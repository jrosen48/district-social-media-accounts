August 1 at 9:12 AM ·

Attention Odell, Saunemin, and St. Paul families,

As I’m sure you’ve all seen, IESA recently overturned their decision to cancel fall sports. So, with that being said, softball is back on (for now)! Softball is open to all girls in 5th-8th grade. I encourage you to share the Odell Ramgal’s Softball page with any families you think may be interested. I will post any important information on there for the time being. We intend to get a practice schedule together as soon as possible, but please be patient with us, as this was just as surprising to us as I’m sure it was all of you. For now, you need to make sure you get those sports physicals taken care of!

We will have open field practices, attendance not mandatory, on Wednesday (8/5), Thursday (8/6), and Friday (8/7) from 4:00-5:30 at the Odell Softball Field. We hope to see many of you out there! ~Coach Wunsch",0.0,"Odell Ramgal’s Softball

Again, with clear communication with Henry County Public Health, this increase was contained to one business in Henry County.

The NLHS Student Council and National Honor Society are starting this year off with a very cool opportunity to get a large tiger paw painted on your driveway or a series of them on your sidewalk.

See this pic as an example of size (for the driveway paw). We tested both colors so you can see the contrast on the concrete and size of the stencil. The sidewalk stencil is nearly the same width, but only 12"" tall. Thanks to our cheerleaders and Student Council members for modeling!

Be sure to check out all the info and get your orders in before Sept. 4! #NLTigerPride

**Note: if paying on PaySchools, you still need to submit a paper order form!

Attention New London Junior and Senior Students and Parents/Guardians:

At this time, we regret to inform you that the 2020 New London Junior-Senior Prom has been canceled. During this entire process we have explored many different avenues that would allow us to host prom for our students in an environment that was fun, memorable, and safe. As we continued to explore various options and asked for guidance it became apparent that it was almost impossible to follow social distancing guidelines in all prom activities.

This was a difficult decision and one that we did not come to lightly. Our hope was that by waiting, seeking out guidance, and finding alternatives that we could in the end have prom for our students. In the end, the safety of our students and staff is our number one priority.

If you have any questions, please contact Superintendent Chad Wahls at 319-367-0512 or chad.wahls@nlcsd.org.

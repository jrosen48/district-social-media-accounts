We are a non profit organization so any monetary donations would go to providing meals and supplies.

If you are interested in donating food for a meal we do have volunteers that are willing to cook.

Campus Update from Dr. Daryl Burckel, McNeese President (9.3.2020)

We are working diligently to put together information and guidance for students, faculty and staff about a variety of topics including changes to the academic calendar, financial aid and scholarships, timesheets and payroll, the status of buildings, a plan for students and employees to enter buildings and retrieve belongings and refunds.

Our Hurricane Laura Response Team meets daily, often multiple times in smaller groups. Many employees in other areas, such as Human Resources, Enrollment Management, Business Affairs and Student Services, have been working remotely to pull together information that will hopefully answer many of your questions.

We will be working through the weekend to compile this information and plan to have a more comprehensive guidance and direction ready to disseminate to students, faculty and staff on Monday.

JDEC is monitoring both Marco and Hurricane Laura at this time. It looks like we will feel the impacts from both of these in our service area. Please be prepared for these storms. Power outages can be expected, so please take every precaution necessary, especially those who rely on life support. JDEC has already started emergency preparations and is on standby for what is to come.
Once storms hit, it could cause electric lines to be torn down. Please do not attempt to touch or move downed lines, this can be deadly. High winds and storm conditions can cause widespread outages in which a timeframe for restoration can be difficult to determine. JDEC employees will do our best to answer all phone lines and any questions you may have. Remember, our Facebook messenger is not monitored. Please call our office.

But this time Michael Cassidy, Jennings Tractor and Equipment(Corey Cormier and Ellen Daigle Cormier), and Guillotte Brothers (Frank and Steve Guillotte) will be providing the meal. It’s awesome that these 3 sponsors have stepped up to the plate to provide a plate of food for our health care members! They are providing meals for the Jennings American Legion Hospital, Jennings Police Department, Jeff Davis Parish Sheriff’s Office, JenningsFire Department and anyone that works in a related field.

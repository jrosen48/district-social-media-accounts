We’ve had several people ask if their children are helping move as well. As much as we appreciate your help, it is probably best if younger students (K-3) are not helping move things. So we are asking, if at all possible, that you make other arrangements for them during this time as we will not be able to provide supervision for them. We want them to be safe and also, there is only so much room on the sidewalks where heavy items are being transported. Older students (4-8) may help if they would like and have your permission.

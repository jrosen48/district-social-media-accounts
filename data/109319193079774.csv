Our final rates feature an interest rate of 3.00% for maturities March 1, 2021, through March 1, 2024, with reoffered yields ranging from 1.70% to 1.90%. The bonds maturing March 1, 2025, through March 1, 2039, carry a 5.00% interest rate with reoffered yields from the March 1, 2024 call date ranging from 2.00% to 2.35%. This plan produces a reoffering premium of $480,925.50, which produces $60,495 greater revenue than what was projected at the May 30, 2019 board meeting. The average interest rate of 4.898% is unchanged; however, the highest reoffered yield of 2.35% is well below the limit of 2.60%.

Some bond issue roofing projects are already underway at the Elementary School. This is one of four buildings roofing projects that we plan to complete this summer. The bond projects will be completed in phases due to specific need completion times and logistics of the school year.
We are excited to get these projects underway.

“Our school district has implemented a new Tutoring Program called TAP which will allow every student in our district to have the opportunity to stay for tutoring after school with transportation provided,” Saunders wrote in her application. “I would use the $100.00 to purchase STEM activities for the students to use during tutoring. STEM activities will allow the students the opportunity to work together as a team to explore, research, experiment, and use communication skills together to work to solve the task given. STEM allows the ability for all students, at-risk and high flyers, to use what they already know along with the new knowledge learned to successfully complete each task as they follow steps to complete the project.”

Hey all Camanche fans!

We’re excited to kick off our home activities tonight with the JV football game, as we host the Mustangs of Mt. Vernon.

As of this morning, we are REQUIRING FACE MASKS/FACE COVERINGS at all home activities at the Middle School and High School. This includes outdoor activities as well. Pleas help us by following these protocols so our students can continue to participate in events and so we won’t have to limit spectators!

We also ask that you sit with your family, including children younger than 9th grade, and adhere to social distancing guidelines. Please don’t congregate by restrooms, concessions stands, or ticket booths.

For Football games, you may bring lawn chairs and spread out down the fence line. For Volleyball games we will have both sides of the bleachers available in order to social distance better.

Kick off is 6pm tonight, see you there!",0.0,"Meg Schebler‎Camanche Activity Department

Senior Spotlight – Markee Low

I would have been involved in track this spring

What is something from your time at CHS that you will always remember?
I will always remember practices with my best friends and amazing coaches. I will also remember the exciting feeling of meets and watching my times drop throughout the season.

What advice would you give to underclassmen?
The advice I would give to underclassmen is to practice and perform at every meet like it is your last because you don’t know when it could be. Also to cherish the times that you have with your friends and coaches before it is too late.

What does it mean to be a Camanche Indian?
To me being a Camanche Indian is to be surrounded by people that are constantly supporting you. I cannot thank my friends and parents enough for pushing me to be the best I can be. Also I would like to thank Coach Ford for always being there for me and helping me to achieve all of my goals.",0.0,"Camanche Activity Department

Senior Spotlight - Dasana Moore

I would have been involved in track and field this year!

What are your plans after high school?
My plans after high school are going to CCC in the fall to pursue a nursing degree.

What is something from your time at CHS that you will always remember?
I will always remember the time when Senora admitted she liked having me as a student hahaha love you Sratty.

What advice would you give to underclassmen?
The advice I would give is “Be the change everyone is always talking about. You don’t have to have a loud voice to be a leader, start right where you are and make change happen :).”

What does it mean to be a Camanche Indian?
To me being a camanche Indian is having pride from where I come from. It’s having grit and strength on the nights your pulling an all nighter to get homework done. Being an Indian is forming not only life long friends, but having a family you can always lean on🤍.",0.0,"Camanche Activity Department

While at Black Hawk college we will participate in the Manufacturing Day Event. At this event, multiple employers and educational institutions will demonstrate manufacturing technologies and processes to increase awareness of the possible career opportunities within the manufacturing industry. Students will have the opportunity to experience the technologies, hands-on, through interactive stations.

After our morning at Black Hawk we will travel to Augustana College for a campus tour and an admissions presentation!

The Virtual Academy of Allegan County (VAAC) is being designed in a collaborative effort among local, participating school districts to provide a 100% online educational option for students and families. It is important to note that this is vastly different from both a traditional in-person school experience and the spring 2020 emergency remote instruction. The VAAC provides online curriculum, interactive instruction and activities. There will be assessments and students will earn grades and credits as part of staying connected to their local district. If you are interested in potentially enrolling your child in VAAC please respond to this survey.

Forms will be sent home with 5-8th grade students. Additional forms will be available at the office or on our website.

Finally, many of you may have heard of the unfortunate accident that took place at Pomerelle earlier this month when a young man died from injuries sustained after colliding with a tree. Helmets are strongly recommended for participants, and can be rented at the Pomerelle Ski shop for $15. Quantity is limited at the shop, so you may want to consider purchasing your own as well.

Gym will be cleared after the JH game and a new ticket will be required for entry. HS tickets must be purchased by the player prior to the end of the school day. JH tickets may be purchased during the school day or at the game. Each player is entitled to buy 4 tickets for their game.

Both events will be livestreamed here on the HN page.

Volleyball players may also purchase their tickets for Saturday's games. These tickets need to be purchased by the end of the school day Friday. JH hosts Riverside at 9:30 am and HS hosts Delphos Jefferson at 11 am. Gym will be cleared between games and a ticket would be needed for each game.

We are in the process of setting up online ticketing through Hometown Ticketing. We hope to have this up and running by next week's games. All tickets will then be available for purchase online!

We appreciate your patience as we work through these difficult times.",2020-08-26 23:31:31,,

On Tuesday night, at 8:20 pm (20:20 military time), Hardin Northern honored their graduating seniors by lighting up the stadium and placing 2020 on the scoreboard in several different ways. The lights and scoreboard went dark 20 minutes later. Please click on the links below. The first is a compilation of video that was taken of the event and the second is a link to still photographs.

The graduating seniors' names have also been scrolling and will continue to scroll on the video board for the remainder of the school year.

A special thanks to Mr. Brian Reeves and Mr. Josh Grappy for providing the drone video and for Josh creating the senior recognition video.

Another special thanks to Mrs. Jennie Good for taking all of the wonderful still shots of the event. Jennie has also given everyone permission to use her photos for their own usage, including printing any and all images.

Please enjoy this tribute and thank you to the Hardin Northern Graduating Class of 2020.

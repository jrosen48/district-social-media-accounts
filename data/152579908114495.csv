Wow, where to begin with last night’s exciting Coaches vs Cancer games... 🎗🏀
Both OE and New Lothrop girls and boys teams played their hearts out!
60 Seconds of Change was fun to watch and amazing to hear the results. I can’t recall the exact amounts but New Lothrop raised over $1500 and OE raised over $1600 for Coaches vs Cancer...in just 60 seconds!!!
Also amazing, 45 people visited Courtney and her crew at the Be The Match table and registered themselves to be added to the bone marrow donor registry. 45 people! Thank you!! 🧡
The orange in the stands is always inspiring and overwhelming. And wow, our student section really knows how to show love for their fellow student.

This is a GREAT visual as to why you should wash your hands, using soap, for at least 20 seconds rubbing vigorously.

If everyone would wash their hands we would see a huge decrease in illness. Seriously, just wash your hands! Cover your mouth when you cough, and not with your hands! ￼Coughing into your elbow is a great idea however have you ever seen little kids coughing into the elbow? 🙄🤦🏼‍♀️ I always encourage the kids at school to pull the neck of their shirt up over their mouth and ￼cough into their shirt.￼

Most importantly, stay home if you’re sick.",4.0,"Kelli Petersen

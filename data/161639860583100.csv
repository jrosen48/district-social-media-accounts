Sappy post warning: This morning I did something so fun! The senior showcase is amazing. This is a silver lining in this funky time. As a Kindergarten teacher I get the pleasure of teaching little people. Most of the time when they leave me I see them a couple of times at Rollins Place. Most of them are frozen in time in my mind as ""My Kinder-babies"". That is until I see one in the news paper, in a play, pulling a wagon in our parade, or playing sports. Unfortunately, I usually do not see many of them ever again.
If you are a teacher, do your ❤ some good and check it out. These are some of ""My Kinder-babies"" that are graduating. Also, something strange (miraculous) happened yesterday. I happened upon a couple of class-made books and work done by these kiddos that was saved all these years🥰

Today in P.E., our Mustangs talked about cost associated with buying things. Students selected items to build a Mardi Gras ""float"".

To purchase the item, students would “pay” the associated cost with specific exercises. They learned that things that are rare in our environment, or have a higher demand, cost more.

Students were very creative and enjoyed designing their floats. Way to go, Mustangs!

What a sweet ending to our week! This afternoon, both our boys and girls were treated to visits from special guests.

Our girls gathered, in their unicorn shirts and accessories, to hear the story of The Nuff. This special book was written by Zachary resident, the late Veronica Waldrop, as a way to encourage her young daughters and girls everywhere. Dear friends of Veronica’s shared a few words about her life and then read the story to our little Wranglers. Thanks to a generous donation from a community member, every girl at RPE received a copy of the picture book.

Our boys were treated to a visit from Zach Von Rosenburg, a Zachary native, punter for the LSU National Championship team, and former MLB player for the Pittsburgh Pirates. He spoke with our boys about setting goals and working hard to make their dreams happen!

Check out how it works:
Income - Students get paid every other week for performing their classroom jobs and for showing positive behavior around school.

Rent & Taxes - Students must pay for their desks and seats every week and can get taxed for negative behavior around school.

Market Days - Every Friday, students can visit Messina Marketplace and spend their money on a variety of different things. They vary from candy ($50) to lunch with Ms. Thomas and Mrs. Noel ($1,000)!

ZES was buzzing with excitement this morning as students lined up to cast their vote for the Louisiana Young Readers' Choice book of the year. State volunteers brought in real voting machines for students to use to make their selection!

Students have been listening to the nominated books in Library classes for the past few months and couldn't wait to see which book would win the school vote. The results are in!

ZES 1st Place - Malala: Activist for Girls' Education by Raphaele Frier

ZES 2nd Place - Grace Hopper: Queen of Computer Code by Laurie Wallmark

ZES 3rd Place - Crown: Ode to the Fresh Cut by Derrick Barnes

The state winner for Louisiana Young Readers' Choice will be announced later this spring. We are excited to see if our choice will match the state winner! 😍📚

Today in P.E., our Mustangs talked about cost associated with buying things. Students selected items to build a Mardi Gras ""float"".

To purchase the item, students would ‚Äúpay‚Äù the associated cost with specific exercises. They learned that things that are rare in our environment, or have a higher demand, cost more.

Students were very creative and enjoyed designing their floats. Way to go, Mustangs!

Today in P.E., our Mustangs talked about cost associated with buying things. Students selected items to build a Mardi Gras ""float"".

To purchase the item, students would ‚Äúpay‚Äù the associated cost with specific exercises. They learned that things that are rare in our environment, or have a higher demand, cost more.

Students were very creative and enjoyed designing their floats. Way to go, Mustangs!

Several of the Zachary High School elite Calculus students competed in the LOUISIANA COLLEGIATE DESIGN COMPETITION hosted by LSU on Feb 14-15th.

The team ALT F4 had the following members (left to right): Nicholas Foreman, Sully Copas, Alex Mounts, Spencer Malone, and Logan Ladnier.

At the design competition, high school and college student design teams were tasked with building a Rube Goldberg Machine to pop a balloon using limited supplies and only given 8 hours.
The ZHS team was one of the few high school teams whose machine ranked high among the other teams including college Engineering teams.

What a sweet ending to our week! This afternoon, both our boys and girls were treated to visits from special guests.

Our girls gathered, in their unicorn shirts and accessories, to hear the story of The Nuff. This special book was written by Zachary resident, the late Veronica Waldrop, as a way to encourage her young daughters and girls everywhere. Dear friends of Veronica‚Äôs shared a few words about her life and then read the story to our little Wranglers. Thanks to a generous donation from a community member, every girl at RPE received a copy of the picture book.

Our boys were treated to a visit from Zach Von Rosenburg, a Zachary native, punter for the LSU National Championship team, and former MLB player for the Pittsburgh Pirates. He spoke with our boys about setting goals and working hard to make their dreams happen!

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be the principal, a coach, or a librarian at ZES? Three of our students who were the highest bidders on these items in the silent auction at Fall Fest got to find out!

ZES welcomed Tayelon Beard as Principal for the Day, Maggie Lampton as Coach for the Day, and Ila Best as Librarian for the Day. The students had fun shadowing in these positions and got a sneak peek of what it's like to do morning announcements as principal, lead P.E. classes as a coach, check-out books in the library, and so much more. Great job, and thank you to Tayelon, Maggie, and Ila for your leadership!",0.0,"Zachary Elementary School

These students from Mrs. Messina's class were able to cash in ""money"" earned in Messina Marketplace to eat lunch with Ms. Thomas & Mrs. Noel today!

Check out how it works:
Income - Students get paid every other week for performing their classroom jobs and for showing positive behavior around school.

Rent & Taxes - Students must pay for their desks and seats every week and can get taxed for negative behavior around school.

Market Days - Every Friday, students can visit Messina Marketplace and spend their money on a variety of different things. They vary from candy ($50) to lunch with Ms. Thomas and Mrs. Noel ($1,000)!

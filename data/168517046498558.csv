E is for Elements of Art!
The Elements are often compared to letters of the alphabet. They must be combined intentionally to create meaning, just like letters are combined to create words.

Elements:line, shape, color, value, form, texture, and space.

Today we are going to focus on LINE.

Activity: go on a scavenger hunt around your home or yard and search for lines. Describe them in multiple ways to develop vocabulary. Photograph them for fun or draw examples of them! Save your sketches or photos and get ready for one more step to follow!",0.0,"Sycamore Elementary Art

I hope you’ve all been following along and thank you for sharing back some pictures of your Art! Please know that I am thinking of you and miss you! I am working with Hopkin’s Elementary Art teacher Mrs. DeZeeuw to create these posts for you to enjoy!

D is for dot!

A dot is the first mark! It’s a beginning, a place to start! Dots come in different sizes and the marks can be made with any Art material! Think: finger prints, bingo markers, pencils, and paint!

How can you make dots, and what can you do with them? Make your own tools to create with dots!

Where can dots take you?

C is for Collage!

Collage is the process of arranging found pieces, papers or images to create a work of Art.
🔍Here are some ideas for finding materials for your collage: magazines, drawings/paintings,scrapbook paper, recycling.
✂️After you gather materials, think about ways to explore them...cut out any obvious shapes, search for interesting patterns and textures to include, consider how the colors will relate.
🧧Arrange and rearrange the pieces to create a composition. This may be recognizable as an image: maybe an animal or a landscape. This could also be abstract: a collection of shapes, color, and pattern that relate in a special way.
🖋Secure the pieces to a background paper with glue. Allow to dry. You may consider taking the project further by adding crayon or paint.",0.0,"Sycamore Elementary Art

Save Some Recycling: It’s An Art Thing

Dear Parents, How’s it going? Remember to take a break sometimes and just laugh together and be creative if you can! It’s so good for us!

You know that recycling you’ve been meaning to haul out? It may just come in handy for some Art materials coming up so please reserve a few things for the kids to be creative with! Here are some ideas:

⁃ the ever popular Celebrity these days: TP tubes! and all things similar
⁃ Bottle caps, all sizes & colors
⁃ Even dried out markers that can be made into great liquid water colors
⁃ Cardboard, corrugated and thin
⁃ Bubble wrap
⁃ Paper, magazines, colored ads/flyers
⁃ Things with cool texture and colors

As your kids make the projects, please share pics in the comments below the post! We would love to see their work! And if you make art together as a family, please share also? It’s inspiring when families have creative fun together!",0.0,"Sycamore Elementary Art

Members of the HME Ahrens-Fox family were blessed this week with the great privilege of escorting students and faculty of Hopkins Public Schools in a delivery of hope for the holidays to the patients of the Helen DeVos Children's Hospital. This annual charity drive is organized by Jason and Allison Babiak as a means of paying forward and honoring a similar kismet act of kindness granted to their son in 2014. Dawson Babiak, a cancer survivor and former patient of HDCH, was gifted a package of window markers while receiving treatment. This simple display of compassion provided him with a jumpstart towards recovery. Five years later, through the generosity of the families and students of the Hopkins Public School District, a single package of markers has grown to an entire bus loaded with toys.

Today Graettinger-Terril experienced what many schools have had to deal with in the past, a bomb threat. The threat was made leaving a written message in a restroom. This was reported to the office and this is what triggered the district to contact law enforcement. It was at the advice of law enforcement to evacuate the building.

The students responded to the directions given by staff and were able to safely make it to one of the nearby churches. Thank you to both students and staff for remaining calm and following directions during this evacuation.

Thank you to local and state law enforcement for their professional advice and response to this situation. All the law enforcement officials were extremely professional in conducting the search of the building.

This event is geared towards middle school to college-aged students. Being a speaker would require you to create a talk, memorize it, and present that talk in front of an audience of around 100 people. If you have an idea worth spreading, the link to the speaker application is included in this post. Applications are due February 10th.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns feel free to email us at 24emquan@student.okobojischools.org or 21cahins@student.okobojischools.org”

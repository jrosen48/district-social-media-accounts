83,0.0,,4.0,,3143853965840048,"Dear Eagles Nest Academy Families:

This evening, our governor, Gretchen Whitmer ordered the closure of all preK-12 schools throughout the state beginning Monday, March 16, until Monday, April 6, 2020. Eagle’s Nest Academy has decided it would be in the best interest of our families to also cancel school tomorrow, Friday, March 13, 2020.

We know that this closure is going to cause a hardship for some of our families. We will be working very closely with our state and local officials to determine next steps on how best to serve our scholars while following Governor Whitmer’s order. Again, Eagle’s Nest Academy will be closed beginning tomorrow, Friday, March 13, through Monday, April 6. We will continue to communicate with families as more information becomes available.

This evening, our governor, Gretchen Whitmer ordered the closure of all preK-12 schools throughout the state beginning Monday, March 16, until Monday, April 6, 2020. Eagle’s Nest Academy has decided it would be in the best interest of our families to also cancel school tomorrow, Friday, March 13, 2020.

We know that this closure is going to cause a hardship for some of our families. We will be working very closely with our state and local officials to determine next steps on how best to serve our scholars while following Governor Whitmer’s order. Again, Eagle’s Nest Academy will be closed beginning tomorrow, Friday, March 13, through Monday, April 6. We will continue to communicate with families as more information becomes available.

Born in Alabama in 1891, Zora Neale Hurston became a fixture of New York City's Harlem Renaissance, thanks to novels like Their Eyes Were Watching God and shorter works like ""Sweat."" She was also an outstanding folklorist and anthropologist who recorded cultural history, as illustrated by her Mules and Men. Hurston died in poverty in 1960, before a revival of interest led to posthumous recognition of her accomplishments.

Hurston moved to New York City's Harlem neighborhood in the 1920s. She became a fixture in the area's thriving art scene, with her apartment reportedly becoming a popular spot for social gatherings. Hurston befriended the likes of Langston Hughes and Countee Cullen, among several others, with whom she launched a short-lived literary magazine, Fire!!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2767431650148950&id=1741470776078381,,0.0,"At ENA we celebrate African American contributions all year.

>>>>>>> master

Alain Leroy Locke (September 13, 1885 – June 9, 1954) was an American writer, philosopher, educator, and patron of the arts.

Distinguished as the first African-American Rhodes Scholar in 1907, Locke was the philosophical architect —the acknowledged ""Dean""— of the Harlem Renaissance. As a result, popular listings of influential African Americans have repeatedly included him.

On March 19, 1968, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. proclaimed: ""We're going to let our children know that the only philosophers that lived were not Plato and Aristotle, but W. E. B. Du Bois and Alain Locke came through the universe.""

Today we were able to have age appropriate assembles about school safety and weapons with our scholars in grades 2-6. We are asking that parents have conversations with scholars in K and 1 over the weekend. We will continue to have assemblies about school safety and the idea that it is “ok to say”, specifically it’s ok to come and share information with the adults about things that could be harmful.

On Monday each scholar will be gifted a clear book bag. Please do not send your child with a book bag or purse. Scholars will be required to utilize the provided book bag. We are also asking that you check your child's things and coats before they leave home.

Thank you for your continued partnership. It is our pleasure to serve you.

I write to inform you that this morning, January 10, 2019, the administration team of ENA was informed of a weapon on campus. It was immediately confiscated and authorities were contacted. At that time the school building was placed on lock down until released shortly after 11:15 am.

As with all matters of student safety, we have taken this very serious and have acted accordingly, utilizing both school system disciplinary resources and working along side Flint Police. We invite you to be our guest tomorrow morning, Friday, January 11, 2019 at 9:00 am for “Coffee with the Principal” of which you will have an opportunity to ask any questions, you choose, at that time.

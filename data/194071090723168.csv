If you have driven down Oregon Street today you might have seen some artwork going up in front of the police department. Hiawatha High School’s talented art teacher Matt Leahy and graduating senior Madelyn Gruber are here painting some artwork that Madelyn designed for our department. This was for a high school community service project that was scheduled to be completed last fall. The project had to be postponed last fall and it was again postponed in the spring due to the ongoing COVID issues. This project could have just been forgotten about and left undone but these two are here today on their own time following through with what they started. The east side of the mural has remembrances to Todd M. Widman who lost his life while serving our community. Some say the best way to find yourself is in service to others. Through their artwork and his leadership they are being of service to our community. We wish to say thank you to them! Our community and schools are lucky to have such talented and dedicated teachers like Mr. Leahy.",0.0,"Hiawatha Police Department

We've had a lot of questions lately, and we are happy to let you know now, that the Summer Lunch Program is a go for June & July!
That being said, things are going to work a little differently this year. As much as we wish we could provide a hot, sit down meal, it just isn't possible this year. We want to be sure that the SLP is as safe as possible for those eating and those volunteering. To this end, for 2020 we will be distributing grab-n-go meals.
These meals will be distributed behind the Sheriff’s Department (south side of the building). We are still working out a few of the details, and will share them with you as soon as we have those all ironed out. Volunteer sign ups will also be available soon.
Thank you all who have inquired - we can't wait to serve you June 2nd!",5.0,"The Hiawatha ACES
May 12 at 5:25 PM ·

We've had a lot of questions lately, and we are happy to let you know now, that the Summer Lunch Program is a go for June & July!
That being said, things are going to work a little differently this year. As much as we wish we could provide a hot, sit down meal, it just isn't possible this year. We want to be sure that the SLP is as safe as possible for those eating and those volunteering. To this end, for 2020 we will be distributing grab-n-go meals.
These meals will be distributed behind the Sheriff’s Department (south side of the building). We are still working out a few of the details, and will share them with you as soon as we have those all ironed out. Volunteer sign ups will also be available soon.

🥳 Announcing our 2020 Foundation for Rural Service Youth Tour Winners: Avery Wischropp of Horton & Christian Shaffer of Hiawatha! 🎉

Unfortunately, the trip was cancelled this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Rainbow awarded the students with a $1,000 scholarship to use toward their future education endeavors.

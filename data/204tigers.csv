It is a daunting task to say the least and I truly appreciate everyone's efforts.

We developed a survey that will help us tremendously to get a feel of how our parents feel towards several different topics concerning our transition to in person learning.

Parents please expect a call from your 2019-2020 teacher. They will be asking several questions that will help us in creating our plan. We have already did a lot of leg work in covering specifics. But we need your help to ensure this plan reflects our community.

Please feel free to be open and upfront with the survey. That is what we desire. There will for sure be changes logistically in the way we ""do school"".

Hope to see you all soon!

This order does allow limited in-person Summer School activities to begin immediately. However, #204 does not currently have any Summer School activities going. Therefore, it does not apply to us.

This Executive Order has nothing to do with the upcoming 2020-2021 school year. It also has nothing to do with our athletics. I anticipate the IHSA's reccomendations for summer contact with students to soon be distributed, after being approved by the IDPH. The IHSA does not govern #204's athletics, however we would likely follow suit to what they are recommending, if we feel it is reasonable.

As for what to expect in the fall. All I can say is that this is definitely a step in the direction we, as a school district, feel is best for our kids. We are not there yet, but we are closer.

The #204 Cross Country Team is officially joining the 100 Mile Pledge. We will be logging all our runners miles for the month. We have 25 runners this year. Our challenge to you is you make a monetary donation for each runner that completes the 100 miles. Therefore if all 25 make it and you pledge $5 per runner that would come to a total of $125. If you pledge $1 per runner and all 25 make their goal that would be a $25 pledge.

If you would like to donate a flat amount or a per runner amount to the Cross Country Team's efforts please contact us anytime. Our goal for the month is $2040.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2396784047064662&id=160352767374479,"Kerry Marie Walker Drake is with Eric Drake.

Hey, South Summit High School Class of 2014, it's your president speaking. I need your help with something, and seeing as I haven't asked you for anything in 6 years -- do me a solid on this one.

I'm compiling a list of us who are frontline healthcare workers (doctors, nurses, EMS/T, Police, Fireman, ETC). If that is you, or someone you know, please shoot me a message with their names and where they currently work. I think I'm friends with a lot of you, but I made this post public so you can share it to help track everyone down.

This is Peter Cottontail. Peter Cottontail has chosen to stay at home and not go hopping down the bunny trail this year so he doesn't contribute to the spread of COVID-19 in his bunny rabbit community. Peter Cottontail is smart, safe and responsible. Be like Peter Cottontail.

STAY HOME, Summit County. We are receiving multiple reports from other counties that some of our residents are leaving the county for Easter Weekend vacations. This contributes to the spread of COVID-19 statewide and will set back the hard work we've all done to fight the spread and flatten the curve.

We are aware that many food items including WIC foods and formula are in short supply at local grocery stores, but we are seeing major improvements recently. Our corporate partners have assured us that manufacturers and wholesalers have adequate supply that they are shipping to stores as quickly as possible. If you need help finding an item, speak with a store manager. We have been made aware that while some stores may be out of certain items, other nearby stores could have the items in stock. You may need to shop around if you are in urgent need of a certain item. The image below explains allowable food substitutions until store stock returns to normal.

Governor Herbert has asked schools to become prepared to deliver curriculum in alternative formats if a school dismissal/closure happens because of COVID-19. Because of the rapid progression of this virus we are going to use Monday, March 16th as a professional development day for teachers to prepare to deliver online or alternative education if required. I have been asked to listen to a press release today at 4:00 p.m. and will provide additional information to you if provided. We apologize for this late notice, but want to be prepared in case of an emergency school closure and believe using Monday is a proactive measure.

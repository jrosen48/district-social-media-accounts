1. Don't be afraid to form study groups, it is much easier to get through tough courses when you have peer help.
2. Get out and meet people! Networking in college can be extremely useful to you post-graduation.
3. Take advantage of open spots in your schedule and use it to study. Don't fall behind and end up cramming the entire day before a big test!
4. Remember that your happiness is up to you. Surround yourself with people that make you feel good and try new things!

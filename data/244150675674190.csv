This week will mark the last scheduled academic cycle for the Class of 2020. Congratulations!

After this Thursday, teachers will be recording grades based upon the work seniors have done during the remote learning school, April 6th thru May 21st. This grade will count as 20% of your overall grade, and will be combined with the grade you earned in school through March 13th, which will count as 80% of your grade. This combined grade will be used to determine if the students has passed the course for the school year.

Students whose combined grade does not meet South Shore's standard of a 65 to pass a course will be required to continue working after the class is complete in order to meet the standard expected by the school district. Students will need to passes all their courses in order to earn a diploma.

Thank you and enjoy your week!

We wanted to remind everyone that our Remote Learning School begins week 2 at 10:00 am tomorrow morning. Freshmen and Juniors will be in academics while sophomores and seniors will move to shop and related. You will find copies of this week's schedule and an agenda page to help students stay on track with deadlines in your school email.

As always students should fill out the attendance survey to start their day. On Monday, you will hear a personal message from Mr. Aubrey.

Finally, The Department of Education has allowed and our own School Committee has voted to not have April Vacation this year. We have chosen to do this to keep momentum going for our Remote Learning School. Therefore, B cycle academic, shop and related classes will run Tuesday through Friday next week. This change will move the last day of school to Friday, June 12th. We will share a new school calendar with you later in the week.

As always stay safe, stay mentally engaged and be physically active.

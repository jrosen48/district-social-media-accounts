Shout out to Bucks Produce!! Buck wanted to make sure every elementary student in the county had a pumpkin this Halloween so not only did he donate them but also delivered them to the schools. East Crawford students will receive theirs after fall break. Thanks to Mrs Wright, Mrs. Etienne and Mrs. Stroud for allowing him to do it. The kids on my bus say “THANKS BUCK!!” In case you’re wondering, that’s over 700 pumpkins!",2.0,"Rocky Gray

As we all know, spring break is upon us and Cedar Rapids and the surrounding school districts have closed schools temporarily in an attempt to control the spread of COVID 19 as well. We believe this is the right decision, but also understand that it may present challenges to families in the communities we serve. We'd like to help.

Finding Kind is a film that tells the story of girl-against-girl bullying and its effects on one’s life as they transition into adulthood. It depicts how bullying is evolving and discusses how we can start changing this pattern; the aim is to put an end to the hate and find kind.

Parents and children, 10 years and older, are encouraged to attend this documentary screening, followed by a panel discussion. Though the film is focused on girl-against-girl bullying, the message transcends gender and all participants can benefit from the discussion.",2020-02-17 17:30:17,,

Efficient scoring and great ball movement have been the keys to their early season wins.

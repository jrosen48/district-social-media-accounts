Madeline Hudnall, one of Nebraska's two Honorees for the Prudential Spirit of Community Awards, has been supporting the Columbus community for years.

From raising over $72,000 for childhood cancer research to providing bedding for 33 children in need, she's done it all.

According to Madeline, volunteering doesn't just help one person, it spreads across the community! “What I’ve realized through volunteer work is how much of a ripple effect comes from volunteering. This ripple can be witnessed by watching people feel loved, supported, inspired and connected.” – http://bit.ly/2S9UgpJ ❤️ #ilovepublicschools",0.0,"Nebraska Loves Public Schools

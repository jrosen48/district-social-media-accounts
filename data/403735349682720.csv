1. You can buy a cub tiger for around $2,000.

Happy Tuesday, everyone!

Just a reminder to all of the students out there. Governor Reynolds has closed school buildings. She has not closed down school.

Learning needs to look different right now, but the opportunities are still there. Make your teachers happy!

The weather is beautiful, but the guidelines for getting through this pandemic remain the same.

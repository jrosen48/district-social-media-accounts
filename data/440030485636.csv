August 25 at 1:02 PM ·

Why do we have Black Breastfeeding Week?

Here’s why:

Black Breastfeeding Week was created because of the long-standing racial disparities seen in breastfeeding rates. CDC data shows that 75% of white women versus 58.9% of black women have ever breastfed.

The BBW website states, “The fact that racial disparity in initiation and even bigger one for duration has lingered for so long is reason enough to take 7 days to focus on the issue.”

Outdoor play:
1. Offers children an opportunity to be more creative.
2. Lets children do what they are interested in: run, learn sports, climb, talk and look at bugs.
3. Provides children with hands-on learning through being able to manipulate natural materials like dirt, leaves, rocks and bugs.
4. Provides a physical outlet for pent up energy. Physical exercise can reduce stress levels and put children in a calm state so they are more receptive to teacher led indoor lessons.
5. Provides children with time to practice critical social skills such as negotiating who is on a team, making up rules for a game, taking turns on the slide and talking with friends about life (“Who’s coming to your birthday party?” “How mean is your sister?”).
6. Improves children’s mental health by giving them a chance to rejuvenate, relax and return to class with renewed interest.

Go out and play!",4.0,"It's Camping Week at Help Me Grow-Allegan. Did you know there are many important reasons why children should GO OUT & PLAY!

Outdoor play:
1. Offers children an opportunity to be more creative.
2. Lets children do what they are interested in: run, learn sports, climb, talk and look at bugs.
3. Provides children with hands-on learning through being able to manipulate natural materials like dirt, leaves, rocks and bugs.
4. Provides a physical outlet for pent up energy. Physical exercise can reduce stress levels and put children in a calm state so they are more receptive to teacher led indoor lessons.
5. Provides children with time to practice critical social skills such as negotiating who is on a team, making up rules for a game, taking turns on the slide and talking with friends about life (“Who’s coming to your birthday party?” “How mean is your sister?”).

Meet our amazing new family coach, Nicole Nylaan! She has begun providing playgroups in your area.

Hello! My name is Nicole Nylaan and I am the family coach for Hopkins!! This is my first year being the family coach. But I grew up in the Hopkins area and graduated from Hopkins. Now, my husband and I have the pleasure of raising our 3 kids in Hopkins. I have a 10, 4 and 18 month old. Oh and a 5 month old Pomsky puppy. When I'm not busy running after them, I am the Zooming Kids instructor at Dorr Township Library. I also work at the Hopkin's District Library - mostly as a craft and story time leader when elementary kids come over for their small town field trip a couple of times a year. In my free time, I love to read, craft and garden. My family and I enjoy traveling - Disney World is our favorite. I look forward to seeing you soon at one of my playgroups in Hopkins!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10163240074005637&id=440030485636,,0.0,"Hopkin's Families,

I grew up in Plainwell and have spent most of my life here. I now have the pleasure of raising my young children in this wonderful community. In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my family! We love to camp, kayak, hike, and go to the beach.

As your family coach, I am committed to providing your family with a loving and developmentally sound foundation for a lifetime of learning. I believe that play is an extremely important component of a child’s success, and I will strive to create and maintain an environment where your child can grow and thrive, while exploring the world around them. My goal for our community is that ALL children (ages birth to five) enter kindergarten as successful learners at Plainwell Community School!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10163165139225637&id=440030485636,,0.0,"Meet our New Plainwell Family Coach!

My name is Kelli Stuifbergen and I have had the privilege of working for Plainwell Community Schools since 2012. After spending seven years at Plainwell Corners Preschool, I am beyond excited to expand my role as your Great Start Family Coach and Early Childhood Coordinator.

I grew up in Plainwell and have spent most of my life here. I now have the pleasure of raising my young children in this wonderful community. In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my family! We love to camp, kayak, hike, and go to the beach.

As your family coach, I am committed to providing your family with a loving and developmentally sound foundation for a lifetime of learning. I believe that play is an extremely important component of a child’s success, and I will strive to create and maintain an environment where your child can grow and thrive, while exploring the world around them. My goal for our community is that ALL children (ages birth to five) enter kindergarten as successful learners at Plainwell Community School!",2020-02-18 12:54:10,,

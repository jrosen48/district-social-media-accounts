Brinkley Family, we are excited for our students to return to school on Monday!!! Students and families make our school community the caring place that it is. However, in order for us to have a successful school year we need your help with the following things:

• Keeping your child at home if he or she has a fever of 100.4 and/or are sick or experiencing cough, chills, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing or loss of taste or smell
• Notifying the school if your child has been exposed to someone with COVID-19
• Making sure your child wears a face mask to school daily
• Modeling for them how to stand 6ft apart
• Demonstrating how to wash and sanitize hands
• Calling before coming to the school
• Not escorting students inside the building

Thank you for replying to our school reentry survey. We are compiling responses from our various stakeholder groups, and the committee is actively working to develop a reentry plan. Once the plan is complete, it will be sent to the board of directors for final approval. The goal is to have the plan published in mid-July and posted to the district website. Additionally, the key components that directly impact you will be published in the newspaper and all social media platforms. We will schedule an onsite meeting date and time for specific grade levels to come to the school and complete registration and pick up a hard copy of the School Reentry Plan. Any questions you have can be addressed on your scheduled onsite day. Social distance guidelines will be posted on the campus. Masks will be required.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1580103602146898&id=509057879251481,,0.0,"Brinkley Parents and Guardians,

Last month I applied for this opportunity to promote Arkansas rice by becoming a 2020 Rice Rep. I was selected to participate in this program that could lead to a college scholarship. This is a new program that is similar to the Miss Monroe County Rice program.

I will be posting photos, videos, and other useful information that promotes the rice industry. The following pictures include a brief summary and guidelines for this program.

Governor Hutchinson has closed schools through April 17. When the Department of Education provides us with further information, I will release the next steps.

The most important thing is to make sure you and your child(ren), stay healthy.

Please make sure to have your child complete the AMI packets. After spring break, I will post a date for them to be returned to the school. The packets must be completed for your child to receive grades and attendance credit.

As always, the Brinkley School District administrators and staff stand ready to assist you.

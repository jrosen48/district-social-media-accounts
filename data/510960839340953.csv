FCCLA: Please sign up by Monday, March 23rd if you are participating in the cupcake wars. If we only have one group, we will not do it.

Thank you Student Council members for overseeing the blood drive. Thank you to the donors for you generous donations. Our drive collected a much needed 32 units! That donation can potentially help up to 96 people. Thank you all for supporting this public service through our school.

Any Seniors wanting to go to Springfield on the Lincoln trip please see Mr. Bridges

We are currently doing 2 big fundraisers right now with another one in the works. There is money to be made but to do this we need more volunteers!! If you would like to help raise money for our athletes, please contact the following people:

To help with the Queen of Hearts Fundraiser (which is a big time commitment for those who have been doing it!), please contact Kelisha VanSyoc Amos, Shari Kuhlman or Chris Kulhman.

To help sell raffle tickets for our Cougar Quilt, please contact Melissa Hilmes, Brittany Garrett or Donna Hall.

There is another fundraiser that we will hopefully be able to begin soon. For information about that, please contact Brandon Swartzlander.

We will need to provide distance learning through electronic means, packets or a combination of both. We are meeting as a staff tomorrow via Zoom to discuss the best ways to deliver instruction while remaining reasonable for staff, students and families. Decisions will be shared with you when the processes are in place and our plans will begin the week of April 13.

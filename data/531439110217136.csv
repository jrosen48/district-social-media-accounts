The kids are looking forward to performing for you that night! They will be performing again in the sanctuary of Cornerstone Church located at 2000 N. Cole St. on Friday, May 10th at 6:30 PM, please have them arrive by 6 pm so they have enough time to use the restroom and meet up with their class! For this concert we are asking that all students wear dark colored pants or skirts with bright colored polos or shirts...girls are also welcome to wear spring dresses. Tickets are now on sale for this event in both of our school office locations. Tickets are still just $3 in advance or $5 at the door, students who are not in the performance are $2. As a reminder, ticket sales help to offset costs for all field trips and other fun parties throughout the year! We appreciate your support ‚ù§Ô∏è",2019-04-29 12:14:00,,

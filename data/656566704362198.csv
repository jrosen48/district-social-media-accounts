As a result, I came out to the school to get all the VEX IQ robots and parts, and clean out the kids’ travel crates, so I can take everything home to breakdown and organize while I watch Netflix.

After emptying the crates, I have a few awards to give out:

-Most minimalist crate -Only the robot. Marie Kondo would be proud =*Team Broggle*

- Most organized crate - everything sorted into internal bins and held together with rubber bands (my heart was happy) =*The Slingers*

Winning the prestigious Design Award at State, this team qualified for the enormous VEX Worlds championship in Louisville, Kentucky!

Due to COVID-19, the Worlds Championship was cancelled, and we did not get to travel. After all of the fundraising and work, this was very disappointing.

On Saturday, April 25, VEX ran a virtual Worlds tournament. For this fantasy robotics tournament, VEX used past match results of all 2020 Worlds qualifiers to generate simulated results.

Our Mohawk team did great! In their division of 110 teams, our team finished 25th! They would have made it into division finals before being eliminated!

Of the 620 teams who qualified for VEX IQ Robotics Worlds, our team finished in position 72! That is fantastic!

VEX IQ State is THIS SATURDAY, and we are still planning on going. All of our teams have qualified.

This is THE ONLY opportunity to qualify for VEX IQ Worlds, and is a very important event.

However, due to potential difficulty in getting the buses out of Marcola, parents may need to transport their own children to the State event, or arrange carpooling with other parents.

We will make arrangements for your children to get into the robotics lab to retrieve their robots, parts, and engineering notebooks, which they will need to take to the tournament.

I'm sorry about the inconvenience. I will let you know if things change regarding transportation.

Enclosed is a photo from Robot Events, showing the address and schedule for the tournament. I hope to see all competitors there!

Please email Ms. Klein for questions, or to let her know if your child will not be attending the State event.

- Any messages or correspondence will most likely not be answered until July.

- If instructions for the fall arrive from the Commissioner, Superintendent Clarke will reach out to all.

- Grab-and-Go lunch continues through June 29 on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays (a huge thank you to the kitchen and staff members helping while school is technically closed!!)

- Our website is in a transition process and currently has many blank pages and moving pieces. We will announce when it's finished, but please forgive the untidiness in the meantime.

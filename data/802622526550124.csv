We are ready to see our freshmen tomorrow and Wednesday! Here’s a quick reminder of what’s needed tomorrow:
-Students will need a mask
-Students will need to bring with them their completed items from the enrollment packets
-Parents will not be permitted to attend the soft opening but will need to remain on campus.

If you haven’t had an opportunity to pick up your packet, today is the day to do so. Please stop by West Campus until 2PM.

Today is Census Day. Muhlenberg County is well above the average response rate, and that is encouraging, but complete your census -- online, by phone or by mail. It has never been easier to complete your census; it is your patriotic duty and it is required by law.

If you do not want a home visit from a census worker in the coming weeks, then get it done now. All personal data provided is protected by law, and cannot be shared with other government agencies. Census workers take a lifetime oath of secrecy, under pain of law.

There are no excuses for not completing your census. Census data is how our Congressional representation is determined, along with how federal funding is distributed across the country.

The future of our roads, infrastructure, public programs, and education system is at stake. Help Muhlenberg County receive its fair share -- complete your census today.",10.0,"Leader-News

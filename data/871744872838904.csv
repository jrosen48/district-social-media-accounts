The stats so far on the Wyoming Public Schools 3D printed equipment for healthcare workers:

To date 400 face shields, 900 ear savers.

They have gone to:
🔹Ascesion Borgess ER
🔹An RN heading to NYC to help
🔹RN's heading to Detroit to help
🔹West Michigan Sign Language Interpreters (to aid in seeing facial expressions during hospital interpreting)
🔹Thornapple Township Fire/EMS
🔹Penock Hospital
🔹Borgess Hospital
🔹Wyoming Police Dept
🔹Wyoming Fire Dept
🔹Thornapple Mannor
🔹Alpena Medics
🔹Trauma program manager for Mid-Michigan Alpena
🔹Portland Police Dept

Just picked up a batch of donated transparencies. We have requests already for 150 more shields. So this will cover us through those and some more, but we are still collecting them if you have them so we can keep up with demand.

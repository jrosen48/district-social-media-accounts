Natalie Miller of Lakeside MS won third place, with Jihyun Won of Portola HS and Louise Macatula and Riya Gupta from Sierra Vista MS honored as finalists! IUSD sent 11 history projects to the final competition, which took place virtually earlier this month.

Each year, approximately 600,000 students across the nation, in grades four through 12, take part in National History Day events. Students, working as individuals or teams, produce original websites, papers, documentaries, performances and exhibits, which are showcased at the local, county, state and national levels. These young historians conduct extensive research on a historical topic related to the annual theme. This year’s theme was “Breaking Barriers in History.”

For this last month in Speak Up We Care’s theme of kindness, we are emphasizing the importance of praise, when to praise and how to praise. Our elementary students at Cadence Park walked over to Portola High School to exemplify when and how to praise & spread kindness to the students & staff! They gave positive praises to those who seemed like they needed encouragement by giving out high fives and lots of smiles. 😊 These simple acts of kindness no doubt brought more confidence & self-esteem to the people the students praised.

On Tuesday, March 6, world language students from Monument Mountain competed against students from high schools throughout Berkshire County as a part of the Berkshire Organization of Language Teachers (BOLT) Language Recitation Competition. The competition is similar to Poetry Out Loud, except that the poems that students recite are written and recited in another language.

In French, Sammy Rusk and Robin Lamb won the competition in their respective categories. Sarah Harding, Toby Van Schaick, and Marlena Benson also received awards for their recitations.

In Spanish, Aidan Santos and Wilson Sprague came in first place in their categories. In addition, Charlie Medeiros was recognized for his performance.

Congratulations to our winners and to everyone who participated!",2018-03-08 15:16:26,,

This means daily sanitizing surfaces and objects that are touched often, such as desks, counter tops, doorknobs, computer keyboards, hands-on learning items, faucet handles, phones, and toys. We also disinfect specific areas of the school, like bathrooms.

Most studies have shown that the flu virus can live and potentially infect a person for only two to 8 hours after being left on a surface.

Parents, students and staff members are encouraged to follow basic prevention guidelines against the flu and upper respiratory viruses, which include avoiding contact with people who are sick and washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and using alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.

We have wall-mounted and freestanding hand sanitizers throughout the buildings. Campus custodial staff will continue to disinfect campuses with hospital-grade products.

We will continue to monitor, respond and plan accordingly as guided by local, state and national health officials. For more information: https://buff.ly/2TxenOc",2020-03-02 15:30:14,,

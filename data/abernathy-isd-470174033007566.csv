Today we are kicking off our Ready...Set...Read! summer reading challenge. Beginning today and extending through Friday, July 31, you can begin logging books that you read at home that will win you a free t-shirt and could win you a Chromebook! To participate, collect a summer reading challenge flyer either from the elementary office or by printing the flyer attached below. Log the 12 books that you read over the summer. Return it by mail or in person to the elementary office by Friday, July 31 for a chance to be entered into our Chromebook drawing. One entry per student, please. This is open to all AISD students PreK - 12th grade. Teachers are encouraged to participate, as well!

We find this more critically important now than ever before with all we have seen over the last few months with remote learning.

Great news Senior parents!! Each graduate will now be allowed 8 guests for the graduation ceremony. They will be split into 2 groups of 4 but will be in close proximity of each other in the stands.

If any of your graduation guests will need seating for a wheelchair, please email me @ echambers@abernathyisd.com ASAP. This will allow us time to help accommodate this seating request and hopefully keep your guests together.

Be expecting another message from me later this week with explicit instructions on parking, arrival, and departure procedures for the upcoming ceremony.

Coach Houston and Mrs. Knight have set up 8 clues around the AISD campuses that will get your heart pumping in some good old family fitness fun! You can participate any day this week should you choose! All we ask is that you avoid other families you may see out there at same time in order to honor social distancing guidelines. The first clue, as you will see, is at the bike rack in front of the elementary school. Since this is where we also serve lunches, we ask that you avoid beginning the family fun during the hours of 11:00-1:00. We hope that this allows your family to get out and work out together in what is supposed to be a beautiful week! HAVE FUN!

""Abernathy ISD graduation will be held Friday, June 5, 2020 at 8:00 pm at the Antelope Football Stadium.

On May 5, 2020, Governor Abbott and the Texas Education Agency announced that Texas school districts would be allowed to hold outdoor in-person ceremonies on or after June 1 with specific guidelines.

Some rural districts meet requirements to hold ceremonies between May 15 and May 31, but Abernathy ISD does not qualify.

AISD will communicate details in the coming days, but we would like to go ahead and inform families that graduates will be limited to five guests.

Abernathy FFA is very proud to report we had 34 students pass their D.9.1 American Welding Society Certification Test.

It has to be 1/4 inch wide and 1/4 high with the correct deposit. If their off my 1/16 inch, or if there is any undercut, pile up, or no penetration they fail.

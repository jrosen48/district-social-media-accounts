IMPORTANT INFORMATION ON THE UPCOMING ACT:

Students and Parents/Guardians:

Unfortunately, a decision has been made to cancel the July 18 ACT out of an abundance of caution for the safety of your students and your families. The majority of test takers registered were from out of state and your students' safety is our top priority.

With the backlog of test-takers looking for a test site, it is in your best interest to consider BOTH the ACT and the SAT and start looking at available dates and sites.

AH is scheduled to hold the August, September and October SAT and the September ACT.

The roster for the July ACT was made up of mostly out of state students coming from NY, NJ, CT and even FL, so you need to stay ahead of the large number of students requesting a small number of seats.",2.0,"Abington Heights School Counselors

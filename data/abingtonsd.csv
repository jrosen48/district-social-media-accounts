Yesterday, March 31st, was supposed to be #TeamJuwanStrong day at both the High School and the Junior High School, in honor of senior, Juwan Adams, who is currently battling Hodgkins Lymphoma. Juwan is in need of a bone marrow transplant in order to sustain his life. All of the faculty was asked to show their support of Juwan’s fight by wearing their Custom Ink shirt or yellow for pediatric cancer. Being that we could not all be in school together, we still wanted to find a way to show our unity. Members of the faculty from ASHS, AJHS, and Overlook joined together in creating this video to support Juwan. Together, Juwan’s Abington family created this beautiful video showing their support of this remarkable young man. #teamjuwanstrong #ghoststrong #ASDproud 👻💛

All week on Abington School District’s social media channels, we will showcase the local organizations that will benefit from the Abington Senior High School students’ fundraising efforts, including The Breathing Room Foundation, Living Beyond Breast Cancer, Unite For HER, and the Asplundh Cancer Pavilion at Abington - Jefferson Health. You can support the cause by purchasing a T-shirt from the Abington Senior High School main office for $10, which includes admission to the game against Pennsbury. #ASDServiceLearning #ASDAthletics #ASDProud #breastcancerawarenessmonth",2019-10-14 18:08:43,,

- Get your child a mask. Inexpensive ones are available at Target, Walmart, Old Navy, and many local Facebook markets have individuals selling homemade ones with fun designs.

- Start slow: Have your kiddo wear the mask for 30-45 mins/day, then increase the time to 1-3 hours/day, and so on.

- When they start fidgeting with their masks or getting distracted by them, point it out and help redirect the behavior.

- Encourage sanitary practices. Encourage good health habits. Encourage independence too!

The only exception would be Fridays due to our shortened schedule: If all APS schools are on a two hour weather delay on a Friday, then ASE is closed.

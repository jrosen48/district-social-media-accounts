We are in the library of Graham High School
this afternoon doling out flu shots to the interested staff.
At one point, I began to hear this lovely background music (Think of the Isreal Kamakawiwo'ole version of Somewhere Over The Rainbow.) playing softly. I thought, ""How fabulous that the students are able to listen to music in here,"" thinking that it was, perhaps, part of a class. I felt like I was enjoying an afternoon in a quaint cafe.
At one point, I was just looking around the room as we do, and I discovered the source of this melodic sound. There sat a young man strumming this relaxing tune on his ukelele. I couldn't help but go over and let him know that I was really enjoying his playing. He's so talented, in fact, that he was able to play, without missing a beat, even while conversing with me. No doubt, one of many hidden gems found throughout our student population. It was, indeed, our lucky day to be able to enjoy this young man's talents all too briefly this afternoon.",4.0,"Compliment of GHS from Total Care Pharmacy - Thank You!!

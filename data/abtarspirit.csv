Anchor Bay Families,

On Wednesday evening, August 19th the Board of Education voted to begin the 2020 school year in a virtual setting for all students and to re-evaluate on October 2nd. Please know this is a postponement to the traditional, face-to-face option previously offered. The Board will continue to review and determine when it is appropriate to transition back to In-person instruction.

Our top priority remains the health and safety of our students and staff. The goal is to return to In-person instruction as it is the optimal learning environment for our students. Please watch for an email from the Technology Department that will be sent today providing information and next steps for parents.
Your continued patience and understanding is much appreciated as we navigate these uncertain times.

Anchor Bay Families,

The Board of Education met yesterday evening (8/5) to review and determine the Fall start-up options. During the Public Comment portion of the meeting, some parents asked the Board to consider starting the school year fully remote for all students. The Board determined to meet again to consider this model. Please know that the registration for the Anchor Bay Virtual Academy has been postponed at this time. The Board will meet again early next week to review plans and make a final determination.

A lot of work has been accomplished since our last update on July 30th. Sub-committees of teachers, support staff, and administrators are continuing to work in the areas of safety, instruction and operations. Thank you to everyone who has written and shared your questions and concerns. We are responding to those emails and reviewing your input.

I will communicate the final plan once it is approved by the Board of Education.

Sincerely,

Leonard Woodside, Ed.S.

Here are the results of our club kids:
• 6th place– teammates Connor Christensen and Noah Varitck, with volunteer boater Mike Varitek, had a 5 fish bag for 19.24 pounds (only 1.5 pounds away from 1st place!)
• 19th place – teammates Deveon Furtah and Nath Toureau, with volunteer boater Jed Toureau, had a 5 fish bag 16.43 pounds.
• 45th place – Aidan Pihaylic and Joey Elliott, with volunteer boater Shawn Elliott, had a 5 fish bag for 12.27 pounds.

Over 90 boats competed in the one-day event in two different divisions. The weather was hot with a high of 84 degrees and a 7-11 mph wind from the SE. This is an extremely competitive high school series that holds events on different lakes though the state, testing the angler’s skillsets. Great job to all the ABSD anglers that competed!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3138245232921931&id=1547549905324813,,0.0,"Sunday, June 21, 2020, Father’s Day, Anchor Bay had several local teams Michigan BASS Nation High School Team Trail event #3 held at the Harrison Twp., MI Selfridge DNR Boat Launch - Lake St. Clair (U.S. Waters Only).

Aidan Pihaylic and Joey Elliott put together a 1st place finish on Sunday, June 28, 2020 to win the 2020 Michigan Bass Federation Junior State Championship!

The event was held on Pontiac Lake in Waterford Township, Michigan. The summer time fishing was extremely difficult due to the air temperature weas 84 degrees, hot, with little wind, 4-5 mph out of the North West, water temperatures well above the 70-degree mark. Joey and Aidan weighed in 5 largemouth bass, all alive for a sack of 9.95 pounds, with their large bass weighting in at 2.55 pounds. They caught over 20 fish on the day, most short, with only the 5 keepers.

The winners’ topics that will be brought to life were:
1. Thankful Baskets for community members such as teachers, police, fire department.
2. Winter Boot Drive for children in the community who could use a pair of warm boots during the cold months.
3. School Garden to improve the outside space plus educate students about plants.

Additionally, no-sew blankets for those in need for members of our community will be made & distributed and a “feelings group” will be started.

We’re VERY proud of all the ways 5th grade Lighthouse writers showed they can be the “I” in K*ND to pay it forward in our community!!!

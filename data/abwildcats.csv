First of all, thank you for your support over the past few days. While we didn‚Äôt achieve our end goal the steps taken by the Legislature are in the right direction for the future of public school funding.

At this time, we feel it‚Äôs best to return to the classroom to finish up the school year on a positive note. Therefore we WILL be in school tomorrow, Thursday, April 12. Normal start time and end time!

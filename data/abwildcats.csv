Next Thursday, May 14th, is student items pickup day. This is the ONLY day scheduled, so please make arrangements for someone to pick up your child’s locker items and end-of-year packet.

Directions are as follows:
Go through the elementary car line, give names of all students, and wait for delivery of the bagged items to your car. This is to minimize exposure for all parties involved.

Times are as follows:
Students whose last names begin with A-L will pick up 10am-noon, and students whose last names begin with M-Z will pick up noon-2pm.

Families with multiple students with differing last names need only choose one timeframe; ALL students’ items/packets will be delivered together.

Again, these are the ONLY times we will do this. We must abide by CDC and SDEOK guidelines and reduce time on campus.

Finally, you will be notified when yearbooks are available if you ordered one.

First of all, thank you for your support over the past few days. While we didn’t achieve our end goal the steps taken by the Legislature are in the right direction for the future of public school funding.

At this time, we feel it’s best to return to the classroom to finish up the school year on a positive note. Therefore we WILL be in school tomorrow, Thursday, April 12. Normal start time and end time!

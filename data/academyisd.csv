Parents,
We are continuing to monitor the weather, but at this time our plan is to continue with a normal school day. According to some weather forecasts, the temperature is supposed to climb above freezing around the time that school is out at 3:30. We will stay in contact with local officials about the road & bridge conditions. Our buses will avoid all bridges that we can possibly avoid and will drive at a much slower speed. In addition, we may even decide to hold the buses for a few minutes (maybe 4:00) before we send them on the route.

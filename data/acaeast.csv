Two of our Middle School Students: 8th grade Tamera Owens & 8th grade Rameer Askew brought “Poetry and Paint” to East Academy. Artist Tamera painted a picture while Poet Rameer created the poetry.

Kindergarten students in Ms Poole’s classroom became “Entrepreneurs “ in their Almond Milk & Butter business . They were able to explain their process of creation (and had great selling points too 😊)

The Collinwood Library visited and shared some exciting reading fun for our parents and students!

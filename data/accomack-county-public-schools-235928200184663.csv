Have you heard about Child Check? Child Check is a free developmental screening provided by Accomack County Schools for young children, birth to school age, whose parents are residents of Accomack County.

Children are screened by a team of professionals which includes a school psychologist, early childhood special education teacher, speech and language pathologist, and school nurse. Spanish and Creole interpreters are available.

If you have a young child who seems to be meeting developmental milestones at a slow rate, you may want to bring them to Child Check. This free screening can assure you that your child is developing normally or it can ensure that a child in need of special services receives them as soon as possible. Child Check will be held on Thursday, November 14th at Kegotank Elementary School at 3:30 p.m. To make an appointment for your child, call the Special Education Office at 824-3360 http://edne.tw/n596450",,,0.0,"Accomack County Public Schools Child Check Developmental Screening -

The first day of school is Tuesday, September 8, 2020. There are two opportunities for returning students to complete registration for 2020-21. New students do not have to come unless they receive a phone call to do so.

Thursday, August 27 11:00 am – 12:30 pm

Wednesday, September 2 1:00 – 3:00 pm

Paperwork that is needed has been reduced so this should go quickly and will be done from your car. Please pull up to the ACEA entrance door and someone will come to your car with the paperwork to complete. If you did paperwork at last week’s food drive, you do not need to come. If neither of these times work for you, please contact the office 631-5202 x 215.

Next week there will be additional communication for transportation, on-line learning schedules, and information on safety protocols/procedures for face-to-face instructions.

Thank you!

*Volunteer Information*

A wonderful team of volunteers from Meridian Public Schools and the United Way of Midland County have created two volunteer registration booths in Sanford, one at the intersection of Center St. and Oak, and one at the pharmacy across from Sanford Food and Pride. If you are planning on heading to the Sanford area to volunteer, you will be directed to one of these booths, and dispatched to a part of the community that needs help.

If you live in the Sanford area and need to request help, call (989)495-2284, and they will do their best to dispatch volunteers to assist you. If you have a neighbor that needs help, you are able to call in on their behalf as well!

Good morning ACEA staff and students! It's Manatee Appreciation Day folks, but I'm surprised people aren't appreciating manatees on the regular. I thought that was kinda just a thing we did??

On this day in the year 708, Constantine began his reign as Pope (not the MOST recent I guess, but that's my brother's name, so I had to do it).

It's so boring right now. I can feel the cabin fever creeping in. But maybe that's just the COVID-19?

Things are getting pretty serious now, guys. Just stay inside and stay safe. I know times are tough, but make sure you utilize the resources available to us.

Good morning ACEA staff and students! It's National Bavarian Crepes Day. So that's cool, I guess.

On this day in 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in Eisenstadt v. Baird, that unmarried people have the same right to contraception as married people.

Nothing too interesting for you folks today. Come get curbside pickup at Michaels though!

Now, a quote for you guys, ""Never hurry and never worry!"" by Charlotte, from ""Charlotte's Web"". We're taking this all one day at a time. I'm pretty bummed out my senior year has been so interrupted, but I'm dealing with it day by day. We're going to get back to normal and have an amazing prom! Take care guys!

P.S. A quote by Mark Cosby, CEO of Michaels, ""Until further notice, Michaels Team Members at the corporate office have the option to work from home."" You can't make this stuff up.

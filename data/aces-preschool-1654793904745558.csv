This week in Centers, we're answering questions with the words ""YES"" and ""NO."" Many children with language delays have trouble with these words and may do things such as restate an item instead of saying ""Yes"" (e.g., ""Do you want juice?"" ""Juice!"") or ignoring/pushing away something rather than saying ""no.""

You can help your child use these words verbally by pairing them with a hand sign when you say them. In addition to nodding your head for ""yes,"" make a fist and ""nod"" it as well. In addition to shaking your head for ""no,"" use the first two fingers of your right hand to tap your thumb.

If you ask your child a yes/no question and they reply with anything other than yes/no, you should also model the expected response when you repeat their answer.
E.g. --Do you want Juice?
-- Juice!
-- Yes, you want juice!",0.0,"Go follow Miss Jasmine‚Äôs Facebook page to see what our students are doing in speech centers & much more!

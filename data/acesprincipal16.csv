In addition to waiving MCAS requirements for this academic year, I firmly believe that we must suspend the high-stakes nature of the test for the next six years at minimum.

We will continue to do different workouts for you and your families ~ the important thing is to have fun 👏🏻

We love our Athol-Royalston School Cafeteria workers. THANK YOU SO MUCH! ...........NOTE: The photos in this collage are a combination of generic photos from school cafeteria workers across the country. Included in these photos are SOME of our own ARRSD cafeteria staff whose photos I was able to locate in my own photo collection. I regret that I did not have a photo of every cafeteria worker in the district, and I hope that these photos serve as a representative sample of ALL of the wonderful cafeteria staff we have working in our Athol and Royalston schools.

Athol/Royalston families. I encourage you all to take these meals Mon-Friday. Every child under 19yrs in our town is eligible to have these meal. If you have little one at home you can take meals for them as well as your school age children to age 18 yrs. The schedule for pick up is running like a 2 hour delay for elementary. So if your elementary bus usually stops at 7:45, then it will be 9:45. High school and middle school routes will not be running but those meals will be available on the elementary route, so check times to see when we will be in your area.

PLEASE READ BELOW******

""Attention Parents/Guardians, VERY IMPORTANT!!!! last week I sent a paper home regarding 2018-2019 Columbus City School busing with the students who live in the Columbus City School District. Hopefully you all are doing this on your own. I will not have a way of knowing if you did. I have offered times to help get you set up. A+ Children's Academy will no longer be sending in paperwork for you it is all done online now by you the parent/guardian. If you do not get it done this school year there will be a 6-8 week wait starting in August of 2018.

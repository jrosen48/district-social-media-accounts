Lyrics:
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby.

Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to
Dream really do come true.

Someday, I'll wish upon a star and
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then oh why can't I?

If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why oh why can't I?",0.0,"George Mason Elementary School

Where trouble melts like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me.

Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then oh why can't I?

If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why oh why can't I?",2020-03-22 19:15:43,https://video-dfw5-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/90400383_576108726330086_4772721930245505024_n.mp4?_nc_cat=102&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=NrK53MiMxTsAX_M1QfB&_nc_ht=video-dfw5-2.xx&oh=0ed2016813e6e94b8c7e6b202bc6e836&oe=5F652519,

For my teacher friends:

I am not complaining about masks...trust me if they mean I can go back to teaching my classroom with my kids then I will wear it! But this made me laugh so hard but is so true! I don‚Äôt own this but wanted to share

So in thinking about the possibility of having to wear masks next school year, a couple of us came up with some mask scenarios while handing out school stuff bags... and then I added to it. Enjoy!

(Insert Name) please don‚Äôt snap (insert name)‚Äôs mask in their face.

(Insert Name) you should not be using your mask as a sling shot. Please put it on your face.

(Insert Name) your mask should be on your face not on the back of your head

(Insert Name) no you can not blow your nose in your mask.

(Insert Name)why is your mask soaking wet? You just came back from the bathroom? And you put it back on your face after you dropped it?

(Insert Name)I‚Äôm sorry you broke the elastic on your mask by seeing how far the band would stretch but now you will have to hold the mask on your face or use this duct tape.

(Insert Name)please take the mask off your eyes and watch where you are walking. I don‚Äôt care if you can see through it.

(Insert Name)please take the mask off of your pencil and stop twirling it.

(Insert Name)I know the mask fits over your pants like a knee pad but please take it off of your leg and put it on your face.

(Insert Name)what do you mean you tried to eat your lunch through your mask?

(Insert Name)please do not share your mask or trade masks. I don‚Äôt care if you like their mask better.

(Insert Name) I‚Äôm sorry but your mask is not school appropriate.

(Insert Name)we are not comparing our masks to other kids masks‚Ä¶ everyone‚Äôs mask is unique and special.

(Insert Name)no you can not decorate your mask instead of doing your work. I don‚Äôt care if you have a Sharpie.

(Insert Name)you are not a pirate, please take your mask off your eye.

(Insert Name) try to get the gum off as much as you can.

(Insert Name)please do not use your mask to pick your nose. No you can‚Äôt use (insert name)‚Äùs mask to pick your nose either.

(Insert Name)I‚Äôm sorry you tripped but that‚Äôs what happens when you put your feet inside the elastic of your mask.

(Insert Name) no your mask does not make it hard to get your work done.

(Insert Name) your Mom will need to get you a new mask since you chewed a hole in that one.

(Insert Name) you will need to go down to the nurse to see if she can get your mask out of your braces.

(Insert Name)why is there a shoe print on your mask?

(Insert Name)no you cannot eat the snow through your mask.

(Insert Name)I don‚Äôt care if you were in art class and being creative, we do not decorate our masks.

(Insert Name)we do not beam other kids in the face with a ball. No, their mask doesn‚Äôt make it not hurt.

(Insert Name)please do not plug your nose holes with your mask.

(Entire Class) who is making that noise?

(Insert Name)I‚Äôm sorry your ponytail is stuck, that‚Äôs what happens when you see how many times you can wrap it around your mask.

(Insert Name of parent)I‚Äôm sorry to tell you but your child thought their mask made them a superhero and so they tried to fly off of the jungle gym at recess‚Ä¶

(Insert Name) I‚Äôm sorry your breath stinks in your mask, maybe we should all try to brush better.

(Insert Name)please take those things out of your mask. No, you are not a chipmunk.

The plan to transfer passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, who had tested positive for COVID-19 (Coronavirus), to the Center for Domestic Preparedness in Anniston, has been cancelled.

The events of this weekend transpired very quickly; however, thanks to the rapid response of a unified Calhoun County, our municipal and state leaders were able to stop this transfer of patients from occurring.

Yet, many of you may still have concerns and may be confused as to the situation as it currently stands. Therefore, we wanted to take this time to: (1) Dispel the rumors, (2) walk you through the timeline of events, and (3) explain what we plan to do moving forward.

Today‚Äôs public school student is in need of the best education that we can provide for them, especially as we witness the massive changes in our world‚Äôs workforce, but more importantly in our state. Alabama‚Äôs economy is changing and growing and our students need to be prepared to take on the jobs in a workforce that is beginning to emerge as businesses are finding their way to Alabama to set up their corporate work plants.
Our students will need more than a high school education and that is why we are committed to Empowering, Supporting and Inspiring all students. Our staff works hard to provide a nurturing environment, as well as a rigorous and challenging curriculum in order to prepare our students for the world after high school.
However, nothing is more important to us than the communication and relationship we have between the parents, community and the school.
It is an honor to serve the Anniston City Schools community as your Superintendent of Schools. We appreciate the Anniston City School System students, staff and community for creating this positive environment, which holds great promise for the future. Our work will continue to strive for academic excellence and fiscal responsibility.

In closing, I thank the entire community for continuing to work on behalf of our children.

Phillip Tutor: Anniston‚Äôs students, family vacations and a Caprice Classic
Dr. D.Ray Hill, Anniston City Schools superintendent.

By Phillip Tutor, Star Columnist, ptutor@annistonstar.com

Aug 8, 2019

Dr. D. Ray Hill says he grew up in a small place about three hours south of Atlanta whose claim to fame is its title as the Peanut Capital of the World.

That‚Äôs not true.

He grew up in the back seat of a brown 1976 Caprice Classic.

Each year, Hill‚Äôs family ‚Äî dad Frank, mom Frankie, Hill and his twin sister Fay ‚Äî piled into that Caprice Classic for another adventure. The world awaited them.

Frank was a truck driver with only an eighth-grade education. Frankie made it through 11th grade. ‚ÄúBut they were smarter than what everybody figured,‚Äù Hill said Thursday morning. ‚ÄúIt was just the times that they grew up in.‚Äù

Frank wanted Ray and Fay to see what he saw ‚Äî a world much grander than their hometown of Sylvester, Ga., a world of splendor and sites and wild differences. Today, D. Ray Hill is the new superintendent of Anniston City Schools, where classes began this week.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to say my parents were poor, but I can tell you that I don‚Äôt think we were rich,‚Äù Hill said, laughing. ‚ÄúBut we did things. My mother and father stretched. We got in the car, we packed sandwiches, we drove to different places, we took vacations out of state. It‚Äôs stuff like that, that‚Äôs how we expose our kids.‚Äù

Fueled by gasoline and homemade sandwiches and truck-stop visits, Frank and Frankie took the twins anywhere roads would go. The options were limitless. And, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never forget (that Caprice Classic) because that was my car in high school,‚Äù Hill said. He laughed, again. ‚ÄúI remember having an eight-track tape player in there because my dad loved music.‚Äù

They drove to nearby places like Florida. But they also traveled to faraway sites Frank saw while driving his rig. And they never flew. Distances didn‚Äôt matter.

They drove to Mexico.

They drove to the Grand Canyon.

They drove to the Hoover Dam.

The drove to the Petrified Forest National Park.

They drove to see the redwood forests in California.

After Ray and Fay left for college, Frank and Frankie took their youngest son, Robby, to Alaska.

That‚Äôs right, they drove from Sylvester, Ga., to Alaska. And back. That‚Äôs roughly 8,000 miles, round trip.

The amount of time the Hill children spent in the back seat of that brown 1976 Caprice Classic is staggering.

‚ÄúI remember they would wake us up and say, ‚ÄòHey, hey, hey, let us show you all this ‚Äî look, look, look,‚Äô‚Äù Hill said. They bought a blanket on one of their trips; Frank and Frankie kept it for decades. Hill, then a child, bought a sombrero while in Mexico; Frank and Frankie didn‚Äôt discard it until a few years ago.

The memories ‚Äî the education of a youngster‚Äôs mind ‚Äî haven‚Äôt faded.

‚ÄúIt showed me there was a lot more out there than I was accustomed to seeing every day,‚Äù Hill said. ‚ÄúThink about it.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs access. If our kids don‚Äôt see anything but the borderlines of Anniston, what do they have?‚Äù

If you want to know anything about the man now piloting Anniston‚Äôs often-criticized schools, this is it.

Yes, he values transparency and openness and civic partnerships and empowering his principals and teachers. He isn‚Äôt a non-traditionalist. He wants more algebra and foreign-language classes. He wants to add a violin program to the elementary schools. He wants to ramp up the system‚Äôs work-training programs for students hungry for paychecks. He wants to revive the high school‚Äôs drama program.

He sees opportunities while acknowledging the roadblocks ‚Äî Anniston‚Äôs poverty, Anniston‚Äôs racial divisions, even the concerns about the system‚Äôs financial stability. If you care for Anniston and its students, pray that the city‚Äôs political headaches don‚Äôt beat him down.

But it‚Äôs experiences and opportunities, lessons that transcend and transform, that he resolutely values. He‚Äôs never far from the back seat of that Caprice Classic. He recalls that his parents ‚Äújust wanted us to be exposed‚Äù to the world, to see what‚Äôs there and what‚Äôs possible.

Years ago, as principal at North Clayton High School in Georgia, he helped arrange a trip for 35 or so students to attend Barack Obama‚Äôs presidential inauguration.

You can imagine him today climbing into an Anniston City Schools bus, filling it with students and taking them on their own adventures, adventures fueled by financial partnerships from a business community reinvested in Anniston‚Äôs schools. An education for life to go along with an education from the classroom.

‚ÄúExposure is my biggest thing for our kids,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI have so many things I want to do.‚Äù

As a school we took some time to stop and reflect on this Patriot Day. Starting at morning announcements we paused to think about and honor those who lost their lives 19 years ago. Many grade levels incorporated 9/11 research and response into their lessons today. Students across the school learned about what it means to be a hero and why we take the time to honor them. We honor those who serve on the front lines, as first responders, and those everyday heroes who step up in times of need. Throughout this somber day it becomes abundantly clear that the children in this building are the future. They have kind hearts and by taking the time to reflect on the past we hope to instill in them a passion for being part of a brighter tomorrow.

Happy Friday! We’ve had a short, but busy week! The students were excited to go back to the Art room and Music room for classes instead of those teachers coming to the classrooms! We are also back to using the playground (one class at a time)! Also, we had exciting news about FREE breakfast and lunch now being offered here at Norris!

We took a Mission Trip to Lake City Elementary to spread mulch on the playground. We then prayed for the students, staff, and families that pass through the school everyday.

We are thankful for such a wonderful school with great leaders, teachers, and staff. #Bethechurch",5.0,"Huge thank you to Clinch River Baptist Church!

Our teachers have worked so hard to make sure we were prepared for our students’ first days of school. They continued their work into PLC time this afternoon, but we did manage to squeeze in a few minutes for them to “de-stress” by making stress balls. They may not be as nice as some of the ones we’ve seen our students make, but we did manage to get in a few laughs!

We’d like to give all of our teachers and staff a huge shoutout for all they’ve done to make the start to this week a success.

Our GOES family would like to give a shoutout to our extended Anderson County Schools TN family at ACCTC. They are working incredibly hard to build screens for every classroom to help keep students and teachers safe. Thank you so much to Phil Pyke, Kelly Myers, Eric Woodard, Russ Gillum, Zach Adkins, Jimmy Davis, David Wood, and all the amazing others working to support #EveryStudentEveryDay. Thank you to Dr. Parrott for leading the charge and putting so much time, money, and energy into making the adjustments needed for this unprecedented time. Thank you to Clay McKamey for helping keep us supplied with PVC to build these barriers. Also, a huge shout out to Faith Promise Church for letting us use their tents for Eagle Day.

This cart is located right outside the front doors of the school. You can take the forms and fill them out and then place them on the next level of the cart. A staff member will pick them up during any business day.

We want to be sure we celebrate and acknowledge the contributions of ALL of our important staff members during this week of appreciation.

Today, we want to give a BIG shout out to our educational assistants, nurse, SRO, custodial staff, food service staff, and our office and administrative staff members for all they do for #EveryStudentEveryDay.

To know these people is to love them! If they have inspired you, taught you something invaluable, or have just been plain awesome, let them know! You can use the comments to type your words of appreciation, share a memory, photo, sign, or video to give them a shout-out. Be creative!

Thank you to these amazing people for all you do! We hope you all feel loved and appreciated today!

We want to be sure we celebrate and acknowledge the contributions of ALL of our important staff members during this week of appreciation.

Today, we want to give a BIG shout out to our educational assistants, nurse, SRO, custodial staff, food service staff, and our office and administrative staff members for all they do for #EveryStudentEveryDay.

To know these people is to love them! If they have inspired you, taught you something invaluable, or have just been plain awesome, let them know! You can use the comments to type your words of appreciation, share a memory, photo, sign, or video to give them a shout-out. Be creative!

Thank you to these amazing people for all you do! We hope you all feel loved and appreciated today!

She is always willing to do whatever it takes to ensure our children are safe and that they feel loved. If she had a home big enough, we are convinced she would take them all home with her! She has 5 boys of her own and is married to her sweetheart, who is a big kid himself! We ❤️ you Mrs. Seiber!

Did you know GOES students say the Pledge of Allegiance and the GOES Pledge every morning?

A few of our #FifthGradeLeaders are here to help remind us what it means to be an Eagle! We are so proud of these students and the role models they have been for students at our school. Fifth grade parents please lookout for information to be on Class Dojo and listen to phone calls as we reach out and work to help celebrate our 2020 5th grade graduates!

Fifth grade you make us proud ❤️

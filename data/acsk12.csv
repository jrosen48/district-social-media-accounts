Good Afternoon! It was a great first day having all the students back. Thank you for respecting only students and staff in the building.

Please remember when you drop off your child if you only have an Algonquin student to use the side parking lot. If you have a Millside and Algonquin student you may use the front loop. This will make drop off more efficient. Thank you.

Senior Muskrats and parents,

We will need seniors to be by the baseball fields at 5pm tomorrow to get lined up and ready to enter the stadium for graduation. Family or friends with tickets will be able to enter the stadium starting at 5pm. You must have a ticket. No tickets will be available tomorrow. Guests will need to sit in the home or visitor bleachers identified by tape. We will be practicing social distancing and ask that everyone bring a mask when social distancing will not be possible. The ceremony will start promptly at 6pm.

Graduation will be live streamed by Big Tilt and there will be a link on the district Facebook page. Student speeches have already been recorded and a link to those speeches will be on the school webpage.

We will provide an update around noon tomorrow in regards to weather and if any changes need to be made, we will let you know.

Thank you and we look forward to finally honoring our class of 2020!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2619433511637857&id=1558145557766663,,0.0,"Message from Mr. Melrose:

Hi, friends. After discussing the situation with our community leaders, it was decided to provide another grocery giveaway for our community on May 9th. Many seniors and families are in significant need for supplemental food. Thanks to the Algonac and Pearl Beach Lions, Harsens Island Cattails, Community First Health Centers, Algonac Rotary, Woodside Bible Church, Zens family and many more silent donators for working together on this.

We now have enough food to help over 150+ families. How cool is that????

We have food pickup at the Algonac Lions Hall starting at 10:30. People will drive up and have the food boxes placed in their trunk. Gloves, masks, limited volunteers and careful social distancing will be carefully utilized.

We have tentatively scheduled 2 more for June 6th and June 20th. We are blessed to live in such an awesome community with such big hearts to help others. IT IS NOT TIME TO SURVIVE, BUT RATHER TIME TO THRIVE.

Please help us share the information with our community.",12.0,"Artie Bryson

We now have enough food to help over 150+ families. How cool is that????

We have food pickup at the Algonac Lions Hall starting at 10:30. People will drive up and have the food boxes placed in their trunk. Gloves, masks, limited volunteers and careful social distancing will be carefully utilized.

We have tentatively scheduled 2 more for June 6th and June 20th. We are blessed to live in such an awesome community with such big hearts to help others. IT IS NOT TIME TO SURVIVE, BUT RATHER TIME TO THRIVE.

Please help us share the information with our community.",2020-05-01 14:15:56,,

Hi, friends. After discussing the situation with our community leaders, it was decided to provide a grocery giveaway for our community on April 18th. By that date, many seniors and families may be in significant need for supplemental food. Algonac Lions, Community First Health Centers, and Woodside Bible Church are working together on this.

We now have enough food to help over 150 families. How cool is that????

It will be held at the Algonac Lions Hall, and people will drive up and have the food boxes placed in their trunk. Gloves, masks, limited volunteers and careful social distancing will be carefully utilized.

Very excited that one of our FLL Jr teams was invited to attend the MISSION MOON World Festival Expo at the FIRST World Championship in Detroit, MI in April!!

Our team was randomly selected to be one of 60 teams out of the more than 20,000 teams that participated in FLL Jr MOON MISSION worldwide this past year. We are very excited for this opportunity, along with the JR High team the RoboRats, to represent the Algonac Robotics Club and Algonac Community Schools to thousands of people from all over the country and the world.

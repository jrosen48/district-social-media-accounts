Altamont District #10 is considering a change to the athletic colors of our teams. Currently, we are Red and White for our junior high school teams and Orange and Black for our high school teams. In previous discussions, we have learned that there are traditions that dictate aspects of our athletics, and we have no desire to make a change that would detract from such history. However, we also see the sense in unifying our public school colors to enhance and deepen our athletics tradition. To achieve this, we are proposing becoming Orange and Black throughout our K-12 public school system. This change would be gradual to make additional costs to the district minimal.

We would like to have your input. Please take a moment to answer the questions below so we can ensure that any change will be for the best. Feel free to contact the high school with any questions via email to Peggy Bueker (pbueker@altamontschools.org).

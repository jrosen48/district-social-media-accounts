We want to recognize the students that are doing great things, whether at school, at home, or in the community! Send me a message with the good things your students are doing, big or small, and I'll choose some to post on the page. If your student gets a shoutout on my page, they can come see me at school for a free candy bar! Let's spread some positivity and recognize those that are doing great things around us. We'll include the virtual kids in this too and figure out how to get them their candy bar.",2.0,"Make sure you nominate Bulldogs throughout the year to be one of Deputy Carl's Unsung Heroes!!!

I’m looking for multiple sources to provide/donate a total of 500 hand made masks. 200 are covered from one source, 100 most likely from another. The group for which I’m asking are mental health providers and/or volunteers in Allen, Auglaize, and Hardin Counties. These are folks supporting others with mental heath and social support needs, such as those working in crisis shelters, homeless shelters, social services crisis workers, etc. Many of these folks serve our Ada students and families. It is becoming more essential than ever to serve those with mental health concerns, the marginalized, and some of the most challenged populations in our counties. Please message us on our FB messenger if you have any you can donate now or can create, acquire fairly quickly, etc. Thank you in advance.",2020-04-06 15:10:42,,

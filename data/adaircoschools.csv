On Tuesday, Sept. 1st, the USDA extended waivers to allow school districts in KY to go back to SFSP (Summer Food Service Program) which will allow ALL children ages 1-18 to receive free meals upon request. This simply means that a child does not have to be enrolled in the Adair County School System in order to receive free meals. Adair County‚Äôs SFSP application was approved on September 4, allowing us to begin this program September 8, 2020. You can pick up meals at Adair County Primary or one of the 7 Bus Stops listed below:

Adair County Primary Center
Knifley Fire Department
Breeding Fire Department
Garden Church/Highway East 80
Jones Chapel Church/Gradyville
Tarter‚Äôs Chapel Church/Portland
Purdy Church/Highway 206
Gaddie Shamrock Lab/HWY 55 S.

Meals may be picked up between 10:00 ‚Äì 11:00 at all bus spots with the exception of the ACPC location, which will be 10:00 ‚Äì 12:00, Monday ‚Äì Thursday.

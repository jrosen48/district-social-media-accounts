You might not be a high school senior, but this was a big year for you. We know how much you were looking forward to your Field Day, your 5th Grade Picnic and trip to Boondocks, getting your yearbook, spending the last few months with your elementary school teachers and classmates, and your big end of the year Continuation.
🌟
We want you to know that no matter what we are always proud of you and all your accomplishments! We will embrace the rest of the school year online and hope that there is an opportunity to get the 5th graders together again!

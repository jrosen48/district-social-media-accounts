Have you ever read on the school bus? Well, now you can! The School Bus Book Bag Project will now give our students the opportunity to read books on the bus to and from school. Each school bus has their own book bag that has been stocked with books for our students to use during their time on the bus. Our goal for this project is to help give our students just one more place that they can pick up a book and continue to foster their love of reading!

Mrs. Wheeler's class helped to deliver the book bags to the bus garage on Thursday!

March 14 marks Pi Day, when the symbol used in mathematics to represent a constant is celebrated around the world. Addison Middle School seventh and eighth grade students joined in the celebration with sweet treats and fun. Board of Education member Jim Mitchell and Food Service Assistant Manager Julie Mitchell served a variety of pies to students. The afternoon included Pi-related activities and concluded with the main event, when two teachers who were voted on by students received a pie to the face. Mrs. Guinnip and Mr. Howard, math teachers who organized the event, also volunteered for pies in the face. Students with top averages in their math class earned the opportunity to do the “pie-ing.”",0.0,"Addison Middle School

Seniors at Addison High School recently got a reality check about life after graduation, thanks to a program presented by Corning Credit Union and coordinated by the GST BOCES Career Development Council. “Mad City Money,” a simulation for high schools students, teaches basic money management in a safe, fun setting.

Participants are paired up for a realistic experience with managing a household budget. They must decide their priorities and rotate through stations to purchase housing, transportation, food, clothing, household necessities, daycare and other needs. The simulation also includes tempting “extras” stations, including a mall featuring televisions and video games and a “Fun Stuff” station where students can purchase vacations and entertainment activities. Some participants encounter the “Fickle Finger of Fate” when they are randomly presented with a life situation that may result in a financial setback. The simulation gives students the opportunity to experience the impact of their financial decisions and learn important lessons about budgeting.",0.0,"Addison High School

At the Addison Middle School, it is a priority to foster positive leadership skills in students. We saw that in action last week when the 7th Grade Peer Leaders organized and facilitated the “Be a Buddy, Not a Bully” assembly, with the assistance of the Elmira Enforcers.

Goalie Blake Scott and Defenseman Ondrej Gabrhelik, along with team mascot Captain K-9 and Director of Community Relations Joe Ruggiero, visited the Middle School to discuss how to be a buddy and to share an opportunity for students to earn tickets to the Enforcers’ February 1 home game. Students who sign the “Be a Buddy, Not a Bully” form pledge to be kind to others, speak up when they see bullying, appreciate differences in others and be a buddy to those in need. Each student who signs the form and turns it in at school will receive one free ticket to the game. Additional tickets for family members can be purchased through the school at a discounted price.

Students who sign up will be recognized at the game and the 7th Grade Peer Leaders will sit on the team bench during warm-ups.",0.0,"Addison Middle School

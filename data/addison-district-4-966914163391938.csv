Did you know that it is a violation of Illinois state law to drive past a school bus that is stopped and picking up or dropping off children? When the stop arm is out and the red lights are flashing, drivers need to stop until the arm is pulled back. Violations can come with penalties up to $500 in fines and suspension of driver’s license up to a year.

The exception to this law is that drivers who are travelling in the opposite direction of a bus on a road that is 4 or more lanes (Lake St., Army Trail Blvd., Addison Rd., Rohlwing Rd.) do not need to stop.

Drivers are also advised not to make U-turns to avoid waiting for a stopped school bus.

The law is designed to keep students safe. Drivers should plan ahead and allow extra time if they will be on the roads at the beginning or end of the school day.",0.0,"Addison Schools

The restarting of school is underway. We are still awaiting some materials needed for protective barriers but in all, things are going very well. We are, however, going to DELAY the opening of school for students until September 8th to give us time to ensure all materials are in place and also observe the results and make adjustments as we watch districts opening up early. This will also give us time to watch the numbers and data for Ross County which has experienced an increase in infections and hospitalizations recently. We want to be sure we are capable of taking every measure to protect our students and staff. Our goal is still to provide in-person learning and quality remote learning.

Below is the link to our 33rd Annual High School Academic Awards Ceremony. I speak for our staff, when I say thanks to all the parents and students for what we have accomplished this nine weeks.
I want to thank our staff for adjusting quickly, with no preparation, to keep up with their curriculum as much as they could while going online and learning new teaching strategies to adapt to the situation.
This nine weeks, we will end up with well over 90% participation online in the end and that is contributed to the resilience our students have shown. I have told the students many times in emails that this is like a marathon. It has been a daunting task, but now we are seeing that finish line. We have kept stepping forward and we are getting through this!

Our seniors last online day is this Thursday, May 21st and everyone else will conclude this school year on Thursday, May 28th.
Final grades for the 4th nine weeks will be calculated and input into Progressbook by Tuesday, June 2nd.

All students in grades 8 thru 11, recently received an email from Mrs. Shea that includes our course catalog and course registration instructions for the 2020-2021 school year. The registration process will be beginning soon, so please review the course catalog and contact Mrs. Shea for any questions.

Our Academic Awards Ceremony will be a virtual event held on Tuesday, May 19th at 9:00 a.m. Any type of award will be given to their recipients at a later date.

Our Senior Night is scheduled for Monday, May 18th at 6:00 p.m. This will be a virtual event that will include a video the seniors are putting together, an announcement of scholarship winners, and some other presentations by seniors. Scholarships will be mailed to their recipients.

We will send out a finalized graduation plan after we get it approved by the health department. I will be meeting with all seniors today to discuss the ceremony.

Have a good day,

Jostens will be at the front entrance of the high school delivering announcements and other graduation products on Friday, May 1st from 9 a.m.- 11 a.m.
This will be a “drive-thru” delivery. The student or parents pull up, roll their passenger window down and they will place the order in the passenger seat. If that doesn’t work, they can place the order in the trunk of the vehicle.

Also, the fourth nine weeks interim reports will show up in ProgressBook on Wednesday.

Keep up the great work, Warriors!

4-24-20

Seniors and their families,

After we postponed graduation yesterday, we received an email from the Ohio Department of Education issuing guidance and a clear message to avoid “congregate” graduation ceremonies, and that schools should not postpone or delay graduation dates in hopes of providing a traditional graduation ceremony. We will use our originally scheduled date of Saturday, May 30th. The time is changed to 4 p.m. We will employ an alternate plan of graduation that we believe still gives our students a meaningful and safe ceremony.

We will provide a description and instructions for the event to each student’s family so they can know what to expect and how to prepare. We will ask that everyone please understand their cooperation will be needed to make this work in a safe and responsible manner. We wanted to get the changes out to you as soon as possible to avoid creating any more hardship for families than has already occurred.

Adena High School Athletic Director",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2435765176528687&id=202483429856884,,0.0,"Due to a scheduling error earlier in the season, the Adena Lady Warriors must forfeit the game with Westfall that was to be played this evening, February 10th. Although Adena listed the game as a scrimmage, I want to apologize to the young ladies who have played valiantly this season as well as their families. Measures will be implemented to make sure this does not happen in the future. Any presale tickets purchased under the Adena name will be reimbursed electronically.

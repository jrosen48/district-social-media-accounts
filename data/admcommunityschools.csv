We need your help! Construction of the new elementary building is underway! We continue to refer to this project as the “new building” but it is time we gave this new building a name.

Through May 1st, ADM parents, students, staff, community members, and alumni are encouraged to complete the following Google Form to suggest a name for the new building!

If you have a moment, watch this video that was created by our elementary principals to help get students excited about suggesting names for the new building.

Ellie Gordon joins ADM as a first grade teacher at Adel Elementary. She graduated from the University of Northern Iowa and is starting her first year of teaching.

Ellie knew she wanted to be at ADM after completing her first student teaching placement at ADM last year and discovering no where else compared to the environment and community that she felt while she was here. She is overjoyed to have the opportunity to join ADM!

Ellie became a teacher because she felt that it was the only career that truly had an impact on all other aspects of the world. She is honored to be a part of her student’s story and to help give them some of the tools that they will use for the rest of their lives.

In her free time, Ellie enjoys spending time with family and friends, going on walks, and reading. Help us give a warm ADM welcome to Ellie Gordon!

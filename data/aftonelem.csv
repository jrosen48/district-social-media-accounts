For all those who have a child who wants to give treats out to their class for their birthday. We have recently been given permission to allow birthday treats under the following parameters:

-Treats must be store bought
-Must be in a sealed box
-Must be individually wrapped

Parents can bring the classroom treats to the front office and office staff can ensure they are taken to the child’s classroom. According to our current health guidance we are not yet able to have parents past the front office, but we look forward to when we can do so. Treat handout will be handled in a sanitary way with clean surfaces and hands.

Amy Ringholz is a contemporary artist and her work can be found in Jackson Hole, Wyoming! She loves to draw and paint animals. Her focus is always the eye of the animal. Her art is unique in the way she draws and paints shapes on animals. Her use of color is also very beautiful. Enjoy how well our 2nd graders have portrayed the emotion and feeling coming from the eyes of their colored animals.

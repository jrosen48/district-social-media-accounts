By studying Hebrew at Agamim, students access one of the three major ancient languages that influenced the development of Western civilization and inspired our intellectual and cultural history. Many of the great thinkers of the past, including the American founding fathers, studied Hebrew, Latin, and Greek. Classical schools today continue to prize the study of one or all of these three ancient languages because of their regular grammatical structure — a feature that helps students learn strong grammar and vocabulary as well as reinforces logical thinking patterns. Like studying mathematics, the inherent logic and order to Hebrew has advantages for nurturing precision and coherence in students’ reasoning and speaking.

to try to recreate the ""Three Amigos"" Watercolor. It was a very large piece about 48"" high and 60"" long. It was crazy trying to do this in just over 2 Hours. Everyone got many turns at the painting and only one of the teachers was an art teacher so it was a morning full of the magic of discovery, accident recoveries and laughter.

Students learned that the Cahill School served as the center for Edina’s Irish community, acting not only as a school, but also a place to hold meetings, dances, and other social gatherings. They also got to reenact what being a scholar in the building was like and perform a dance routine!

School champions then took an online qualifying test, which they submitted to the National Geographic Society.
This year, National Geographic increased the prize money for all State GeoBees. State champions will receive a medal, $1,000 in cash, and other prizes, as well as a trip to Washington, D.C., to represent their state in the National Championship to be held at National Geographic Society headquarters, May 19-22, 2019. Students that come in second and third place will receive cash awards of $300 and $100, respectively.

All are welcome to join us for Caleb’s GeoBee Send Off Assembly on Thursday, March 28th at Agamim!",2019-03-04 15:14:42,,

Dear Agamim Families,

We have been consulting with our bus company and have decided to cancel school for tomorrow, Wednesday, February 20th. Our bus routes and family commutes are far-reaching across the metro and it will be difficult to get to school and back home in a reasonable timeframe. We are making this call this evening to help parents/guardians make plans for childcare tomorrow.

Have a safe day together.

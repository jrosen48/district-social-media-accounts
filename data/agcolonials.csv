Please read the information below regarding the Laurel Highlands at Albert Gallatin varsity football game scheduled for Friday, September 11th, 2020.

As a result of the Governor’s mandate of only allowing a 250-person capacity for outdoor gatherings, the football game is closed to the public. The limited spectators permitted to the game are for parents/guardians of the players and cheerleaders of the Albert Gallatin Area High School. We are sorry for the inconvenience, but are hopeful this mandate is changed soon and we will be able to accommodate more spectators in the near future.

If you’re interested in watching the game, it will be live streamed through our AGTV Sports Network. You can also listen to the game on W.M.B.S. 590 AM. The South Union Sports Network will be on tape delay. I will provide links to the live stream tomorrow morning.

AIMS@UNM class of 2023 (Freshmen last year) outscored the global pass rate/mean scores on the A.P. United States Government and Politics Exam.

The global pass rate (score of 3 or above to earn college credit) was 57.5% and we are at 58% (New Mexico as a state came in at 30.9%).

Our mean score (2.9) also bested the global and New Mexico mean scores (G 2.84, NM 2.04). This is really great news for the following reasons:

- Our kids take this course and exam as freshmen - 9th grade, whereas the course is predominantly taught at the 12th grade level elsewhere.

- ALL of our kids take the exam, whereas it's mostly optional elsewhere (often the most confident/advised will sign up, pay for and take the exam).

- AIMS@UNM pays for all our students' exams.

- The kids truly stepped up in the face of strange and challenging circumstances.

- We had eight scores of a 5 (17% of our test takers and global is 16%). It may be the highest number of 5s scored on any of our AP exams over the years

Do you remember learning about Galileo, the father of physics, who was
born in Pisa, Italy, in 1564 and lived until 1642. He discovered the
Rings of Saturn, among other things? Galileo also discovered that any
object falling to earth, falls at the same rate.

height, will touch the ground at the same time provided there is no
air resistance. I always found this hard to believe.

centuries later, with the current technology, it has been

- Graduation practice will be held at 7:00 pm on Thursday in the gym, please be a few minutes early for screening.

- Parents, be looking for your student’s packet of tickets for Saturday. There will be a place on the back for the person who is using the ticket to PRINT their last name. This way we can collect the tickets and we will have the ability to let the health dept. know who actually used the ticket on graduation day.

- Please try to organize family guests in groups of 8 prior to getting to the door for screening. This will make seating in the gym much easier and more organized.

As we work together in our communities to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases, like COVID-19, there are a few things to remember:

1. If you are sick - stay home
2. If you feel you need to seek medial attention - call ahead so that healthcare teams can take precautionary preparedness measures prior to your arrival
3. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with warm water and soap
4. Avoid close contact with people who are sick
5. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth
6. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
7. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.",0.0,"Great information from the North Central District Health Department.

Out of respect for everyone’s time, this year, computers will be rolled out to students on the first day of school versus an evening prior to the beginning of school as we had done in previous years.

You will be receiving paperwork in the mail, please review all of the information and once signed, the colored page can be dropped off at the school or sent with your student on the first day with the $35.00 lease fee if applicable.

The first day of school is quickly approaching and hopefully the change of the computer rollout will make the process more efficient for all involved.

Below is a short video which I would encourage you to watch.

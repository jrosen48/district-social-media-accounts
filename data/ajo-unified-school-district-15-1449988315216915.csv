We want your children to continue learning! We did a tech survey recently to determine how many students have access to the Internet and online resources. We are in the midst of planning and will have more for you soon. We will continue to educate Ajo students online and are figuring out best ways for those without Internet access.

We hope you will join us for our Band Concert, Thurs, Dec 13 at 6pm in Dicus! Please remember concert etiquette and maintain quiet during performances. As Mr. Green notes, it's like being in the movie theater: we silence phones and refrain from talking. That way we will show Red Raider respect for our amazing students as they perform! Thank you!

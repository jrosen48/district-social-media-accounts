As you've already heard, school opens July 21 with online instruction due to the Corona-virus global pandemic. We appreciate the support and understanding that many of you have shared. It's difficult for everyone, but we are going to shine on.

We do have a need to help our students and families. Because students are beginning their new school year at home, we will provide meals they normally would receive in school to their homes. To help us deliver the freshest food possible we are in need of additional ICE PACKS OR FROZEN GEL PACKS as well as CARDBOARD OR STYROFOAM FOOD CONTAINERS.

If you are able to help in this request, please send a note to Karen at kwarhus@goaj.org.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10163836218630109&id=228509620108,,0.0,"Hello Apache Junction community,

Students work collaboratively with other students as teachers guide them to explore and create while problem solving to be innovative learners.

All students are encouraged to be a part of camp as it's a hands on experience that leads students into a world of creating and innovating.

Typically a week long program with approximately 200 elementary teachers and 15 staff, this year we ran the program through online meetings.

Every AJUSD graduate has a unique story and the Ripley Brothers are no different. Aaron (pictured in the first picture on the right) has overcome many challenges but still managed to graduate with a 4.0. He is a determined and kind lad who is always willing to lend a hand - even without being asked! He isn't letting high school be the end of his education. Aaron is going to be taking classes online at Penn Foster. He will be going to school for small engine repair. He is so excited. He even received a scholarship.

Aaron is going to be taking classes online at Penn Foster. He will be going to school for small engine repair. He is so excited. He even received a scholarship.

Dear Patrons of the Arizona Lecture Series:

It is with saddening hearts to inform you that the remainder of the Arizona Lecture Series season is cancelled due to a statewide school district shutdown in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. We hope you have enjoyed spending your Monday nights and learning about all the fascinating history that makes Arizona so unique. We promise that the series will be back for its 2021 season. For those who have purchased tickets to “Armed with Our Language” and/or “Doc Holliday” we encourage you to hold onto your tickets as they will be credited to next year’s season.

All the Best,

Kids aren’t the only ones who had fun on Halloween. At Cactus Canyon Junior High the 8th grade team of core teachers wore shirts with a Hocus Pocus theme. The shirts were created by Diana Kidde. #ajusd

The ladies’ shirts had more sparkle than the guy’s version (the no-sparkle ban was the only way they would wear a shirt). The ladies’ shirts said, “I smell children.” The guy’s shirts said, “It's all just a bunch of Hocus Pocus.”

CCJH has a very special group of teachers. They work together, have fun and display a true spirit of teamwork and camaraderie. The picture was taken by Jenny Powell right after lunch.

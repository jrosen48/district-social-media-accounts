We recognize that many Alaskans are feeling lonely and could use more social support including help with child care. One choice Alaskans now have, thanks to everyone's hard work to flatten our curve, is to slightly expand your social bubble to be connected with a few close friends or another family to help support each other. Create a small and consistent ""trusted bubble"" and outside that bubble, keep up the great work staying at least 6 feet from others to keep case counts low in Alaska.

Trooper Rallo introduced Kimmik to the kiddos at Knik Elementary school that came up with the K9s name. Kimmik is a three year old male Belgian Malinois. He is what we call a “dual-purpose” canine, meaning he is trained to conduct patrol work and sniff out certain controlled substances. A student in the class came up with the name Kimmik because his grandparents had a dog by that name and it was a good dog. The class liked that it was an Inupiaq name and means ‘dog’ and that is why they suggested it for the new K9. The students were amazed at how attentive Kimmik is to Trooper Rallo and how well behaved he was. They especially loved it when Kimmik would find the hidden objects around the room and get his toy as a reward. AST would like to thank the Matanuska-Susitna Borough School District for sharing these great photos with us.",0.0,"Alaska State Troopers (Official) K9 Kimmik and Trooper Rallo visited Knik Elementary School yesterday!

Alaska State Troopers (Official)
February 24 at 6:32 PM ·

Trooper Rallo introduced Kimmik to the kiddos at Knik Elementary school that came up with the K9s name. Kimmik is a three year old male Belgian Malinois. He is what we call a “dual-purpose” canine, meaning he is trained to conduct patrol work and sniff out certain controlled substances. A student in the class came up with the name Kimmik because his grandparents had a dog by that name and it was a good dog. The class liked that it was an Inupiaq name and means ‘dog’ and that is why they suggested it for the new K9. The students were amazed at how attentive Kimmik is to Trooper Rallo and how well behaved he was. They especially loved it when Kimmik would find the hidden objects around the room and get his toy as a reward. AST would like to thank the Matanuska-Susitna Borough School District for sharing these great photos with us.",2020-02-25 10:38:00,,

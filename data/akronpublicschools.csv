This video features members of our 7th and 8th grade Chamber Choir performing ""Light in the Hallway"" by Mitchell Grassi, Scott Hoying, and Audra Mae, arranged by Roger Emerson (Hal Leonard #00265179). This video was produced using no autotune, pitch correction, or timing enhancement; just some reverb and echo to simulate a nice concert hall!

Miller South is a Visual & Performing Arts School where the creative and curious learn to challenge, support, and inspire each other. Our unique environment focuses on the Arts and Academics, empowering students to use innovative skills to flourish as people and professionals. Learn more at: https://millersouth.akronschools.com

Ohio families with children who receive free or reduced breakfasts and lunches should start receiving money this week.

The temporary program, called Pandemic-Electronic Benefit Transfer (P-EBT), gives the families of 507,000 students who receive the assistance the money as a credit that can be spent in grocery stores.

The money amounts to about $300 per student.

People who receive help with food from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will have that money loaded directly to their P-EBT card.

If you don’t currently receive SNAP benefits, you’ll get your card in the mail.

The last mission for fifth grade reading students in Mission Control (part of Miller South’s Gifted & Talented program) is a digital film competition. In past years, students were given roughly 16 school-hours to complete their submission. This year, due to our digital learning environment, students received 4.5 weeks. This project is rooted in the art of storytelling. Students had to collaborate during Google Meets to develop a story and script, decide who they would cast as different characters, create a shot list, film independently and/or with help from a family member, using their chromebooks. Some students also attempted to utilize a green screen effect. After filming, students used WeVideo for Education to edit the movie to be within the 4-6 minute requirement. Hopefully that gives you an idea that it was no easy task!

The last mission for fifth grade reading students in Mission Control (part of Miller South’s Gifted & Talented program) is a digital film competition. In past years, students were given roughly 16 school-hours to complete their submission. This year, due to our digital learning environment, students received 4.5 weeks. This project is rooted in the art of storytelling. Students had to collaborate during Google Meets to develop a story and script, decide who they would cast as different characters, create a shot list, film independently and/or with help from a family member, using their chromebooks. Some students also attempted to utilize a green screen effect. After filming, students used WeVideo for Education to edit the movie to be within the 4-6 minute requirement. Hopefully that gives you an idea that it was no easy task!

The May Festival has been a celebrated annual tradition in the Akron Public Schools for 93 years. Our presentation this year will be unique due to the virtual aspects of the program.

This year's programming has been divided into three separate presentations which provide performance opportunities for our elementary, middle, and high school students in music, dance theatre, and visual arts.

Part 1 of the Virtual May Festival series will feature elementary, middle and high school choirs, as well as middle school and high school dance and theater. Part 2 will feature our middle and high school instrumental presentations. Part 3 will feature our elementary, middle, and high school visual arts gallery presentations.

Students who had a physical completed on or after July 1, 2019 will be allowed to utilize that physical for activities through December 31, 2020. Usually physicals can only be utilized for a year at a time.

The Parent Permission and Concussion form that typically accompanies the physical forms we hand out will need to be signed by the parent/guardian and the student just as it has in previous years, so there is no extension for this form.

Our graduates were recently provided an opportunity to help decide when to hold graduation.

Of the three options to consider, the majority of graduates have selected June 28 as our new date for holding commencement.

We are hopeful that we can hold this event at the school in our traditional format. However, we are also planning an alternative ""virtual"" graduation in case we are unable to bring everyone together. If we go with this option, more details will be shared.

If you have questions or comments regarding this decision, please call the school at (712) 568-2020.",2020-04-24 10:50:30,,

Throughout the pandemic, Alabaster City Schools have been committed to feeding our children. A new waiver from the USDA is allowing us to extend our free feeding program through December 31, 2020 or until funding is depleted. We will feed all children at no charge for breakfast and lunch starting September 1, 2020. This will provide meals to ALL children, whether they are learning in the classroom or learning virtually.

ALL Alabaster City School students will receive free meals (breakfast and lunch) at each school site. This includes hot meals served daily across all ACS cafeterias. This applies to all students- they do not have to be eligible for reduced-price or free meals.

Curbside meal kit pickup is also available Wednesday, 8:30 to 9:30, at Thompson High School. These meal kits are for all students learning through Champion Virtual Academy.

Families who qualify will still need to fill out the free and reduced meal application to ensure there is no lapse in coverage starting in January or when this program ends.

Families are responsible for any lunch debt accumulated in August. Also, students will need money in their account if they wish to purchase ice cream or other a la carte items.

We will have a supply pick-up and drop-off for students to pick-up supplies and belongings that were left in their lockers in March. Students are also asked to return textbooks and library books at this time. This will be drive-through style in the car rider line. No one will exit their vehicle while on campus. Our staff will be putting students' supplies and belongings from their hall locker and PE locker in a grocery bag that will be labeled with their name. Please follow these instructions for pick-up and drop-off.
Write your child's name in large print on a piece of paper and put it in the passenger side window of your car. (This will only apply to 7th and 8th graders.)
When you pull up to the gym lobby, using car rider line, open your trunk, and we will place your student's bag with their school belongings inside.
We cannot separate shared items or items students may have put in a friend's locker. All items in the lockers will go to the student whose name is associated with that locker.
Some students will not have a bag as their locker may have been empty.
If you need to return textbooks, please ensure that your child's name is written inside the textbook along with the year 19-20. This will ensure that your child receives credit for returning the textbook.
Place textbooks and library books in the trunk of your car. When we place your child's locker items in the car, we will then get the books. For 6th graders, we will only retrieve textbooks and library books.
Please follow all instructions from faculty and staff directing traffic, and please be patient as we work to get the correct belongings with each student.
You can pick-up/drop-off for siblings at the same time.
We will have pick-up for art, choir, band, and athletics in the bus lane at the back of the school. If your child took art, choir, or band, you can drive through this area to pick-up items from those classes if needed.
If you have a student athlete and need to return any items/uniforms, there will be a place to drop-off these items in the bus lane in the back of the school.
TMS Nurse April Mills will also be returning student medication in the bus lane in the back of the school.
Student pick-up/drop-off will be on the following days and times:

6th Grade: Monday, May 18 (Students will only be dropping off textbooks and library books as 6th graders did not have lockers.)
All students 8:00-11:00 a.m. and 1:00-2:30 p.m.

Fewer than half of one percent of students who take the ACT earn a top score. In the U.S. high school graduating class of 2019, only 4,879 out of nearly 1.8 million students who took the ACT earned a top composite score of 36.

The ACT consists of tests in English, mathematics, reading and science, each scored on a scale of 1–36. A student's composite score is the average of the four test scores. The score for ACT’s optional writing test is reported separately and is not included within the ACT composite score.

In a letter to the student recognizing this exceptional achievement, ACT CEO Marten Roorda stated, “Your achievement on the ACT is significant and rare. Your exceptional scores will provide any college or university with ample evidence of your readiness for the academic rigors that lie ahead.”

The ACT is a curriculum-based achievement exam that measures what students have learned in school. Students who earn a 36 composite score have likely mastered all of the skills and knowledge they will need to succeed in first-year college courses in the core subject areas.

ACT scores are accepted by all major four-year colleges and universities across the US.

“Drive-Up” Learning: Student Filtered WiFi

Alabaster City Schools is continuing to provide avenues for student success in distance learning. Over the past week, Alabaster City Schools distributed over 400 Chromebooks to students in grades 3-12. In order to facilitate student learning, we are also proud to announce that starting Thursday, April 9, 2020, at 5:00 PM, all Alabaster City Schools campuses and the Central Office/Alabaster City Schools Empowering Students (ACES) building will have outdoor wireless access points installed. The district-managed WiFi network will be accessible through the parking lots located at different points on each campus. Each parking lot will be monitored through security cameras. Students will be able to utilize the “Drive-Up” service from the safety of their cars. The WiFi network will use the district’s content filtering and security measures that continue to address compliance with the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA). The Student Code of Conduct and Technology Acceptable Use Policy will apply. During this COVID-19 pandemic, families should practice social distancing guidelines while using the resource and adhere to any city-wide curfew restrictions.

Creek View Elementary School, Meadow View Elementary School, Thompson Intermediate School, and Thompson Middle School have the wireless access points installed at the front of each school. The access points at Thompson High School are located in the back of the school. The access point at ACES is located in the back parking lot near the former Thompson Intermediate School basketball courts, and the Central Office access point is located at the parking lot near the railroad track.

Once students arrive at a “Drive-Up” learning location, ACS-named wireless networks will appear as they do when students are on campus. Students with district-provided Chromebooks will automatically join the ACS_Chrome wireless network. Students using a personal device must connect to the ACS_Student network by using their student username and password. Those who do not remember their student usernames and/or passwords should contact their teacher.

Important: Security measures such as content filtering, device monitoring, and user reporting are still in place. For additional information, please go to www.acsboe.org/DriveUpLearning.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3613191972030043&id=219705378045403,,0.0,"Alabaster City Schools

Dear Warrior Family,

The Alabaster City School System is diligently working on a plan in response to Governor Kay Ivey's announcement that school campuses will not reopen to students for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year. Beginning April 6, instruction will consist of an enrichment program designed to reinforce core academic standards and best prepare students for the next school year. This plan will be delivered virtually/online and also through written materials for any student without access to technology. We are also working to finalize grades for the current school year. While we do not anticipate our enrichment program to have grading parameters, we are still awaiting guidance from the Alabama State Department of Education regarding year-end grades and promotion criteria.
We have developed a survey to determine the availability of technology in student households. At your earliest convenience but on/before 11 pm on March 31, please complete the survey found at https://www.acsboe.org/HomeAccess.

For members of the Thompson High School Class of 2020, we continue preparations to commemorate your accomplishments, including prom, Commencement, and other senior events that have become traditions in our community. Based on the current pandemic situation, we are unable to finalize specific dates for these events, but will continuously evaluate the situation in an effort to celebrate your accomplishments as soon as we are given clearance to safely convene our class of 544 seniors and their families/guests.

Our Pre-Kindergarten program will conduct a virtual drawing on March 31 at 9:00am to select students for the 2020-21 class. Additional information can be found at
https://www.acsboe.org/2020PreK_Lottery. For students entering kindergarten in the fall, we will soon post an online pre-registration form through our website and will work to reschedule a kindergarten tour as soon as feasibly possible.
Thank you for your patience as we navigate this unprecedented, continuously-evolving event. We will release additional details as they are available. Please continue to monitor our social media and www.acsboe.org for more information.

Sincerely,

Dear Parents/Guardians of Students in Alabaster City Schools:

Our approach to dealing with the concerns associated with COVID-19 (coronavirus) is very fluid based on the rapidly changing landscape. With the health and well-being of our students and staff as our top priority, we are following guidance from Governor Ivey, Centers for Disease Control, Alabama Department of Public Health, and the Alabama State Department of Education. As a reminder, Alabaster City Schools will remain closed and will tentatively reopen on April 6. All extracurricular activities will be canceled during this time. School officials realize that travel plans for Spring Break were made far in advance of this health crisis. Nevertheless, we urge you to follow all travel guidelines and other recommendations made by the CDC to avoid contracting COVID-19: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html

In addition, we are putting in place several precautions as students and employees transition back into classrooms after the break. We have developed the following ""Return to School Guidelines"" that we believe are necessary to safeguard the health of all. Many of these guidelines are recommendations currently set forth by the Centers for Disease Control. However, please note that these could change as the situation evolves.

Return to School Guidelines:
• If your child comes into contact with a known carrier of COVID-19, do not send your child back to school after the break until he/she is cleared from a doctor to return back to school. It is suggested to contact your physician for further guidance. To minimize the spread of the virus, please notify us at www.acsboe.org/covid-19.
• If your child is confirmed to have contracted coronavirus, he/she will need written clearance from your physician before returning to school. Please notify us if your child has tested positive for COVID-19 at www.acsboe.org/covid-19.

Similar guidelines will be in place for employees. Our hope is that these extra precautions will help eliminate or, at least, reduce the chances of the virus spreading. As new developments take place, we will provide updated information. For the most current information, please visit our website. We also encourage you to consult the CDC website at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus for reliable information on what you can do to protect yourself and your family. Thank you for your cooperation as we navigate this unprecedented situation.

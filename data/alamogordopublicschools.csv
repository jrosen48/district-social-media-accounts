Tiger Graduates, Parents, Guardians, and Fans,

Here is the link to our AHS/ADS virtual graduation ceremony scheduled for Friday, 22 May, at 6:00PM:

alamogordo-hs.Stageclip.com

You may share it with as many people as you like, no ""tickets"" required.

At 8:00PM that same night, we will be holding the drawing for the Perfect Attendance Car, courtesy of Mr. Bobby Martinez and Desert Sun Motors. The drawing will livestream on the Alamogordo High School Facebook page.

And after that, at 8:20PM (2020), we'll have our final Friday Night Lights for the AHS/ADS Classes of 2020, but this time, it won't just be stadium lights--we'll be lighting up the sky above Tiger Stadium with our traditional graduation fireworks!

Thank you for your amazing support of our socially-distanced, ""drive-through"" commencement week!

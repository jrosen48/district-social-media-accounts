Your child may experience a delay when attempting to get into a Zoom Room since all participants are now required to go to a waiting room before being granted access by the host (teacher). In addition, Zoom Rooms can be password protected and locked once participants are allowed in.
Other safety features include participants muted upon entry and not allowed to share their screen unless the host (teacher) grants permission.
Although the safety features may take a bit of time for everyone to get used to, it is critical that we keep Zoom Rooms secure.

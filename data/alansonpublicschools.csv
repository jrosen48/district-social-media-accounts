Sturgeon in the Classroom UPDATE: Our classroom visitor’s name is Fin! Thank you for all who voted and shared in our excitement.

My students and I would also like to thank Doug Larson for all the time he has already volunteered and effort he has put into helping us with our tank. Also, thank you to Kris Dey from the Little Traverse Bay Band of Odawa Indians for making this all possible!

Below is a picture of a juvenile Lake Sturgeon. If all goes well🤞🏻, Fin will be this size in no time!

Stay tuned for more updates on Fin. 💙💛",2020-01-16 06:01:29,,

This morning I had the opportunity to visit Henry’s class and talk about Lake Sturgeon as part of Nme’ Teachings (Sturgeon in the classroom). A neat way for students to learn about #nativefish. While the fish is amazing, the curriculum is better. Huge shout out to Kris Dey and everyone at the Little Traverse Bay Bands Of Odawa Indians for providing the materials and the fish to make this happen.￼￼ Another shout out to Mrs. Cantrell For taking this on! We are so fortunate to have great educators at Alanson Public Schools!",2.0,"Here is a little more information about what is going on in the second grade classroom today!

While all of the projects from our incredible students are our favorite, this project received the most votes in the Engineering and Empathy Project Finalists Facebook album! These innovative students designed their toy with different mazes made out of Legos, trying to make each maze harder than the last. They took pictures of the mazes created and added them into ""The Marble Maze Book"". Children then use the maze book and the Lego set to try to create the mazes inside.",0.0,"Way to go American Leadership Academy- Gilbert South Elementary!

There is a plan to address the COVID-19 Pandemic. It is a very simple plan that will work, if we will only all follow it.
- Wash your hands and all common touch areas
- Keep your distance from people as much possible
- Do not travel unless you must
- Isolate yourself if you do
- If you have symptoms isolate yourself and call the clinic
- Keep groups small...under 5
- Wash your hands

This is all we have to do, for a few short weeks...just follow that plan. ALL OF US! Because then, everyone who has COVID-19 can be discovered, and can be isolated, and our medical professionals will be able to do their jobs to help them, and years from now this will only be dim memory. It's not hard...and we can do this! Do it because you love your communities. Right now, everyone needs to just follow the plan, and we can all help save thousands and thousands of lives.

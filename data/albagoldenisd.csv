The board approved a second school nurse position specifically for secondary students. This is extremely proactive as it allows us to monitor/check symptoms for students on their home campus. This will avoid sending students across the district to one nurse clinic at elementary and reduce cross-contamination for any illness. We are pleased to announce Mrs. Jill Boykin has accepted the nurse position at our elementary campus. Applications are being accepted for our secondary nurse currently. Please contact Michael Mize, HS Principal, at mizem@agisd.org for details about applying. This is another great step in planning for the future and intentional strategy in preparing for the re-opening of schools!

The board approved a second school nurse position specifically for secondary students. This is extremely proactive as it allows us to monitor/check symptoms for students on their home campus. This will avoid sending students across the district to one nurse clinic at elementary and reduce cross-contamination for any illness. We are pleased to announce Mrs. Jill Boykin has accepted the nurse position at our elementary campus. Applications are being accepted for our secondary nurse currently.

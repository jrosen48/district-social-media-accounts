At this time our elementary students will be attending school Monday through Thursday and JH/HS students will be on a hybrid schedule alternating days with virtual learning on days not present.

As a community we need to be flexible and be able to rotate from plan to plan fluently as situations change. We do not want to lose students and will find a way to serve every student in the district, to meet the needs of families, and the educational needs of each student.

We will continue to follow the directives of the County Health Department and Governor's directives.

This message is from Mica Clarkson, PK-12 Principal of Alberton Schools.

As you are aware, the Alberton School District, like all Montana school districts, will be making
decisions in the near future about reopening this coming fall of 2020.

We have composed a survey to gather families' opinions and perceptions on items that will assist in guiding the school board, administration, and staff in planning for reopening. This survey is especially important if the school district is not given the permission to reopen as it normally has in previous years.

The survey contains 30 questions. All the questions are multiple choice and it should only take between five to seven minutes to complete. A link to the survey will be placed on the school district’s Facebook page. The goal is to have one response per household. You will have until Monday, July 13th, to complete the survey. We thank you in advance for your time.

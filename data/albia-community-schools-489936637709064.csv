WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR FAVORITE BOOKS? Owl Diaries, Geronimo Stilton, Whatever After, and The Spiderwick Chronicles

TELL US ABOUT ONE OF YOUR FAVORITE BOOKS OR SERIES: Spiderwick Chronicles is about two brothers and their sister who find a boggart in the walls of a secret room at their aunt's house. It is scary and suspenseful with magical creatures!

WHAT ARE YOUR SUMMER READING PLANS? I want to read the rest of the Spiderwick series and more Geronimo Stilton books. It's fun to read on my trampoline on a nice day and also in my canopy bed. I will keep listening to my mom read Harry Potter.

READER: Sophie W

WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR FAVORITE BOOKS? The Maze Runner series, Divergent series, Shatter Me series, The Belgariad series, The Fault in our Stars,

TELL US ABOUT ONE OF YOUR FAVORITE BOOKS OR SERIES: My favorite series is probably the Maze Runner series, although it is hard to choose. This series is a dystopia and very action packed with a lot of little important details, which, in my opinion, is what makes it so good. The books were really hard to put down.

WHAT ARE YOUR SUMMER READING PLANS? This summer, I already have and plan to read a lot.

FAVORITE AUTHOR: I don't really have a favorite author.

FAVORITE TYPE OF BOOKS: Science fiction, Mystery, Dystopias

It is very IMPORTANT that our STUDENTS DON'T GATHER IN GROUPS while attending the games. I'm reaching out to our Student Leaders that attend the games to help set this example and help keep up our social distancing at our home events. This will help ensure everyone's safety and to be able to continue to play our summer activities.

WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR FAVORITE BOOKS? The Land of Stories series

TELL US ABOUT ONE OF YOUR FAVORITE BOOKS OR SERIES: I like the Land of Stories because it is funny and adventurous. They are really fun books to read! The stories are about these twins named Alex and Conner. They travel to a fairy tale world through a magical book their grandmother gave them. The characters in the fairy tale world are characters from popular stories like Snow White and Little Red Riding Hood. We get to see them in their future. For example, Red Riding Hood becomes a queen. Another example is that Jack and Goldilocks get married.

Only stipulations are groups of 6 at any time, social distance in our large sports roundtable studio, and follow FCC guidelines!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2885603944808976&id=489936637709064,,0.0,"Tune in to KICC this Thursday at 5:30 to support our Seniors!

The following days/times have been designated for students to drop off their scholarships.

Some of you may remember when I posted about Beads of Courage before. It is a program for kiddos in the hospital with surgeries, cancer, etc. they get these gorgeous beads for sticks, surgeries, meds, treatments, etc. There’s a whole bunch of volunteers whom make beads, bags, etc.

Well, since I don’t know how to sew I had asked for someone to make bags on my behalf in honor of Scarlette to donate to the hospital for these kids. Mrs Katie Weaver took on the challenge and had her kiddos sew some in her class. Katie warned me they may not be perfect, however, I think they are. They have character. They’re homemade with love.

Thank you soooo much for taking on this project as an assignment for your kids; and thank you to your class for making these bags! 💕💕💕",0.0,"Shayna Tallman added 3 new photos to the album: Scarlette Elyse 🎀 — with Kaytay A Ayy and 2 others.

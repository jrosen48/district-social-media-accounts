ABA is preparing to issue additional devices beginning September 11, 2020. A shipment of 200 Chromebooks will be made available to any student actively enrolled in ABA online courses. A schedule for device pick up will be shared this week, as we will stagger pick up to avoid long lines.

Please complete the form below - you must complete one form for each ABA student residing in your household.

https://forms.gle/1puVc9PZfvxiLYkp8

Thank you for your patience during this challenging time. Our teachers continue to work hard to adapt to this model of teaching and learning. We would like to extend our appreciation to our parents, as you have done an exceptional job as our partners in learning. We hope the additional devices will help your online learning experience flow a little better.

ABA Device Checkout/Sistema de pr√©stamo de dispositivos",0.0,"Good Morning,

ABA is preparing to issue additional devices beginning September 11, 2020. A shipment of 200 Chromebooks will be made available to any student actively enrolled in ABA online courses. A schedule for device pick up will be shared this week, as we will stagger pick up to avoid long lines.

Please complete the form below - you must complete one form for each ABA student residing in your household.

https://forms.gle/1puVc9PZfvxiLYkp8

Thank you for your patience during this challenging time. Our teachers continue to work hard to adapt to this model of teaching and learning. We would like to extend our appreciation to our parents, as you have done an exceptional job as our partners in learning. We hope the additional devices will help your online learning experience flow a little better.

Respectfully,

Mr. Jones

Please know that we are making both options (online and in-person) available for our beloved families. We know this is a difficult time for all of you, and we want to do everything we can to help you get through this together, with the least continued impact on the children we all love.

ABA Student Return Update",0.0,"Hi ABA Families,

Please help us by completing the 'Return to School' form below. We need to know by this Friday if your students will return for in-person instruction next year of if you will keep them home to learn online. A form is required for each student that attends ABA - please do not double up siblings.

Please know that we are making both options (online and in-person) available for our beloved families. We know this is a difficult time for all of you, and we want to do everything we can to help you get through this together, with the least continued impact on the children we all love.

It saddens me to have to send this email because I look forward to 6th grade orientation every year. Unfortunately due to current circumstances with COVID-19, an in-person orientation was not an effective, safe way to handle this process. So, linked https://youtu.be/q0qhuvZJYwg you will find a video that shows parts of the school, introduces 6th grade teachers, and covers some general information. A video isn't the same, but I hope this helps students learn a little bit of information that they would have learned from orientation night.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out and I'll help however I can.

Go Pirates!

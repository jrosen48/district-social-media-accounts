Hey, Heart of the Gila friends. Please welcome Quinn Crockett our summer, 2020 intern. Quinn will be a senior at Aldo Leopold Charter School in the fall. She grew up and lives at the headwaters of the Gila River in the village of Gila Hot Springs and will help with our stewardship, trails and education projects.
Says Quinn, “I grew up in the wilderness and since the time I could talk I’ve been learning how to identify and use many native plants. I’ve been doing research and projects on invasive species for years now and I’m eager to learn more and support this place that I will forever call my home.""",0.0,"Go Quinn!!!

Aldo Leopold Charter School Class of 2020
Contact Darlene Chavez - achavez@aldocs.org

By adopting a senior, community members have the opportunity to brighten a senior’s spirit during this tough time by sending them messages of encouragement and/or little tokens of appreciation. A card, a note, a small gift. Anything, really. You don't have to spend a lot. Basically, once someone adopts a senior, they are given a bio of that senior to help them assess what notes or small gifts to send that senior anytime during a two week period.

We have 20 deserving Seniors that could use a little community support right now. It's fun and easy!

Can Aldo Leopold’s land ethic tackle our toughest problems?

Justin Bramhall
December 6, 2016 at 5:05 AM ·

""Our challenge, then, is to continue — or better, accelerate — the evolution of the land ethic and the ideas that underpin it. Three generations after Leopold, we’re even more distracted than the people of his time, and our environmental problems are in many ways vastly more complicated and pressing. The biotic community is as interconnected as ever, though our influences upon it are greater now, and voluntary decency must stretch to serve species and places we don’t know and never will. But we can still start in the same place Leopold did: in the chicken coop, and with the problems of the backyard biota.""",0.0,"Hey, we know these things...!!!

The Alexander City Schools Leadership Team is in constant contact with multiple agencies (Alabama High School Athletic Association (AHSAA), Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE), and the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH)) to help guide our decisions for reopening schools. These agencies update and change information sometimes daily; therefore, the plan will be constantly updated as we make necessary changes. We will use SchoolCast, social media, and the district website to alert you to the updates. I am anticipating the plan being complete by August 1, 2020. The individual school plans outlining specific school procedures (drop-off and pick-up, schedules, check-in/out, and electronic device assignment) will also be included in the plan by August 1, 2020.

🚨Graduation Reminder🚨

Seniors and Senior Parents,

This Thursday, graduation will be held at the football field in two waves; 5:00 & 7:30 (Check your email for designated time). This is a voluntary, non-traditional graduation. However, we will expect family members to honor our long tradition of showing class and pride by holding applause and cheers until the graduated class is presented.

All family members are reminded to wear masks in the stadium. Optional for seniors.

If the senior is not participating due to choice or did not meet requirements, their gowns must be turned in by Thursday by 12:00 pm. They are to be shipped back to Balfour Friday morning.

Gates open for family members at 4:30 and 7:00. (The email says 6:30; however, the correct entry time is 7:00 for the second wave). Enter through the pass gate with your mask on. Reminder that YOU MUST HAVE A MASK ON TO ENTER THE STADIUM.

In the event of severe weather or heavy rain on Thursday, we will use option two with graduation in the auditorium on Friday with the same procedures that were announced on May 7th. There will be NO make-up for graduation on the field.

🚨Breaking News!!! Long post with lots of information!🚨

Seniors and Senior Parents,

We are excited to announce the Class of 2020 Graduation will be held on the original date of May 22, 2020! The graduation will be on Facebook Live and recorded by our local television station. We wished that this graduation was a traditional one but with the safety concerns of COVID 19, we will have to make some changes to protect everyone involved with this ceremony.

Each senior will hear their name being called as they walk across the stage in the auditorium to pick up their high school diploma in front of their immediate family!

We will have groups of 20 seniors with each senior having a maximum of six family members rotating in and out of the auditorium every thirty minutes starting at 9:00 am on Friday, May 22, 2020. Times will be assigned by alphabetical order. Only one senior and a maximum of six family members will be allowed in the auditorium at a time.

Each senior and family will have only TWO designated parking spots in the student parking lot for the family (including the senior). This information has been emailed to you, so please check your email. The senior must be in one of the two vehicles with the family. All must stay in the vehicles until a staff member directs you to exit the vehicle and walk as a family to lobby of the auditorium. Like most businesses now, we will have an X every 6 feet for the senior and family to stand as they enter auditorium. ACPD will be on hand to ensure that only two vehicles per family are parking in the student parking lot.

As staff members guide the senior and family into the auditorium, the senior will walk down the aisle by the wall and the family member will walk down the center aisle toward the stage. The senior will give the teacher with the wired microphone an index card with his or her name on it. The teacher will call out the senior’s name as they walk across the stage to pick up a diploma cover off the table near Dr. Wilkinson. There will be no handshake.

Senior will stop for a quick picture for photographer and their family members. Senior will leave diploma cover on table after the picture. Both senior and family members will exit up the aisle by the wall to the main lobby of the school where they will turn in their gowns and pick up their senior packets. The senior packet will have items such as diploma, diploma cover, official transcripts, etc…Staff members will guide senior and family members out of the main lobby and use the sidewalk that is to the right of the ninth-grade building to the parking lot. Senior and family members need to leave campus quickly as the next group of 20 seniors and family members will need those parking spots.

Seniors who paid their senior fees will receive their cap and gowns when they turn in their Chromebooks on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week. In addition, we will also give out honor cords, NHS collars and tassels, and index card with name on it. Seniors who do not have cap and gown will not participate in graduation. All seniors are expected to be graduation dress code.

We want to remind all seniors and family members that there will be no celebration gatherings on school campus after the ceremony. Due to the rotation of almost 200 seniors and family members, we need for everyone to not arrive until about 10 minutes of their time and leave immediately after the ceremony.

We also want to announce the digital board across from Wal-Mart has pictures of our seniors on it! It looks great!

Your BR Family wants you to have the experience of graduating from BRHS. Although this may not be ideal, it is a way that we can honor you and your family with a personal touch.

We missed you guys and hope you are excited about having this graduation ceremony in your honor!

We will keep you updated on every thing so please check your email often!

❗️BR FAMILY PLEASE SHARE❗️

Just checking in on you! I hope you are trying to enjoy your spring break as much as possible with everything that is going on in our country, state, and community. We know that you may feel uneasy with all of the closures, cancellations, and new phrases like ""social distances"", ""what happened to the toilet paper"", etc...but your BR Teacher Family wants you to know that everything will be ok. Just listen to your parents and make smart decisions when it comes to being around friends and crowds.

We do want to give you some updates on some things. Some will make you happy and some will disappoint you.
- Student-led Conferences and Wildcat Showcase are cancelled.
- All athletic and extracurricular activities are cancelled. This includes after school events for any students.
- No students need to be at school during school closure unless it's an emergency.
- No athletic meetings or workouts for students.
- Prom will be rescheduled to May in the competition gym.
- Breakfast and lunch programs will be given out in a drive thru format at Stephens Elementary School next M-F from 11:30-12:30 during closure.

In an effort to help with any academic slide over the next two weeks of BR being closed, each core teacher will be assigning enrichment activities starting next Wednesday in a blended format. We will use both Google Classroom and printed copies. Students who do not have internet access may come to BRHS on Wednesday of next week to either drive through the bus loop from 8 am until 9 am for hand delivery of packets or pick up items on the front steps in grade level tubs. Printed student packets need to be turned in when you return on April 6th.

Please check your emails and the ACS district website for more information on any potential changes. In the last week of March, we will do a school cast and emails on the procedures for returning back to school and cleaning of Chromebooks. Also, dual enrollment will be online until further notice at CACC.

❗️BR FAMILY PLEASE SHARE❗️

Just checking in on you! I hope you are trying to enjoy your spring break as much as possible with everything that is going on in our country, state, and community. We know that you may feel uneasy with all of the closures, cancellations, and new phrases like ""social distances"", ""what happened to the toilet paper"", etc...but your BR Teacher Family wants you to know that everything will be ok. Just listen to your parents and make smart decisions when it comes to being around friends and crowds.

We do want to give you some updates on some things. Some will make you happy and some will disappoint you.
- Student-led Conferences and Wildcat Showcase are cancelled.
- All athletic and extracurricular activities are cancelled. This includes after school events for any students.
- No students need to be at school during school closure unless it's an emergency.
- No athletic meetings or workouts for students.
- Prom will be rescheduled to May in the competition gym.
- Breakfast and lunch programs will be given out in a drive thru format at Stephens Elementary School next M-F from 11:30-12:30 during closure.

In an effort to help with any academic slide over the next two weeks of BR being closed, each core teacher will be assigning enrichment activities starting next Wednesday in a blended format. We will use both Google Classroom and printed copies. Students who do not have internet access may come to BRHS on Wednesday of next week to either drive through the bus loop from 8 am until 9 am for hand delivery of packets or pick up items on the front steps in grade level tubs. Printed student packets need to be turned in when you return on April 6th.

Please check your emails and the ACS district website for more information on any potential changes. In the last week of March, we will do a school cast and emails on the procedures for returning back to school and cleaning of Chromebooks. Also, dual enrollment will be online until further notice at CACC.

Again, we just wanted to check in on you and make sure you are ok! Also, we wanted to keep you and your parents updated on some things!

Be Safe, Be Smart, Be Calm!

Enjoy your spring break!

TikTok is a video-sharing social media app available on iOS and Android which allows users to create, share, and view user-created videos like Facebook, Instagram or Snapchat. Its main draw, however, is that users can record and upload bite-sized looping videos of themselves lip-syncing and dancing to popular music or soundbites, often for comedic effect, which can then be further enhanced with filters, emojis and stickers. TikTok has been designed with the young user in mind and has a very addictive appeal. Occasionally, trends or “challenges” catch on that encourage users to attempt dangerous stunts to garner ‘likes’ from friends and/or viral fame. It takes a collaborative effort with parents, teachers, counselors, and administration working together to keep our students informed on the dangers of such social media challenges. If parents or students become aware of these dangerous trends, please do not hesitate to notify our schools and central office personnel.

TikTok is a video-sharing social media app available on iOS and Android which allows users to create, share, and view user-created videos like Facebook, Instagram or Snapchat. Its main draw, however, is that users can record and upload bite-sized looping videos of themselves lip-syncing and dancing to popular music or soundbites, often for comedic effect, which can then be further enhanced with filters, emojis and stickers. TikTok has been designed with the young user in mind and has a very addictive appeal. Occasionally, trends or “challenges” catch on that encourage users to attempt dangerous stunts to garner ‘likes’ from friends and/or viral fame. It takes a collaborative effort with parents, teachers, counselors, and administration working together to keep our students informed on the dangers of such social media challenges. If parents or students become aware of these dangerous trends, please do not hesitate to notify our schools and central office personnel. We urge parents to speak with your children about using social media responsibly. Also remind them that respect, empathy, and safety for others is far more important than any online trend.

In an effort to encourage teachers to truly get to know their students, Dr. Keith Lankford partnered with ACSEF to create a Bus Challenge for ACS teachers. The first teacher to ride all 23 buses would receive $1000.00. Abby Alexander made it her mission to complete the challenge. In order to ride the morning route she had to leave her home by 4:00 am. She then stayed most nights until 7:00 pm to plan for the next school day. Ms. Alexander got to see where her students live and where they come from. She was able to have conversations with students outside of the classroom to get to know them better. It was a beautiful experience for her, the students and our bus drivers. At the Oct. 29th ACS Board Meeting she was presented with her reward of $1000.00! Way to go, Ms. Alexander.",3.0,"Way to go, Ms. Alexander! 🚌💨🏆

Alexander City Schools will begin using the Raptor Visitor Management System in all schools and offices to increase the safety and security for students and faculty. Part of keeping students and faculty safe is having accountability of everyone present in our buildings at all times, and the Raptor system will now allow us to do just that. The Raptor System will allow screening of all visitors, contractors, and volunteers in our schools and provide us with a safer environment for Alexander City Schools.

Upon entering our schools and offices, visitors will be asked to present a government issued identification (ID), such as a driver's license, to be scanned or manually entered into the system. If a parent or guardian for any reason does not have a valid ID, they may present any form of ID with a picture and name to be entered into the system. The Raptor system will check/screen
The visitor against the national database of registered sex offenders. The registered sex offender data base is the only official database checked by the Raptor system. No other data from the ID is gathered or recorded and the information is not shared with any outside agency. Once the entry is approved, Raptor will print a visitor badge that identifies the visitor, the date/time, and the purpose of the visit. A visitor's badge will not be issued for those who s impl y drop off an item in the office or pick-up paperwork at the front desk.

The safety of our students is our highest priority and the Raptor visitor management system allows us to quickly identify those that may present a danger to our students. Thank you in advance for understanding and for your support in enhancing the school safety protocols in our school district.

Sincerely

Keith Lankford, Ed.D.

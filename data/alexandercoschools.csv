The start of the new school year means the big yellow buses are on the road again transporting students safely to and from school. Did you know the most dangerous part of the trip for students is traveling to and from the bus stop and getting on and off the bus?

Please review the handy refresher on following North Carolina school bus stop laws and remember to give yourself a little extra travel time when you head out in the morning or afternoon.",31.0,"Please watch for our school buses!

Wearing a cloth face covering in public settings is now a requirement in NC. It is a simple but powerful action to #SlowtheSpread of #COVID19. If we all wear a cloth covering over our nose and mouth, we can stabilize our COVID-19 trends.

Usar una mascarilla (cubierta de tela) en entornos públicos es ahora un requisito en NC. Es una acción simple pero poderosa para detener el contagio del COVID19 (#SlowtheSpread of #COVID19). Si todos usamos un paño cubriendo nuestra nariz y boca, podemos estabilizar la situación del COVID-19.

Thank you to everyone that turned out to the first ever AEC Student Cruise. This was a great way for AEC students and staff to see each other and still remain within the rules of Phase 2 of Governor Cooper's Plan. As everyone already knows, AEC has the best students! Thank you students for everything that you do to make AEC a special place. You are amazing!
Also, it takes a special, talented group of teachers and staff to compliment such an amazing group of students. Thank you AEC staff for supporting the student cruise and making it a special night for students! Students, if you were not able to attend the cruise and turn in your Chromebook, charger, and textbooks, please bring them by the school on Thursday or Friday. Check out the pics below of last night's cruise! Have a great day and go Owls!",0.0,"Alexander Early College

PLEASE READ ALL DETAILS ABOUT 5TH GRADE GRADUATION ON MONDAY, JUNE 1st.

5th grade graduation is one of the best programs of each school year,and it makes me sad that we cannot have a program for this group! We have tried to do several special things for our fifth graders to celebrate and honor them. Please know that we love each one of these kids and hope that the videos, banners, gifts, etc somehow fill the void of not having an in-person program. Mrs. Eckard also painted the spirit rock for the class and it now has all 5th graders' names on it. Check out the pics! (Hope you will come by and get your child's photo in the next week or so.) In order to have a safe, orderly, and honorable program please follow the guidelines below about the program on Monday night.",0.0,"Ellendale Elementary School

Hey friends in the Bethlehem community! We have a new ""Blessing Box"" at Bethlehem Elementary. It is basically a small food pantry where people can come get food if they need it - and I'm sure during this time of crisis there are families in our community that do need it. If you have any extra in your pantry, or if you are getting groceries in the next weeks and think about the Blessing Box, please contribute if you feel led!

These are the items most commonly donated and used to stock the Blessing Box:

Canned food with ring-pulls
Crackers
Non-perishable foods
Small snacks
Toiletries, including hand soap, toothbrushes and toothpaste
Baby wipes

Thanks everyone!",6.0,"Natasha Deal Haas

Hey friends in the Bethlehem community! We have a new ""Blessing Box"" at Bethlehem Elementary. It is basically a small food pantry where people can come get food if they need it - and I'm sure during this time of crisis there are families in our community that do need it. If you have any extra in your pantry, or if you are getting groceries in the next weeks and think about the Blessing Box, please contribute if you feel led!

These are the items most commonly donated and used to stock the Blessing Box:

Canned food with ring-pulls
Crackers
Non-perishable foods
Small snacks
Toiletries, including hand soap, toothbrushes and toothpaste
Baby wipes

Thanks everyone!",11.0,"Natasha Deal Haas

The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) is offering two mental health hotlines during the COVID-19 crisis -- one for all North Carolinians and one for healthcare/emergency personnel. The Hope4NC Helpline (1-855-587-3463) connects North Carolinians to additional mental health and resilience supports that help them cope and build resilience during times of crisis. It was previously a service available to Hurricane-impacted counties, but now it is being made available to everyone in North Carolina’s 100 counties during the COVID-19 crisis. [ 129 more words ]

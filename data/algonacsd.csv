AHS presents Doorways & Pathways - Prom 2020! Since times are different now, so is Prom. It's not cancelled - just changed. On Saturday, June 20th, AHS juniors and seniors, plus a guest, are invited to a series of photo shoots in and around the Algona community. Begin at AHS with the first photo opportunity for you and your guest (this photo will also be used for a ""virtual"" Grand March). From there, you and your guest will be given a number of pre-determined photo opportunities in and around the Algona Community. These locations will provide the perfect back drop and will utilize a variety of doorways and pathways to go along with this year's theme. Every Algona High School junior or senior who takes part will receive a prize (thanks to the after-prom committee). Additionally, you will increase your chances of winning one of the three ""big"" prizes based on how many locations you visit.

School Material Drive Through Pick-Up - Please read for details.

We will be having a drive through pick up/drop off for school materials on May 26th and 27th. The teachers have your student’s items (including school supplies, clothing left in lockers, etc.) bagged and ready to return to you. We will collect materials (books from classrooms or the media center, textbooks, etc.) that need to be returned to the school at the same time. We ask that you stay in your vehicle and wait for a staff member to come to your vehicle. At that time, we will need your student’s name and homeroom teacher. Please drive west on Kennedy Street from HWY 169 to enter the drive through line (where the busses park in front of the school) and wait for a staff member to greet you at your car.

If your student's last name starts with A-K, we ask that you come on May 26th between 4:00 and 7:00 p.m. to collect and return items.

If your student's last name starts with L-Z, we ask that you come on May 27th between 4:00 and 7:00 p.m. to collect and return items.",0.0,"Lucia Wallace Elementary School

When you ask third grade teacher Sheryl Carroll why she does her job, she has this amazing answer. “I realized, at a very young age, I was born to teach. First, I do this job, because I have a passion for teaching children. I enjoy teaching students to think for themselves and helping them find their own potential; watching their eyes sparkle when they discover they can actually do something they never believed they could. Next, I enjoy going to work each day, because I get to collaborate, problem solve, and laugh with my third grade team. Together, we create fun and exciting ways to motivate our third graders to set and reach goals throughout the year. Last, I get to see my students! We laugh, cry, and have way too much fun together!

This month, our schoolwide theme is emotion management. In our morning announcements we’ll be prompting students to notice their own feelings by paying attention to clues in their bodies, and we’ll be reminding them to use their Second Step skills to calm down:

· Stop—Use your signal

· Name your feeling

· Calm down: Breathe, count, use positive self-talk

These skills help students calm down strong emotions when faced with learning and social challenges, which helps them succeed academically and get along well with others.

Second Step lessons specifically teach about calming down strong emotions such as anger, disappointment, frustration, and anxiety.

Please tell your child’s teacher if you have questions about how you can help your child learn to calm down at home.

“I had a little boy in my class who came from a very hard life. His mother was on drugs and he started off in kindergarten not even knowing a letter from a number. He didn’t know how to spell his name. Didn’t even really know his last name. He started off very low. And, just taking him in and knowing that he needed that love, that extra help.... And, seeing him grow so much. He went from a student that was getting zeros to mastering tests at the end. Just seeing the growth in how much and how far he came, even from a hard life. He was actually so inspiring that I named my little boy after him. He’s one of those kids that I will never forget because the odds were so against him.”

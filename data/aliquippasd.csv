Matzie: More than $1.3 million to fund safety resources for area schools

‚ÄúEnsuring safe schools is an issue that demands constant vigilance, as safety needs change from year to year. Our schools do an excellent job of assessing those needs, which often involve a mix of people-based resources, programs and equipment. Securing this funding is going to give our school districts broad access to these resources so they can provide the safest possible environment.‚Äù

After playing 5 games in 10 days our Quips ran into a very good team in New Brighton and even though we started fast with a homerun from Tyke Hayes scoring Arison Walker to go ahead 2 to 0 to start the game. It was rough going after that New Brighton got going and the pitching settled down and our Quips found hitting hard to come by and the errors came calling on defense. The lions went ahead and never looked back scoring 8 runs in 2 innings before the Quips got a inside the park homerun from James Gilbert to add one more run to close out the Quips scoring at 3. The final score was 11 to 3 before the üåß and üå© stopped the game after 5 innings. Great finish to a long year Great job Quips enjoy the rest of your summer!

I am pleased to announce that Aliquippa School District will receive a nearly $25,000 grant through the Pennsylvania Department of Education‚Äôs competitive Safe Schools Targeted grant program. These funds can be used to purchase safety and security-related equipment and are designed to aid schools in getting the resources they need to create a safe learning environment for students.

It is critical for all local schools to evaluate how we can better protect students and make our school buildings a safe environment for learning, and I applaud all of the local districts over the past year who submitted applications for this program to boost school safety.

When I grow up, I want to be a mechanical engineer. There‚Äôs not a lot of female mechanical engineers, like anywhere, so I really want to be one. My Granny said, ‚ÄòI can see you being an engineer,‚Äô and so can my mom. I think it is important that there are female mechanical engineers so that you can show other little girls you can be something even if there‚Äôs not a lot of girls [doing it already.] Usually you see men as mechanical engineers, you don‚Äôt see women. You can tell little girls, ‚Äòyou can be this too.‚Äô

Aliquippa!!! Did you know that 4 of our high school students are in Washington, D.C. participating in a NATIONAL youth leadership conference focusing on drug and alcohol prevention and advocacy?

Today, Alfred, Tyrese, Kataijah and Christina went to our Nation's Capitol to speak to members of Congress about why the Drug Free Communities grant program and the Drug Free Aliquippa Youth Coalition matter to them. These young leaders are forward thinking and passionate. They want CHANGE for Aliquippa and a BETTER community for their peers. We are so proud of them!!!

Thank you to CADCA for facilitating this opportunity.

I want to start by saying a huge thank you to all that participated in the senior parade. It was awesome! Below you will find an update on Graduation. I‚Äôm trying really hard to have something for the seniors but we have to follow the Health Department and Governor.

The graduation window will be from Thursday 6/25 to Saturday 6/27. Our plan is to give individual diplomas to students in an outdoor setting (hopefully on the new turf field). We have the window to allow for any unfavorable weather. If guidance from the health department changes the individual ceremonies would be moved inside or a possibly larger class group outside. We are waiting until 6/19 to determine final plan based on guidance from Health Department.

In any scenario at this point would not include crowds or spectators. At this point it will be immediate family only.

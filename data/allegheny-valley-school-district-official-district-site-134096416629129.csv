""The English 12 kids created these 'Role on the Wall' assignments. We read the novel “The Things They Carried.” It is a story about the Vietnam War. This assignment asks the kids to make connections with the text by examining internal and external feelings.

Each student selects compelling quotes from the text and the feelings they represent, then depict them on the following slides. This is a popular assignment they look forward to. Usually, we do this with large poster board, Sharpies, and in groups of 5. However, due to the regulations (and the fact this was done before we had a handle on Google Meets) each student was tasked to do this on their own.

The results exceeded my expectations and will change they way the assignment is done in the future.""

Sponsors could support the student for as little as a penny a question to as much as they wanted to support.

The money raised goes to a non-profit organization called Cape Clasp. The group is affiliated with several other organizations that help save the marine life (turtles/ seals/ sharks/ whales) specifically in the Cape Cod area.

Students could purchase a RED heart to support their homeroom or a BLACK heart to sabotage another teacher’s homeroom. Hearts were placed on each teacher’s door at the end of the day by junior high activity club members. The end goal was to have the least black hearts and the most red hearts. The winning homeroom enjoyed a Panera Breakfast.

Half of the proceeds went to Carson’s Hope, a foundation working to find a cure for pediatric cancer. Congratulations to the Ms. McGee's homeroom for winning the challenge...but everyone who participated is a winner to us!

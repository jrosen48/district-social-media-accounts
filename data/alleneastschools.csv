Call to action!

A hospital has reached out to our STEM students. Let’s see if we can use our creativity to help them!

Challenge
The hospital has run out of face shields and need some designs for face shields made out of materials you can find at home. Your challenge is to build a face shield made of materials you can find around your house. This is just a prototype, so if you do not have a clear piece of plastic for the actual ""shield"" part, you can use a piece of plain paper to show where it would be.

Criteria:
-Made out of everyday objects
-Acetate (clear plastic piece) far enough from face that it is not touching your face
-Stays on head without falling off or being held on
-Fits different adult head sizes without being too loose or tight
-Keeps germs/droplets from getting on face
-Washable (no cloth)

Deliverables:
Email Mrs. Burgei (burgeim@alleneastschool.org) a picture or description of your idea

Timeline:
On Friday, I will forward your ideas on. This is BIG. You could save lots of lives with your idea!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2611670672401930&id=1918393901729614,,0.0,"From Mrs. Burgei for STEM students:

We would like to let everyone know that we had a local business man by the name of Roger Steed with Steed Family Properties donate 1,000 Cheeseburger and Small Fry meals to the community !! We are truly blessed and greatful that he has chosen us to do this for him !
This will start tomorrow Wednesday the 1st at 1pm and we will be handing out Free Cheeseburger and Small Fries until they are gone ! No matter if it takes a few days !
We just ask that everyone be safe first and abide by the laws of this shutdown , caused by the Coronavirus .. No more than 10 people in lobby at once and please keep the 6ft rule in mind also . Everyone just have patience and we will get this done !
Thank you Roger for choosing the Burger Hut to show your gratitude... We really appreciate it and will do our best for you ! You are a great Man !!!! Thank you ...

They read the book ""The Snowy Day"" and discussed all the things that Peter did in the snow.

Afterwards, the kids made a snow picture out of fake snow (shaving cream and glue). They were able to create all of the activities that Peter did: draw in the snow, make tracks in the snow, etc. They added a paper Peter cut-out to finish their pictures. The next day, the students did a retelling of the story and completed comprehension activities about the book.

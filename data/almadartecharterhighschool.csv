The Doña Ana Board of County Commissioners has declared April 14, 2020 as CANAAN BOWER DAY OF VALOR!

Canaan (pictured middle with his parents) thwarted an attempted kidnapping in progress on March 25 by pinning the suspect to the ground until a Doña Ana County Sheriff's Department Deputy arrived on the scene.

His act of courage, bravery and heroism has been recognized nationally and our community is stronger for having Canaan in it.

We honor Canaan and his family with this well-deserved proclamation and invite everyone in Doña Ana County to celebrate him today by liking, sharing or commenting on this post. Way to go, Canaan!

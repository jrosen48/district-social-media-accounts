Since the global pandemic began last Spring, Alma del Mar has been committed to providing access for all scholars to participate in remote learning.

Unfortunately, Chromebooks are limited across the entire country right now. We have a very large order coming our way, but they will not be ready for distribution next week as planned. Because of this, we will be prioritizing Chromebook distribution for Kindergarten families next week.

This means we are asking for as many families as possible to use personal devices for the time being if they do not already have Chromebooks. *This is only temporary.*

We are committed to having 1 device per 1 scholar as soon as possible. The issue, right now, is simply availability.

Families who received Chromebooks last spring: Please bring your *charged* devices with you to Orientation so your scholar may be shown how to access remote learning tools.

We could not have predicted how urgent the work of FHF would become only months after its launch.

In the past four weeks, Marie, FHF volunteers and other Alma staff have provided dozens of Alma families in need with everything from infant formula and diapers to paper goods and safe drinking water. They‚Äôve picked up prescription medications for kids and delivered it along with school lunch to home bound parents. They‚Äôve connected families with information on unemployment insurance and other crisis relief services.

Special Education Support for Alma Scholars (Letter) - Alma del Mar Charter Schools",3.0,"""We understand that the extended public health closures present even more complex challenges for all families, particularly those families of scholars with disabilities.

In response to the extended school closure and in line with
updated state and federal guidance, Alma del Mar is shifting from an optional enrichment resource model to a remote learning opportunity model that aims to include, where appropriate and feasible, remote educator-led direct instruction and feedback focused on reinforcing and deepening content knowledge and skills already taught this school year.

As part of this model, and to the extent appropriate, Alma del Mar plans to provide remote educator-led specialized instruction in line with scholars‚Äô individualized special education goals and needs.""

Again this year, we will convert our Cafeteria into an official polling place next Tuesday. This means the Cafeteria will be sectioned off from the rest of the building and closed down from usual daily activities. Scholars will eat breakfast and lunch in their classrooms.

The election commission will supply polling staff, and the city will provide multiple police officers to monitor the polls. As always, Alma scholars will always be supervised by their teachers, and there will be additional supervision throughout the school day.",2019-09-23 12:52:28,,

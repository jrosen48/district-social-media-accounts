If I‚Äôm going into battle, these are the Airedale warriors I want beside me. They serve. They care. Their loyalty is proven over and over. When I was hired as the head volleyball coach for Alma High School, I knew I was embarking on an amazing new opportunity. I had no idea I was also going to be so blessed by new relationships. Relationships that challenge me to be better and work smarter. In a world when so many things are uncertain, I am thankful to work with leaders who are steady. Flexible. Focused.

Thursday night it was made official that I will be teaching and coaching at Pottsville! (YAY!!!! ü§óü§óü§ó) We have prayed for me to get closer to home and now it has been answered! I am so excited for what the future holds but I will say I am going to miss my Airedale family. In my time at Alma I have come to know some pretty incredible people. The coaches and teachers close to me became like family and taught me to be a better person. My athletes taught me just as much or more than I have taught them. I am extremely thankful for them and their support in my next adventure!

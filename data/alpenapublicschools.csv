Early College applicants, we continue to wait on the state for an education budget for the coming school year which means, unfortunately, that we must continue to wait to accept our incoming class. At this late point, there is a strong likelihood that we will begin the program for cohort 7 in January instead of September. I know the waiting is difficult, I feel exactly the same way about it. I'm happy to discuss with anyone that may have questions. Feel free to contact me by phone, email or by message through the early college facebook page.

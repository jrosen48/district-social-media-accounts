Dear parents, students and employees,

Hello from Alpine School District!

Last night, a Two-Hour Delay Advisory was sent out to all parents and employees because of the weather forecast with the potential to impact the morning commute and travel to school on Friday, January 17, 2020. Although the forecasted weather will bring some snow, it has been determined that the two-hour delay will NOT be implemented since the impact during the commute is forecasted to be minimal. School will begin at the normal time.

American Fork High School AP Government Students of Tamara McMurray are here at the Capitol today. I was impressed by all their questions and talked to them about how becoming experts in their own fields, reading the paper, and being involved in the community can help them be informed citizens. I also shared with them what it was like to run for office. They asked about the distracted driver bill and I spoke on the responsibility that Utah citizens have to drive safely without distractions. We talked about Utah’s tax reform with lowering the overall rate by including taxable services. It is good to know that our district’s schools receive good instruction, and that these bright young people are interested in our legislative process. I hope you enjoy the rest of your visit here on the hill. Thank You!

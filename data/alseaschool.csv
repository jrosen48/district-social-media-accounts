The time has come.....FINALLY! We are extremely excited for your children to be returning to our school. Every dedicated professional in our school is grateful for the opportunity to have your kids back with us. We will do all that we can to begin to ""reconnect"" with your child on both a personal and educational level. As you can imagine, there will be a few speed bumps in our attempt to have kids back in person while going an extra mile to keep them safe, healthy, and in line with all precautions that go hand in hand with COVID protocols. Believe me when I say it has not been easy to get to this point.

A special shout out and thank you to Superintendent Marc Thielman and the entire Alsea School District School Board. They have shown leadership and courage to provide this opportunity to return to school and we are thankful.

Without further adieu....

Here is the Secondary schedule as we kick off the year. Yes, it is a bit funky but it honestly can't be helped with the continued alterations and expectations coming from the Oregon Department of Education.

The first two weeks will see all Secondary students (grades 6 - 12) on a modified block schedule. It has us going 3 periods a day for an hour and half each. We will alternate each day with one day having 1/3/5 and the next having 2/4/6.

Periods 1/2 9:00 am to 10:30am
Periods 3/4 11:00 am to 12:30 pm
Periods 5/6 1:00 pm to 2:30 pm

August 24 - August 28
Monday - Technology delivery day. No actual virtual class.
Tuesday - Periods 2, 4, and 6.
Wednesday - Periods 1, 3, 5
Thursday - Periods 2, 4, 6
Friday - Periods 1, 3, 5

August 31 - Sept 4
Monday - Periods 1, 3, 5
Tuesday - Periods 2, 4, 6
Wednesday - Periods 1, 3, 5
Thursday - Periods 2, 4, 6
Friday - Teacher Office hours. Available to all students for help with school work.

Sept 8 - Sept 11
All 6 - 8 students return to Alsea School to resume our regular mode of operation. It is at this point that ALL students grades 6 - 12 return to our normal bell schedule. This means that all 9 - 12 students will now have all 6 periods a day, still virtually. It is likely our 9-12 students would be in virtual class approximately 30 minutes of each period. We understand this will be a tough transition initially for students not used to getting up early for school again, have other things still going on at home, etc. It is what it is.

Sept 21
The day has come!
All 9 - 12 students will join Alsea School in completing our resumption of business as usual with a regular bell schedule and being in our classrooms with their teachers.
This is THE day we are all looking forward to. OUR students....back in OUR classrooms.

As noted above, we will again be delivering both technology, food, etc beginning on Monday, August 24. We will be sending home the Chromebooks, a hard copy of each student's schedule, and some materials from specific classrooms. With that amount of ""moving parts"" there will certainly be a few things that get missed. No worries at all. Please email me directly and we will rectify any issue as soon as possible.

I want to thank each and every family for your ongoing patience, your understanding and flexibility, and most importantly your dedication to your children and their education. While this crazy COVID ride may not be over yet, we will continue to do all that we can to teach your children, provide those special moments that make school a fun experience and memorable, and make decisions that MAKE SENSE.

Please feel free to hit me up with any questions.

Thanks everyone.

Governor Brown recently made another round of changes to the guidance affecting school reopening. Specifically, she eased restrictions on in-person instruction for small/remote/rural schools and Districts. The Alsea School District qualifies under these new metrics for reopening, however, we are unable to shift resources back towards in person instruction for all grades by Monday, August 24th. The bright side is we have created a ""Running Start Plan"" intended to get our entire school open as safely and quickly as possible. The plan is to open in phases:

Phase 1: The Alsea School District will be open to provide in-person instruction for grades K-5 on Monday, August 24th. Grades 6-12 will begin the school year on Comprehensive Distance Learning (CDL).

Phase 2: The Alsea School District will be opening up grades 6-8 for in-person instruction on Tuesday September 8th. With grades 9-12 continuing in CDL.

Phase 3: The Alsea School District will be opening up grades 9-12 for in-person instruction on Monday, September 21st (potentially sooner if our Desk dividers get manufactured and delivered ahead of schedule).

This means we will be fully open for grades K-12 for in-person instruction by September 21st. I want to apologize to all of you for the stress, confusion, and difficulties a running start will cause, but under the circumstance I believe it is the prudent approach. We are implementing a lot of restrictions and safe-gaurds that will take some time to get used to, and adjustments and tweaks will be inevitable.

More information will follow next week regarding chromebook, supply,and food services deliveries for students beginning under CDL.

The Alsea School District thanks all of our school community for showing so much patience and understanding during this time.

Here we go again! As many of you may have heard Governor Brown and the Oregon Health Authority have released new ""health metrics to guide school reopenings."" These metrics are extremely restrictive compared to any prior guidance and have been implemented in response to increased COVID infection rates statewide.

Prior guidance allowed schools to open on a county-by-county basis. The new metrics have applied restrictions on county-based school reopenings to no more than 10 cases per 100,000 for seven days. In addition, if the COVID test positivity rates exceed 5% in any county and/or statewide as a whole, all state schools must close with some exceptions.

As for Alsea, the exception means that we WILL be able to operate grades K-3 in person with safeguards in place. The safe-guards are extensive as the Governor is also mandating face coverings be worn by students all day. Anyone who has worked with or raised small children knows that this will be a challenge. The good news is we will be providing face covering options as well as providing work space isolation shielding for each student. This will allow students to remove their mask/shield while working at their station IF they need to.

In addition, we are dedicating two full time classified staff to do ongoing ""crash"" cleaning and disinfecting during the school day with nightly deep cleaning and sanitizing to be performed at night. Directional controls, social distancing, and frequent hand washing and sanitizing are also part of the plan. Finally, all staff will be using PPE at all times as well as isolation shielding when appropriate. Our goal is to keep our students and staff safe, while providing a first class education to kids, and full service support for our staff and families.

Grades 4-12:

As per the newly implemented metrics, students in grades 4-12 will begin the school year in Comprehensive Distance Learning. As was the case last Spring, all students will be provided with technology, supplies, food service, and internet access (if needed). More details about scheduling, attendance, grading and student support services will be coming soon.

For Parents, this situation is difficult to navigate, but it is nothing short of devastating for so many of our students! Please know that the Alsea School District School Board, Administration, and Staff are here to support you and your student(s) regardless of the ever changing circumstances we are dealt.

If you have any questions, need to vent, or wish to explore some of the fulltime online options we provide feel free to call me personally on my cell at (509)-220-5313, or respond directly to this email.

I would be remiss if I did not end this update with a quote from Governor Brown who opined in her press briefing yesterday, "" EVERYTHING I have just shared with you is subject to change.🙂"" Go Wolverines!!!

Here we go again! As many of you may have heard Governor Brown and the Oregon Health Authority have released new ""health metrics to guide school reopenings."" These metrics are extremely restrictive compared to any prior guidance and have been implemented in response to increased COVID infection rates statewide.

Prior guidance allowed schools to open on a county-by-county basis. The new metrics have applied restrictions on county-based school reopenings to no more than 10 cases per 100,000 for seven days. In addition, if the COVID test positivity rates exceed 5% in any county and/or statewide as a whole, all state schools must close with some exceptions.

As for Alsea, the exception means that we WILL be able to operate grades K-3 in person with safeguards in place.

22,12.0,,20.0,,3245476152205812,"Dear Parents, Community and Staff,

I wanted to communicate a change to our August start date for the 2020-2021 school year. Originally, we planned to start the school year on August 17th, but due to a series of logistical circumstances our starting date will be delayed one week.

The new starting date for the first day of School will be Monday, August 24th, 2020. I apologize for any confusion this may cause.

Speaking of confusion, many parents have inquired as to what kind of operating model we will be under on the 24th. Unlike many of our neighboring districts we are blessed to be able to operate on a full school schedule for grades K-12.

This means we will be having school like normal with a series of COVID based safety protocols/procedures in place. More information will be coming soon on the details of the Alsea Reopening Plan. A couple of preview details are a follows:

We will be taking temperatures of all students, staff, and visitors as they enter the building, as well as all staff will be using appropriate personal protective equipment and every classroom will have both hand washing and/or sanitizing stations. The reopening plan is very comprehensive and hopefully user friendly. Now on to the most commonly asked question.

The most commonly asked question is : ""Will students be required to wear MASKS?"" The Alsea School District will not be requiring students to wear masks, however, we will make them available to any student who wants or needs one. Students may be encouraged, but not required, to wear a mask during passing times and during specific activities as needed to meet the recommendations of the Oregon Health Authority (OHA), and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) when adequate distancing is not as likely.

Naturally, we are doing everything in our power to keep students and staff safe while allowing school to run as normally as possible under the current circumstances. I hope this update helps all our students and families with their planning for this fall.

We will also be offering comprehensive distance learning online options for students K-12 if you prefer that delivery model for your student(s).

Let us know if you have any questions/requests. We are very excited about the upcoming school year, as we will be welcoming many new faces to our school community.

I just wanted to reach out to all Alsea High School graduating Seniors for the Class of 2020 and their parents alike. Obviously this has been a different end to this Senior year than any before us has ever experienced. To say it has been unique, stressful, confusing, frustrating, and a bit of a let down with a few shining moments would be an obvious understatement. Yet somehow for this particular class having something unique is SOOOO them.

All that said, this IS an amazing group of Seniors who will be getting their due on both Thursday and Friday this week. So let's talk about both:

Senior Banquet: Thursday, June 4 beginning at 6 pm in the Alsea High School gymnasium. Mr. Roberts and his crew of Juniors will be putting on the banquet as is tradition and we are incredibly excited to have it. There will be a Senior slideshow, Athletic Awards, there will be some fun messages coming from the Junior class to our Seniors, a few more stories shared, and of course some good food. We hope to also record this event so it may be available for others to watch later on. Please remember that each Senior is allowed to bring both parents but that is it. We have to continue to play the game with our head-count to keep our get together both legal and safe for all who participate.

Senior Class and Parent Meeting: Thursday, June 4 at 5 pm in the Alsea High School gymnasium. Yes, this will be one hour before our Senior Banquet starts. I want to meet with all of our graduating class and their parents to rehearse how the ceremony will go, where to be and when, answer any and all questions prior to the graduation, and allow everyone to just enjoy the day with what is hopefully a lower stress level.

Graduation Day: Friday, June 5 beginning at 7 pm in the Alsea High School gymnasium. I would like to have our Seniors in the building no later than 6:30 pm. Families will begin to assemble outside of the school at those same times. Superintendent Marc Thielman and Board Member Aaron Schneider will oversee this proceeding. Teacher David Crowe will be our Commencement Speaker and will have some words of wisdom for sure. We can also expect something pretty witty from Senior speaker Lewis Bourne. The entire proceeding will be streaming live beginning at 7 pm. Mr. Roberts will send out the link that day to all families so please make sure you pass it on to anyone who wants to watch/attend the ceremony. Please remember, once again, that to stay legal and safe with our graduation ceremony we MUST stick to our rule of only allowing each graduating Senior to bring a total of 8 family members or friends with them. It is critical that we adhere to this number. Unfortunately this does mean that our community, teachers, friends and others will not be allowed to enter the building during the ceremony. This will in NO WAY keep us from having a first class celebration for those deserving Seniors!

Final Notes: again, Mr. Roberts will send out the link for the live streaming of the graduation ceremony. We will also be recording the production in case anyone missed it and wants to see it later. As is tradition, there will be a 'Senior Bag' available here on site for any community members who wish to send these deserving graduates a gift, card, or other well wishes. The Senior Bags will be available in the covered play shed on tables during this ceremony. We will also have a professional photographer on site to take pictures of the entire graduation day festivity.

I hope this email finds you all excited for these moments and that you are able to enjoy this milestone with your graduate, family and friends.

Go Blue!

As many of you know we finally received updated guidance from the Oregon Department of Education last night. As of today all school districts have been directed to move to a ""Distance Learning for All"" program. This change allows all students to receive schooling online and/or packets FOR CREDIT by April 13th.

The Alsea School District is well equipped to facilitate this new directive. More detailed information will follow in the very near future. In the meantime we are gearing up for tomorrow's Meal and Supply delivery debut. The school is looking a bit like a UPS Warehouse:) Please be patient with us as we have had more curve balls thrown regarding food preparation. We will begin preparation at 9:00 am making well over 400 meals! This means we will be looking at staggering our delivery times. Carmen is planning on sending the first van out to the farthest locations which are Monroe, Junction City, Eugene/Bethel and Triangle Lake first. It should embark around 9:45 am.. The next route will be Philomath/Corvallis which will have two main drop stops: The first at True Value Hardware in Philomath at 10:45, and the second at the Fair Grounds at 11:00. Please allow fifteen minutes of leeway for ETA. Finally, the Local/Lobster routes will leave last starting around 11 am and will be door to door service.

This is our first go with something that is definitely outside of our normal purview so Grace and Patience are very appreciated! We do ask that social distancing restrictions be practiced during delivery with items being placed on porches or in cars rather than handing person to person.

Finally, we will be delivering Chromebooks to most of our students tomorrow with some more to follow. We are getting a new shipment of Chromebooks and will be assigning them to many of our older students who have the older models. If your student does not get their Chromebook don't worry, because it is on the way. Our goal is to get every student their own computer device as a means of maximizing access to teacher driven content.

I wish to thank Carmen, Chris, Shirley and all the teachers for helping with getting everything organized and put together for tomorrow's grand delivery experiment. As a parcel service we make really good educators :)

Stay Well and Go Wolverines!

Sincerely,

Marc Thielman

This is our first go with something that is definitely outside of our normal purview so Grace and Patience are very appreciated! We do ask that social distancing restrictions be practiced during delivery with items being placed on porches or in cars rather than handing person to person.

Finally, we will be delivering Chromebooks to most of our students tomorrow with some more to follow. We are getting a new shipment of Chromebooks and will be assigning them to many of our older students who have the older models. If your student does not get their Chromebook don't worry, because it is on the way. Our goal is to get every student their own computer device as a means of maximizing access to teacher driven content.

I wish to thank Carmen, Chris, Shirley and all the teachers for helping with getting everything organized and put together for tomorrow's grand delivery experiment. As a parcel service we make really good educators :)

Stay Well and Go Wolverines!

Sincerely,

Marc Thielman

As mentioned in my previous email, the play structure facility is closed to the public as per Governor Brown's latest Executive Order. The Track area is still open for public use during daytime hours. Please practice social distancing rules when using the track.

In addition, we have several families who do not currently have internet service at their home. If this applies to you, please let me know by replying to this email. We will help you access the many new service options being created to get all families connected (many for free). The Alsea School District will help you get connected with a service provider, if needed,and we will work to get the set up fee covered/waived if possible.

Below my signature are some links and program options you can access.

Please stay close to your email as we move forward. More to come.

As you all know we are faced with a very difficult and unique circumstance surrounding the COVID-19 school closures and continuing restrictions. Last week I updated you on the Governor's Executive Order effectively closing school until April 28th. Today, Governor Brown has expanded restrictions to effectively require all citizens to ""Stay Home, Save Lives."" This order created a flurry of questions from all stakeholders. What does this mean for our School District? For the most part, this does not alter the current order for schools. We will continue to be responsible for:

· Delivering supplemental education and learning supports to students to the extent practical through independent study and other appropriate options;
· Providing school meals;
· Providing for supplemental services and emergency management services, including but not limited to, the provision of child care for first responders, emergency workers, health care professionals, and other individuals; and
· Continuing to regularly pay all employees of public schools. A public school subject to this Executive Order may require school employees to report to work to assist with the provision of supplemental services and emergency management activities.

***One change is all play structures/areas will be closed to the public beginning Tuesday, March 24th.

This morning the Alsea Administrative team met to further our implementation of supplemental supports for students, and for the provision of nutrition services. We will be sending out a series of updates this week and I am asking everyone to keep an eye on their email moving forward.

We greatly value information and communication during this evolving crisis and ask that everyone remain flexible, as many of these ongoing changes are outside of our direct control.

Fortunately, students in Alsea recently completed our 3rd Quarter of course work, and have the added benefit of a long Spring Break that has helped our team prepare for, and put in place, a variety of supports.

Our community, our state, and much of the world are now dealing with an unprecedented public health crisis. Today, Governor Kate Brown issued an Executive Order extending the closure of all public schools through April 28th.

Governor Brown’s order will ensure that schools continue to receive funding during this closure so that employees will not be laid off and vital services, including meals for students, can continue.

In our district, we will work to make the following resources/services available during the extended closure. Services will begin following our regularly scheduled Spring Break to include:

- Supplemental educational services: online, independent study, and offline options

- Nutrition Services including meal delivery if needed.

- Daycare services for designated first responders, emergency, and health care workers.

Schools are essential to communities. We know that the Governor’s executive order extending the school closure will cause difficulties for many families who rely on their schools for meals, quality education, and a safe place for kids to be during the day. Since the COVID-19 coronavirus first emerged in Oregon, we have followed the guidance of public health agencies, including the Oregon Health Authority and Oregon Department of Education, in taking preventative steps to make our staff and students safe.

We encourage all our families to make every effort to follow published health-related guidelines such as regular handwashing and social distancing. The purpose of these actions is to slow the transmission rate of the virus within levels the health care system can safely accommodate. This is best accomplished by everyone working together.

We are in uncharted waters, but please know that the Alsea School District , in collaboration with local and state authorities, is doing its best to support our broader community as the reality of this unprecedented crisis continues to evolve.

To the Alsea School District Community:
With the number of confirmed COVID-19 coronavirus cases in Oregon increasing, new guidance was issued regarding group gatherings and social distancing. As we head into spring break, we have decided to proactively begin suspending events that bring large groups of students, adults, and community members together.
Suspension of non-essential activities is to continue through March 31st at this time, in respect to orders by Governor Brown. At this time, we anticipate returning to school April 1st and are still planning to host school conferences on April 2nd and 3rd. We will follow guidance from OSAA regarding athletics and update the district website as we receive further guidance. http://alsea.k12.or.us/
To be clear, we are taking every step possible so that we can continue to provide high quality education for all of our students and keep our school open.
The safety, health, and well-being of our students and staff is our highest priority. We will continue to work in close partnership with public health authorities to minimize both the spread of COVID-19 and disruption to schools and students. We will continue emphasizing the importance of handwashing at school. Our custodial staff will perform a thorough deep cleaning over the break and will continue to prioritize hightouch surfaces when we return.
Students, families, and everyone in our community can best support our efforts by washing hands frequently, covering mouths when coughing or sneezing, avoiding those who are sick and using hand sanitizer. Those experiencing symptoms of the cold or flu should stay at home, only returning to school or work when symptom-free for 24 hours. If you are concerned about symptoms, please consult with a doctor.
Thank you for your cooperation and understanding during this difficult time. Please see the following links regarding COVID-19 for more information.

We will continue to work in close partnership with public health authorities to minimize both the spread of COVID-19 and disruption to schools and students. We will continue emphasizing the importance of handwashing at school. Our custodial staff will perform a thorough deep cleaning over the break and will continue to prioritize hightouch surfaces when we return.
Students, families, and everyone in our community can best support our efforts by washing hands frequently, covering mouths when coughing or sneezing, avoiding those who are sick and using hand sanitizer. Those experiencing symptoms of the cold or flu should stay at home, only returning to school or work when symptom-free for 24 hours. If you are concerned about symptoms, please consult with a doctor.
Thank you for your cooperation and understanding during this difficult time. Please see the following links regarding COVID-19 for more information.

He remembers how flat and lifeless the community felt and how many of his friends got into trouble once they didn’t have the daily structure and routine of the sport.

“That’s the bad part — they had nothing to do,” Elbers said. “They started making less intelligent decisions.”

Even with the school fielding a football program for the first time in two years, Elbers still knows how painfully close he is to losing the sport he loves, again. That’s why he spends many of his days going from classroom to classroom, making sure his teammates are where they are supposed to be. Because if they don’t go to school, they can’t practice. And if they don’t practice, they can’t play. And if they don’t play, he and the Wolverines might find themselves in the same situation they were in on homecoming night in early October.

We found ourselves with mountain of clothes, shoes and miscellaneous items at the end of last school year that were not claimed after reminders to parents and students to go through them. Shirley graciously took them all home over the summer and washed and folded them.

Typically, unclaimed lost and found items are donated to charitable organizations in Corvallis. Due to the sheer volume of unclaimed items, we feel like we should try one more time to get these items returned to their rightful owners.

We will have all the clothes etc. available for you and/or your children to look through tomorrow morning. Please do not ask us to look for a specific item for you - you must come claim your items in person.

Starting Tuesday all unclaimed items will be available for anyone who can use them. At the end of the week, they will be taken to Corvallis and donated.

In addition to the lost and found items, we have old Alsea sportswear of new and vintage styles to pick through. A donation jar will accompany these items. You do not have to donate to take items, but any funds we raise will go to the Alsea School Student body. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns you can call and ask to talk to Shirley.

Carmen, our transportation supervisor, also wanted to personally welcome your students.

Bus schedules are the same as at the end of the school year but will be subject to change depending the needs of our students and our continuing growth. If you have any questions about transportation you may send an e-mail to Carmen at carmen.martin@alsea.k12.or.us.

Lastly, all Middle and High School students should meet in the gym upon arrival tomorrow.

Elementary students should go directly to their classrooms and then their teacher will take them down to breakfast.

Look forward to seeing you all bright and early!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1887305334689574&id=726215407465245,,0.0,"We cant wait to welcome all our families and children back to Alsea School tomorrow morning!

Please let us know if you are interested in riding the rooter bus. Seats are on a first come, first served basis with students receiving priority.

Grades K - 5 must be accompanied by an parent/guardian.
Grades 6 - 8 must be accompanied by an parent/guardian or older siblings if given permission by a parent/guardian.

DON'T FORGET
We will be dismissing all students at NOON on Friday in order to facilitate a strong show of support for our state playoff bound High School Basketball team.

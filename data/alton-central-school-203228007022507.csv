We currently have an early release day scheduled for Wednesday, February 13th.

However, winter weather has been predicted and we have had enough interruptions!

Here are three possible scenarios for the “iffy” weather situation for Wednesday:

1. IF the meteorologists are completely wrong and this whole mess goes out to sea….we will have an early release as planned.
2. IF we get hit with snow but roads are cleared in time for a delayed opening, we will welcome students at 9:30 and finish the day at our regular time of 2:50. This means we would not have an early release day, just a delayed opening.
3. IF the roads are NOT cleared, then school will be closed.

Regardless - We will update you on Wednesday morning with the official closing status but wanted to give you a heads up to plan accordingly.

Unfortunately we cannot change the weather, but also want to be sure that we are not in school all the way until July…. Yes, we still love New England...

The School Board is aware of questions that have arisen regarding the 2018 school tax rate. Although 33 cents less than 3 years ago and 5 cents less than two years ago, the comparative rate to 2017 was difficult to understand.

In 2017 the school tax rate decreased substantially compared to prior years because the below events had impact in same year:
1. Lower budget/warrants
2. Offset due to significant return of funds to Town from prior year budget savings
3. $135 million increase in valuation compared to previous years

Therefore, while the 2018 rate is reduced compared with 2015 and 2016, the dip in the tax rate and savings to taxpayers in 2017 was an anomaly.

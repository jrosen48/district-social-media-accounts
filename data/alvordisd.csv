Alvord ISD Family:

We received a report of an incident at the bus stop near the Methodist Church this morning. An unknown female reportedly approached two students before the bus arrived. The students were not harmed, the parent of the students has been contacted and is aware of the situation.

This incident has been reported to the Wise County Sheriff’s Department, law enforcement and staff will be monitoring our bus stops. Thankfully the students reported the incident to a staff member, allowing us to investigate and address the issue. This serves as a reminder that we all need to be situationally aware at all times, parents may want to remind students to always be aware of their surroundings and to tell someone when something doesn’t seem right.

The Texas Education Agency (TEA) confirmed today that we are allowed to have an in person, outdoor graduation as long as the local public health situation allows. Backup dates will be announced in case the number of active COVID-19 cases in Wise County changes the status of the approval from TEA.

The number of guests allowed to attend must be limited according to the size of the outdoor venue where the graduation is held. We could have the graduation ceremony at Bulldog Stadium on May 22. We could also have the graduation ceremony at a larger, nearby venue to allow more guests to attend. The graduating seniors will be sent a survey to determine the preferred location and date for the ceremony. The starting time for the ceremony and details including the plan to meet social distancing requirements will be available soon.

Nicotine is highly addictive and can harm brain development which continues until age 25. In addition to nicotine, some cartridges contain marijuana which often comes in the form of concentrated cannabis, synthetic cannabis or wax. The liquid or “juice” comes in over 7,000 flavors with names that cater to the younger generation. The flavors mask the harsh taste of tobacco which makes it easier for kids to smoke.

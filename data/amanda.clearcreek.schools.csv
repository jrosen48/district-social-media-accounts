A-C is pleased to be able to conduct our athletic events in light of this year's unique circumstances. This year, we are thankful that - due to the levy passing - our pay-to-play fees have been reduced from $175 to $100 for our students.

In order to continue the sports season, we need all students, athletes, families and the community to help keep A-C sporting events safe.

We would like to remind our spectators that COVID-19 guidelines must be followed at all times during sporting events. This includes adhering to social distancing and wearing a face covering at all times. These protocols were put in place by the Ohio Department of Health to allow us to safely have a fall sports season, and we'd like to see that continue. Our student athletes, coaches and administration appreciate your cooperation, which ultimately allows our young athletes to participate in this sporting event.

We are very excited to announce that the Amanda-Clearcreek School District has partnered with FinalForms, an online forms and data management service that will be replacing paper forms. FinalForms allows you to complete and sign back-to-school and athletic participation forms for your students. The most exciting news is that FinalForms saves data from season-to-season and year-to-year, meaning that you will never need to enter the same information twice! FinalForms also pre-populates information wherever possible, for each of your students, saving you time.

Dear Parents and/or Guardians,

As our trial week for online learning approaches, I want to provide everyone information about what you and your family can expect during that week.

What were teachers asked to create?
1. One week of lessons via an online learning format (May 4th - May 8th).
2. Assign no more than 2 hours of daily learning activities.
3. Provide videos of teaching activities that the students would get on a typical day in a classroom.

What do we expect from the students/families?
1. Complete each day's activities.
2. Watch the videos all the way through. Each video is valuable and important.
3. Stay in contact with the teacher.
4. Complete the learning, at your family's convenience, (does not have to be done during school hours).

How will it be communicated to you?
1. On Sunday, your child’s teacher will provide you with the week's learning activities via Google Classroom.
2. Contact your teacher if you are not sure how to access your child’s Google Classroom.

Why are we doing a trial run for online learning?
We do not know what the future holds in regard to the impact of COVID-19. If we are not able to return to school in the fall, we want to be prepared. This trial week will afford us the opportunity to experience an online learning platform and evaluate the process. We will ask for your feedback after our trial run has finished.

What if you can’t access the learning?
Please contact your child’s teacher for directions.

We appreciate all the time and effort you have put into helping your child. We definitely could not have done this without each and everyone of you. We appreciate all of your efforts!

Sincerely, Mrs. Libby Wills
Amanda-Clearcreek Elementary Principal

Per Governor DeWine’s orders, all K-12 schools will be shut down for three weeks beginning Monday, March 16, 2020 due to the increasing presence of the “Coronavirus” or COVID-19. Since the K-2 Grandparent’s Day lunch and program scheduled for Friday, March 27th falls within those three weeks, it is cancelled. This event will NOT be rescheduled. It takes weeks to organize large events like Grandparent’s Day and the process would have to start over once school resumes on April 6.

If you have already paid for lunch(es), that money will be placed on your student’s lunch account. It will be placed on your student’s lunch account for school auditing purposes. Students who do not normally purchase school lunch or are on the free lunch program can purchase “extras” during lunch. They can spend the credited money on extras such as a banana, orange, apple, yogurt, cheese stick, ice cream and other items. Thank you for your understanding during this chaotic time.

By: Elaina Van Gundy

We are learning how our nation was settling after the war and what the Native Americans tried to do to get us off of their land. We are often assigned an article to read and summarize along with a set of questions to answer and share with the rest of the group. At the beginning of class, we will usually play a game of Quizizz or Kahoot to help study for the bell ringer or a test. We learn how America is a powerful and growing country, how the people in the government are trying to stay constitutional, and are arguing on what they should do in certain situations. We have finished up talking about the Jacksonian Democracy and are continuing the lesson into next month. I’ve personally liked the review games we have been playing because it helps tremendously with an upcoming test, quiz, or bellringer along with getting a better understanding of the lesson.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2469027023415018&id=1472912469693150,,0.0,"What We Learned in November

By: Libby Giammarino

In the month of October, the social studies class has learned about modules 6 and 7 in our book. We have done a Be - Washington, which is a scenario theatre online; we got to step into the boots of George Washington to understand what he was facing during the Revolutionary War and as our first president; we were able to look at multiple views from very important people on decisions George Washington should consider to make people happy. When we were learning about module 6, we did a Bill of Rights illustration, where we wrote each Bill of Rights law in a square, then drew a picture of each one in a box. We also had to cut out a piece of newspaper and glue it on the bottom of the paper to represent one of the bills in the Bill of Rights. Furthermore, module 6 was mainly about the Bill of Rights and our constitution; in module 7, we learned about our launching to the nation and how it exactly happened. All in all, our social studies class has been fun, and we have learned so much in just one month.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2469025250081862&id=1472912469693150,,0.0,"Social Studies Month of October

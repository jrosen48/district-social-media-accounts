Did you know Tascosa‚Äôs Athletic Coordinator and Head Coach Kenneth Plunk was also in a movie?? Coach Plunk had a small part in the movie Friday Night Lights. Coach Plunk played himself- Coach Plunk (he was coaching at Permian when the movie was filmed). That part of the filming took about 9 days in Odessa and Ratliff stadium over spring break in 2003. At first he was offered $20 an hour to chaperone, then changed to $100 an hour when offered a part in the movie. Coach Plunk even had a speaking line in the movie üé• üçø
So the next time you watch the movie Friday Night Lights, see if you can spot Coach Plunk üëÄ üèà

Amarillo ISD is proud to congratulate 77 retirees representing 1,645 years of service in education! Special clocks recognizing their service were hand delivered to them. Had it been a typical year, they would have been honored at AISD's annual employee banquet. The theme this year would have been Ar√™te. This is a Greek word which means excellence, valor and virtue. For many years this group has shown excellence, valor and virtue in serving AISD and providing the highest level of success to our students.

This message from Chris Tatum, AISD Executive Director of Human Resources accompanied each delivery: ""I want to thank you for allowing us to honor you differently this year by hand delivering your retirement gift. Most of all, I want to thank you for your service and dedication to Amarillo ISD and for making sure that each student graduates prepared for life and success beyond high school. I wish each of you Kalyteros Efches (good luck and future blessings) and bid you Adio (goodbye).""",0.0,"Amarillo ISD added 35 new photos.

5th Grade Highest Tower Competition
The 5th grade students participated in the Highest Tower Competition last week. The students were asked to build a tower using the supplies that they had at home. Just like the Empire State Building was the result of a competition to build the tallest building. Our students gathered supplies and constructed their tallest towers. The pictures are from the top three towers from each class. Thank you to all who participated.

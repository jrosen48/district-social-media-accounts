We understand the challenges you may be facing with the current closure of schools. Faculty and staff members at Ambassadors Preparatory Academy are working very hard to protect the health and safety of our students, employees, and community.

One of our main goals is to provide learning alternatives to keep students on track with their education. This week our teachers and staff are developing instructional continuation and educational resources that students and parents can access at home.

Many of our teachers are beginning to implement online learning with their students. Starting Monday, March 23, 2020 all students will begin instructional continuation from the home until we return to regular school hours.

Parents, your students’ teachers will be communicating with you on the specific lesson plans, resources and schedules. Please stay in contact with teachers for updates on school work.

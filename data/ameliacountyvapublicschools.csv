Thank you to all of you who have signed up for the Boosterthon and those who have received pledges. We have raised more $13,000.00 for our special projects!! The Fun Run is tomorrow, so today is the last day to get pledges!! If we make our $15,000.00 goal, Mr. Cummins will be made into a human sundae! Also, the student from each class with the most money earned will get to throw water balloons at Mr. Cummins and Mrs. Bouchard!

We are aware that there are many students who are out due to illness. According to Boosterthon, students who are absent for the run will be assigned 30 laps. We will have a student or teacher run in his/her place.

We have limited space in the gym, so parents are not allowed to attend the fun run. However, we will use Facebook to go live and to post lots of photos so you can see your child run.

Please help our school by getting pledges from family and friends and entering them on FUNRUN.COM. Thank you for your support!

It was an awesome event! A special thank you to our guest readers: Taylor Harvie, Glen Wilkerson, Sheriff Walker, and Dr. Reasoner. Also, we would like to thank our RISE team for planning the event and our ACES teachers for running the stations. We are very lucky to have so many people who care about our ACES students!

Here are just a few pics and I‚Äôll try to post more this weekend!",2019-09-20 19:56:42,,

We appreciate your patience as we work to improve all dismissal procedures.

Here are a few reminders for tomorrow to help us get students to the appropriate location quickly and safely:

1. We must have a note for any students who are not riding the bus to their home address. The note must include the drop off address and a phone number in case we have questions.

2. For long term changes, we must have a note on file for the location and duration of the change.

3. There were many car dismissal students today. We will monitor that and may make changes in order to speed up the process.

Thank you for understanding. We hope you all have a great night.

I hope those super tigers are getting to bed because tomorrow is the big day!

Here a few reminders for tomorrow:

1. Parents/guardians are allowed to walk students to their class tomorrow only.

2. Car dismissal will take place in the front lobby.

Prek - 2:55pm

The big day is finally here!! Tomorrow is FUN RUN Day! All day long, students will be coming down to the gym to run their laps with their resource classes. Please make sure all students have proper athletic footwear for running. We will make sure to post many pictures and videos so you all can see your kids in action!

At this point, we have raised over $25,000 for the ACES playground!!! We are no longer accepting pledges per lap, however we will still accept flat donations through Thursday, February 7.

The fun isn't over! Prizes are still being handed out and classes have been celebrating with classroom incentives all week. Mr. Cummins and Mrs. Ramey will be getting slimed in front of the whole school on Tuesday, February 5. Once all donations have been accepted, we will announce the students who get to silly string Mr. Cummins and Mrs. Ramey.

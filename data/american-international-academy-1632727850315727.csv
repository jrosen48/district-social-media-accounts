Good morning AIA Families:
We just want to remind families of AIA's exciting Summer Learning Backpack Program. Due to the COVID- 19, the district has decided to create a learning backpack for our students to practice skills that they need to maintain and practice for transition into the next school year.

This is not a traditional summer school program and students will have a backpack that they will use to engage in independent learning opportunities. We will have videos that will be made available about the materials in the Backpacks and you may contact the school if you have any questions.

AIA staff will begin delivering Summer Learning Backpacks to the homes of current AIA (K-5 ) students Tuesday, July 21st. Please be on the look out for an AIA bus in your neighborhood today.

Stay Safe, Stay Healthy, Keep Learning!

We miss you all

We are excited to offer an opportunity for you to purchase coverage for the Chromebook that your student will be checking out this year. This plan includes extensive coverage for your child's device at a great rate. In order to expedite coverage you can print and sign the attached document and send money with your student this week. Please send in a sealed envelope and have students give the envelope to their teacher. If your family qualifies for the free and reduced lunch program this insurance will be covered by the school. If this cost puts your family in financial hardship, please communicate with your child's principal. If insurance is not purchased you may be responsible to cover the cost of repair or replacement of the device. If you have questions please call the school or email admin@ahcspatriots.us.

As I think about Kaylee as a student, a person, and what her future entails, there are many words that come to mind: funny, smart, capable, focused, and endearing. Kaylee is such an incredible student, and an even better human being. These words are attributes that will carry her to do great things. In today's world, so many are afraid to be themselves. They get stuck in comparison, locked into social media and seeing what others are, have become, and showcase, most of them being fake. Kaylee breaks that mold. She owns who she is and she doesn't look back. Due to this, Kaylee will create a future for herself that propels her farther than most. She has empathy for those who struggle and she is able to use that empathy to better herself. As we move forward as a school, we are truly proud to call Kaylee Dalton a graduate.

SOMETHING TO DO:

Chapter 1 - You Could Grow Your Own edible Sprouts. Buy or make your own sprouter and get cute seeds (alfafa, mung bean, clover, broccoli, radish for example) for edible sprouting. Sprouts are highly nutritious food and delicious in a salad or on a sandwich. If you carefully grow your own sprouts, you won't have to worry about getting sick or product recalls because of contamination. #knowwhereyourfoodcomesfrom Sprouter and seeds can be easily obtained on Amazon. Google ""grow your own sprouts"" for oodles of information and instructions.
Word of caution...Make sure you don't grow too many sprouts, or you will need to find some creative way to eat them. This may inadvertently create more work. For example: The excessive amount of mung bean sprouts that we made forced us to learn how to make Chinese food, a vegetable stir fry in order to use up the bean sprouts. It was delicious!

The Idaho State Board of Education has directed all public school districts and charter schools to immediately implement a “soft closure” of all classroom facilities through Monday, April 20, 2020.

At the conclusion of Spring break this week, AHCS will continue with virtual delivery of classes K-12 through Monday April 20, 2020.

Thank you for your patience as we “Do what has to be done.” Thank you also to our wonderful teachers and administrators who are doing all they can to deliver a quality education to our young patriots.

Thank you for your support as we adjust to social distancing as advised by the CDC. We are receiving great feedback from our AHCS families and we appreciate your efforts to help us continue your child’s education as best we can. Our teachers, our parents, and our students have had to make big adjustments as we follow our Cowboy Ethics principles!

As District 91 has now called off school until April 3rd, (and we share transportation) American Heritage will be doing the same. We have spring break starting tomorrow and going through next week. Then we will start up virtual classes again March 30th through April 3rd.

There is strong evidence that the virtual education for us could continue beyond that time but we hope things will improve and we can all get back to school!

Stay safe and stay in touch.

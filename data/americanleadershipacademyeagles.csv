There are days each year that cause us all to stop and take inventory of our lives and what is really important to each of us. For many of us September 11 is one of those day’s. 19 years ago on that day the world was changed and for many of us time stopped as we contemplate the magnitude and significance of what was happening. America was under attack and our countrymen and women were being killed on American soil. This stark realization unified our country and the people and now September 11 is known as Patriot Day to remember the citizens who acted with bravery and honor while under attack and to remember the Heroic acts by first responders who ran in to harms way to save those who could not run away from the harm. Today we remember and pause and take stock of the freedom that we still have, and to remember the words “In God We Trust”!

Should you have a 5th grader through 12th grader that would be interested in trying out for one of our three show choirs at ALA: Tyros (Elementary), InPulse (Junior High) and Evolution (High School), the audition will be FRIDAY, JULY 31st in the Jr. High Auditorium, from 8am-9am.

Audition Expectations:
1. Prepare 30 seconds to 1 minute of an uptempo Pop or Broadway Song.
2. Prepare 30 seconds to 1 minute of a slow, heartfelt ballad (We would like these pieces to show contrast).
3. Be prepared to learn a short choreographed sequence that you will be judged on.

Thank you and we are looking forward to your auditions!

If interested in auditioning for a show choir, please email:

Words cannot express how grateful I am for all of you. You guys are outstanding! Thank you for always being willing to go the extra mile for me and our wonderful school. My lunch crew is always ready and willing to try out all of my new ideas, and together we have created miracles. We have spent endless hours together making food for our ALA students and their siblings. We went to great effort to make sure that all of our students felt loved during these times away from school.
I could not run the lunch program without them.
It has been so wonderful to see all of the ways that our school lunches have helped our families.
Thank you again to our ALA families for all of your love and support to our lunch program, and our lunch crew.
We have loved all of the cards, pictures, notes, treats and flowers, home videos and signs from students hanging out their car windows.
It was wonderful!!!!!
Have a happy and safe summer.

Here is the first ""Precious Moments with Mr. Ashby"" for this week; we will try to have at least 2 videos a week if we can keep it up and make sure they are somewhat entertaining. And, before you watch this one, I wanted to give a shout out to Mr. Walker who has done the editing for my videos. He is a video Rockstar!!!!! I'm so glad for him because they have just enough humor added with just the right touch. (Thanks Mr. Walker!!!!!)

Enjoy...

NO CASES HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED IN UTAH. Although, the UDOH has investigated, and ruled out, several potential cases. Only cases diagnosed in Utah will be counted as Utah cases.

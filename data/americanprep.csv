One of my students has been selected as State Finalist for Utah in the 'Doodle For Google' Competition!

Google visited our school today and held an assembly to award her a prize. The good news is that she can win a college scholarship of either $5,000 if she gets the most votes for her age range. Or even better, a $30,000 college scholarship if she gets to be the overall winner (chosen by some famous people.....details on the Doodle for Google web page.) You have until the 5th March to vote, and you can vote everyday from as many different devices as you like! (i.e you could vote 5 times a day, every day if you have 5 devices!) I have copied the link on this post, so please vote for her. And remember to vote every day!

She is in the Utah 8-9 Grade Group. Please see her design on the photos I have posted so that you can vote for the correct one.

Also, for a large number of our Draper families, there will be a candidate debate held tonight for the District 10 (Draper) candidates.

We know our families are anxious to see their new school and meet our wonderful staff. As a preliminary to our Grand Opening Kindergarten Kick-off which will be held in August, we have planned a ""Popsicles in the Park"" activity where your child will meet other American Preparatory Kindergarten students. There will be fun activities such as story telling, music, games, and of course popsicles. We hope to see you all there!",0.0,"American Preparatory Academy

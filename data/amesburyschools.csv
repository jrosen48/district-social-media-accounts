Today’s AEFI Shout Out goes not to faculty or staff, but to one of our students!
Middle School student Julia Parsons repainted the bench on the top of PO Hill and inscribed it with the inscription, very appropriate for current times, “Escape The New Norm and Breathe!”
But This isn’t Julia’s first adventure with this bench! Five-plus years ago she and her family made their first trek up Po Hill and Julia saw what had been the long-neglected bench which had slats missing and mentioned to her Mom, Michelle Bosse Parsons that it a was too bad someone didn’t fix it. So she and her Mom went to see Mayor Gray who in turn got the DPW to repair the bench. Then Amesbury Industrial donated the paint and Julia and her brothers took it from there! Voila!! Girl Power! So many lessons here!
Thank you Julia! Such a great example of our amazing, thoughtful students!!
(Full disclosure here—her brother helped at the end!)",0.0,"Amesbury Educational Foundation, Inc. is with Michelle Bosse Parsons.

We've had many local businesses calling the Mayor's Office to see if Mayor Gove is going to mandate that they close. The short answer is no, but we are asking everyone to follow guidance from the Commonwealth, which is to not spend more than 15 minutes with 6 feet of another person.

We encourage everyone to patronize our businesses safely - through take-out, curbside pickup and online shopping.

This is an evolving situation and the City may need to put out a mandate in the future, but for now we're recommending that everyone follow the guidance.

We know many parents are wondering how much their kids can socialize with friends during this school closure. The point of the closure is to slow the possible spread of the Coronavirus, which means social distancing and avoiding public places.

If kids are hanging out during this closure, it does not help slow the possible spread. The virus can live on surfaces for days, so it’s important to avoid public spaces like playgrounds and skate parks. Please don’t let your kids go to friend’s homes.

It’s very important to keep your social circles small. Whenever there is a potential case of COVID-19, our public health nurse does what’s called contract tracing. That requires gathering information about every person the suspected case has come in close contact with. If that case ends up confirmed, EVERYONE who is a close contact has to quarantine for 14 days.

So please help with this initiative, and limit your kid’s contact with others during the school closure! Thanks for your cooperation.",6.0,"Amesbury High School

It’s almost time! The musical is right around the corner. Are you coming?

Amesbury High School Presents Chicago the Musical - High School Edition.

Set in the legendary city during the roaring “jazz hot” 20s, Chicago tells the story of two rival vaudevillian murderesses locked up in Cook County Jail. Nightclub star Velma’s serving time for killing her husband and sister after finding the two in bed together. Driven chorus girl Roxie’s been tossed in the joint for bumping off the lover she’s been cheating on her husband with. Not one to rest on her laurels, Roxie enlists the help of prison matron Mama Morton and slickster lawyer Billy Flynn, who turn Roxies’s incarceration into a murder-of-the-week media frenzy, thus preparing the world for a splashy showbiz comeback. But Chicago’s only big enough for one murderess celebrity...

If students were returning under this present guidance they would not be required as students to wear masks while at school. (The state may recommend that they do, but will not require it.)

The biggest challenge right now is to space requirements. The current guidance would require a classroom to have 35 sq ft per student. However, with the recommendation that came from the American Academy of Pediatrics regarding the importance of all students being physically in school, I believe we will see that number modified down so that we can have every student in class every day.

This modification has not come down from the state yet (we are to get major guidance revisions on July 21), so it is not something that we can bank on just yet, but that is the way the pressure is pushing the guidance, I think.

19,8.0,,39.0,,1960435377422002,"The following was in the news last night and could substantially impact how the state modifies guidance for reopening schools. It may also assuage some fears that parents could have.

“The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is pushing government officials and school administrators to allow students to return to class in the fall despite the coronavirus.

The AAP said in a Monday statement that the cost to children of keeping them separated from school and their classmates may be worse than the disease and lead to abuse, drug use, and even suicide.

The AAP strongly advocates that all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of having students physically present in school. The importance of inperson learning is well-documented, and there is already evidence of the negative impacts on children because of school closures in the spring of 2020. Lengthy time away from school and associated interruption of supportive services often results in social isolation, making it difficult for schools to identify and address important learning deficits as well as child and adolescent physical or sexual abuse, substance use, depression, and suicidal ideation. This, in turn, places children and adolescents at considerable risk of morbidity and, in some cases, mortality.

The child health professionals noted that keeping children from in-class instruction has already had a “substantial impact” on students’ physical health and nutrition, as miss consistent exercise and school meals. As for the threat of the pandemic, the AAP said that the coronavirus is much less dangerous to younger people, and students with healthy immune systems are less likely to spread the disease further, especially if precautions are taken such as wearing face masks in class.

SARS-CoV-2 appears to behave differently in children and adolescents than other common respiratory viruses, such as influenza, on which much of the current guidance regarding school closures is based. Although children and adolescents play a major role in amplifying influenza outbreaks, to date, this does not appear to be the case with SARS-CoV-2. Although many questions remain, the preponderance of evidence indicates that children and adolescents are less likely to be symptomatic and less likely to have severe disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, children may be less likely to become infected and to spread infection.”",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1960435377422002&id=170102886455269,,0.0,"The following was in the news last night and could substantially impact how the state modifies guidance for reopening schools.

""Our state’s response to COVID-19 has necessarily evolved with the use of data and knowledge of effective suppression measures. We now have a moral imperative to meet
the changing nature of the pandemic and evolve our approach to serving our children.

As we continue to implement Governor Brown’s “Stay Home, Save Lives” order, we also foresee the strong possibility that our students may not come back through our school house doors this academic year. This calls for a shift from providing supplementary education to a formidable effort to provide Distance Learning for All.

Of course, education without face-to-face interaction between students and teachers will look and feel different and cannot be fully replicated across a distance. It will not and cannot happen overnight. We need the grace and patience of our state’s leaders, our communities, our families, and our educators as we learn together to move powerfully to ensure care, connection and continuity of learning happen in entirely new ways for our students.""

Here in Amity, this shift to distance education will take a couple of weeks as we need to continue create a specific plan in order to most effectively deliver each child's education. We will use online technology as much as possible but we know that other means will still be required in some situations. Schools will be reaching out to parents and students in order to ensure the best results. We are planning to make weekly all-calls with the most general and important information and will be using Facebook, websites and direct contact from staff members to give more details as they become available.

There has been a significant amount of confusion regarding the changes to senior schedules this year as well as scheduling for the high school in general. First let us apologize for not ensuring better communication on changes that occurred this school year. We clearly could have and should have done a better job of informing parents, especially of this year’s seniors, of these changes.

The most important change came about from the State Board of Education and the Oregon Department of Education with regards to the rule around student contact time. After some very negative publicity a few years ago, the state implemented changes to how they interpreted and enforced ORS 581-022-2320. Under section (7)(d), the language now reads “For the 2018–19 school year, at least 92% of all students in the district and at least 80% of all students at each school operated by the district must be scheduled to receive the minimum hours of instructional time set forth in subsection (1) of this rule.” In order to be in compliance with this rule, the district could not allow a large group of students to take less than a fully scheduled day.

Senior students that are working during the school year should consider getting credit through Cooperative Work Experience. This can replace late start or early release and still count towards fulfillment of the state law. Arrangements for this must be made through the High School Counselor.

None of this affects school funding as our Seniors nearly always take enough classes to be considered full-time for funding purposes, as that definition is different for the state. I can assure anyone interested that the district’s finances are in very good condition. Unlike several neighboring schools, Amity did not make any staffing or program cuts this year; in fact we have expanded in both of those areas. At the high school specifically, staffing been added that allows for additional elective options while improving support for struggling students.

As staff changes at the high school level, sometimes course offerings do as well. This could be due to either teacher areas of expertise (usually) or to their license restrictions (rarely). We are constantly looking for better ways to serve our students and their parents with varied offerings, sometimes based on need and other times on interest. Among other changes to our schedule are the addition of AP Studio Art and Sports Medicine, while Woods changed to Cabinetry and now follows a robust curriculum designed in part by Mr. Stearns. Mr. Daniels is also putting his background to work, teaching a math class.

I am not sure Amity has ever offered more college level and preparatory courses, as the following list of this year’s class offerings shows.

AP Studio Art Calculus Pre-Calculus

AP US History Chemistry Spanish

AP Literature Anatomy and Physiology Horticulture

College Writing Welding

We could have and should have done a much better job of preparing students and parents for the changes that came down from the state and we apologize for the frustration and confusion that was caused. I know that the State Board of Education is considering some exceptions to the current interpretation of the rule, but they have yet to make any changes. If and when they do, we will let you know any pertinent options that may be then available. The State Board meets later this month.

Respectfully,

Jeff Clark, Amity Superintendent

As many of you know we have been working on a gym remodel for a few months now. We retained the services of an architect and had plans drawn up to improve the usefulness of our HS gym and increasing the seating capacity by about 200. We went out to bid in March and accepted the low bid from TS Gray Construction of $276,185.

Unfortunately, shortly after the release of the bids to the public, TS Gray wrote a letter to the district claiming to have significantly underbid the project. They said they were ""neglected by the subcontracting community"", receiving very few sub bids and spent there last day before bids were due ""scrambling to estimate the subcontractor's (sic) work scopes"". They listed five areas where this impacted their bid: painting, sheetrock, acoustical ceiling tiles, HVAC (removal of old units), and the bleachers. To this end, they requested the district add nearly $80,000 to the bid price in order for them to ""breakeven"". This is an increase of nearly 30% over the original bid. While not fully itemized, there was a cost in an appendix of the bid for bleachers, so this was not an area completely ignored in the bid.

At the monthly meeting last night, the board voted unanimously to not accept this proposed increase and to hold TS Gray to the original bid. They understand this means that likely the remodel doesn't occur, but they felt strongly that first and foremost the responsibility of the board in such matters is to be responsible stewards of the public dollars. If need be, we can survive longer without a gym remodel; it is not critical, just desirable.

There will be an article in the newspaper about this in the near future; we wanted people to know prior to that exactly what was going on.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1021714517960764&id=170102886455269,,0.0,"Amity Supporters,

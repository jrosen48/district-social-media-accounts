The Canyon del Oro AP/IB Mathematics Distance Problem Set Project",4.0,"What a fun project from Canyon del Oro High School teacher Chris Yetman! Every year, his AP and IB students have a chance to earn extra credit by taking pictures of themselves working on a problem set while in some non-math situation. They earn extra points if their graphing calculator is involved. This year, he asked them to take a photo of themselves working on their problem sets at home. Check out the results! #AmphiTogether

We received an email from Mayor Winfield congratulating the three of them personally and celebrated them during our class Zoom meeting. They would normally be presented at Town Hall but due to social distancing their certificates and gift cards will be mailed. Fingers are crossed that they'll still be able to attend a Town Hall meeting when it's safe to do so as they are so excited for this. They worked so hard on this project and their love of history shows. To say we're proud of them is an understatement!!!!

""Mrs. Luciano has guided, helped, supported me this year so far in my first year of teaching. She is such a hard worker always putting everyone else first and always goes out of her way to help her students no matter what. She had a student that got rushed to the hospital over a weekend and immediately went up to the hospital to check on that student. She truly is beautiful inside and out. She always has a smile on her face, and makes sure to go over and beyond to help everyone around her. So blessed that I have an amazing team member in 3rd grade to work with.” #PrideofAmphi",2020-01-27 13:19:17,,

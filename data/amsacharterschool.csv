So- now is the time to register!!

We know the tournament is going to be different and not exactly what we envisioned- but we’re still planning a super fun filled day! We won’t be able to have the large social gatherings aspects such as Happy Hour or the dinner banquet. Over the coming weeks, we’ll be in the final stages of planning for the best social distancing Golf Tournament possible. Stay tuned for more details- including updated tournament day schedule, an online silent auction and new on-the-course games.

We’re really excited and hope many of your will join us for a great day of golf with the greater AMSA Community!

If anyone is not comfortable with the social distancing format, or if something changes and we don't host the Tournament after all, registration fees will be refunded in full.

Please register at www.amsacs.org/golf.

So- now is the time to register!!

We know the tournament is going to be different and not exactly what we envisioned- but we’re still planning a super fun filled day! We won’t be able to have the large social gatherings aspects such as Happy Hour or the dinner banquet. Over the coming weeks, we’ll be in the final stages of planning for the best social distancing Golf Tournament possible. Stay tuned for more details- including updated tournament day schedule, an online silent auction and new on-the-course games.

We’re really excited and hope many of your will join us for a great day of golf with the greater AMSA Community!

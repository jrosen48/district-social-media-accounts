And I love this dichotomy.” Julie Riccardi has taught kindergarten for 14 years, one of those as a K-2 literacy coach, and she says she learns so much from her students about kindness and curiosity. Creating lessons that are engaging for students and seeing them take ownership of their learning while developing confidence is a huge reward.

Her passion for literacy has helped her lead the efforts to move to online learning during the school closure; district kindergarten teachers are using Seesaw to connect with students via video lessons, student-to-student posts, and multi-media interactive lessons.

Ubungen says connecting with students is easy when you care about them. “Their perception is their reality, so acknowledging that their feelings are important is key. I also believe that kindness matters.”

Next year, Ubungen will be sharing her passion for student success as the director of the WA World Fellows program, a program that selects sophomores from around the state and provides them with opportunities to be successful in high school and college.

This month offers an opportunity to deepen our understanding of dyslexia and share resources and tools to help educators, parents, and students affected by it. One of the district's goals this year is develop a plan for dyslexia screening to help identify impacted students early.

Questions about the district's dyslexia work can be sent to Fran McCarthy, executive director of student support services, at fmccarthy@asd103.org or (360) 503-1216.",2019-10-17 12:36:08,,

Ten days before Carter O’Donnell and her family were set to move to the Middle East, they got the orders to come to Anacortes. That was seven years ago, and they’re here to stay. O’Donnell returns to the classroom after staying home with her four children: 8th grade, 6th grade, 3rd grade and kindergarten. As they’ve grown, she realized she missed being in the classroom. She says the district’s reading and writing curriculum made such a huge difference for two of her children that she eagerly made the transition from Montessori teacher (15 years) to public school teacher. Her environmental science background has taken her to New Zealand where she studied conservation to the top of Mt. Kilamanjaro. What does she love about teaching kindergarten? “They are so eager and excited about everything. You’re always their superhero. It’s a privilege to be the first teacher of their public education.”

First up, meet Josh Emery -- health and personal finance teacher at Anacortes High School.

When Josh Emery isn’t in the classroom, he can most likely be found outside, either climbing or on the trails. He loves both rock and alpine climbing and ultramarathon running. Emery comes to Anacortes most recently from Tonasket but has taught in Alaska and Seattle as well. This is his seventh year teaching, and he’s looking forward to making connections with his students. He has been impressed with the high expectations of the district and is confident that he’ll be teaching at a much higher level than in previous schools.

“We are disappointed that we won’t have a viable varsity team next year,” said Erik Titus, Anacortes athletics and activities director. “But it doesn’t make sense in terms of student health and safety to push inexperienced sophomores or freshman into varsity play before they are ready.”

The district will offer seniors with previous varsity-level experience an opportunity to play with another Skagit County school through an inter-cooperative agreement.

“We will continue to build our program and take full advantage of our new stadium,” said Titus. “We remain committed to offering a football program that balances student safety and competition.”

Titus plans to work with other districts to develop a junior varsity-level schedule for the season, including Homecoming.

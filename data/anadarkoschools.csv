The program is for students that were in grades 2-5 during the last school year. The application is on our REACHOUT website. You can get to the REACHOUT website by going to the District website and looking under quick links. We also placed a paper application in all of the envelopes that contained your child's awards and report cards. We will be delivering the packets with all of the crafts and activities for the week of June 1 to the meal drop locations on June 1. If you need us to deliver to your house or if you have any questions, please feel free to contact Connie Thompson (405)402-1072 or Jill Haddon (405)643-7153. We are excited and look forward to seeing you!!!!",2020-05-26 13:02:16,,

On top of taking care of their academic obligations, they have put together a series of Public Service Announcements. Each PSA delivers a timely message. The topics range from information about COVID19, tutorials on how to make hand sanitizer, ideas for how to cure boredom, and even ways to manage stress during these challenging times. The PSA's will be published on the South Facebook page each week.

Today we are highlighting the PSA of Bersabeh Getachew on ""Things to do at Home during Quarantine""

Earlier this year, the city of La Palma installed two new traffic signs on the corner of La Luna and Walker street directly across the street from Walker JHS and adjacent to Kennedy. This is a major thoroughfare for students walking to and from school and, unfortunately, the location of many close calls between cars and pedestrians.

After some extensive research, Walker students began a campaign and ultimately met with city leaders to present their case. After several meetings and deliberation with the city council, the city agreed with students and installed ""No right turn on a red when children are present"" signs.

This is a great example of tenacity and civic engagement by students to make their community safer.

Dear AUHSD Family/Community,

In the upcoming weeks we will be posting some of the remarkable work our students and teachers across our District are creating focused on an #AUHSDCapstone project with the following Driving Question: How Is the Coronavirus Affecting Your Life?

Today, we want to share with you what Lexington’s photo classes, led by teacher Elizabeth Hind, are working on. Students have created a photovoice project by photographing their lives during the COVID-19 confinement and writing statements about their thoughts and experiences. This is an important project, as photographers document history, and these students are generating primary sources that future generations will use to learn about our time.

Below are a few examples, however, the complete gallery is on view at http://www.instagram.com/photographers.interrupted.

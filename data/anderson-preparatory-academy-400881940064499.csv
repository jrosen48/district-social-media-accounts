I hope everyone is doing well and adjusting as well as possible to our new temporary normal.
This week the Pre Academy implemented the “week at a glance” E-Learning schedule for our families. Our hope is to help everyone feel a little more organized and less anxious during the next 7 weeks of E- Learning. I will be sending these out every Monday to all of our students and families via email. If you don’t receive one please contact me and I will make sure you get one and put you on our email list.
Our teachers are here to help you in any way we can and are reaching out to make personal contact with everyone. If you or your child have any questions concerning E-Learning, you need added to our email list, or you haven’t been in touch with anyone from APA please email me at kgraves@goapa.org.

As we approach our first e-learning day on Monday, have you checked the blog? http://apablog.org/ Your teachers (k-12) will post assignments there and potentially post alternative communication lines (like Mr. Yergin set up a Remind account he wants you to sign up for if you’re in his class).

Also, Academy students, make sure to check your APA email at least once a day while we’re in e-learning.

Most teachers are looking forward to hearing from you on Monday!

Parents, if you have questions the best way to contact a teacher is always through email.

By now, you are all probably aware that our Governor has mandated that all schools will be closed until at least May 1.

Our APA administration team is meeting on Monday to develop what eLearning will look like going forward. There are no assignments due this week nor next. No new eLearning assignments will begin until the week of March 30th.

Additionally, all state assessments, like IREAD (3rd grade only) and ILEARN (for 3rd/4th graders) are canceled for this school year.

Finally, as a reminder, we are here for you. As far as we can tell, we will be able to continue providing food services as our closure continues.

Amanda Cox is a 4th grade student in Lt. Wiles' class at Anderson Preparatory Academy. She has a huge heart for all animals! She and her family volunteer at The Animal Protection League periodically and she understands the need we have at our facility. Because of this, she planned a school wide fundraiser for her elementary school that would help collect items for the APL. She did all the planning, including designing her own flyer. She then followed through with her plan by getting several students to help donate different items that the APL needed. Monday, they were finally able to bring in all of the stuff for the staff and animals!

School choice is the process of allowing every family to choose the K-12 educational options that best fit their children. These options include all forms of education, from traditional public schools, to public charter schools, public magnet schools, private schools, online academies, and homeschooling.

Every child deserves an effective, challenging, and motivating education. Because each student has their own unique set of talents, interests, and challenges, a variety of options in education is crucial. School choice ensures that each student can find a learning environment that allows them to be inspired, successful, and happy.

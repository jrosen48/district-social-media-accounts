Our schools here in Anderson have been getting some negative attention. There are amazing things happening here at all our schools, with our schools offering students so many more opportunities than other local schools, and most importantly a safe, positive learning environment. I challenge us to take a break from the negative posts and post 1 good thing you love about Anderson Community Schools. Let's end the week on a better note than how we started and unite our community under the great things we should focus on. If you're an alumni or current person in our schools (in any capacity)-help show Indiana why Anderson is the place to be!

On Wednesday, July 1, 2020, the new Indiana law involving holding cell phones while driving will take effect. This law prohibits the operator of a motor vehicle from holding or operating cell phones or other similar electronic devices while operating a motor vehicle.

The new law states that “a person may not hold or use a telecommunications device while operating a motor vehicle.” This law applies to wireless phones, personal digital assistants, pagers, or other text messaging devices.

Exceptions to this are if you are using hands-free or voice-operated technology like Bluetooth or if you are calling 911 to report an emergency.

Sending or reading a text message takes your eyes off the road for approximately 5 seconds and at a speed of 55 mph, that is like driving the length of an entire football field with your eyes closed!

As July 1st is approaching, now is a good time to begin thinking about how you plan on complying with this new law and purchase any needed equipment such as cell phone holders or hands-free technology before then.",67.0,"Plainfield Police Department

Our E2 families drove through the parking lot and honked, waved, and even gave some teachers special gifts. It was uplifting for staff members to see and visit one another (with masks and at least 6’ apart), but especially to see some of our students today.

It is with a sad heart that we share this news about one of our beloved educators, Joann Maddox. Mrs. Maddox was an admirable teacher, colleague, and leader that served as a source of light and joy to those she interacted with. She was full of laughter, smiles, good stories, and good advice. While at D26, Mrs. Maddox worked with students pursuing a CNA certification. She also served on the leadership committee and helped to make important decisions based on the expertise she had gained with over 40 years of experience in education. She was a wonderful person and had a tremendous amount of love for the students. Mrs. Maddox served D26 and Anderson Community Schools well and will be dearly missed.

SENIORS, SUBMIT YOUR LETTER TODAY!
The Class of 2020 will finish its senior year at home, instead cruising the halls with friends, attending prom, starring in one final performance or playing in one last game. The Herald Bulletin would like to offer seniors a chance to put their thoughts about this unprecedented situation into words. Seniors can reflect on their high school careers, thank teachers, bid goodbye to friends and let everyone know about their future plans. It can't replace what these senior shave lost, but hopefully it can offer some closure.

Out in the community again, with my food service friends distributing meals today from 10-12. Remember to watch for a school bus at your normal bus stop, or even just flag down ANY ACS Yellow Bus and we would be more than happy to stop and give you FREE MEALS for any school aged student, regardless of where you go to school! Today's food distribution will have 3 meals per student! Awesome huh? And all you have to do is watch for us in your neighborhood! #ACSMakingADifference #Striving4Excellence",23.0,"Joshua Dillard

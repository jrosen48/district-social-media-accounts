What does it take to secure, prepare, pack, and deliver 70,344 meals in one day?

People, lots and lots and lots of great people!

Culinary Services is proud of the hard work and dedication of the Anderson 5 team to ensure our kids have great breakfast and lunch options over Spring Break. Our 110+ school food service professionals, 80 bus drivers and their leadership team, 100+ custodians along with their leadership team, nearly all of the RAMS Athletic Department, and countless volunteers have worked tirelessly and passionately to see this day be a huge success. Each of you, as well as our local businesses that donated much needed supplies, are so greatly appreciated.

The love we share for our community as well as the tremendous support from our vendors is why The Electric City shines bright!

Thank you all for your outstanding support... we will see you again on April 13th!

This effort included students/teachers from three of our high school campuses:

• T.L. Hanna High:
Adeline Youngblood
Stephanie Ortiz
Molly Loftis

• Westside High:
Lilliana Taylor
Ashley Kozikowski

• Anderson Institute of Technology:
Stacy Coleman – Digital and Visual Art Instructor
Jeffery Hoffman – Media Technology and Film Instructor

How cool is it to be able to produce projects in-house, right here in our own school district?! This is Career and Technical Education in action! We appreciate all involved for sharing your time and talent to create something truly excellent as a school district. Congrats and thank you!

Anderson Five Board of Trustees recognized teachers, students, and district administration this month for their excellent collaboration, combined efforts and talents. The Office of Student Services and the Office of External Affairs worked together to initiate a launch for the district-wide “Anti-Vaping” Public Service Announcement. This effort included students/teachers from three of our high school campuses:

• T.L. Hanna High:
Adeline Youngblood
Stephanie Ortiz
Molly Loftis

• Westside High:
Lilliana Taylor
Ashley Kozikowski

• Anderson Institute of Technology:
Stacy Coleman – Digital and Visual Art Instructor
Jeffery Hoffman – Media Technology and Film Instructor

How cool is it to be able to produce projects in-house, right here in our own school district?! This is Career and Technical Education in action! We appreciate all involved for sharing your time and talent to create something truly excellent as a school district. Congrats and thank you!

Students were picked up by limo and chauffeured to a Target holiday shopping spree where they each were allotted $200 to spend on things at the top of their wish-lists! 🛒🎁 This is all thanks to Perry Freeman, owner of Charleston Sports Pub – Clemson graduate, and product of Anderson Five.

Christmas came early, that’s for sure! ❤️
Thanks for your giving-heart and sharing the true spirit of the season with our students, Perry.

These bricks are earmarked for the school's and district's use and not open to the public for taking. Also, we have asked that you stay out of the construction site, so please follow our recommendation. Entering any construction site is extremely dangerous and it is slowing down our progress.

In 2015, State Superintendent Molly Spearman began a statewide program to recognize high school seniors entering the military or attending a military service academy. The SCDE provides these students with red, white, and blue honor cords to be worn at graduation ceremonies and also holds an annual event in Columbia where parents, state and military leaders honor the sacrifice these students are making to protect and serve our country.

This year's ceremony was scheduled to be at Fort Jackson but due to federal limitations placed on military bases we are moving the recognition ceremony to an online format that will air on our social media platforms and be carried by news outlets.

If you are the parent or educator of a high school graduate who has enlisted in the U.S. Armed Forces or attending one of our distinguished military service academies, we encourage you to help students take part in this celebration by filling out the below form by May 11, 2020.

Please continue to share and like this page so we can connect with as many Wren families as possible. 💙💛💙

We need your help! We need pictures from the old Wren Middle building. This is what we are looking for:
💙 Pictures from 1957-2000 mostly
💛 Any pictures of original construction
💙 More large group picture, than smaller groups of people
💛 Pictures that show aspects of the building: classrooms, gym, cafeteria, lockers, etc.

Please email to Jessica Tollison at tollisonj@apps.anderson1.org

You can scan pictures with a scanner to email or take a quality picture with a cell phone camera. Tips for cell phone pictures of physical pictures:
1. Use good lighting
2. Position the phone/camera to where there is not a glare on a picture from an overhead light.
3. Try to avoid getting other images in the background: desk, tabletop, etc.
4. Email at the highest quality
Note: Don’t take pictures of a computer screen. These do not turn out well. Screenshots do not save at a high quaity. Landscape photos are best for our project.

Pictures must be emailed by Tuesday, May 5 to be included.",12.0,"Farewell to the old Wren Middle School building

BECOMING is better than BEING.

I have Bubble Gum Brain. I like to chew on my thoughts, flex, bend and stretch my brain, and expand the way I think! I make great mistakes that help me learn.

I have Brick Brain. With me, things are the way they are...and they're probably not going to change much. I am the way I am...and that's just how it is.

Meet Bubble Gum Brain and Brick Brain: two kids with two VERY different mindsets. Bubble Gum Brain likes to have fun adventures, learn new things, and doesn't worry about making great mistakes. Brick Brain is convinced that things are just fine the way they are and there's not much he can do to change them, so why try?

When Bubble Gum Brain shows Brick Brain how to peel off his wrapper, Brick Brain begins to realize just how much more fun school...and life... can be!

This creative story teaches children (and adults) the valuable lesson that becoming is better than being, which can open the door to a whole new world of possibilities!

Ready, Get Mindset...GROW!!

PARADE ROUTE IS HERE!!!

We're excited to have our Teacher Parade today. Please see the APPROXIMATE times that we will be driving through the below locations. Unfortunately, with such a large school zone to cover, we can not make it to every road and neighborhood. Maybe you can drive and park in a neighborhood close to you.

*We will give you live updates through ParentSquare about our location.

Have fun and make signs with messages for teachers/staff. Wave, cheer, chalk your driveway, etc.!

A FEW THINGS TO REMEMBER TO STAY SAFE:

KEEP YOUR SOCIAL DISTANCE. Please DO NOT congregate in groups in your neighborhood as we drive through.
Please do NOT approach the teacher's cars. Sadly we can't give hugs and we must remain in our cars and a safe distance away.
Please stay safely in your yard or driveway a safe distance from road.

James Davis, PLTW Engineering Instructor, used our 3D printing technology to create a mask prototype from Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) specs.

As of this afternoon there were no confirmed cases in Anderson County or Anderson One. Following the agencies recommendations, all schools in Anderson One will remain open at this time.

Computer science is one of the fastest-growing fields in the world, and more South Carolina students than ever before are benefiting from Advanced Placement computer science courses.

1,003 South Carolina students took the AP Computer Science Principles exam in May 2019 (⬆️ from 630 in 2018). This was in addition to 345 students taking Computer Science Principles A. More than 69.4% of students scored 3+ (⬆️ from 67.6%) on these exams.

The College Board has honored 12 South Carolina schools with the AP Computer Science Female Diversity Award. This award recognizes schools across the nation that have closed the gender gap and engaged more female students in computer science coursework.

Congratulations to Silver Bluff High School, ACTC, Denmark-Olar High School, R.B.

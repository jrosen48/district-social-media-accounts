And with that, more than 450 seniors at Andover High School (Kansas), Andover Central High School Jaguars and Andover Ecademy crossed the stage last week to be honored as part of the graduating Class of 2020. We had three beautiful nights for our celebrations.

Thank you to Hutton for donating this video to honor our seniors, and to Adler Grey Videography for producing it.

Congratulations, Trojans, Jaguars and Eagles!",2020-05-26 14:13:09,https://video-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/10000000_692933937948592_5993693463625859072_n.mp4?_nc_cat=109&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=sF7WrwYm6yIAX-lSPz_&_nc_ht=video-atl3-1.xx&oh=53f3dea2f3afd464cc99dddda8891847&oe=5F5CFD90,

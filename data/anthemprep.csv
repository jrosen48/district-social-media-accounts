Anthem Prep has changed my way of thinking and how I approach certain situations. Anthem Prep was different from any other school I had attended and taught me that nothing comes easy if you don’t work for it. The pre- and post-game meals with the teams after a hard-fought win were some of the best times, and I especially enjoyed the bus rides. I plan to attend community college for the time being and will pursue opportunities to continue playing soccer in college.",2020-05-14 16:20:12,,

I’m most grateful for my growth personally and individually in understanding ‒ about reality, human nature, the good, etc.‒ which ultimately gives me meaning and fulfillment. Similarly, what impacted me most academically were the philosophical discussions in which I took part mainly during Humane Letters seminars but also after class and among some close friends during my free time. Though I also enjoyed many of the other courses, especially all of the math classes, the questions we encounter in the books we read in Humane Letters are some of, if not the most, urgent and pressing questions that any person should answer. During my time at Anthem Prep, I’ve been able to find some answers to those questions, but most importantly, I’ve developed a determination ‒ a conviction ‒ to find the rest.

It has taught me to cherish the moments I have with all my peers and teachers - especially looking back on this fourth quarter with not being able to be at school. Lastly, it taught me how to make decisions going forward on where I want to go to college and what I want to do after college.

I’ve grown a lot intellectually, but also I’ve formed connections with my friends and teachers that I will never forget. I’m truly grateful to Anthem Prep! Humane Letters has always pushed me to think about concepts and ideas that are so much bigger than me. I’ve loved the deep conversations, the laughs, and the memories from all four years. But I never want to stop volunteering, and I would like to be part of a nonprofit organization when I join college so that I can continue my work. In addition, I will continue to pursue truth by asking the hard questions and wanting to know the answers.

Our 2020 Summer Lunch season has officially ended, and we'd like to send a HUGE thank you to all of the Y staff and directors who worked tirelessly to make this program a success. Whether you worked behind the scenes (the staff in our Bellefonte kitchen alone prepared over 900 meals per day!) or on the front lines, we couldn't be more appreciative of your commitment to ensuring kids in our community have the food they need to thrive - particularly during these challenging times.

Although our Summer Lunch Program is over until next summer, we continue to provide food to local kids during the school year. Our Backpack Program ensures kids in school districts across Centre County have food to eat on the weekends.

While our production lines sit idle, some of our team members have been keeping busy by lending a hand to the local YMCA, a longtime DiamondBack partner. Their food programs provide meals to hundreds of families, students, and veterans in Philipsburg and the surrounding communities.

In our neck of the woods, just like in communities everywhere, people are struggling. For too many, the next mortgage payment, or even meal, is in question. Although the objective hasn’t changed for the Moshannon Valley Y, the number of those in need has recently skyrocketed. With help from an army of volunteers, they’re answering the call.

We’re not sure what the aftermath of this shutdown will look like, or how quickly we’ll all bounce back. We do know that our neighbors are in need, and that’s unlikely to change soon. DiamondBack has partnered with the YMCA of Centre County to open DiamondBack Family Centers that will provide groceries and hot meals to those in need, far into the future.

While hunger is not a new enemy, the need for access to food has rapidly expanded. Together these two organizations have taken to the front lines by first expanding the YMCA’s Backpack program from weekend meals to daily lunches. With the support of multiple organizations and collaboration with Crops for Christ, the daily meal expanded to care for senior citizens and veterans. The goal is to provide for every neighbor regardless of age or circumstance, until the fight is over. Adam Clampet, who heads up Crops for Christ, was one of the initial people to go the the Bellefonte Branch with donations, traveling to pick up supplies needed, and offering total support that no one goes hungry. As a veteran, he wants to make sure that those who have served their country have the food they need for themselves and their family.
#SomeoneYouShouldKnow",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2598819670338481&id=1825319881021801,,0.0,"Two organizations, YMCA of Centre County Anti-Hunger and Crops for Christ, have responded to this battle. While hunger is not a new enemy, the need for access to food has rapidly expanded. Together these two organizations have taken to the front lines by first expanding the YMCA’s Backpack program from weekend meals to daily lunches. With the support of multiple organizations and collaboration with Crops for Christ, the daily meal expanded to care for senior citizens and veterans. The goal is to provide for every neighbor regardless of age or circumstance, until the fight is over. Adam Clampet, who heads up Crops for Christ, was one of the initial people to go the the Bellefonte Branch with donations, traveling to pick up supplies needed, and offering total support that no one goes hungry. As a veteran, he wants to make sure that those who have served their country have the food they need for themselves and their family.

YMCA of Centre County’s Anti-Hunger Program is prepared to help children in need of food while schools are closed due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. We realize that many children in our community are dependent on the meals they receive at school through the Free/Reduced Lunch Program and that these may be their main source of nutrition throughout the week.

It’s important to us to ensure that no child in our community goes hungry as a result of school closures. If you or another family in your community are struggling to put food on the table or if you are willing to provide support of any kind, please contact Mel Curtis at (814) 342-0889 or mcurtis@ymcaocc.org as soon as possible.

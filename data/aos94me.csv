Good Evening,

First, Great Job!! I want to thank all of the students and parents for doing an incredible job this week keeping your children connected with their teachers. I know if we keep up the momentum it will make our transition back to school go much smoother. Based on the Governors Emergency Declaration and last night's Governors Executive Order I am announcing that SAD #46 is officially continuing our remote learning days through Friday, April 17, 2020, with our traditional Spring Break the following week and regular in school learning resuming on Monday, April 27, 2020. As we move through the next few weeks we will keep all students engaged as best we can. If you have specific questions please contact me at 924-6000 or the school where your child attends.

To all the families, please stay safe and healthy!
Kevin Jordan

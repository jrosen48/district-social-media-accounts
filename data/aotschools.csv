Did you know that the state of Arizona gives taxpayers credit on their annual returns in exchange for cash donations made to schools?

If you support your child's school, and if you find yourself making additional payments to the state when you file your return, this credit is for you. Make the donation and take $200 or $400 (depending on your filing status) off your return. This is money you have already paid to the state in income tax, and you have the rare chance to designate how you would like it spent! Sounds too good to be true? Check out the link below to learn more.

This money can be used in the school's general fund OR it may be designated for programs (like athletics or fine arts), field trips and MORE!

Thank you for donating!

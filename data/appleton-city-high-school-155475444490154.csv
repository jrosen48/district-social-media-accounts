We would like to remind you that Missouri requires all students entering the 8th grade to receive a Tdap and Meningitis shot and all students entering the 12th grade to receive a Meningitis shot prior to the first day of school in August. For your convenience, we will be offering a free shot clinic at school on Wednesday, March 4th for those students who are currently in the 7th and 11th grades. If your child needs these vaccines, the required forms have been mailed to your home address for you to complete and return to school.

We are coming to the end of the 2018-2019 school year and also the first year of our participation in OPAA, our new cafeteria program.

It is the District's intention to do this kind of survey every year. The results of this survey are very important to our District and will be a key factor in determining how food service will be done here going forward. We will deliver the survey in both web-based and paper form and will accept completed paper surveys in the Elementary, High School, and District offices. Thank you for your participation.

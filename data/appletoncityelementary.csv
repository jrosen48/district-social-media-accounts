Dear Appleton City Elementary Parent:

Please help us plan for safely and efficiently getting your students to and from school by completing the survey at the following link:

https://forms.gle/NHgeZo1nGE6mMdN48

From our School Re-entry Plan, ""We encourage parents to bring their children or to drive/walk to school as weather permits. Buses will be loaded from the back to the front and unloaded from the front to the back. The bus driver may have family units sit together. All buses will have assigned seating.""

It will most helpful to have this survey completed before Monday, August 24th.

Thank you for your assistance.

Thanks to very generous donations from Appleton City Junior Achievers, West Central Missouri Community Action Agency and Ellett Memorial… WE'VE GOT IT COVERED!!!

If you have already purchased your child’s school supplies, great! Thank you! You may drop them by the circle drive on Monday from 3pm to 6pm.

If you have not already purchased those supplies, don’t stress about them! West Central has provided enough supplies for everyone who needs them. Junior Achievers has supplied us with sanitizing solution. Ellett Memorial has supplied us with paper towels.

However, please do still feel free and welcome to come by the circle drive Monday, August 24th from 3pm to 6pm to meet and greet with your child’s teacher. Also, this would be a great time to grab QUICK back to school photo with the teacher!

We are so excited to see everyone back!

So, if you have photos that you would like to share, please send them! Captions to tell of the learning that is happening would be most helpful.

Please forward photos via Facebook messenger or email to mmount@appletoncity.k12.mo.us.

WEMO ART WEDNESDAY!!🎨
Feel free to tag/share.

Along with everything else that has been cancelled, so was the annual WEMO Art Competition shortly after I had come in to get it ready to ship out. I didn't even have a chance to announce the students that were selected to go!😪 Sooooooo....

I would like to honor the following students for being selected! See pictures below. Being selected for this is a big deal. It is for grades 3-12, and only 3 total pieces per grade are allowed.

We may not ever know what your rating would have been, but you are all winners in my eyes!!!🌟🌟

I also want to thank Kay Bollinger Reynolds for being an awesome sub 2nd semester. She has been such a blessing from above. I mean, who gets so lucky to get to have a real art teacher sub for art right?

Hello Families,

Here you will find a packet for second graders for the next three weeks. I am sending this packet to your home by mail tomorrow morning! As always, if you or your child are in need of anything (even if you aren't a student of mine), please let me know! I WANT to help.

It seems unreal that I won't be seeing your child's smiling face for so long. It also breaks my heart that I am not able to learn with your children during this time. However, I know this isn't permanent and soon things will return to as normal as possible.

I will be continuing to read stories and teaching mini lessons daily. I also plan to post a ""Directed Draw"" every Wednesday, just like we would do in our classroom. I hope that these videos are helpful for your family!

Heavy mixed precip with snow totals of 2-4 inches & ice accumulations up to .2"" are possible along with high wind gusts of up to 35mph.

These hazards will make travel very hazardous tonight into Saturday, power outages are also possible with ice accumulations combined with strong winds.

It is a great idea to make sure phones and any essentials are charged in case of power outages..also a good idea to have snacks, water & a blanket in your vehicle if you do have to get out in the nastiness.

Important Driving reminders for Winter Weather:

The most important tip is to SLOW DOWN and BUCKLE UP!! Allow extra time to get to your destination. If you don't need to be out don't go!

Allow extra distance between you and the vehicle ahead of you.

If you need you windshield wipers on then you need your headlights on.

Remember SLOW DOWN, BUCKLE UP and BE SAFE as it may take emergency personnel an extended time to reach you if needed.

Work will begin this summer on a massive, 2-year renovation. When EMMS reopens in Fall 2022, learners will be housed in a new building (at the same address) that honors the past, but looks to the future. Friday, November 1, is the last day to place your order for an ornament. This stocking stuffer is sure to inspire fond memories for everyone on your gift-giving list.

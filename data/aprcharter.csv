When did you start at APR? What did you do before?
I started at APR in 2017 as a teacher, and before that I graduated from Bentley University.

What makes APR unique?
What makes APR unique is the community that it creates and fosters, it is an environment in which students feel comfortable and safe.

Favorite after-school snack?
I enjoy Reese’s as great after school snack after a long day.

Thank you, Mr. Forde. APR is lucky to have you!

What makes APR unique?
“APR values the long-game: steadily building an institution around a set of communal values and priorities. As a result, there is a cohort of staff who have been here a long time, which is such a benefit to the community. This may not be unique, but it is great!”

How do you connect with your students?
“I try to bring my full self to the classroom -- my unapologetically rigorous assignments, my bad jokes, and my supreme willingness to meet with students where they are at and work together to envision where they want to be.”

Fav after school snack: “Apples and peanut butter.”

Thank you, Mr. Jacobsen. APR is lucky to have you!

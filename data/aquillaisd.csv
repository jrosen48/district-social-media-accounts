Even when life is interrupted by a global pandemic, life is still happening. We still have homes to run, we still have to find things we need. We're trying to keep our families together, yet safely apart and we're trying to keep our kids learning when their school buildings stand silent. In this brief conversation, we'll explore what keeps us together as parents and educators and discuss what we have to guard against from ripping us apart. We're not necessarily experiencing it like everyone else. But one thing is for certain; we're all experiencing it. We're living through the same storm, but experiencing it in a different boat.

We are sad to announce that due to these unprecedented times dealing with COVID-19, Varsity Spirit has decided to cancel the Varsity Spirit Awards competition. Our amazing mascot, MAC the Cougar, was a finalist for this award for the second year in a row. Although he may not have the opportunity to bring home the trophy this year we know that he is by far the best mascot there is! He goes above and beyond in everything he does and he is number one in our hearts. We are so blessed and thankful to have him as our AISD mascot! Please feel free to leave a note in the comments section to share your love and support for MAC.

We love you MAC!!

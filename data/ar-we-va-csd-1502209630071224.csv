A few guidelines to remember that Paton-Churdan has implemented for spectators:

1. All students in 8th grade and below are required to sit with parents.

2. We ask that all spectators sit in family units and social distance when possible. 9-12 students are asked to practice social distancing in the student section of the bleachers and wear masks.

3. We highly recommend that spectators wear masks especially when entering and exiting the gym and get up from their seat.

4. Please also remember that if a ball would go into the crowd, they cannot be thrown back to the players or line judge, they must be thrown back to a designated person to sanitize balls before they can return to play.

There will be a $5 admission for all ages & concessions/drinks are going to be prepackaged.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2485423841749793&id=1502209630071224,,0.0,"Good luck to our girls tonight as they travel to Paton-Churdan for JV/V volleyball!!!

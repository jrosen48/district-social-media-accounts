We have exciting news to share regarding school supplies for ACISD students!

With the help of designated grant funds and the generosity of the Education Foundation, ACISD will be able to purchase Pre-K through 12th grade school supplies for the next two years. Principals provided lists at the end of the school year, and those will be used to purchase supplies through our local HEB and Walmart stores and delivered to each campus. Backpacks and lunch boxes are not included in this, but we will have a supply if a student is in need. We hope this will provide continued relief for our families as they continue to recover and rebuild.

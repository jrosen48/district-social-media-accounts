Dear Families,

At the Girl‚Äôs State Basketball tournament this past week, a spectator attended the games who tested positive for (COVID-19). After speaking with the Southwest Nebraska Health Department regarding this event, I was informed that the risk to our girls and coaches was very low and there are no other steps we need to take at this time. As an added measure of caution, I have requested the coaches and girls to take their temperature daily and not attend school if their temperature is over 99.5 degrees. They also need to inform the district immediately so we can consult with the Health Department to see if any additional steps will be needed.

Be clear that the risk of exposure is very low and I will keep you informed if there are any changes.

Sincerely,

Mrs. Missy, Nurse
By Camryn B, Dillon D, and Olivia G (7th grade)

Mrs. Missy is a superhero nurse at Acadiana Renaissance. She has been a nurse for almost 5 years. She loves working here because the students are great and the teamwork between the co-workers and parents are amazing. Super Missy has a passion for helping others and found out about the job through one of her good friends coach Eaton. Most of the time kids come to her because of headaches and upset stomachs. She is a master of detecting when students are faking an injury.

She was born and raised as an LSU Tiger, but she also attended SLCC for her last years of college. Her first job was working in surgery for a surgeon.

Ms. Deidre, Custodian
By Laila J, Chris S, and Sophie L (6th Grade)

Ms. Deidre is a custodian at Acadiana Renaissance. She has been working here for five years. One of the reasons she loves her job is because she loves cleaning. Her first job was a pharmacy tech. When she was a little girl, she always wanted to be a mother. “After my kids were all in school, I was ready to reenter the work place. I found an opening at ARCA with hours that would be beneficial to still be a mother. That’s when I found my true passion of working with a wonderful staff and amazing students.”

Ms. Deidre loves Louisiana and is very passionate about Mardi Gras. It is her absolute favorite time of the year. Her other hobbies include spending time with family, shopping, and traveling. One of her dream vacation destinations is France. She is a big Dr. Pepper fan. She has two children and they are the loves of her life.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3281096218574214&id=1046104168740108,,0.0,"Staff Member of the Month

Curious about the iPhone as a teenager, he was inspired to work with technology. He never thought he would be working at a school, but is enjoying it so far. Recently most of his time has been occupied with re-imaging computers and helping the staff. On average he works with about 25 computers a day. His most rewarding part of the job is making sure the students have working technology.

Besides working with technology, he would’ve liked to teach P.E. In fact, one of his hobbies is playing basketball. Did you see him dunk at the staff versus student game? He also enjoys oldies and rap music. Apple or Android? “Apple, of course.” Chick-Fil-A, Canes, or Popeyes? All three because “they’re all super delicious.” Oh, and his favorite color wire is blue.

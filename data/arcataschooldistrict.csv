No School on Monday!

Labor Day is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the first Monday in September to honor and recognize the American labor movement and the works and contributions of laborers to the development and achievements of the United States. It is the Monday of the long weekend known as Labor Day Weekend.

Beginning in the late 19th century, as the trade union and labor movements grew, trade unionists proposed that a day be set aside to celebrate labor. ""Labor Day"" was promoted by the Central Labor Union and the Knights of Labor, which organized the first parade in New York City. In 1887, Oregon was the first state of the United States to make it an official public holiday. By the time it became an official federal holiday in 1894, thirty states in the United States officially celebrated Labor Day.

Episodes are available on the LL&L website and YouTube channel!

Longtime TV producer and host Val Thomas-Matson is the creative force behind “Look, Listen and Learn,” a new community-powered TV series (which airs on YouTube) designed to encourage BIPOC children to take their rightful place in the world. She anchors each episode as Auntie Lena, an ultra-reassuring character who dialogues with a sweet-tempered puppet friend named Possum to explore the meaning of core developmental preoccupations of childhood (e.g., making friends, coping with change) — as well as far more difficult concepts to grasp, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement.

Episodes available on the website include Practicing Courage, What Does ""Black Lives Matter"" Mean?, The Community Garden, and more!

Let National Relaxation Day encourage you to slow down and unwind! It's a day to focus on taking care of ourselves by taking a moment to relax. National Relaxation Day is an important day as we all need a break from the fast-paced and often hectic lifestyles we live. On this holiday, people are encouraged to engage in activities that not only rest their bodies but also their minds as well.

Although a certain amount of stress is normal, too much of it can be harmful to your physical and mental health. Take care of yourself today. Read a book, watch a movie, take a nap, or go for a long walk. Studies have even shown that going on a walk a few times a week leads to improved well-being and lower stress levels! No matter what you choose to do, just remember to take it easy, even if it’s only for a few minutes.

Black Minds Matter was designed as a free, public course to draw parallels between the violence facing Black Lives in policing and the symbolic violence facing Black Minds in schools, colleges, and universities.

In 2017, the first Black Minds Matter course was offered in response to the killing of Alfred Olango in San Diego. As with Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland and many others, Alfred was unarmed and killed by law enforcement officers.

In the wake of the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, Ahmaud Arbery and others, we received numerous requests to offer the course again. This time, Black Minds Matter will include two co-hosts – Dr. Luke Wood (returning) and Dr. Donna Y. Ford (new). Each course will open with commentary from Drs. Wood and Ford and then introduce guest speakers and interviewees who will discuss their perspectives on the education of Black students at all levels of education.

Black Minds Matter was designed as a free, public course to draw parallels between the violence facing Black Lives in policing and the symbolic violence facing Black Minds in schools, colleges, and universities.

In 2017, the first Black Minds Matter course was offered in response to the killing of Alfred Olango in San Diego. As with Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland and many others, Alfred was unarmed and killed by law enforcement officers.

In the wake of the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, Ahmaud Arbery and others, we received numerous requests to offer the course again. This time, Black Minds Matter will include two co-hosts – Dr. Luke Wood (returning) and Dr. Donna Y. Ford (new). Each course will open with commentary from Drs. Wood and Ford and then introduce guest speakers and interviewees who will discuss their perspectives on the education of Black students at all levels of education.

Sunday, June 21 is Father’s Day! Mrs. Sonora Smart Dodd is credited for being the one to popularize this special day, starting events that led to Father’s Day becoming a U.S. national holiday. Her story began as she sat listening to a Mother’s Day sermon in 1909. Mrs. Dodd thought that it might be nice to honor fathers as well. Her father, William Smart, had raised his six children alone on his farm in Washington after his wife died giving birth.

Mrs. Dodd proposed to the Spokane Ministerial Association and the YMCA that they celebrate a “father’s day.” She chose the 5th of June because it was her father’s birthday.

The idea received strong support, but the ministers of Spokane asked that the day be changed to give them extra time to prepare sermons on the unexplored subject of fathers. The first Father’s Day in Spokane, Washington, was observed on June 19, 1910 (the third Sunday in June), and became an annual event there. Soon, other towns had their own celebrations.

Flag Day is celebrated on June 14 each year, and commemorates the adoption of the Stars and Stripes as the official flag of the United States. It is a day to celebrate and show respect for our flag and its designers and makers.

In 1775, the first American flag, called the Continental colors, was created for our fledgling country - but it looked too similar to the British flag. So, on June 14, 1777, the Second Continental Congress passed a resolution that “the flag of the United States be 13 stripes, alternate red and white,” and that “the union be 13 stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.""

It wasn't until 1916, that President Woodrow Wilson issued an official decree making June 14th Flag Day. However, some say the original Flag Day occurred in Wisconsin in 1885, and that Bernard J. Cigrand, a school teacher, began the practice of celebrating the flag’s birthday. He assigned his class to write essays about the flag and its significance.

On Memorial Day, it’s customary to spend time remembering and honoring the countless veterans who have served the United States throughout the country’s history.

Memorial Day commemorates the men and women who died while in the military service of their country, particularly those who died in battle or as a result of wounds sustained in battle. In other words, the purpose of Memorial Day is to memorialize the veterans who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. We spend time remembering those who lost their lives and could not come home, reflecting on their service and why we have the luxury and freedom that we enjoy today. We might consider how we can support and safeguard their grieving families and loved ones who are left behind.

Classified employees work as classroom aides, food servers, custodians, office clerks, groundskeepers, one-on-one student aides, bus drivers, and more. Each one is integral to the school environment. They form relationships with students and model teamwork and good citizenship. Students often know classified staff members by name, and look forward to the friendly faces that greet them each day on the bus, in the cafeteria line, and in the hallways.

Thank a Classified School Employee today!",2020-05-18 19:24:06,,

The date is observed to commemorate the Mexican Army's victory over the French Empire at the Battle of Puebla, on May 5, 1862, under the leadership of General Ignacio Zaragoza. The victory of the smaller Mexican force against a larger French force was a boost to morale for the Mexicans. More popularly celebrated in the United States than Mexico, the date has become associated with the celebration of Mexican-American culture. These celebrations began in California, where they have been observed annually since 1863.

Every year, the National Geographic Society sponsors a geography contest called The National Geographic Bee, and students in the fourth through eighth grades compete to see whose geographic knowledge will reign supreme.

The 4th and 5th grade competitors practiced at their recess, at home, and on the bus, to prepare for the big event. Many thanks to Mrs. Adams for coordinating the event, and Mrs. Yeoman, our presenter, did a terrific job with the pronunciation of places near and far.

This year our first place winner is fourth grade student, Eleanor, and our second place winner is Savanna. All of the students did a fabulous job.",0.0,"Many congratulations to Eleanor and Savanna!

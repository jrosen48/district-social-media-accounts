It has been a joy to see kids returning to the activities they love on the field and on the court. It is very important to me that we begin the year in a positive way, focused on the true spirit of student athletics and activities. While games are competitive, they are also an educational experience for players and students. Parents, fans, and people in the community all set an example for students whether they are aware of it or not. That is why it is imperative that all spectators show respect and sportsmanship and refrain from negative cheers, chants, or behavior. Let’s enjoy every game this season by cheering on our athletes and supporting our coaches and officials who make these events possible. Thank you for following our 24 hour policy before speaking with coaches after games, and for keeping those conversations professional. With your support, we can all look forward to a fantastic year.

We had an AMAZING LAST Competition Day today! All the kids worked so hard with some challenging competitions which included planking (some of our athletes held a plank 13+ minutes....WOW!)

As a reminder, our last summer weights session will be tomorrow EVENING, Thursday, July 30, 2020, at 6:30 p.m. at the Sports Complex. The workout will begin at 6:30 p.m. followed by hamburgers/hot dogs at 7:30 p.m. Parents are invited to attend. 80% attendance as well as the Competition Team Champion will be recognized.

Thank you....Thank you......Thank you......for supporting the summer weights program and bringing and/or encouraging your kids to attend.

We've had a blast!

Parents,

I hope everyone is enjoying the summer. I wanted to take a moment to reach out to everyone and touch base about the upcoming jr high football season.

I know from a meeting with the kids at the end of last season that there is a good number of students who are wanting to play football next year. I’ve set up a class on the Remind application called Archie Jr High Football 2020. This link will allow you to join that group https://www.remind.com/join/archiejr
You can also text @archiejr to 81010 to join.

If your child does plan on playing, or is considering playing, please join the Remind. If you could also email me at my school email address with the following: your preferred email address, your athlete’s name and the best phone number to reach you. This will help me get my list up and running.

I am looking forward to our upcoming season.

Beginning Monday, June 29, we will start our transition back into the weight room and gyms!

We will continue working out 🏋️‍♀️ and rotating in small groups. Weight stations and solid surfaces will be sanitized between groups. There will also be hand sanitizer available for use.

As a reminder, if you are not feeling well 😷, please stay home 🏡. However, communicate your absence in any situation.

The weights program will not be in session between the dates of July 4-11.

We are excited to be able to utilize the facilities again 🌪🏋️‍♀️🌪🏋️‍♀️

Spring is just around the corner. It would be a GREAT time to add some new bricks out at the Sports Complex.

In order to add new bricks to the wall, we need a minimum of 5 orders. The price is $100/brick. This is a great way to honor or memorialize someone special.

If you would like an order form, please comment below.

Great turn out of parents and students to the art opening at Emerson Art Gallery for 5th grade Archway Cicero students. My scholars got to experience the gratification and honor to have an artwork showing in art gallery and their parents shared in their child's accomplishment. I truly wanted to give them the gift of self confidence in their artistic expression before they left our school. I wanted to make sure that before they leave they have learnt a way of channelling their emotions and give the gift of beauty to others...They learnt that hard, patient work pays off, and beauty and artistic expression is indispensable in their lifes. I am so proud of my 5th grade artists, Ms. Laura Thurbon

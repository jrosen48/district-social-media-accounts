Give as many choices as you can while the price tag is small so you can gain control when the stakes are higher.

When giving choices, begin with phrases like:
“What would be best for you…”
“Would you rather…”
“Feel free to…”
“You can either…”

Only give choices you can be incredibly happy about. Kids need to believe (whether it’s true or not) that your life will go on and you’ll be happy no matter which choice they make.

Never give a choice only after they have argued with your original decision. This shows the child that they can manipulate you.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3004241752943822&id=878136802221005,,0.0,"The Love and Logic Guide to Giving Choices - Loveandlogic.com

We have another project starting for Arcohe School. The front garden bed needs to be rehabbed.
I am bidding on 6 lots of concrete block and bricks stacked on pallets at a Galt area ranch on Jahant Rd.

A few of these lots have as many as 5 partial or full pallets. I will have an exact count next Monday, but my estimate is no more than 20 pallets. I will know by Tuesday, March 17th at 1 pm, if I have won the auction.

Meanwhile, I will need to arrange a pickup at the ranch location on Wednesday, March 18th, 9-4 pm. There will be a forklift at the ranch, but none at Arcohe. So, I would appreciate a truck(s) and/or trailer(s) and the use of a forklift at Arcohe. All pallets would be placed on the East campus, on the East end of the campus in proximity to raised beds adjacent to the football field.

Please let me know if you can volunteer your time and/or your equipment.

My phone number is: 209.744.6979. Thank you!

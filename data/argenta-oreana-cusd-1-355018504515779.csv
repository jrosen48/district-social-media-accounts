Today, Governor Pritzker reported at his press conference that he will extend the mandated school closure through Thursday, April 30th. This means the earliest we could return to school is Friday, May 1st. Like you, we have no idea if the mandated closure will be extended again.

We anticipate that the district’s Remote Learning Plan will be posted on the district’s website no later than 5:00 pm tomorrow. Links will be provided for each school. Our plan will be continuously evaluated and updated as we move forward. Please review the plan for further guidance.

We know that this is a situation beyond any of our control. We will get through this together. Our biggest concern is the safety and security of our students and staff.

We will continue to utilize Facebook, Twitter, and our web site for further updates.

Dear Argosy Collegiate families,
During today's virtual staff meeting, Argosy Collegiate staff observed a moment of silence honoring the life of George Floyd, an African American man who was needlessly killed in Minneapolis last week. Argosy Collegiate stands with the Massachusetts Charter Public School Association in taking a stand against systemic racism.
The life of George Floyd, in addition to the lives of so many other Black Americans who have needlessly left this world far too soon, reinforces the importance of strong public education that focuses on fostering empathetic, compassionate, hard-working individuals that embrace diversity.
If you or your child need support during these troubling times, our school adjustment counselors and school psychologists are available. #BlackLivesMatter #SayTheirNames #EnoughIsEnough",,,0.0,"#blackout

Argyle ISD Superintendent Dr. Telena Wright has joined with other Denton County Superintendents and elected officials in requesting the state suspend STAAR testing for the 2020-2021 school year.

This formal request was sent to Governor Greg Abbott and Texas Education Agency Commissioner Mike Morath stating the need for the state to suspend STAAR along with the A-F grading system due to the current COVID-19 pandemic.

The letter states that by suspending the test and grading system it would allow schools to continue to maintain a safe and secure educational environment while allowing schools to provide quality education specific to each student's educational needs.

After schools began to close across the state in March due to COVID-19, Governor Abbott waived STAAR testing requirements for the 2019-2020 school year.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3122061994544348&id=264500040300572,,0.0,"Dr. Wright Joins Denton County Superintendents Requesting STAAR Suspension

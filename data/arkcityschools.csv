Monica is known for her warm, welcoming demeanor and her meticulous organizational skills.

In fact, she treated all students as if they were her own grandchildren.

Kelly was a Jeffy Pup for 30 years. She was always kind and helpful to her colleagues as well as patient, loving, and nurturing to her students. Having worn many “hats” at Jefferson, she was kind of the go-to person. No matter what she was in the middle of, she was always willing to stop and help and never complained. Kelly has one of the biggest, kindest hearts and has been greatly missed since her retirement earlier this year. Congratulations, Kelly!

Caroline Bruce has 28 years of Head Start education experience and 20 of those have been with us. As the director of Head Start, Caroline has helped influence and shape the lives of our youngest students and their families - a role she’s enjoyed every minute of. Federal programs bring about a unique set of expectations, regulations, and guidelines but Caroline has managed everything in a way that makes it look easy. She is incredibly organized, knowledgeable, and compassionate toward the families she serves. Her calm and steady presence will be greatly missed. Caroline, we wish you more downtime and quality time with your family during your retirement. Congratulations!

We are excited to announce that Kansas teachers, students and parents just got a new partner in their continuous learning efforts.

Thanks to the support of Kansas Public Broadcasters, Kansas students will receive supplemental education content by way of a new television program produced by Kansas PBS stations and KSDE, and hosted by local teachers. The new program called Learning Across Kansas will begin airing the week of April 20.

Each 30-minute segment, individually produced for elementary, middle school and high school students, will feature grade-specific educational content delivered by our very own Kansas teachers who serve on KSDE’s Continuous Learning Task Force.

Teachers, students and parents/caregivers, tune in for short, fun and engaging lessons. Plus, you just might see one of your own teachers presenting!

Parents can come to their child’s school between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. and again between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. You will be contacted by your child’s school with any specific instructions.

Keeping everyone’s health and safety in mind, this will be a curb-side pick-up process. Families will not be allowed in the buildings and students’ belongings will only be released to adults. School personnel will wear gloves and will disinfect all plastic bags before handing them to parents.

Parents should make every effort to retrieve items during the set times. If that’s not possible, please contact your child’s school to make arrangements. Thank you!

Yesterday was Middle School Ag Academy, where our Exploratory Ag students competed against other middle school ag students in the South Central District to test their knowledge of the industry. Not only did they compete, but they also got to participate in leadership, teamwork, and icebreaker workshops. The best news... We came in with a 2nd place finish!!! Craig, Mia and Stetson even placed in the Top 10 individuals! Another cool part about yesterday was that some of our very own high school FFA members put on a workshop for the younger students.

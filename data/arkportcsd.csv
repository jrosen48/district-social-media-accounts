A: All PK-12 teachers will be using Schoology so families will have just one system for accessing learning materials, assignments, grades and communications. Schoology will streamline the academic piece so that there is less stress at home surrounding student work. In order to address emotional health, students will be engaging in social emotional learning each week. Our PK-12 school counselor will continue to maintain an online bank of resources which can be accessed by parents or students at any time. Parents/guardians should always feel free to contact their students' teachers or the student services team with questions regarding emotional health.

It is so awesome I want to thank all the medical personnel who are working so selflessly to provide for those effected by this pandemic.
If you are a Dr, nurse, EMT, urgent care worker, or any other in the medical field who graduated from ACS, please post your name and the year you graduated.

I also need to add firemen and police for all you do everyday in many ways.

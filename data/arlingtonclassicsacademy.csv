Help us meet this year's $30,000 district goal on Sept.17th and our wonderful administrators will get showered in foam the Friday before Fall break. It will be filmed of course and shared after the break. And if you want to be the one to press the button and let the foam fly, there will be a random drawing from all our super fans that created their own FUNdraising page for ACA on the North Texas Giving Day website. One student family will be randomly selected from the ACA FUNdraising pages and must be available after school on Friday, Oct 9th. Create your FUNdraising page by visiting https://www.northtexasgivingday.org/arlington-classics-academy, click on ""Create a FUNdraiser"" and follow the prompts. Thank you for helping our #GriffinsTakeFlight.

Unfortunately, TEA was not able to provide the guidance for re-opening that we were waiting for today. However, the ACA Board of Directors will still hold the virtual special called meeting this Thursday, June 25, at 7:00 p.m. in order to further the conversation of our fall plan development.

Due to the impact this plan will have on all of our ACA families, we have made this meeting a live webinar so that more families can view the meeting. Since it is a virtual meeting, there are very specific steps to take in order to address the board in an open meeting. The details about Thursday's meeting can be found on our website under ""Board of Directors: Meeting Agendas"" or at this link: https://www.acaedu.net/Page/644

We value the partnership we have and the community that is ACA. Our Griffin Tribe will thrive despite recent events and I assure you that your student will have access to the stellar education that ACA has brought to our community for over 20 years.

We sympathize with each and every one of our ACA families as we all work together to overcome the challenges and inconveniences the COVID-19 crisis has caused.

ACA continues to participate in conferences with the health department, Texas Education Agency, and other local agencies.

The best way to address the various needs of our families is to first be informed. While we have some previous survey data that we are working from, we would appreciate it if you took the time to update us on the questions in this survey. This will help us make any alterations to our plans that are needed to best serve you during this uneasy time.

Please attempt to coordinate and limit each family to only one response. Your quick response is greatly appreciated.

But I also know...

‚ù§Ô∏èthis down time with your family is an unprecedented gift at this stage of life, cherish it
‚ù§Ô∏èone day you will look back and be amazed at these moments, look for the happy moments - smile and laugh.
‚ù§Ô∏èyour next phase of life will still go on and probably change directions 10 more times, it‚Äôs ok to NOT know what direction you want to go.
‚ù§Ô∏èyou will get through this being stronger, more resilient and compassionate human beings, let this shape you and impact you.

Finally.

‚ù§Ô∏èyou will be ok, I promise, you will be ok.

Your teachers care about you more than you know. We are cheering you on. As always, we can‚Äôt wait to see what you do.

Talk about full circle! Last night, AHS '09 graduate and Arlington Wrestling's Coach Andrew Sossaman faced his former coach, Israel Cordero!

Cordero, who now coaches the Memphis Central Warriors, created and led the AHS wrestling program from 2004 to 2014. Not only did Coach Cordero train Coach Soss, the two of them actually coached together at AHS in 2014. They were also part of the 2007-2008 team to bring home the first Regional championship for AHS Wrestling.

Last night‚Äôs mini-reunion also brought back Chandler Duncan, who graduated from AHS in 2011 and is now the assistant coach for the Warriors.

""I brag all the time,"" Cordero said. ""I'm always very proud of what this team has done over the years. I'd love to take credit and ownership, but honestly, this program has just always produced quality men."" #AHSAlumni #ArlingtonSports #ArlingtonSchools #TigerTough",0.0,"Check out this alumni story! #ACSproud

She comes from a long-line of educators and decided to mix her love of psychology with her family history.

""One of the earliest cases in my career involved a student with extremely poor vision, some other disabilities and a low socioeconomic background. One day, I needed to test her but she didn't have her glasses. My principal and I got into the car and drove to the little girl's apartment to get her glasses so I could assess her. I remember how we tried our best to make this child's life better.

I often think about this family and how much it meant to them that we cared so much and that we went out of the way to get her the services she desperately needed in the school system.

She comes from a long-line of educators and decided to mix her love of psychology with her family history.

""One of the earliest cases in my career involved a student with extremely poor vision, some other disabilities and a low socioeconomic background. One day, I needed to test her but she didn't have her glasses. My principal and I got into the car and drove to the little girl's apartment to get her glasses so I could assess her. I remember how we tried our best to make this child's life better.

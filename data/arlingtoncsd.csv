This event is free and open to the public. We encourage Arlington students and parents to attend together. Visit the News section at www.arlingtonschools.org for a printable flyer!

Chris Herren, a basketball legend from Fall River,Massachusetts, was an All-American, broke scoring records and was recruited by the nation’s top colleges. Herren realized his lifelong dream of playing in the NBA when he was drafted by the Denver Nuggets in 1999 and then traded to his hometown team, the Boston Celtics, before losing his career and almost his family to the disease of addiction.

In long-term recovery since 2008, Chris inspires people to start the conversation on wellness and educate themselves on the disease of addiction.

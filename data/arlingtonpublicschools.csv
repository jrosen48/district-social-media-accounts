Her proudest moment was landing her dream job! As she began looking for open social studies positions, she knew that she needed to find a school that aligned with her values as an educator. She wanted a position in a school system that encourages student-centered learning, celebrated diversity, and fostered an environment of excellence. She was absolutely thrilled when she received the phone call from Mr. Underhill that informed her that she had landed the job at Swanson Middle School! Five years at James Madison University lead her to this point in her life, and she couldn’t be more excited!

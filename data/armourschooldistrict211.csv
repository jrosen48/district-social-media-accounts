Daughter of Ronald Kellogg Jr. and Jennifer Kellogg

Future Plans: Attending Mitchell Technical Institute in the fall to study’s Culinary Arts

What She Enjoyed at AHS: I really enjoyed being a part of plays, both one act and three act. To me, being a part of a group to perform a piece for the community was a lot of fun.

What AHS Taught Her for the Future: I have learned that no matter what, just be your best self. Always trust yourself and stand tall. Don’t let anyone tell you that you are not enough.

Advice to Underclassmen: my advice to underclassmen is to just do your best and enjoy everything about high school. Remember the little moments and try new things every chance you get.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2714364752026600&id=800622110067550,,0.0,"Senior Spotlight!!

Daughter of Ryan and Nicole Neugebauer

Future Plans: Attending Northern State University in the fall to major in Elementary Education

Best Advice Ever Received: If you always try to be normal, you will never know how amazing you can be.

Best High School Memory: There are way too many memories that we made to just choose one. We always have the funniest memories when we are having Homecoming because it is like a free week. We enjoy decorating our float together and just spending time with each other.

What AHS taught her for the future: I have learned to make the best out of every day and make as many memories and friendships as I can. AHS has also taught me to work as hard as you can and never give up. Some work may be challenging, but you can get through it if you believe in yourself.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2707572319372510&id=800622110067550,,0.0,"Senior spotlight!!

As many of you have already heard, the Governor has asked for schools to stay out of the building for the rest of the school year. Although we will not be together in building, we will continue our flexible learning platform through the original school calendar.

Also, teachers are working on cleaning out desks and lockers. We are securing all items into bags that will be sent home with assignments on the Friday after Easter (4/17).

We continue to work on a re-entry plan for the Fall. We are asking for a potential approval of a post-Labor Day beginning to the school year should we need it, but our already approved calendar for next year will be our default primary schedule. We are planning for what could be seen as ""worst case scenario"" and hoping not to need it.

I have attached a graphic of the survey responses that have been received online at this point in time. We have additionally received paper copy surveys that will be tabulated and shared out either this afternoon or evening.

Please keep in mind that the survey was NOT an official vote to build, it was simply a ""temperature check"" on starting the conversation on facility planning. That is why there was not more shared prior to the meeting (although present in our board minutes since last year March), we had no solid information on what costs would be based on building needs to share.

Armour School District's responsibility is to educate and give options. The final decision, if and when it is appropriate to be addressed, happens in an official community vote that requires a 60% super majority.

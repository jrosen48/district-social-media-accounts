Thanks to Mike and Julia’s help, we donated 389 bunches of produce (lettuce, kale, bok choy, spinach, radishes, chives, oregano, thyme) to the school nutrition department which will be shared with community members at Friday’s meal pickup sites. Soon the gardens will be planted with the next round of crops for flexible use (community share, summer/fall learning, etc.) depending on what circumstances dictate.

We’re so thankful to be able to continue to use the gardens for teaching, learning, and community connections during this time!

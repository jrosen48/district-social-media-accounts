Arrow Academy uses a testing program called MAP Growth. The purpose of the test is to get an individualized assessment of where a student is performing academically. Students are tested at the beginning and end of each school year to keep track of their academic progress. Arrow Academy meets a student where they are academically and takes them to where they need to be.

Attached is an informative article from NWEA regarding MAP Growth for students. MAP Growth is a computer-adaptive test that measures what students know, regardless of grade level. Unlike standardized tests, MAP Growth adapts to each student's performance to give a more accurate representation of what they know.

Charles A. Potter of Developing Future Scholars spoke to parents about college planning. Each participant was given a free manual, 12 Steps to College Success. Afterwards, dinner was served and tutorials began. This was a great opportunity for students and their families to get the help they needed to ensure academic success. The faculty and students of Arrow-Odyssey would like to thank St. John’s and its volunteers for their efforts in partnering with us in ‘educating our children.’ The students and families of Odyssey are looking forward to the next ‘Homework Dinner.’",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=230022380527088&id=228611250668201,,0.0,"Odyssey Preparatory - Thursday evening, February 20, our community partnership sponsored our first ever ‘Homework Dinner.’ Volunteers from the congregation came out to provide tutoring and homework assistance in math and reading for students in grades Kindergarten through eighth grade.

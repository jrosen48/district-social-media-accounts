I have been working with both Keep Keith County Beautiful and Western Resource Group to replace the large white container that was here temporarily for plastics and aluminum. That trailer was only available during the winter as it is placed at Lake McConaughy during the summer. I thought I had a replacement lined up to return with the help of the village board. However, there are currently no containers to replace it and the cost of a large container is expensive. However, WRG recently found an old, used stock trailer that can be used for plastics and aluminum cans, and the cost is much less. If anyone has old stock trailers that you are willing to sell, they are interested in purchasing more. You can call Aaron at 308-284-7353.

I wish we weren‚Äôt having to do this online, but here we are so let‚Äôs make the best of it! I‚Äôve emailed all 7-12 students about purchasing yearbooks. Yearbooks are $27 or if your child would like their name printed on the cover of the yearbook it is $30. All I need from you right now is your ordering information. The cost will go onto your student‚Äôs school bill. Please email me with how many yearbooks and if you‚Äôd like a name on them by April 3rd. My email is mandy.vasa@arthurcountywolves.org.

Now, help the yearbook staff out! We plan to make a memory out of this experience. Please email me any pictures you are willing to share of your time at home. This doesn‚Äôt just have to be school work, we‚Äôre going to get creative with some candid pages and would appreciate your help!

Feel free to reach out to me with any questions, it doesn‚Äôt even need to be yearbook related=) I miss seeing you all, can‚Äôt wait until we are back in school again!

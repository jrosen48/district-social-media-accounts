Students will return to school as originally scheduled. That means all primary students will return to school, and middle and high school students on an alternating schedule should attend in person if they are in the first group, usually identified as “A” group for most schools. The second “B” group will remain virtual on Friday.

District staff spent much of today checking on school campuses, testing our infrastructure, and consulting with emergency officials. We are fortunate that Ascension Parish received very little damage from Hurricane Laura, but we continue to keep our neighbors to the west in our prayers.

It was an emotional but EXCITING sendoff for St. Amant High’s Class of 2020 today as our seniors celebrated their very last day of high school...the STA Way! Nearly 300 of our 486 seniors were the stars in their own Senior Parade that ran from the main campus to The Pit, where their class song was playing in the stadium. Teachers lined up with shakers and custom masks to send the seniors off to start the parade, while families and supporters waved signs and cheered on the students from their yards along the parade route. Principal Beth Templet said the entire event was planned as a special way to honor the graduating seniors, who began their high school years during the flood and found their senior year cut short by COVID-19. The event went very smoothly, thanks to tremendous help from the St. Amant Fire Department and the Ascension Parish Sheriff’s Office. Thanks to all the volunteers who helped make this a memorable day for our graduating seniors!

Congratulations to the Senior Class of 2020!

It's time to celebrate all of your many accomplishments and allow STA to take an opportunity to tell you goodbye and wish you well. Due to the COVID 19 circumstances, we will alter our traditions for the last day of school by having a Senior Gator Parade from STA to The Pit instead. Seniors will line up in the Black Lot and the parade will roll at 9:15.

If you would like to participate, please RSVP below so that we ensure enough parking spots for all students. If you have any questions, please email Kellie Gonzales (kellie.gonzales@apsb.org).

We are looking forward to celebrating you! Please look for more information via email and Remind.

Dear Ascension Public Schools Families,

Our first week of school closures due to COVID-19 was filled with a lot of teamwork and heart as we started this transition to distance learning and ""Grab & Go"" student meals. We know not everything went perfectly, but we are all committed to working towards ensuring students have opportunities for high-quality learning each day.

Below is a video that highlights some of the great moments that took place this week and words of encouragement from you, our parents and guardians, for our employees. As we continue on this journey of unknowns, we want to strengthen our commitment to being your partner in this wonderful community. Together, we are #AscensionStrong!

Central Primary Food Drive
By Caden Louque

Central Primary’s November service project was a great success for our community. We collected food items for the Greater Baton Rouge Food Bank for two weeks. We had a competition between the boys and the girls on who could collect the most food items. It was a very close competition, but the girls took the lead with 1,792 food items and the boys 1,704 food items. That is a total of 3,496 food items! Our school has helped many families in our community to have the food they need for the holidays. Thank you for joining us in the fight against hunger!",0.0,"Central Primary Colts

This may also be a good time for you to wash jackets, hats, backpacks, lunchboxes, shoes, etc. For items that cannot be washed, you may want to wipe them down with disinfectant wipes.

Also, please use this chart as a reference to determine when a student should be kept home from school and when they can return.

Oak Grove Primary celebrates International AAC Awareness month with an announcement from 4-H Club Officers Mia Mann and Patrick Finnan Friday, Oct. 18th. As the video shows, the goal of AAC Awareness is to remind everyone there are many different ways people communicate, and even if it takes a little more time to reply we should remember that everyone's voice is worth the wait. 💙

Dear Griffin Families,

The Ascension Parish Sheriff’s Office received a potential threat call. Out of an abundance of caution, we went into lockdown. Law enforcement is on campus, and we are all safe

Please understand, as with any lockdown situation, no one is allowed on or off campus. We look forward to returning back to a normal school day shortly.

Sincerely,

Below is a parent message about the lockdown at Dutchtown High School.

---

Dear Griffin Families,

The Ascension Parish Sheriff’s Office received a potential threat call. Out of an abundance of caution, we went into lockdown. Law enforcement is on campus, and we are all safe

Please understand, as with any lockdown situation, no one is allowed on or off campus. We look forward to returning back to a normal school day shortly.

Sincerely,

Carli Francois

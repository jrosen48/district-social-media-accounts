The BAE Systems Women in Technology (WiT) program started at the company’s Nashua campus 25 years ago. The annual graduation ceremony was held on Tuesday, February 18, 2020, at Sky Meadow Country Club, honoring the 24 young women from high schools around the region who completed the engineering exploration program this year. The WiT program objective is to allow female students in high school who have an aptitude in math and science a practical, hands-on opportunity to explore careers in various technical disciplines. It also provides mentorship to the students to encourage and support them in their pursuit of a technical career. Congratulations to all of the WiT class of 2020 graduates, especially ASD’s own Sarah, Olivia, Grace and Nicole!",0.0,"Academy for Science and Design Charter School added 5 new photos.

ASD Distance Learning or Hybrid Learning Model",0.0,"DUE TOMORROW, July 31 PLEASE
The deadline to notify the school district of what educational learning model you have chosen for your child is Friday, July 31. Parents will need to complete a form for each individual child. If the form is not completed, your child will be enrolled as a Hybrid Learner. If you have already completed the attached form, you do not have to complete it again. If you are unsure if you completed it or not, would be so kind as to complete it again. Thanks!

Good evening and sorry for the late message. With a confirmed case of COVID-19 in our community, the school district feels, for the safety of our students, staff, and community, it is the best decision to temporarily suspend our feeding program. While we understand this is an inconvenience for some stakeholders, we feel this is the most appropriate decision in these very unstable times. Thank you for your understanding, as we gather more information, we will do our best to effectively communicate with all stakeholders when it is safe to re-start the feeding program.

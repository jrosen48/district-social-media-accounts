In order to comply with state guidelines, we will be splitting the camp into two different dates depending on the students’ grade levels. We will adhere to the district mask policy. Please check the attached form to see what dates your student will be attending camp if they are interested. Also, an important thing to note, in order to make sure our stadium complies with the 66% capacity rule, our halftime performances will be during junior high games, not high school varsity games.￼

These guidelines are as follows:
1) All patrons wear a mask throughout the event.
2) All patrons social distance 12 feet (unless it is with your household family).
3) Bleachers must have one empty row between seating (the empty rows are marked with blue tape).
4) Standing along fences is allowable if social distancing and mask mandates are adhered to.

Many of you have been asking about senior ads in the football program. Having the first Home football game the first week of school makes it difficult to make sure every student has the opportunity to buy an ad and get it in there in time for the first game. So we’ve decided that senior ads will be added into the football programs starting on the September 25th home game and will be in all of the other programs for the rest of the year.

Forms for students that are interested in having senior ads will be available in the office on the first day of school and will be due on Wednesday, September 9. We will have programs for the first home game, but they will not have senior ads due to school starting later and time constraint for ordering.

Thank you for your patience as we try to navigate and adjust to the different year that this year is!

With the cancelation of OYE, it put many of our exhibitors in a financial hardship. We are dedicated for our exhibitors and the families of OYE and have since had many sponsors come forward to help those in need. We are very excited to announce the 2020 Financial Hardship Scholarship, which is available to senior market animal exhibitors who did not receive a 2020 OYE Academic Scholarship. Thanks to the generosity of many of our sponsors, we will award 100, $1,000 scholarships to seniors who are preparing to pursue their higher education goals. Applications are due April 10th.

Please remember it is still Flu season.. if your child is not feeling well or has ran fever less than 24 hours before the school day, please keep them home!!

It is policy a child has to be fever free without medication for 24 hours before returning to school. Also, if they have a Dr. Note please make sure they do not return before the date the Dr. has stated on the note.

This is to prevent an outbreak to other students and our staff.

Please be courteous of others during this time of year.

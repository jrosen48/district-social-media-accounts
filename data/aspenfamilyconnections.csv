AEF CONTENT SERIES | What can my child do with all this free time?!
With the school day shortened, parks closed, and all extra-curricular activities on hold, our families are searching to fill the days in a meaningful way. We are fortunate to live in a beautiful mountain town. Getting outside to bike, walk, scooter, hike – all at the proper 6 feet social distance – will definitely help with the cabin fever. For that time inside, we reached out to our Pitkin Library for help – we picked our favorite suggestions from the Aspen Youth Center – and scoured the internet for more. We hope you will enjoy!

Last June, the Aspen School District began the process of developing a strategic plan. It all started with 30+ district employees, coming together to imagine the future of education for our students. Throughout the development of this plan, and as a result of it, we desire to nurture a culture of collaboration and trust.

Creating this plan is a TEAM effort. When all is said and done, the plan should reflect the combined voices of all involved parties: teachers, students, parents, community members.

Stetson Charter School students recently had the distinct honor of meeting Ms. Manya Frydman Perel, a Holocaust survivor, and hearing her story of survival. By the age of 17, she was confined to the Radom Ghetto before being deported to 8 concentration and death camps. Despite living in constant fear, Manya bravely risked her life to save others. She managed to escape a death march from Auschwitz just days before its liberation.

Manya expressed her love for the children sitting before her as they pledged to remember her story and carry on her legacy. “I hope that my life will be an example for others not to take life for granted, not to be prejudiced toward others, and to respect one another. After all, we only have one life to live.”

We are so grateful to Manya and Holocaust Awareness Museum and Education Center for making this powerful educational event possible.

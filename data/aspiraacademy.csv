Teaching outside the building. Our Nature work inspired by the artist Andy Goldsworthy. We visited White Clay Creek State Park and began this sculpture that I am hoping some ASPIRANTES will visit or add to it. The lesson will be posted on Sunday.
Our project is located a little over half a mile on the whitely farm trail. While you are outside with your families think of sharing your creativity with others in the spirit of Goldsworthy. Have fun and keep creating.

Congratulations on finishing elementary school! We can't wait for you to join us this fall as 6th graders. We were disappointed we didn't have the opportunity to show you around the middle school this spring. Hopefully this Virtual Tour gives you a small glimpse of what you can look forward to and answers some questions.

The tour is made for you to explore whatever you'd like. Feel free to reach out to the staff you meet along the way! I'm sure you're a bit excited and a bit nervous (a feeling I've never stopped having about the first day of school).

The tour will take some time to load because we've crammed so much into it. Please be patient, we promise it's worth the wait to meet everyone!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3683055888378115&id=123670407650032,"DOCS.GOOGLE.COM

Every day my heart hurts
because you are not there

I scan the names, view

the video pictures

I see some friends

and yet some

are not there.

Your voice I miss

the way you

get up a dozen times

just to sharpen a pencil

down to its nub

and then ask me

for another.

I have a whole collection

just waiting in my drawer

Yet we can‚Äôt go back

and when we do

You will be

somewhere else

and not with me.

You will grow

and move on
and my pencils will go

to yet another

who asks me for my help

and I will think of you

and wonder whether

someone else will give you

the sharp attention you deserve.

Overview:

WHAT: MARGINAL RISK to SLIGHT RISK of Excessive Rainfall
WHEN: Today
WHERE: across most of southeast LA, southwestern Ms and coastal MS.
CONFIDENCE: Low in the coverage of rain however, confidence is a little higher that a line of storms will develop over the area. The biggest question is where that may occur. If it is east of I-55. The line itself may be very slow to move east while the individual storms move to the northeast which would lead to some locations seeing multiple storms that could lead to rain quickly adding up and with rainfall totals well above current forecast. There is a chance that many locations west of where this line develops could see little if any rain.

Impacts:
The main threats associated with any severe storms will be:
· rainfall of 0.5 to 1.5 inches will be possible. Locally heavy rainfall could lead to ponding of water in low lying areas and areas of poor drainage.
· Isolated flash flooding possible especially if any locations receive multiple rounds of rain and received heavy rain a few days ago.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1905246929612307&id=462036913933323,,0.0,"From NWS NOLA:

Louisiana will enter into Phase One on Friday, May 15, when the Stay at Home order will be lifted and more businesses will open with strict social distancing, enhanced sanitation and required masks for employees helping the public.

Louisianans should still stay at home as much as possible to avoid unnecessary exposure to COVID-19. People who are at a higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 should still stay at home unless they are traveling outside of the home for an essential activity.

Thanks to the hard work of the people of Louisiana under the Stay at Home order, we have seen declining new COVID-19 cases & hospitalizations. This, coupled with increased testing and contact tracing capacity, is what is allowing us to move to Phase One on Friday.

This is not mission accomplished or a victory against COVID-19, but it is a positive and hopeful move for Louisiana. #lagov

Part of our new normal will mean wearing a mask or face-covering in public. Wearing a mask in public is just like holding a door open for someone, it's being kind and courteous, and it will be critical to Louisiana moving forward.

When I say mask, I mean wearing some sort of cloth facial covering. We've seen creative folks make masks out of t-shirts or other household materials, and I am encouraging everyone to begin the process now to start getting them for yourselves and your families.

Take this time to make sure you and everyone in your family has a face covering, you can buy or make masks. Remember, unless you are a healthcare worker, you do not need to wear or purchase N95 or surgical masks. #lagov #MaskUpLa",7.0,"Governor John Bel Edwards

Astoria FFA virtually attended the Oregon FFA State Horse Evaluation and placed 4th in state. Team members were Alivia Rickenbach, Samantha Davenport ,and Jena Russel. Students who participate in this Career Development Event (CDE) gain new insights into equine science by evaluating and ranking horses based on breed characteristics, conformation and performance. Participants defend their decisions through oral reasons in front of a panel of judges.
In this team CDE, students solve problems related to everything from the nutrition and reproduction of horses to the tack/equipment and feed used to care for horses. Participants strengthen their leadership, observation, analysis, critical thinking and communication skills while also developing and exercising a competitive team spirit and building an awareness of career opportunities within the equine industry. #astoriaffa #gofish #ffa",0.0,"Congratulations to the AHS FFA team!

As we prepare for this new and remarkable school year, we wanted to remind parents of a few helpful changes that are happening this year in Astoria School District:

• Astoria School District will be providing all school supplies for students in grades K-12. You will not need to purchase supplies for your student this year!

• Astoria Middle School will not have any student fees, including PE uniform fees, and student planner fees.

• Astoria High School will not have any student fees, including parking fees, sports fees, or any other fees charged in the past.

The decision to provide school supplies and eliminate fees was made before the COVID-19 pandemic and confirmed at the end of June through this years’ school district budget process. We are grateful to have made this decision early, as we feel that it will help our families in their back to school planning and provide equitable access for all students.

When students are allowed to return to school buildings, each student will be provided their own school supplies that will not be shared with other students. These supplies will be sanitized daily while in school.

If students should need school supplies during remote learning, please contact your school’s office and they will help coordinate remote learning school supplies.

Astoria School District is gearing up for Remote Learning 2.0!

We appreciate your ongoing patience and support as we weathered the closure of schools last spring and the immediate shift we had to make as a community from in-class to remote learning. We know it was a challenge for students, staff, and families.

We want you to know that we appreciate and we have listened to your feedback. Over the summer, we have learned from you all and have spent the last several weeks and months preparing an improved model of distance learning for the 2020-2021 school year.

We will be releasing more information over the coming days and weeks about ASD Remote Learning 2.0. While we all wish that we could be in our classrooms together again very soon, we are excited to be able to offer an improved Remote Learning system that we believe will lead to higher levels of engagement and learning for our students, and that includes additional supports and user-friendly features for our families.
Attached you will find a brief overview of some of the improvements we are making to our Remote Learning model.

We appreciate your ongoing patience and support as we weathered the closure of schools last spring and the immediate shift we had to make as a community from in-class to remote learning. We know it was a challenge for students, staff, and families.

We want you to know that we appreciate and we have listened to your feedback. Over the summer, we have learned from you all and have spent the last several weeks and months preparing an improved model of distance learning for the 2020-2021 school year.

We will be releasing more information over the coming days and weeks about ASD Remote Learning 2.0. While we all wish that we could be in our classrooms together again very soon, we are excited to be able to offer an improved Remote Learning system that we believe will lead to higher levels of engagement and learning for our students, and that includes additional supports and user-friendly features for our families.
Attached you will find a brief overview of some of the improvements we are making to our Remote Learning model. We hope that you will participate in our upcoming community forums and will continue to follow the updates on our Facebook page as we continue to work to prepare for the 2020-2021 school year.",2020-07-24 12:00:17,,

• Write your teacher a letter.
• Email heartfelt cards, pictures and messages.

• Create video messages telling your teacher how much you appreciate them.
• Change your social media profile photo to this graphic
• Post positive statements to celebrate teachers on social media.

In keeping with these priorities, it is the school district’s goal to provide an education for ALL students using an equitable and accessible framework of supports and resources that students and families of all backgrounds, resources, skills and stress levels can access during this school closure.

In grades kindergarten through 8, the District’s focus is that students stay connected with their teachers and that they are provided engaging and enriching learning opportunities. With that being said, numerous students and parents have asked for feedback on the work that students are completing each week at home. We are committed to supporting our students and families and anxious to provide adequate and needed feedback as best we can. As such, we would like to recommend the following options for submission of completed school work:

• Upload work to the enrolled and assigned Google Classroom or in Remind as outlined by the teacher(s).
• Complete the assignment electronically and email or send the document via Remind to the teacher(s).
• For print copies, take a picture of the completed work and email or send via Remind to the teacher(s).

The above three opportunities allow for direct submission of schoolwork to the classroom teacher. For students receiving print copies, if the above options to submit are not available, the school district will be collecting school work from your residence on five separate dates.

If you would like the school work picked up from your home, place the completed school work in the Ziploc bag provided when the homework is distributed, then place outside your home in an easily visible and accessible location. If you do not have the Ziploc provided, use any bag or clip to keep the work together. The District will continue to use proper safety protocols for all delivered and turned in paperwork.

• Collection from your home will be between 8 A.M. and 1:00 P.M. on the following dates:
Monday, April 27, 2020
Monday, May 11, 2020
Tuesday, May 26, 2020
Monday, June 1, 2020
Monday, June 8, 2020

Please make sure your child’s name and teacher name are at the top of the page that is being submitted so we can get the proper assignments to teachers. Once your teacher has received and reviewed your paperwork, they will be in contact using their usual method of communication.

The District is working through a final report card system for grades K-8. Although the report card for the end of the 2nd semester will not look the same as previous semesters in terms of letter grades, the District feels that it is important to provide quality feedback that will support and grow our students in the best possible way during the remote learning time.

You are doing a great job! If there is anything the District can do to help along the way, please reach out to your school office or teacher.

Tomorrow, April 6th, will be our first delivery of student work packets. A tremendous amount of work has been put into this process in a short period of time. We will be attempting to deliver nearly 750 packets district-wide. Because of this number and changes in request for packets from digital to print, there may be a possibility that your student’s packet isn’t delivered this week. We are working hard to make sure that every student gets what they need to move forward with remote learning. This is a very fluid process right now. Please let your student’s homeroom/advisory teacher know if you did not get your packet or if you would like to change from print materials to digital only.
These packets will be delivered directly to households beginning on April 6, 2020. The following is additional information regarding paper/pencil packet delivery:

• Deliveries will be door-to-door each Monday between 8:00 am and 1:00 pm, beginning April 6, 2020.

• When a packet is delivered to a household, District Staff will be asked to knock on the door or ring the doorbell, set the packet of learning materials on the doorstep, and step back from the door before the door is answered. There will be no personal contact between District staff and families during this time.

• District staff will also have school supplies, including spiral notebooks, pens/pencils, art supplies, paper, and supplied workbooks. At any time students are in need of further school supplies, please email Heather Hummell at hummell@astoria.k12.or.us or call the District Office at 503-325-6441. Ms. Hummell will coordinate the delivery of these supplies.

Our first priority as a school district is to provide a safe, healthy environment for your children to learn. The novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, continues to impact Oregon communities and regions across the globe. With that in mind, and following last night’s new directive from Oregon State Governor Kate Brown, we will close Astoria School District schools beginning Monday, March 16 through Tuesday March 31, 2020.
During next week, district staff and administration will be finalizing temporary school closure plans. We will send follow-up communication with additional information about remote learning, support resources, food service, long term educational plans and other updates.
While the school district is closed, Public Health agencies recommend that students stay home as much as possible and avoid larger social gatherings in order to help reduce the potential for transmission. We strongly urge families to follow the guidance from Clatsop County Public Health.
We want to share information regarding the following essential services for students and families:
District Office and the Office of the Superintendent
The Astoria School District Office and Office of the Superintendent will be closed to the public, but available for questions or concerns by phone at 503-325-6441

Breakfast and Lunch Services
Breakfast and lunch will be available for children on all scheduled school days – details to follow

Support Services
We know that closing our schools will have a significant impact on our families and we will continue to work with our community partners to identify support services and resources.
Effective immediately, with the announcement from the Oregon School Activities Association (OSAA), we are cancelling all evening events and extracurricular activities. Please contact the District Office if you have questions.
We will remain in contact with public health officials, elected leaders and fellow school districts, and will keep our website and social media page updated with the most current and available information.
I am very grateful to each and every one of you as we navigate this unprecedented public health situation. I thank you for your support and partnership in this effort. Our strength as a community is our greatest asset.

• Is it FAIR to all concerned?
• Will it build GOODWILL and BETTER FRIENDSHIPS?
• Will it be BENEFICIAL to all concerned?

In case of inclement weather conditions, the Astoria School District will either start school with a 2 or 3-hour delay or completely cancel school. Busses will be delayed for 2 or 3 hours. For example, if your child usually gets picked up at 7:35 am the bus should be at your stop at 9:35 am or 10:35 am.

If the weather does not improve within the 2 or 3-hour delay, the remainder of the school day may be canceled. The decision to have a 2 or 3 hour delay or cancel school will be communicated through Astoria School District’s School Messenger phone system. Each family with an active phone number will receive a call and email so if you miss the call you can listen to the message in your email.

This year, we have also implemented text messaging via the Remind App. Please let the school office know if there have been any changes with your contact information.

I want to thank our parents for being so patient with us today. It will take a few days to get everything running smoothly. The kids at Ingleside had a great first day at school. We realize it is hard dropping your children off at the beginning of the year and leaving them with a new teacher. Please know that we love them very much and they are safe when they are at school. 🙂

ACMS MASK REQUIREMENT GUIDELINES

ACMS Students/Parents:

GOOD NEWS!!! ACMS will be following the Physician Task Force recommendation for all students and staff to wear masks during the school day. It is always our number 1 priority to keep our staff & students SAFE! We understand that masks can be uncomfortable, therefore we will be providing “mask breaks” during the day. These breaks will be set at specific times and in social distance settings.

Expecting the BEST!

✔️ We ask that families arrive no earlier than 10:50 am.
✔️ Please remain in your cars, forming a line in the parking lot.
✔️ As you arrive at the main entrance, we ask that only 2 people at a time approach the entrance, and only 1 person per vehicle.
✔️ There will be signage to direct you to keep physical distance from other participants.
✔️ We ask that you wear a mask, if possible.

Our team will work as fast as we can to keep the line moving so folks don't have to wait too long.

To help support the Athens City School District (ACSD) successfully transition to online instruction, Ohio University's Office of Information Technology (OIT) will provide tech support for ACSD students and instructors, helping the district's handful of IT employees keep up with what is likely to be a flood of support calls in the coming weeks.

Starting April 13, families within the Athens City School District may call 740-593-1223 (option #2) for help with internet setup, online learning apps, and device troubleshooting.

“We’re fortunate to have this partnership with OHIO’s OIT to help support our students and faculty in this difficult time,” Tom Gibbs, Superintendent of Athens City School District, said. “We understand the challenges for some in our community when it comes to technology and believe this support will truly help our students in remote learning.”

Calls will be fielded by OIT student employees who worked at the IT Service Desk in the Tech Depot before social distancing restrictions closed that location.

In memory of Patsy D. Barrington
Date: April 11, 2020
Time: 11:00 am

Due to Ohio's Stay At Home Order and restrictions on non-essential items we are changing the format of this event! We hope that you will still participate, making it your own, and running or walking a 5K within your close circle of family members! All of course, with good memories of Patsy in mind!

We want you wear something colorful, play some fun music, and run or walk a 5K on the course of your choice! If you knew Patsy, snap a selfie and post it on Patsyś Facebook wall or tag her. If not, enjoy a run or walk by intentionally putting GOOD VIBES out into the universe! Or, better yet, BOTH!

We ask that you make a donation if you are able. Half of the proceeds go to the Susan Matters and her Family. The other half will go to Kids on Campus.

The Athens Bulldog Elementary X-Country Clubs Sponsor: The VIRTUAL Forget Me Not 5K Run/Walk

In memory of Patsy D. Barrington
Date: April 11, 2020
Time: 11:00 am

Due to Ohio's Stay At Home Order and restrictions on non-essential items we are changing the format of this event! We hope that you will still participate, making it your own, and running or walking a 5K within your close circle of family members! All of course, with good memories of Patsy in mind!

We want you wear something colorful, play some fun music, and run or walk a 5K on the course of your choice! If you knew Patsy, snap a selfie and post it on Patsyś Facebook wall or tag her. If not, enjoy a run or walk by intentionally putting GOOD VIBES out into the universe! Or, better yet, BOTH!

We ask that you make a donation if you are able. Half of the proceeds go to the Susan Matters and her Family. The other half will go to Kids on Campus.

Let us show our appreciation for Irene Hancock, 9th and 11th grade English teacher at Athens High School. She has 1.5 years of experience.

Students call her: Miss Hancock/Lil Teach/Captain Hancock/Chairwoman Hancock. 😄

Miss Hancock loves helping students discover their passion and what drives them. She hopes that what she does each day helps the students gain the confidence to be the best versions of themselves while also learning how to cope with difficult emotions that come with being a teenager - and let's be honest, an adult too!

She LOVES being at Athens High School. She adores her colleagues, students, and administrators. She considers herself very lucky.

Let us show our appreciation for Molly Roach, English teacher and yearbook advisor at Athens High School. She has 15 years of experience.

The best part of her job is when her students start to understand and love a novel that they are reading in class. She loves their class discussions and way, still after 15 years of experience, students can surprise her with new insights that she hasn't considered. She also loves when her students become so engaged in a novel that they beg to find out what happens, or to read more, or they come to class to discuss what they have read the night before.

Alex was a presenter at Prom Impact a few years ago. Since we do not have the Prom Impact event anymore, Alex contacted Judge Stewart who put him in contact with Deputy Jimmy Childs of the Athens County Sheriff Department. AHS has been working with Deputy Childs to make arrangements for the event to be held this coming Friday in the AHS gymnasium from 10:00 am - 12:00 pm. Students will have the opportunity to meet Alex after the event.

Other local high schools including Tri-County Career Center, Federal Hocking High School, Trimble High School, and Nelsonville-York High School are bringing their upperclassmen to the event.

I hope that all CC+ students feel welcome to attend even if they are not usually on campus during this time. If there are any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Mr. Springer at Athens High School.

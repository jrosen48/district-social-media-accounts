Re: Remote Learning Survey Results
Date: June 17, 2020

A survey was sent out to families in early June to gather information on the remote learning experience. The district received 542 completed surveys. To view the results of the survey, please click the picture below.

The feedback provided gives us important information as we look into planning for next school year. The district will be analyzing this data and providing a response, including next steps, in early July. A follow-up memo will be posted at that time. Thank you for your participation completing this survey. Your input and suggestions are so very important as we work on planning for the 2020-2021 school year.

As you may be aware, the Athol-Royalston Regional School District is planning for a full reopening of school this fall. This means that students will return to school as close as possible to the normal date in late August.

In order to ensure the district can meet safety regulations put forth by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, we must gather information on each of your children. Please fill out this survey using a new survey for each child who attends ARRSD schools by no later than July 30, 2020.

Re: Remote Learning Survey Results
Date: June 17, 2020

A survey was sent out to families in early June to gather information on the remote learning experience. The district received 542 completed surveys. To view the results of the survey, please click the picture below.

The feedback provided gives us important information as we look into planning for next school year. The district will be analyzing this data and providing a response, including next steps, in early July. A follow-up memo will be posted at that time. Thank you for your participation completing this survey. Your input and suggestions are so very important as we work on planning for the 2020-2021 school year.

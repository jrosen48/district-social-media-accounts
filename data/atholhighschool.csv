Re: Remote Learning Survey Results
Date: June 17, 2020

A survey was sent out to families in early June to gather information on the remote learning experience. The district received 542 completed surveys. To view the results of the survey, please click the picture below.

The feedback provided gives us important information as we look into planning for next school year. The district will be analyzing this data and providing a response, including next steps, in early July. A follow-up memo will be posted at that time. Thank you for your participation completing this survey. Your input and suggestions are so very important as we work on planning for the 2020-2021 school year.

A survey was sent out to families in early June to gather information on the remote learning experience. The district received 542 completed surveys. To view the results of the survey, please click the picture below.

The feedback provided gives us important information as we look into planning for next school year. The district will be analyzing this data and providing a response, including next steps, in early July. A follow-up memo will be posted at that time.

To my fellow classmates,
this is certainly not how we thought we would experience our senior year. Time for us has been cut short. Senior year is very emotional because it’s a bitter sweet ending to a huge chapter in our lives. I wish you all the best and hope every single one of you accomplish your dreams in life. i wish nothing but happiness and safety to all my peers. I hope one day we can look back at these times and remember what it was like. We all have complained on how we can’t wait to get out of these long halls and yellow colored classrooms but as i sit here in my house for almost two weeks with no contact with anyone besides snapchat, ft, and texting i regret the times i have complained about school. our pep rally’s, lip sync, even mid terms. Hopefully we will be able to go back in May like they say, so we can enjoy our last couple of weeks in athol high.

Athol Triumphs Over Easthampton in Playoffs! Photographs and Story by MItchell R. Grosky

Athol's Varsity Baseball Team combined superb pitching, great defense, and timely hitting to advance in the playoffs by earning a suspenseful 1-0 victory over the Easthampton Eagles. Mark Ferrari gave up only 4 hits, and sent 15 Eagles away with strikeouts. The Red Raiders now advance to the Division 3 quarterfinals which will be on Monday. Bryce King scored the winning run after getting a single and stealing second base. Congratulations to all the players, to Coach Josh Talbot and the entire coaching staff.

I enjoyed the experience of not only watching the game as a fan and cheering on our Red Raiders, but also trying my best to document the action with my camera. I picked up some good pointers from Athol Daily News/Greenfield Recorder Photographer Mike Phillips, as we viewed the game together. Thanks, Mike!

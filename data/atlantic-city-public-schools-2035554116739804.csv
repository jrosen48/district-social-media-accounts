Just a few missed days here and there can add up to too much lost learning time. So please make sure your child is in school every day right up until vacation starts. We also want to make sure that your child returns to school on January 2nd, which will be a full day.

Our teachers will be teaching, and our students will be learning. Please enjoy this holiday season and contact the main office with any questions or concerns.",2019-12-20 18:00:16,,

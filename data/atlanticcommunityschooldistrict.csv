Items ranged from frozen cherries - canned fruits and vegetables - bakery items - fresh sweetcorn - potatoes - cabbage and a variety of snacks. Each family walked away with at least 4-5 boxes of food. This would not be possible without the help of all the volunteers - including food service staff, student council, families, teachers, students and administration. We served over 156 families with approximately 685 individuals benefiting from this food. Our next mobile food pantry will be on Wednesday December 6th at the High school. Truck comes at 330 and we start distributing food at 430 or sooner if we get the tables set up. Everyone is welcome and there are no income guidelines.""",,,4.0,"""The Mobile Food Pantry was held last night Sept 6th from 430-630.

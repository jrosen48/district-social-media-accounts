This past Monday night the Girls Varsity basketball team traveled to face Sturgis West High School. The contest between the two teams was close for most of the game, but the Tritons prevailed 25-23, as Aaliyah Ramos hit two free throws with ten seconds left to secure the victory. This was the team’s first victory of the season.

Top scorers for the game included: Sidney Bednarz (8), Tanea Jackson (7), and Aaliyah Ramos (7). Sidney Bednarz also had 4 steals in the game as part of a stingy Tritons defense.

The team is now 1-1 on the season. Their next game is Wednesday 12/18/2019 at home vs. Avon 4pm.

Our Atlantis Charter Tritons will face off against Cohasset High School at Holbrook High School at 5:00pm.

As this is ACS High School’s first championship game, we are hoping that all of our Triton fans will come out and support our team.

Tickets at the gate are $7 for adults, $5 for students/seniors.

Also, there has been a change of date for the last football game of the season.

Due to the expected lack of player numbers for both schools, the Thanksgiving game, at Randolph High School, has been moved from 11/28/2019 10:00am to 11/27/2019 at 4:30pm. So the game will be held the day before Thanksgiving, and not on Thanksgiving.

Also, there has been a change of date for the last football game of the season.

Due to the expected lack of player numbers for both schools, the Thanksgiving game, at Randolph High School, has been moved from 11/28/2019 10:00am to 11/27/2019 at 4:30pm. So the game will be held the day before Thanksgiving, and not on Thanksgiving.

Thank you all.",2019-11-15 09:17:33,,

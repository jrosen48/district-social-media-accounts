As you know, due to COVID-19, the Class of 2020 was not able to experience all that Atmosphere has to offer its 8th graders. Prom, career exploration, DC trip, Costa Rica trip, graduation at Columbia University, and much more had to be canceled.

Atmosphere created the following video to honor the Class of 2020. This video tries to capture some of what was lost and to give it back to the amazing graduates and their families. The title ""Forever Connected"" speaks to how the scholars finished their Atmosphere careers in remote instruction and our hope that our ""connection"" during this pandemic will endure far into the future.

Thanks to Mr. McCall and Mr. Roman for putting this together.

Enjoy!

Hello Atmosphere!

I have to say congratulations to all of you, teachers, students and staff. You guys have done great. This has been a good start for Atmosphere and I hope we will continue to do exceptional.

Have to s/o Ms. Distangilo for the great party! Had fun as well as the students I'm sure.

Dont forget the summer camp that Atmosphere has for students as well as summer school. And the school garden(which is growing nicely♥). For more info on the summer camp and summer school I'm sure the ladies in the front office will gladly help you.♥
For those that will not be back for next year we will miss you.
Good luck.

Atmosphere have a great summer!!!!;-)

Hello Atmosphere!

Hope everyone is doing well after that ""blizzard."" We've had worse, I think. I'm sure there'll be another one before winter ends.

So this blog will be short and sweet. I want to ask parents, students, and staff of Atmosphere their opinions about the presidential elections. What do you think about each candidate's platform and what they are promising to do for the country? What are they saying about each other and how are they conducting themselves? What are they saying about what is going on overseas and what happened in Michigan?

Tell me your thoughts. What topics are important to you? What do you want to see happen when the next president is in office?

Atmosphere student government, this goes out to you as well. This presidential election is almost the same thing that happened when "" campaigning "" for your position. What say you?

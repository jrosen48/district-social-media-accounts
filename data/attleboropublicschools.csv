Dear AHS Community,
It is with great regret that I share the passing of Shawn Jerauld after an accident today. Shawn had so many friends within both the AHS and ACA Communities. He will be missed. Our sympathies are with Shawn’s family and friends; the ACA Community; and his former AHS teachers.
Please consider supporting his family with funeral expenses. Please see the link below.
In the strongest sense of Blue Pride, I remain,

Dear AHS Community,
It is with great regret that I share the passing of Shawn Jerauld after an accident today. Shawn had so many friends within both the AHS and ACA Communities. He will be missed. Our sympathies are with Shawn’s family and friends; the ACA Community; and his former AHS teachers.
Please consider supporting his family with funeral expenses. Please see the link below.
In the strongest sense of Blue Pride, I remain,
Bill Runey

3/22/2020 Bach suite no. 1 pr√©lude
By Jacob

‚ÄúDear students, parents, teachers and Auburn residents,

I am writing this essay and playing Bach Suite no. 1 Pr√©lude to encourage you to not be stressed about the victims of the coronavirus, for even though it is very serious, we still have each other, which is a very good thing. Even though the damage will be very severe, it will eventually end. Also, if you have a close friend or family member who has the coronavirus your grief is our grief.

Now, I will inform you why I am playing Bach suite no. 1 Pr√©lude. In Bach suite no.1 Pr√©lude, the beginning was very carefree and had a lack of troubles. Suddenly, the music became very restless. The coronavirus has a same story. Before the coronavirus, there was no worldwide trouble. Suddenly, like a lightning bolt during a cloudless day, disaster struck. However, at the ending of Bach Suite no. 1 Pr√©lude, the music becomes peaceful after all that suffering. That is why I hope that the virus would end the same way. I hope you enjoy my music and start to hope again. This concludes my essay.‚Äù

Following Governor Kay Ivey‚Äôs State of Emergency to close schools for an extended period, the time of closure was modified to three weeks and the expectation is to reopen schools on Monday April 6th. However, the safety and wellbeing of our students, staff and their families will continue to be our primary concern.

ACS will continue to share communications routinely via social media (Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram), the system website (www.auburnschools.org) and our mass-notification system, which allows ACS to communicate to all students, staff, and parents via text, email, and phone calls.

We encourage parents to follow their child‚Äôs teacher webpage for age-appropriate learning resources as well as checking their school‚Äôs webpage for additional listings of learning opportunities to utilize at home.

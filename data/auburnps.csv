The word of the month for December at Auburn Middle School is “empathy.” Empathy is generally defined as the ability to sense and feel other people's emotions. In the last few weeks, our AMS students have proven time and time again that they are not only empathetic, but also caring, generous, and thoughtful. The annual Student Council toy drive to benefit Auburn Youth and Family services was a tremendous success thanks to the help of our students, their families, and our staff.

We exceeded our expectations with over 300 gifts donated.

While we wish that we lived in a world where everyone had what they want and need in life, the reality is that we don’t. It fills our hearts to know that we will be making a difference in a child’s life even if for just one day. We hope that the real reason for the season has been sparked in all of our students. #dogoodthings #payitforwardams

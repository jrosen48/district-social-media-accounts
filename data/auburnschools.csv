The Auburn Prevention Coalition wants to hear from you! We are asking you to participate in a confidential community survey if you are 18 or older and live or work in the city of Auburn!

The survey is about concerns related to substance abuse among youth in the Auburn area. We will use the data to guide our work to develop effective substance abuse prevention programs within the Auburn School District and our community. The survey is completely voluntary and anonymous. We will not know your identity and you are able to skip questions or stop the survey at any point. The survey will take approximately 10 minutes to complete.

Gavin Newsom announced today that all public and private schools in California counties on the state’s monitoring list for rising coronavirus infections would be required to close for in-class instruction. In order for schools to reopen, the counties where they are located would have to have 14 days of a declining number of COVID-19 cases, as well as meet other CDPH criteria.

While we desire to open school five days a week with extra health and safety precautions, we must follow the state and local directives. If we see COVID-19 infection rates begin to trend downward, this will increase our opportunity to reopen schools in-person.

In my desire to continue to remain transparent with our AUSD families and the community, we must start our school year with a period of distance learning before transitioning to in-person instruction.

It is our hope that real change will result and is brought about through peaceful demonstration, civic participation, and engagement. If that is to occur, we each have a role to play in standing up to acts of injustice, both big and small, and engaging in the hard conversations to build greater understanding and acceptance. Schools must be part of the solution in creating more equitable outcomes for all our students, particularly students who have been historically disenfranchised by our institutions.

The safety of your child while he/she is on our campus, is always our top priority.

We want to make you aware of a shelter-in-place/lock-down directive that was implemented at E. V. Cain campus this afternoon.

At approximately 1:45 p.m., the Auburn Police alerted our staff to shelter-in-place/lockdown E. V. Cain Middle School as a safety precaution due to a stabbing incident that took place at the Placer County Library Auburn branch, and that the suspect had not been apprehended. E. V. Cain Middle School administration and staff acted swiftly to ensure the safety of our students. Dismissal of students was delayed until Auburn Police removed the shelter-in-place/lockdown and announced an all-clear. At approximately 3:05 p.m., Auburn Police removed the shelter-in-place/lockdown.

We will continue to keep families informed when situations like this occur. Thank you for partnering with us to keep our students and staff safe.

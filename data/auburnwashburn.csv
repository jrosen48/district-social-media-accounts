We asked staff what they would like to tell parents as we prepare for the start of school. Here are some of their responses:

- We are working hard to do the very best for your child! Providing them the education they deserve while keeping them safe is our top priority.

- We miss your kids!

- We consider it an honor that you are trusting your child to us during this scary time.

- Stay positive and reassure your kids that whether they are remote or hybrid learners, we will take care of them!

- Teachers didn't want school to be this way either, no one does. We would love for it to be back to ""normal"".

- Expectations are high.

- Learning will be different than last spring, but it may not be perfect. Please give us grace.

- Safety precautions must be taken seriously by students (at school and home).

Normally, you would have all attended an event at the high school back in March. Unfortunately, with our current reality, that was not possible. As an alternative, the district music faculty have put together this information for you to help your child make the best decision going into 5th grade.

On Tuesday, Live Art Performance Painter Mike Dubus created two large works of art in front of the entire student body at Washburn Rural Middle School. Dubus is an accomplished artist from Kansas City who programs his painting around music and dance to have a fun approach to live painting. When painting for a live audience, Mike has a turning easel that allows him to spin his work and for it to be somewhat of a puzzle for the audience until the painting is nearly completed. The completed paintings will serve as artwork for the school. The event is made possible by a grant from the Auburn-Washburn Public Schools Foundation.

Good afternoon,

I would like to thank the public for their help in resolving an issue we posted about this week in regards to an incident on June 29th. Thanks to your overwhelming support, we were able to identify the individuals in the pictures and made contact with them today.

Initially we took a theft report of items in the area where the individuals were seen. After speaking to them, we determined that it was a misunderstanding and no actual crime occurred. The original post has been removed.

Again, thank you for all your help. We appreciate it and value the partnership we have with the community.

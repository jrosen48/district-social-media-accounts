Dressed up in mask and gloves, these mathematical surgeons went to work on a variety of addition and subtraction word problems.

He consistently helps others in the classroom with tasks and is always the first person to ask if someone is okay or needs help.

So proud of this Gladiator!

He was recognized by Mr. Armstrong for his leadership in PE. He is respectful of his peers and teachers and always ready to take on additional responsibilities. As an example, while he was in the gym to get his picture taken he jumped in and helped a student in Kindergarten who didn’t have a partner.

Way to show your Red Pride!!",2020-01-16 10:57:28,,

Preschool conducted an egg drop today to go along with our farm unit! Yesterday each class made a list of the best ways farmers carry eggs and a list of things they can use to keep an egg safe. The students had free range to use a variety of materials to protect their eggs. The classes then went outside to test their predictions on the playground to see if their ideas kept the eggs safe!

The student projects were very successful and they all had a GREAT time! 😊",0.0,"Riverheads Elementary School is feeling accomplished.

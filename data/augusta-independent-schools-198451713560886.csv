NEW: We have canceled K-PREP testing for the 2019-20 year due to the COVID-19 crisis.

Kentucky Interim Education Commissioner Kevin C Brown:

“I hope this will help ease some of the anxiety being felt among our families. I want our teachers and schools to concentrate on providing a great education to their students through the NTI Program rather than worry about standardized testing. Let’s end this year strong despite the extra stress COVID-19 has placed on all of us.”

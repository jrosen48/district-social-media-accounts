I just want to say congratulations to a man that I truly appreciate being apart of my life in High School. Today Coach Jeff Sweet was given the honor of having Gateway High School's basketball court named after him (Jeff Sweet Court). Coach, you deserve this, but not just for being the winningest coach in Gateway history and leading it's best team to a 2000 Continental League Championship and the 2000 State Final Four, but for showing young kids what leadership looked like. Coach, I meant it when I said you got me ready for the Army.

Having good men and women (Mr. And Mrs. Sundine included) apart of your life at the right time can really make a difference in a young person's life. Thank you for the invite coach, your legacy will live on with in me, and the two little boys you saw sitting next to me tonight which by the way my oldest said he wants to see the videos of his dad dunking, because he doesn't believe half of the stuff people tell him 🤣.

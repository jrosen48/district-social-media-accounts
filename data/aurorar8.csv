Attention Aurora Community Members:

We are looking to expand our Parents As Teachers Advisory Board.

Members of the board are asked to attend two meetings a year (February and October). Members are encouraged to share feedback about the program, offer suggestions for continued improvement, help refer families for our free services, and help increase our presence in the community.

Our parent educators visit families with children prenatal to kindergarten and provide support for school readiness and promote healthy development.

If you are interested in participating on our advisory board, please call Pate at 678-1552 and ask for Mykie Nash or email at mynash@aurorar8.org.

Please share if you are willing.

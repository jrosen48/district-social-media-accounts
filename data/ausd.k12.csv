And, done ✅ Well, for now.
We ended our book distribution week on a high note - literally.

Today our freshmen scored the highest number during these last four days with 1,652 checkouts. Our weekly total was 7,031! That’s a whole lot of books 📚 📚 📚
Jeannine Coover, AHS library tech, said “It was an outstanding end to a very busy week. Thanks so much for all of your hard work!”

Make-up day for book pick up is from 9a-noon Tuesday/Sept. 8.

STUDENTS PLEASE NOTE: If you have any books from last year, we really need them returned. 👍🏽

A copy of the calendar will be mailed home to each family along with information about the learning model for next year. In short, all parents will be offered the option of starting the school year in full distance learning. If health conditions allow, we also hope to offer families a choice of in-person learning combined with distance learning. In the next two weeks, we will be holding webinars with parents to answer questions, etc. about what each learning model may look like so that if options are available, parents will be informed about what choice they want to make for their child.

APPRECIATION REVED UP!
Antioch Middle School staff surprised two of its upcoming retirees with a car parade.
Some 30-plus vehicles drove past the homes of teacher Tricia Campbell and aide Janet Hammack.
Fellow Eagles made signs, played music, honked wildly and yelled well wishes out their windows.
Ms. Campbell has been with AUSD for 17 years. She taught for four years at Dallas Ranch Middle before making her way to AMS.
Ms. Hammack has been with district since 2001.
Both are highly admired by staff and students alike.
Said Principal Lindsay Wisely “We will miss them both a lot. They have contributed so much to our school.”

The Breathing Tool allows us to calm ourselves and check in with how you are feeling. With so much going on in the world, breathing allows us to relax our body, focus on what is important, and proceed with love. We are all currently trying to balance these stressful times. The breathing tool will help you reflect on where you are now and where you want to be.

Let's practice. Close your eyes and breath in deep positive thoughts for five seconds. Exhale and release negative stress. Remember to use the breathing tool to remain calm and centered.

Today was the last day of giving at least one device to each family in the district. Our team - from district staff to administrators and community volunteers - helped hand out 5,000-plus lap tops and tablets to help our students as we begin distance learning during our State’s shelter-in-place.

We were all so happy to see our kids and families come through at Antioch Middle School.

""I'm really proud of the work that was done,"" said Superintendent Stephanie Anello. ""As I looked around, I realized how deep our bench is and how much they all care about helping our students.""

Monte Gregg, Mission Elementary School principal, notes that while these are stressful times, the work and being together with fellow admin was a truly positive experience.

Thank you to all our families for their continued support.

Please stay tuned. We are going to do an inventory of remaining devices and will post a schedule for pick-up of more devices for large families who may need them. First responders and health care workers will have first priority.

SOME GOOD NEWS!
Counselor Violeta Orozco has earned the César Chavez Educator of the Year title.
Awarded by Los Medanos College, Ms. Orozco was honored for her diligent and compassionate work at AHS.
Here are a few details from the nomination:
“Violeta Orozco has countless positive qualities: kind, open, light-hearted.
But what may be her strongest attribute is her compassion for students.
She goes well beyond her job description.
She is non-judgmental in listening to her students’ struggles and is quick to listen and help guide them through any and all issues.
In addition to her role as head counselor, Ms. Orozco helps lead Puente and spearheads the annual Dia de los Muertos event at our school.
She is highly regarded and well respected by staff, including Principal Louie Rocha, who admires her tenacity, her passion for our students and her can-do spirit to go above and beyond.
In her 10th year at Antioch High, she continues to inspire and make strides with our students.”
We’re so proud of Ms. Orozco and lucky to have her in Panther County.

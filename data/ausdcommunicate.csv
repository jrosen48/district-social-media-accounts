Because schools are closed due to COVID-19, families who are eligible for free or reduced-price meals can get extra food benefits to help feed their children. These food benefits are called Pandemic EBT or P-EBT.

Families will get up to $365 per eligible child on a P-EBT card. You can use your P-EBT card like a debit card to buy food and groceries for your children.

Most families who receive CalFresh, CalWORKS, Medi-Cal, or other social services benefits will get a P-EBT card in the mail before May 22. Please keep an eye out for this card in the mail over the next few weeks.

Other families will need to complete a simple and quick online application before June 30, 2020.

We are making history today at 9:00am! Happy Distance Learning Launch Day! Tidings and Teachings will continue; however, our next post will be on Tuesday, April 21. With all of the teachers and staff working to virtually support students starting today, we will be transitioning to once a week postings. Tidings and Teachings will now be posted every Tuesday morning instead of M-F. Thank you to everyone who has given us positive feedback. We look forward to continuing this fun tradition. #alpinestrong #tidingsandteachings #distancelearninglaunchday",2020-04-15 11:00:15,,

It appears the issue has been resolved, and scholars are now able to access and participate in scheduled class meetings via the Zoom app, which is installed on district devices. Instruction will resume effective immediately. Please help ensure that your scholar logs on as soon as possible.
_________________________

Families,

Earlier this morning, we started to receive error messages on Zoom as our instructional staff was logging into the platform for final preparation for today‚Äôs instruction. Zoom has put out a statement that this issue is a system-wide error and it appears as if they are working on a fix as quickly as possible.

For now, unfortunately, your scholar will not be able to access Zoom meetings until the issue is resolved. We are hoping Zoom will have this fixed shortly and are also exploring some back-up options for instruction.

We will be in touch again later with more information as we have it as we hope we can re-start instruction as soon as possible.

Thank you for your flexibility and patience.

Ms.Caruthers' favorite part of teaching at Austin Achieve is being part of a community sharing the same goal for all scholars - to be happy, healthy, learning and always growing. As a minority herself, she understands the importance of education and believes that a great education can transform the lives of her scholars. #WeAreAchieve",2019-11-26 12:28:30,,

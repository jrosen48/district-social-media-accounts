The Austintown Fitch Baseball and Softball teams started practicing but never got to have a season. As a way to send their seniors off in style, a slow pitch softball game was organized pitting the players against their coaches and parents. I was honored to get to attend and capture some of the highlights. Feel free to share this video with the families of those who played.

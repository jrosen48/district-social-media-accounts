Pine Level Elementary is one of 200 schools selected to receive this special designation and receive a grant to fund a community project developed by the school.
Launched by Governor Ivey in December 2017, the Alabama Bicentennial Schools Initiative encourages all public, private, and homeschool students and teachers to participate in the celebration of Alabama’s 200th anniversary of statehood in 2019. In early 2018, all K-12 schools in Alabama were invited to submit a proposal that engages in outreach and improvement projects to connect their classrooms with their local communities.
From a competitive pool of nearly 400 proposals, 200 schools were selected to be official Alabama Bicentennial Schools and receive $2,000 grants to support the implementation of their projects. Additionally, 56 schools received honorable mentions and $500 grants. Schools were chosen through a review process involving committees of local educators, community leaders, and private citizens.
Representing all corners of the state, the selected schools have developed a wide variety of projects that will make meaningful contributions to their local communities.
Mountains, beaches, lakes, canyons, musicians, artist, inventions, natural resources…the list can go on and on. Alabama is home to many great cities and a variety of rich experiences that many people have never explored. After discussing with administrators and educators, our team felt that the students at Pine Level Elementary needed a sense of understanding of our states geography. The project will consist of a large magnetic map that will be displayed in the front hall of the entrance to Pine Level Elementary. All students will have opportunities throughout the year to interact and learn more about our great state and its many resources. Not only will the map be used for the Bicentennial Celebration but for many years to come. Making connections help students grasp ideas and understand more about their surroundings.
“The Bicentennial Schools Initiative is not only a special way for students to take part in celebrating our 200 years of statehood, but also an opportunity for them to engage within their communities. It fosters a love for the state they call home, and it instills in them the courage to make a difference,” said Governor Ivey.
Mrs. Harry, principal stated , “We are very honored and excited about receiving the grant. Not only do we get to celebrate Alabama’s 200th birthday, but our students and community will learn more about our great state.”

Under the direction of David Simpson, the band’s halftime show, Motown Soul, included the hits, Get Ready, I Want You Back, Superstition, Papa Was a Rollin’ Stone, Respect, and When a Man loves a Woman. Mr. Simpson has been a band director for over 25 years and has been at Marbury High School for 15 years. He is also band director at Marbury Middle School. The auxiliary sponsor is Mrs. Kim Hicks. She is the guidance counselor at Marbury High School.

The Northstars began their successful marching season back in July with summer band camp. The students worked extremely hard in the heat of summer to get ready for the marching season. Summer camp concluded with a performance for parents and supporters on July 27th. Meet the Bulldogs on August 12th was the first public performance of the year. The following week began the Marbury Bulldogs football season. The Northstars Marching Band performed at each game, entertaining football fans at home and away. Practices continued after school each week and the band improved their show in preparation for the contest season.

On Saturday, October 7th, the Marbury Northstars attended the Southeastern States Marching Contest held at Troy University. They received all superior ratings in overall band and the following categories: drum major, drumline, color guard and majorettes.

On October 14th, the Northstars traveled to Prattville to attend the Heart of Dixie Band Festival. This contest is a special one for the Marbury Northstars. Back in 1980, the band began competing in marching contest and The Heart of Dixie was the very first contest for the Northstars. Keeping with the winning tradition of the past, the Northstars received all superior ratings for overall band, drumline, color guard and drum major.

On November 4th, alumni of the Northstars band gathered for the first Northstars Alumni Band. Twenty-two alumni members from various years played once again with the Northstars. They played with current members of the Northstars band in the stands. A few were even able to play with their children. This fun event brought back many memories for the alumni and created new memories that will last a lifetime. Once a Northstar, always a Northstar!

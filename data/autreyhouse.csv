It's almost time for the annual Autrey Family and Friends Reunion. It will be held Sept. 24th at the Autrey House in Dubach, La. You can learn all about it at the ""Absalom and Elizabeth Norris Autrey Annual Reunion"" facebook event page. There are also some updates about the Autrey House Museum posted on the ""Autrey House Museum"" facebook page.

You'll read there about a fundraising project sponsored by Jeff and Yvonne Autrey, to benefit the Autrey House Museum. They have arranged for Tommy's tees in Ruston to make tee shirts with the Autrey House photo. I'm enclosing the link for any who would like to purchase the shirts.

He chose the Alamo as one of those sites. One of the things I had discovered about a year ago while doing genealogy on my Autrey line is that Micajah Autry is a possible distant relation. I am still researching this line but I believe Micajah is the grandson of my 4X great grandfather, Cornelius Autry from Sampson, North Carolina.

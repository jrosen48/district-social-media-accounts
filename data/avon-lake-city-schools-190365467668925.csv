All home events will be posted on our box office, which can be accessed at the link below. Tickets will not be sold at the gate.

The tickets you purchase are for family members only, which can include your child. Per Governor Dewine’s order and reinforced by the Lorain County Health Commissioner, tickets cannot be bought by students who are non-family members. Any student coming to the game without a parent will not be admitted into the event. We are really sorry, but we are under strict guidelines. Make sure you are selecting the correct event as there will be multiple events listed in the box office.

Upcoming Events | Avon Lake City Box Office",2.0,"TICKET INFO FOR GAMES FOR FAMILIES:
All home events will be posted on our box office, which can be accessed at the link below. Tickets will not be sold at the gate. You will need to enter your child’s access code to purchase your tickets. The amount of tickets available to buy may vary as we may make adjustments as we analyze the attendance. The tickets you purchase are for family members only, which can include your child. Per Governor Dewine’s order and reinforced by the Lorain County Health Commissioner, tickets cannot be bought by students who are non-family members. Any student coming to the game without a parent will not be admitted into the event. We are really sorry, but we are under strict guidelines. Make sure you are selecting the correct event as there will be multiple events listed in the box office. Contact the athletic office if you have any questions. brent.schremp@avonlakecityschools.org or 440-933-5164.

Dear Students, Parents/Guardians, and Staff,

Thank you for the hard work everybody has put in the last two weeks. As we continue with our ""new normal"" we need to keep our communication lines open (students, teachers, staff, and parents/guardians) and work together to get our social and academic needs met.

We have been sending a lot of written messages lately so I thought I would change it up with a video. To view the video, please click on the link here. https://www.avonlakecityschools.org/news/?action=show&id=5875

I hope everyone is remaining healthy and I hope everyone is working hard to follow the Governor's ""stay-at-home"" rules. Together we can reduce the spread of COVID-19 and get us back to school as well as back to a more normal way of life!

Greetings Avon Lake School Families,

Due to the recent directive from Governor DeWine, all Avon Lake City Schools playgrounds are closed until further notice. Thank you in advance for recognizing this closure as an important tool to help stop the spread of COVID-19 (coronavirus) within our community. Tape has been placed on all playgrounds as a visual reminder of their closure and are not to be used by anyone at this time.

Currently, all Avon Lake City Schools tracks are open to the community to walk/run/exercise. However, social distancing must be followed to maintain the safest environment for everyone enjoying the space.

We are all in this together to help combat “community spread” and appreciate your efforts in supporting the health and safety of all Avon Lake residents.

The new mural - just a tease of it in the picture below - will be on display permanently and include additional magnetized bottle caps and a large activity board, for kids to craft their own mural.
The project was created as a way to bring awareness to recycling, using recycled materials, and show a bright and colorful example of how to use recycled objects in a fun and unique way!
The Library is a proud partner and supporter of projects like this and we are thrilled to have a new display in DiscoveryWorks! Our thanks goes out also not just to Katherine, but we are grateful for the outpouring of support by the community who brought in literally 1,000’s of bottle caps over two months this fall to help make this project a reality.

UNICEF is the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund, and their programs are varied and far-reaching. They provide clean water, medicine, vaccines, support for schools, and much more in countries all around the globe. Donations as small as $1 can provide safe water to a child for more than 2 months!

So, if a child trick-or-treats at your house for candy, AND for UNICEF, please consider a donation, no matter how small. Last year, we were able to donate almost $300 as a group and we hope to surpass that this year! If you don’t live near Erieview, but you’d like to donate, please contact Kathy Walker, leader of the group at Katherine.walker@avonlakecityschools.org

Avon Lake City Schools",8.0,"When it becomes necessary to close Avon Lake City Schools due to inclement weather or other causes, the CodeRED system will be used whenever possible. Please continue to monitor the local radio and television stations, as they are also contacted requesting they include Avon Lake City Schools on their school closing lists.

Once operational later this fall, we will also be sending school closings via text messages to parents, students and staff who have signed up to receive text messages through SchoolMessenger.

We will be sending a “test” text on Nov. 4 at 3 p.m. so please be sure to register before then. Instructions on how to sign up for text messages can be viewed here. https://www.avonlakecityschools.org/platform/cms/SMS_Text_Opt-In_Flyer_67587_for%20Avon_Lake.pdf

School closings are also posted on our district website: www.avonlakecityschools.org. Parents and students are reminded not to call schools or school officials with questions about school closings. Normally, the decision to close school is made between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m.

Greetings! We hope everyone is doing well! A Band Booster grandparent was kind enough to sew cute little plush bees (about 9"" big) from the old middle school concert uniforms (see attached pictures). We had originally planned to sell them at the Pops Concert, but here we are...We thought people may still be interested, especially graduating seniors since they were the last group to wear the uniforms. We would like to offer them out to the band seniors first as we have limited quantities . They are $25 each. Please contact Juli Drake if interested (248 840 3016). Pickup options include: pickup with cap and gowns, or porch pickup/drop-off. Payment can be made via PayPal (preferred) at bandboostersavondale@gmail.com. Cash or check payments can be arranged (with social distancing :) ). Please let me know if you have any questions and feel free to pass this to any senior (band or not) you like. Take care!",0.0,"CHECK THIS OUT ....

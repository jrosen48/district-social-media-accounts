Arcadia Valley R-II Schools has made a change in the 2020-21 School Calendar. The first day of school with students will now be Tuesday, September 8.

The main reason for the change was made in response to current and pending situations with staff members, including some key staff members, relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.

AV Schools still plans to begin with the option of face to face learning, in addition to the virtual option on that date. The prior scheduled days lost will simply be added to the end of the year in May, so that no school days will be lost.

We are truly sorry for the inconvenience this has caused.

Please contact your child's building office between 8:00 - 3:00 M-F if you have any questions.

After graduation, Allie plans to attend St. Louis College of Pharmacy. A decade from now she hopes to be in her career as a dentist, starting a family, and owning her own home.

While in high school, Allie was involved in Pep Club, Art Club, and NHS. Her favorite memory from school was the day so many students all wore red in support of one of their peers. The thing Allie will miss the most are her daily lunches in Mrs. Turner's room with friends.

Allie's staff shout out goes to Mr. Hargiss for always proving that there is light at the end of the tunnel!

Quartz Hill High School
November 19, 2019 at 9:16 PM ·

Dear Quartz Hill High School family,

This afternoon, Quartz Hill High School was made aware of a social media post by one student referencing an alleged threat of another student. The social media post was immediately reported to the Lancaster Sheriff Department and promptly investigated. Both parties have been identified and we will continue to work with our local law enforcement agency.

We appreciate those who reached out, notifying us of the concern, and take this opportunity to remind everyone- If you see something, say something.",2019-11-19 23:19:14,,

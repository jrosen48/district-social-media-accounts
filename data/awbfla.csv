GOD calls children a blessing and a gift. Their spirits are filled with innocence, joy, and laughter.
While attending THE Grambling State University studying Social Work, one of my professors stated that I will be a teacher teaching younger children. GOD ordered my footsteps allowing me to work over 17 years in the Social Work field with children and their families. During that time,
I was able to better understand that you never know what a child has gone through the night before coming to school.

As you may have guessed, if you have kiddos in AWV School district (k-8) the spring dance show that was going to be held this friday the 20th..is now cancelled. I couldn't tell you for certain if it is going to be moved to another day or if it will be cancelled as a whole. I promise to inform you as soon as we get it all taken care of. Thanks in advance!

Please share to get the word to those parents:)",0.0,"Laine Miller

Just a few reminders.... the cost for tonight's game is $8 (price set by the state), AWV passes don't work tonight, parking spots on the hill are still reserved, and there will be limited parking on the east side of the field (be sure to pay attention to the markings on that side.)

Due to the situation in the spring all students were granted eligibility at the start of this school year. Moving forward eligibility will be reestablished based on the first quarter of this school year.

This means that students must have a 2.0 and cannot have any F’s on the 1st quarter report card. We want everyone to understand this so when it comes time for us to begin athletics and activities that are sanctioned by the NMAA, we understand that eligibility does count.

We are serving from 11:00 AM – 12:00 PM at McCoy Elementary, Lydia Rippey Elementary, Aztec High School and First Baptist Church.

We also have buses that run between 11:00 - 12:50 at sites around the district. Meals are available for students enrolled in Aztec Schools and Mosaic Charter School. If you have a student in McCoy, Rippey, Park or Vista Nueva, those students are all served meals free of charge. If students are from Koogler, AHS and Mosaic, they will need to complete a new application for Free and Reduced meals. Those can be picked up at any school or the Administration Building. We look forward to serving all our students across the district. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to the Foodservice office at 599-4351.

The purpose of this correspondence is to inform you that our on-line learning program for the elementary level will be changing. Originally the district had planned to use the K-12 program for our students in grades K-5 who opted for online only. We were informed today that the Public Education Department is reducing our funding. For this reason, we are now going to offer total online instruction provided by Aztec teachers via Google classroom. It will be called AMSD Online Learning. Instruction for the AMSD on-line program will begin on August 10, 2020.
We will still provide devices for this program if you need them. We will also provide technology support as needed. We hope that using Aztec teachers to provide online instruction will make our students and parents more comfortable with online learning.

Again thank you for considering the AMSD online program.

We have received a lot of questions around our reentry plan. We are still working on this plan and will be finalizing it in the next couple of weeks. In fact, we will be calling you next week to get another important question answered from you on what your plans are for your son or daughter, so we can put some final details together. Please know that a staff member will be calling.

We have posted a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document on our website for you to review. As much as we are trying to stay on top of all the questions coming in, we just cannot manage all of them. We have tried to address the most common ones on this document. We will continue to monitor Facebook and update this document.

We appreciate your patience and know that one important action is our Board of Education will be adopting the adjusted calendar for next school year.

Greetings:
The Banner project is complete, but many of you have asked about helping our Seniors. Our AHS Student Council is sponsoring a Yard Sign drive for all Seniors in our district. So if you still want to help make this a Special Graduation, given all that our Seniors are going through, here is some information on a yard sign campaign.

Attached you can see what they look like and if you would like to purchase a yard sign for a senior they are $10.00. All you have to do is contact Sandra at Finish Line Graphics with your payment information at 334-1694 or you can mail a check to:
Finish Line Graphics
1100 W. Aztec Blvd
Aztec, New Mexico 87410

Thank you AHS Student Council for Sponsoring this and thank you to everyone for making this Month of May and Graduation Season a Special one for our Seniors.

Just put a note in the memo section that it is for a yard sign.

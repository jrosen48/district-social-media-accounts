Dear AUSD Community,

This afternoon, Dr. Debra Duardo, Superintendent of the Los Angeles County Office of Education (LACOE), announced the recommendation that schools remain closed until Tuesday, May 5, 2020. This recommendation was made in consideration of the Los Angeles County ‚ÄúSafer at Home‚Äù and the Governor‚Äôs ‚ÄúStay-at Home‚Äù orders. Based on this recommendation from LACOE, schools in the Azusa Unified School District will remain closed until Tuesday, May 5, 2020.

The health and safety of our community is our utmost priority. We, along with the Los Angeles County Office of Education (LACOE), have been closely monitoring the development of COVID-19. We understand that this extension will raise a lot of questions. We will continue to provide updates as we move into the next steps of planning and implementation for extended school closure. This continues to be a rapidly evolving situation. We are thankful for your patience and understanding as we navigate this together.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1253443684845234&id=398332250356386,,0.0,"March 20, 2020

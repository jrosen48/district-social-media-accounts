A date has not been scheduled due to the Nation's current Stay at Home order that runs through June 4th. At this time, I have not heard any information about whether or not the order will end on June 4th or if it will be extended to a later date.

The health and safety is of utmost importance, so we want to be sure that our plan keeps the students, families, community and staff as safe as possible.

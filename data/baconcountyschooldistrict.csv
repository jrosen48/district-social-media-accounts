Directions for Packet Pickup 🍎

On Friday, parents/guardians can pick up their child’s or children’s belongings and work for the rest of the year. To make things flow smoother and quicker, we have spread teachers around the campus. Parents and students will not get out of the car. Pull beside the teacher’s area and the teacher will give you the student’s bag.

Please read the following instructions.

Pre-K and Kindergarten teachers will be located on the bus yard.

1st and 2nd grade teachers will be located around the pick-up loop. Parents will enter through the middle parking area. First grade parents will veer to the right and second to the left.

Parents with more than one child will go to the youngest child’s teacher’s area. For example, I have a second grade student and a kindergarten student. I will pick up both students’ belongings at the kindergarten area.",4.0,"May 1st from 1:30-6:30 ~BCPS Parents! Read Carefully!

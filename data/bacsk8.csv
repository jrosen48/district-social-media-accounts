7,502 pounds.

Yes, seven *thousand*, five hundred and two pounds.

That’s how much food was distributed this weekend as part of Social Change’s response to the immense need created by this crisis.

This is the sort of work supported by our fundraising campaign that ends next week.

Next week next week. Lol

Have you given or shared our fundraiser yet? 🙂

Every cent and every share matters.

If you can, take a moment to give and/or spread the word today (link below)!

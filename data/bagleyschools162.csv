Happy Tuesday Bagley Flyers! Last night the Bagley School Board hosted a live Zoom session, that had over 100 guests. We reviewed our plans for the upcoming school year. The Bagley School Board had a focused discussion and brought up important concerns and advocated what they thought was best for our students. Three motions were put forward and resulted in a tie vote. Because of the three failed attempts to pass the motion, the action item was tabled to a later date. The special board meeting has been set for Saturday, August 22 at 8am.

Superintendent Update
August 11, 2020
Today, the Oregon Department of Education released updated guidance giving flexibility to rural school districts in determining when and how to reopen schools. The prior metrics sent out by the state on July 29 would have made it almost impossible for Baker School District, and other rural districts, to operate in person schooling this coming semester due to the number of COVID-19 cases occurring within the county. Under the guidelines released in late July, Baker Schools could not be allowed to reopen if there were more than 2 newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases in a one week period.
The new guidelines issued today are a result of strong messaging from regional School Boards and their superintendents, County Health Departments, County Commissioners, Representative Mark Owens and Senator Lynn Findley. This group encompasses districts represented in 7 Eastern Oregon counties. The Governor’s Office, Oregon Health Authority and the Department of Education responded to these concerns by adopting new guidance for schools that are in counties of less than 30,000 population and have a population density of less than or equal to 6 people per square mile.
“I am grateful for the consideration given by our state leadership in this matter,” said Superintendent Mark Witty. “These new metrics will give us a good chance of getting back into in-person school much sooner than it would have been otherwise.”
Baker School District is working closely with the Baker County Health Department to determine the appropriate time to move forward with in-person schooling.
A team composed of district staff and administrators made a presentation to the 5J Board last week recommending the district begin the school year in a comprehensive distance learning format, based on the July 29th state metrics.
Although the state has adjusted the metrics for rural districts, state guidelines dictate there can be no community spread within the school enrollment area, as determined by County Health Officials. Baker has not yet met this metric.
The Baker County Health Department is continuing to monitor the situation through case investigation and contact tracing to determine the level of community spread and risks to our population. They will keep as paramount the safety of our students, staff and greater community as they advise the district regarding in-person schooling.
County Health guidance continues to emphasize the need for all members of the community to practice basic health recommendations: wash your hands regularly, watch your distance, wear your mask and avoid large gatherings.
Witty stated that the goal remains to move into in person instruction as soon as the metrics consistently show that the spread of COVID-19 in the community has dissipated to a level that gives reasonable assurance that we can provide in person schooling for a reasonable length of time.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3730817543613414&id=716574418371090,,0.0,"Governor Grants Rural Adjustments to School Metrics

Baker School District 5J invites parents, community to review proposed K-6 ELA materials

Parents/guardians of Baker 5J students and community members are invited to review core curriculum materials for grades K through 6, Into Reading, published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, has been recommended for adoption by the K-6 English Language Arts Curriculum Cadre.
Into Reading grade level sample materials will be on display at the District Office from June 23 – July 2. Summer hours for the District Office are 7:30 – 4:30, Monday – Thursday. The District Office is located at 2090 Fourth Street.
Parents and community members are asked to sign in at the front office, wear a face covering and follow hygiene protocol. A comment sheet will be provided to gather input from those participating in the review. Parent and community member comments will be compiled and presented to the Baker 5J School Board along with the team’s recommendation.

District policy requires that any materials considered for use as core curriculum first be approved by the Baker 5J School Board. The Board will convene a work session next week to consider the team’s proposal. A vote to approve or deny the materials recommendation will occur during a publicly advertised board meeting.

The community will have the opportunity to provide additional input at that time.
This recommendation culminates six months’ work by a dedicated team composed of teachers, administrators and specialists. Beginning in December, the team reviewed State Standards, weighed strengths and weaknesses of the present ELA program and prioritized the most important components necessary to develop strong reading, writing, speaking and listening skills across the K-6 spectrum.
“The team wanted a program that would align schools and grade levels. Into Reading fits the criteria they were looking for,” said Assistant Superintendent Betty Palmer. “The District welcomes community input in this process. We are grateful for the time and effort individuals have committed to help make this important decision.”",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3588466317848538&id=716574418371090,,0.0,"Baker 5J English Language Arts Materials Review

of rural school districts

Baker School District received reassurances from the Oregon Department of Education this week regarding how school will proceed in the fall of 2020. The response, sent from ODE Director Colt Gill, addressed concerns outlined in a May 22 letter sent by the Baker School District board of directors and Superintendent Mark Witty.
It opened with this statement: “This letter represents a collective plea, demonstrating the common concern and collective resolve of House District 60 superintendents and board members in these unprecedented times.”
One concern was conflicting messages. On May 7, ODE said school districts could open concurrently as their county opened. Five days later, ODE announced that all school districts in the state would follow a statewide opening not tied to a county’s status.
The letter states that input was not sought from schools in House District 60, which includes nearly 12,000 students in grades K-12 located in Baker, Grant, Harney, Lake and Malheur Counties.
“School board members across the state have not been asked their input on policies for the last three months,” said Andrew Bryan, BSD director. “We have not been given a voice, and we are the voice of the people.”
The letter contained two requests: for House District 60 to be involved in the decision for reopening schools for 2020-2021, and for the ODE to design and implement a reopening process concurrent to the one used for reopening counties.
Gill, who also serves as deputy superintendent of public instruction, responded June 2 with a four-page letter. He quickly addressed the concern of one state-wide plan for the 2020-2021 school year.
“The model we are proposing under Governor Brown’s leadership will provide statewide guidance for each school district to independently plan for the 2020-21 school year,” Gill wrote. “These individual plans will necessarily look different from community to community, as each district in Oregon serves diverse communities with distinct strengths and needs, has unique physical structures, includes different staff make-ups and local bargaining agreements, has experienced varying degrees of impact from COVID-19 outbreaks, and has access to various levels of readiness to respond to an outbreak.”
In addition, he said decisions to physically reopen schools will not be made on a statewide or county-wide level. For instance, if one town experiences a rise in COVID-19 cases, it will not necessarily affect a district in another town within the county. That said, Gill emphasizes that “decisions will be made at the local district level in coordination with the local health authority and under guidance from both the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) and the Oregon Department of Education (ODE).”
Julie Huntington, a BSD board director, was pleased with Gill’s response.
“I was happy to see established standards and expectations that can be applied at the local levels based on our COVID issues – not a one-size-fits-all structure,” Huntington said.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3539825299379307&id=716574418371090,,0.0,"Oregon Dept. of Education addresses concerns

At 2 p.m. on Sunday, June 7, graduates of Baker High School and Eagle Cap Innovative High School will organize at the Baker Sports Complex. Each will be in a car with his or her immediate family. From the complex, the graduates will be driven through the bus lane in front of Baker High School to receive a diploma. The cars will then proceed to the BHS parking lot. Once all diplomas are awarded, the graduates will step out of their cars and move the tassel of their cap from one side to the other. The Oregon Department of Education is not allowing graduates to throw their caps.

A processional through town will follow the ceremony around 3 p.m. The school resource officer will lead the graduates’ cars west on E Street, and then turn left onto 10th Street. The cars will head south on 10th Street, staying in the right lane, and then turn left onto Broadway. The processional will continue east on Broadway to Main, then turn right. The cars will disperse after reaching Auburn Avenue.

In order for everyone to have a clear view of the graduates – who will be in the passenger seat of each car – the school district is asking the community to avoid parking on Broadway and Main streets.

“We know family and friends want to support our kids,” said BHS Principal Greg Mitchell.

The school district worked with Baker City to help direct traffic, especially when cars will be turning onto 10th Street from E Street.

“They’re going the extra mile to help us celebrate the seniors,” said Mark Witty, superintendent.

This is not a parade, and streets will remain open with regular traffic rules. The community is invited to cheer the graduates from the sidewalks while following the social distancing guidelines of the CDC.

“This has been a challenging year for the seniors and we want to celebrate them,” Witty said.

A total of 115 graduates will be part of the processional. In the past, BHS and Eagle Cap held separate ceremonies.

""The Eagle Cap students and staff are excited to celebrate all of Baker City's graduates, together,” said Dr. Thomas Joseph, director of specific secondary programs. “We are proud of every student's accomplishments, respect the different paths people often take to reach a common goal, and are happy to be a part of this special occasion.""

Awarding of the diplomas will be streamed live on Facebook and posted to be viewed later, as well. The commencement speech by Summer Curry and speeches by the valedictorians and salutatorians were recorded in advance and will be posted on June 7.

Classified staff will vote on the proposal Tuesday, May 12, 2020. If classified employees accept this proposal, the total effect of the furloughs will save approximately $300,000 from this year's budgeted expenses.
There are multiple reasons for this reduction in hours. First, the Governor has signaled that budget allocation for K-12 schools will be significantly reduced for the 20-21 school year due to the COVID 19 recession. Based on Governor Brown’s initial projections, BSD could experience up to 17 percent cut in State School Funds. The Oregon Legislature will convene a special session after the May 20 economic forecast. There is potential that the Oregon Legislature will adjust the Governor’s budget cuts to K-12 schools in the state thus reducing the impact.
This furlough will not impact the critical work our staff is currently providing through the COVID-19 restrictions. We will still provide Distance Learning 4 days a week to all students. Our Emergency Day Care and Food Service programs will maintain their current level of service through the end of the school year.
This furlough will allow Baker School District to push approximately $300,000 of savings into the next year’s budget, thus protecting program and staffing levels so that we can provide the best quality service to our students and their families.
Due to the Trump Administration's economic stimulus package, our staff will be held harmless through the Work Share Program. This will allow our staff to remain financially whole, maintaining a workforce that is able to spend money in the support of our local economy.
My hope is that this recession will be short lived, but it is difficult to predict when economic restraints in place to protect community health will be lifted. This furlough provides us a way to hedge against the real cuts in the K-12 revenue package for 2020-21 as well as potential future budgets.
My sincere hope is that the economy will recover quickly when restraints are lifted, but there is no way to guarantee the degree of impact or length of time the COVID-19 virus will continue to affect our state economy. By imposing this furlough, we are taking reasonable steps to protect future programming capabilities for our students as they return to school next fall.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3465588590136312&id=716574418371090,,0.0,"Baker School District has come to an agreement with administration, confidential and certified staff to furlough 20% to 26% of the work week from now through July 31.

Current plan for 2020 Commencement

What: Drive-Thru Graduation with city-wide procession in vehicles
Where: Baker High School and Downtown Baker City
When: Sunday, June 7, 2020 at 2p.m.
Graduates, in vehicles with their families, gather in a staging area at Baker Sports Complex parking lot, then proceed South on 5th Street to the bus lane if front of BHS to be awarded diploma in cars. To ensure safety and avoid distracted driving, we will be asking parents or guardians to drive the vehicles.
Graduates will wear caps/gowns/cords/medals; vehicles may be decorated; one vehicle per graduate. Graduates are expected to be seated in the passenger side of the vehicle.
BHS & BTI staff members will be encouraged to line the front sidewalk to greet and congratulate students as they drive by.
Once vehicles pass through the bus lane to receive their diplomas, the vehicles will gather in the student parking lot to prepare for a parade through town.
Local government and emergency personnel agencies will lead and escort the processional along the route through town and manage social distancing.
Diploma presentations at BHS will be live-streamed on the internet and recorded for posting at a later date.
Valedictorian and keynote speeches will be pre-recorded with Elkhorn Media and posted online for viewing during the parade.
Other Senior End of the Year Activities:
Athletic Facility Lights – For the past several weeks, Athletic Director Buell Gonzales, Jr. has coordinated with local emergency services personnel to light selected athletics facilities at 8:20 (2020 military time) each Friday night. This coming Friday will be the last event in this series. This entire effort is a way of honoring our student-athletes and recognizing the spring season that has been lost to COVID-19 closures.
Caps & Gowns Pick-up – Seniors will be able to pick up caps, gowns and yearbooks using a drive-thru process in the student parking lot on Wednesday, June 3. In addition, we will be collecting Chromebooks from those seniors who still have them.

Senior Yard Signs – Signs honoring 2020 BHS seniors are being created in the District Print Shop. These signs will be placed on front lawns of senior students. We are currently conducting a survey to determine if any of our senior families wish to opt out of this recognition.

Downtown Business Displays – Our senior parent group is in the process of creating photographic signs celebrating graduates. These signs will be displayed at downtown businesses and will feature the student’s yearbook photos.

Senior Honor Walk alternatives – Seniors are volunteering to create a video, dressed in their caps and gowns where they will provide advice to Baker School District students. This video will be recorded and sent to the feeder schools for potential broadcast release.

Senior Awards Night – This event will be pre-recorded with school and district personnel announcing the recipients of scholarships and other awards. The recording will be posted to variety of social media and websites on the regularly scheduled date of Wednesday, May 27.

Senior (Virtual) Assembly – A virtual assembly is being organized for our seniors to take place on June 3. This event will be live-streamed and recorded, and it will include the traditional Senior Slideshow that is created by our Yearbook staff.

Frequently Asked Questions:
WHEN will we get our caps/gowns, and HOW will we get them?
Caps/gowns/tassels have arrived at BHS. The pick-up date will be Wednesday, June 3rd. We will conduct a drive-thru pick-up in the bus lane at the front of the high school. More details for times will be posted when we get closer to the pick-up date.

Brooklyn Primary Principal offers online and in-person opportunities to pre-register
Every year, pre-K children who will turn 5 on or before September 1 are invited to participate in one of several Kindergarten Round Up events during the month of May. This year, because of state mandated closures, these events will not be offered.
“I’m sad that we will not be able to offer our usual kindergarten round-up event this year,” said Phil Anderson, Brooklyn Primary principal. “These events allowed us to meet families face-to face, get to know our entering Kindergarteners and provide an opportunity to pre-register for school in the fall.”
In lieu of RoundUp, Brooklyn families will have two different options to pre-register:

Physical Pick-Up Monday April 27th through Thursday, April 30th: Parents may park on Oak Street near the old Kennedy Market to pick up a packet between 8:00 am and 4:00 pm. Parents are asked to stay in their car while Brooklyn staff bring packets directly to parents. Parents may drop completed registration packets off at the District Office, located at 2090 Fourth Street, between 9:00 am and 4:00 pm.

Digital Pick-Up: Registration packets in English and Spanish are available online through a link on the Brooklyn webpage http://brooklyn.baker5j.org/. Digital packets can be scanned and returned to janet.conant@bakersd.org or returned to the Baker School District Office, as noted above.

Since 2015, the Blue Mountain Land Trust has partnered with the South Yuba River Citizens League (SYRCL) to bring you the Wild & Scenic Film Festival. This year, the coronavirus outbreak forced us to reimagine how a film festival could work with physical distancing measures in place. Because you couldn’t come in person to our festival this year, we decided to bring the festival to you – where you could enjoy it from the comfort of your couch, patio chair, or picnic blanket.

Over eight-weeks beginning April 20, 2020, BMLT will be streaming a selection of short films that illustrate the challenges facing our planet and explore how communities are protecting the places they love. Each week, we will release a new lineup of films that conveys a broader theme of environmental activism.

We’re also offering three weeks of programs designed for children and young adults. The film programs will be accompanied by a set of activities that encourage young learners to think critically about the themes each film explores.

The best part? We’re presenting this online festival free-of-charge. To enjoy the films, simply visit bmlt.org/wild and register.

This program is generously supported by Outside Walla Walla, a website that will inspire your next adventure into the Blues. It’s a collection of stories to help you explore wild places of the great nearby.

In these uncertain times, we are excited to provide you with a boost of inspiration through these nature films. Enjoy.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3393734863988352&id=716574418371090,,0.0,"WILD & SCENIC FILM FESTIVAL COMES TO YOUR HOME

Superintendents Desk
April 9, 2020

The Governor’s Office has announced unprecedented Statewide School Closure for Students in Oregon from Wednesday, April 8, 2020 due to the significant health threat posed by the COVID -19 virus. This means that our staff will continue to engage with families and students for the rest of this academic school year through distance learning to serve our students’ academic needs.

First, I want to acknowledge the sacrifices that are being made by students and families at this time. Certainly, our Seniors will not be able to fully engage in the social components that Seniors heretofore have enjoyed. We are mindful of these sacrifices and will be working on ways to engage our students and families to celebrate and honor our Seniors' accomplishments. Our staff is currently reviewing the Oregon Department of Education guidelines and will be reaching out to each Senior and their families next week. Essentially, the guidelines state that if a student was on track to meet graduation credits on March 13th then they will be awarded the credit as if they completed the year through a pass/incomplete grading system. Any Seniors that were not on track will be given ample opportunity to meet the number of credit requirements necessary to graduate through our distance learning model. Our BSD staff will be working with all Seniors to assist them in meeting their post-high school transition plans as well as scholarship applications. The guidelines also suspend the Essential Skill and Personalized Learning Requirements for this year’s Seniors.

Second, I am directly in communication with Colt Gill, Deputy Superintendent of the Oregon Department of Education with regard to grades 9-11 guidelines. Dr. Thomas Joseph will serve on the team reviewing and providing guidance at the state level with regard to how we can best serve the needs of our Freshman, Sophomores, and Juniors. As soon as those guidelines are set forth, BSD staff will be in communication with students and families at those grade levels. In the meantime, our high school staff is providing Distance Learning directly to those students. This is a critical stage in the acquisition of knowledge for our High School students grades 9-11 as many of the lessons taught this academic year lead directly to being successful in the student’s coursework the next school year.

Third, students in grades K-8 will continue to engage in the Distance Learning Model for the remainder of the academic year. It is even more critical in this model that we connect with students and families and support them as they take on new roles. Forming strong relationships between teachers and the families we serve is paramount to our success through these weeks.

Re: Pre-K Screening
Date: March 25, 2020

Each spring over 100 Baker City children participate in a readiness screening provided by Baker School District. This year the Pre-K Screening will be postponed, in compliance with Governor Brown’s directive for Oregonians to “stay home and stay safe”.
The annual screening, which targets children who will turn 5 by September 1, typically takes place at various community preschool locations. Screening was scheduled to begin on Wednesday, April 1.
Pre-K Screening Director, Linda Honeywell, has contacted local preschool providers to schedule screening. Notices were sent to preschool teachers and packets given out to parents which included permission slips for screening and parent information forms that provide important information about the child’s readiness skills.
“The materials are in. Our screening team is set. We are anxious to see the kids,” said Betty Palmer, Baker 5J Assistant Superintendent. “However, in order to follow the Governor’s directive to keep everyone safe, we will postpone the screening until later this Spring or early Summer.”
The District is requesting parents fill out the forms and permission slips even though the screening has been postponed. This information can be returned to the School District Office at 2090 Fourth Street. Haines and Keating area residents may return their forms to those schools.
Baker 5J intends to publish new screening dates as they receive updated information from Governor Brown.
Nationally recognized Baker School District 5J (BSD) in Baker City, OR, is the largest of three rural school districts in Baker County, serving 1,700 students and employing over 110 educators and staff. District elementary schools include Brooklyn Primary School, Haines Elementary, Keating Elementary School, and South Baker Intermediate. Baker Middle School and two high schools, Baker High School and Eagle Cap Innovative High School, are also part of BSD. Additionally, BSD sponsors two charter schools, Baker Web Academy and Baker Early College, each offering teacher-supported online education. BSD provides next generation education for the future of Eastern Oregonians and launched Baker Technical Institute (BTI), a career and technical program that partners with regional employers and industry experts to provide an innovative education in hands-on fields.

Baker School District will continue with the Emergency Meal Program through Spring Break, with the help of community volunteers. Meals will be provided as long as necessary, using 5J staff beginning April 1. Key points and adjustments:
The meal program is available at mid-day, Monday through Friday.
We will be serving through Spring Break.
Meals are available for children 0 to 18 years of age. There is no enrollment requirement.
Families can pick meals up at the site most convenient to them.
Those picking up more than 6 meals are directed to the Baker High School site.
Families may coordinate pick up for other children in their neighborhood to assist families that may not be able to meet the scheduled time of delivery.

We will also be making several adjustments to the schedule to better serve our families. Starting Monday, we will discontinue the morning meal delivery. Families may pick up their hot lunch and breakfast for the next day at the same time. This will cut down on the number of trips a family needs to make in one day. Also, starting Monday, we will deliver meals for distribution at the Keating school.

The updated schedule starting Monday, March 23, 2020 for Monday through Friday is:
Haines & Keating (Noon to 12:30 pm)
Brooklyn and South Baker (11:30 am to 12:30 pm)
Baker High School (11:30 am to 1:00 pm)

We appreciate families and children not congregating at the sites. This helps ensure a safer environment.

Baker School District is in the process of developing plans to supplement the education of our students during this closure. The highest priority will be given to current Seniors so that they can meet all graduation requirements. Rest assured, we will be putting plans together to serve all children.

Additional information will be forthcoming as we develop viable strategies for students and their families to meet the educational needs of their children. This will undoubtedly need to be a partnership between our staff and the families we serve.

We will be seeking clarification on a number of issues from the Oregon Department of Education. We
will keep our parents and community updated as we know more. BSD, along with community partners, will continue to provide breakfast and lunch at Haines, Brooklyn, South Baker and the High School. This program is for all children in our community 18 years old and younger.

The Governor has also charged schools to implement child care for first responders, emergency workers and health care professions. BSD is in communication with management of each of these organizations to determine the level of need. We are striving to meet this need as soon as reasonably possible. We are currently developing plans for staffing/logistics to ensure quality care as well as
meeting all previous protocols set forth by the state.

I will continue to update our families, staff and community as further information is disseminated from State Authorities. This is a time when we are being asked to sacrifice. Our children and families will not be able to experience many opportunities that they have worked so hard to achieve. One example is our Girls Basketball Team.

March 12, 2020 – (Wilsonville, OR)

The Oregon School Activities Association (OSAA) has canceled all remaining Winter State Championships. This includes the remaining Basketball (effective immediately) and Dance/Drill State Championships.

“As this unprecedented public health emergency continues to evolve, we believe that the responsibility to our member schools and communities regarding the health and safety of participants remains our highest priority,” said Peter Weber, OSAA Executive Director.

This news comes after the Pac-12, along with other major collegiate conferences and the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF), canceled their men’s basketball tournament and all other sporting events until further notice due to COVID-19.

The OSAA will continue to collaborate with Oregon’s public health authorities, including guidance from the Governor, OHA, and ODE in order to help slow the transmission of the coronavirus.

We are working with our ticketing partners to ensure those who purchased tickets for future sessions are reimbursed.

The OSAA will have updates soon about Spring activities and contests that are scheduled to begin next week.

March 12, 2020

The Governor’s Office developed new guidelines last evening to address the continued spread of the Coronavirus in the United States and specifically in Oregon. The guidelines were developed in consultation with the Oregon Health Authority and the Center for Disease Control and Preventions as well as other Oregon public health experts.

Key Message from the Governor:
“In addition to previous guidance issued on March 8, 2020 to keep schools open, all non-essential school-associated gatherings and group activities should be canceled – such as group parent meetings, field trips, and competitions.
The Governor has also banned public gatherings of more than 250 people statewide for 4 weeks. (this ban is not directed at closing schools as they fulfill the educational needs of our students.)

Additionally, OSSA is following the guidance from the Oregon Health Authority and the Oregon Department of Education (ODE) in the administering of state championship events. This means that events will continue but only with essential personnel which means, no spectators.

Baker School District immediately taking the following steps:
All field trips for students are being put on hold.
School sponsored large group parent gatherings will be cancelled.
Staff will not be attending professional development events outside of the District.
We will continue to monitor the situation in consultation with our Local Health Department and strictly following all guidelines set forth by local, state and national health authorities.
We will continue to disinfect all of our facilities on a regular basis utilizing classroom disinfectants that are in the hands of our staff and the product Vital Oxide that our custodial staff applies twice a week to all facilities and busses.
We will be monitoring further communications that are expected from the Governor’s office today including a press conference scheduled at 9 am.

I will be working with Deputy Superintendent Colt Gill, COSA Executive Director Craig Hawkins and OSSA Executive Director Peter Weber to organize a conference call for all superintendents to gain clarity into the new guidelines and their appropriate implementation. Spring sports will be a topic that we will be seeking clarification and guidance.

In the meantime, these recommendations remain in place:
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Congrats to all the girls who competed in the North Region Wrestling Tourney this past weekend. We had two wrestlers make the podium in their respective weight classes. Bailey Cole took 3rd and Sydney Keller took 1st. Both are guaranteed spots in the State Meet Feb 27-29. Kaci and McKay Anderson both took 5th and have an outside shot at qualifying for State. It will prob be early next week when we know for sure.
District Swimming is this week at Molalla. Good Luck Swimmers!

Young Women at Three Lakes and Riverside High Schools at Oak Creek Correctional Facility Gain Traction Toward a Career in Heavy Equipment Operation

BAKER, Ore. – Baker Technical Institute (BTI) is pleased to announce that they will be partnering with Multnomah Educational Service District (MESD) and the Oregon Youth Authority (OYA) to provide heavy equipment operator training for it’s students in Albany, Oregon.

BTI will provide approximately 80 hours of introductory operator training for students at the Oak Creek facility beginning on January 13th. BTI will utilize it’s mobile operator training platform that is equipped with the latest technology of virtual reality CAT simulators to train on heavy construction equipment such as dozers, graders, wheel loaders and excavators.

“Being able to take this training right to their location and provide these students with employable skills that are in demand across the nation is exciting, ” says BTI President Doug Dalton. “Our team is thrilled to be a part of providing these students with real career-connected opportunities, through hands-on learning, that can build a foundation of skills, confidence and a passion for a successful career.”

The training is the result of a proactive approach of MESD/OYA leadership in providing students with career and technical training that can lead to high-demand high-wage jobs after being released. “Every chance we get, we look for medium to high wage skills our students can learn. This is the right work to do, and we are thrilled that BTI is partnering with us,” says Joy Koenig, Principal of Three Lakes and Riverside High Schools.

Upon completion of the course, the students can earn a certificate of completion showing their training levels for each piece of equipment that they reach the minimum operating standards on.

BTI heavy equipment instructor Dawson Vanderwiele will rely on her own experience as an operator to not only provide the students with equipment operator skills, but to also guide students through the intangible essential skills that are key in gaining employment, retaining positions and advancing in this field, such as resume writing, interviewing, critical thinking skills, and much more.

Dawson, who grew up in a family of heavy equipment operators, has been running them herself for as long as she can remember. She now has turned her time to teaching others the trade. Three years ago Dawson became the first female trained instructor in the nation on CAT simulators; the technology she now utilizes to train with, along with the real equipment, as she travels the Pacific Northwest as part of the BTI heavy equipment team. “I love to teach, but it is extra special when I get a chance to teach other females about the profession,'' says Vanderwiele. “Often times all they need is the exposure to a career they did not know about, and given a start on the right path.”

Film 'No Small Matter' addresses the importance of
early childhood education

The Baker Early Learning Collaborative is sponsoring the viewing of a documentary film, “No Small Matter”, at Churchill School on November 7. Early childhood education is becoming a national focus. This documentary film brings attention to the subject through true stories and struggles. The viewing is free to the public; on-site childcare is available.

Baker Early Learning Collaborative is comprised of over 15 community partners involved in helping improve opportunities for families with young children. Susan Townsend, a member of the collaborative, brings personal experience to this issue. Her perspective on early learning stems from the time she spent as principal of an Early Childhood Education Center in Carlsbad, New Mexico.

“So many needed the same kind of support services,” she said.

An outdoor learning environment (called OLE) provided a space for students to ride tricycles and interact with nature.

“We hatched eggs and grew plants – all sorts of connections with nature,” she said.

The focus of early learning, she said, is to help young children develop concrete ideas, such as connecting the verbal word “flower” to an actual flower. This leads to understanding abstract concepts in language – when a child reads the word “flower” he can connect it with the real object.

“You need all those steps in the progression to build comprehension,” Townsend said.

The center also started a conversation about reaching children before kindergarten.

“It brought an awareness to the entire community about the importance of early learning,” she said.

About the film
No Small Matter looks at how our country is raising its youngest citizens, why making the most of this time in their lives is so crucial, and what we can do to change the perception of when learning begins. The film's website explains: “With every new study, the incredible development happening in a child’s early years becomes more and more apparent. For example, we now know that the number of words a child hears before age three can vastly improve her school readiness; the first few years of life are a kind of 'big bang' for learning — 86 billion neurons being connected by synapses at a rate of a million times per second; and when a child lacks an engaging, loving environment, 'toxic' experiences actually have the power to rewire her brain with consequences that can last a lifetime”

Baker Charter Schools Pursues Ellingson Building Acquisition

Baker Charter Schools, which encompasses Baker Web Academy and Baker Early College, is pursuing the acquisition of the former offices for Ellingson Lumber Company, located on Broadway Street in Baker City. The online schools, which have 60 students and 25 staff locally, will move to that building from the current location at North Baker School.

“The building will better meet our needs, allowing us to more efficiently utilize space for both faculty and staff,” said Dr. Dan Huld, superintendent of Baker Charter Schools.

Baker Charter Schools has eight locations across Oregon currently serving 2,500 students statewide. The main office, which contains financials and student records for the entire state, is located in Baker City. Huld said the Ellingson building has office spaces as opposed to the classrooms at North Baker which will better meet their needs.

Baker Charter Schools is its own entity, although it works in partnership with Baker School District. Huld said the school is utilizing funds from its savings to purchase the building, not tapping into the school's operating funds. Baker School District Mark Witty stated, “We appreciate the strong relationship that we have with Baker Charter Schools and believe this purchase will be advantageous in providing the operational space necessary to continue to grow the service model even further in the State of Oregon.

The tennis courts north of Baker High School will be out of commission for several days next week as
the Beynon company works to resurface and fill cracks.
The project started with the Tennis Association of Baker, which has funded court maintenance for more
than 20 years. TAB will soon dissolve and join the Baker Sports Complex.
“We had enough money in the account to do one more overhaul,” said Jeff Higgins, TAB president.
He said TAB members along with Baker School District officials researched the cost of two options:
resurface or replace. That's when they found the Beynon system that installs a titanium mesh-type
surface called Guardian between the existing cracked courts and the new surface.
Of the six courts, the multi-layer system will be installed on the south three tennis courts. The north
three will be cleaned and cracks filled.
“We'll see how the two systems weather,” Higgins said.
The exact start date next week will be determined by weather. Once finished, the public must stay off for
24 hours for the surface to seal.
Total cost of the project is $44,800. Baker School District committed $16,576. TAB donated $28,224.
Of that amount, $11,500 came from the Leo Adler Community Foundation, and charitable donations
totaling $10,000 came from George and Linda Keister and Bill Tipton. The rest was from the TAB
account.
“It was a pleasure to work with TAB and their membership on a great project that will greatly improve
the playing surface on the Tennis Courts not only for our students but also the community.” Witty
stated.

build parking lot near soccer fields
Students in the heavy equipment course at Baker Technical Institute are currently working to improve
the road leading to the soccer fields located on the north side of the Baker Sports Complex.
The BTI training is a 260-hour course that draws students from around the region. Students first honed
their skills on CAT simulators, then moved to work on real equipment at the land lab located off Hughes
Lane. The aim of the lab is to provide an “experience that best matches work conditions,” said Doug
Dalton, president of BTI.
“We try to mimic a construction site,” he said.
In previous courses, the students completed heavy equipment tasks and then graded the ground back to
level. The current class had the opportunity to complete a project that will benefit community members
headed to the soccer fields.
“The BTI students were able to work that in as one of their projects,” Dalton said.
Until now, northern access to the soccer fields was a narrow dirt road. The BTI students and instructors
designed the road to be wider, determined the grade, staked the area, calculated the necessary material,
and estimated the cost. When complete, the road will be gravel and lead to a parking lot – also gravel –
adjacent to the soccer field. A turnaround area for buses was added into the design.

BCPD received this photo from a concerned citizen. We would like to remind parents and caregivers that while parking is at a premium at and around both Brooklyn Primary and South Baker Intermediate Schools, especially during pickup and drop off times, it is illegal to block a pedestrian crosswalk when parking, even temporarily. This creates a hazard for children crossing the street, making it more difficult for other drivers to see and yield to pedestrians attempting to cross the street, creating a hazard for those safely attempting to navigate through these congested intersections. A crosswalk exists at any public street intersection, whether marked with paint or unmarked (ORS 801.220). Your consideration is greatly appreciated and it is in the interest of everyone's safety, especially that of the school-aged children attending school in these areas, that we bring you this information.

Young a shout out! I was currently failing a portion of PE and that involved physical testing. We have benchmark
standards and are expected to meet them. Mine was to run 600 meters in under 3:15. Well, on my first run I
got 4:33 and that wasn't good. I kept running and failing. Mr. Young took his own class time to run with me to
surpass my benchmark — I got 2:14.

Young a shout out! I was currently failing a portion of PE and that involved physical testing. We have benchmark
standards and are expected to meet them. Mine was to run 600 meters in under 3:15. Well, on my first run I
got 4:33 and that wasn't good. I kept running and failing. Mr. Young took his own class time to run with me to
surpass my benchmark — I got 2:14.
Thanks, Coach Young!

UPDATE ON DEATH INVESTIGATION:

A Baker City teenager whose body was found Wednesday afternoon at the skate park near Sam-O Swim Center died from a self-inflicted gunshot, Baker County District Attorney Matt Shirtcliff said this morning.
In a press release, Shirtcliff said the Baker County Major Crime Team has finished its investigation into the death of Izah Nicholas Gonzalez, 14.
Shirtcliff said the investigation was delayed because a handgun had been taken from the scene.
Police arrested Oren Shaile Moore, 20, of 240 Foothill Drive, on two counts of first-degree theft.
According to the press release, Moore found Gonzalez’s body, took the gun from the skate park and then reported the death to people who live nearby. Moore later sold the gun, according to the press release.
The investigation into the transfer of the firearm is continuing and other charges are pending.
“The District Attorney’s Office takes removal of any item from a death scene very seriously as that effects investigations and in this case delayed getting answers to a grieving family,” Shirtcliff said. “This is a horrible tragedy and the law enforcement community of Baker County extends its condolences to Izah's family at this time.”",0.0,"Update Press Release from the Baker County Major Crimes Team via The Baker Herald:

Work at the BHS Gym has been focused on the interior roofing and truss work that is now 95% done according to Griffin Construction management on-site. The roof demolition has been completed and the new roof will begin to be put in place next week. Crews also will be completing concrete work inside the gym over the next few days.

The roof at Brooklyn is now sheeted and new roofing will begin to go in place on Monday. Crews there are also now focused on inside tasks.

Griffin construction representatives also reported that coordination with community events that take place at or near the construction sites has went very smoothly. This weekend brings many motorcyclists to Baker and many that camp at BHS. Provisions have been put into place that will provide room for the campers as in previous years, including a portable shower facility, that keeps them a safe distance from the construction site.

Greetings Brooklyn Families,
You may have noticed some Griffin Construction signs up at Brooklyn this week. Two years ago our School District applied for and was awarded a seismic upgrade grant for Brooklyn Primary and Baker High School. As a result of this grant, our school is receiving 1.4 million dollars in seismic upgrades over the summer. This will include structural supports, a new roof, new windows and paint in certain areas, increased energy efficiency and overall seismic safety upgrades.

Some of the initial roof work will begin during the last two weeks of school, which will take place on the South side of the school, specifically the roof over the gym. This will not affect the school day at Brooklyn. Over the summer Brooklyn will be closed due to the construction.

This is a great opportunity to provide updates to Brooklyn Primary that will enhance the seismic safety of the building, as well as provide improved energy efficiency. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact me. Thanks!

Dear BEA Community:
We have had our first confirmed Covid-19 case in the district. It was an adult at Wingate Elementary. Those students and staff that are required to quarantine have been contacted.

Good afternoon,

The school year is off to a good start. Thank you for being understanding as we navigate the new normal and what education looks like.

Please be advised that Friday, September 11, 2020 is the deadline for initiating any changes to student Educational Instructional Options. Please ensure that all requests are submitted no later than 5:00 PM on Friday, September 11th.

The next opportunity to switch to a different Educational Instructional Option will be at the end of the first marking period. You will have from Tuesday, October 27th until Friday, October 30th to make any changes. After this date, the changes will remain in effect until the end of Marking Period 2.

A reminder that Friday, August 28th is textbook pickup for virtual learners (Option 3). Parents, guardians, or students can pick up course textbooks between the hours of 8:30 AM and 2:30 PM at their school building.

We will be switching to Monday's as the pick up and drop off day for Option 3 course materials that students need to participate in classes remotely (e.g., art supplies, lab materials, work packets, etc.). Teachers will communicate with students as to who has something that needs to be picked up and/or dropped off each Monday. Not every student will need to pick up and/or drop off course materials each week. Parent's and/or students can pick up course materials for the week between the hours of 8:30 AM and 2:30 PM at your child's school building.

Dear BEA Community,
The governor's recommendation that sports be cancelled until January 1, is not a mandate at this point. I have a meeting with our conference superintendents and athletic directors on Monday. I will keep you updated. Please know this, I will not be making any unilateral decisions on shutting down sports through January 1.
Several of you have emailed me supporting not to shut down sports.
However, it is imperative that everyone follows state mandates and the district's Safety Plan while on school grounds. It came to my attention that several people, including athletes and parents yesterday were in the stadium not wearing masks and not practicing social distancing. We are doing everything possible to keep Covid-19 out of our schools. We need to work together as a community if we are going to have any chance to be successful.
On a personal note, if you email me and I do not get back to you right away, it is because I am having surgery tomorrow.

The second round of flash drives, with week three and week four materials on them, are now available. These flash drives are for those students who are not able to get online and access their materials through their Google accounts.

If you need to exchange your flash drive please bring both the flash drive you have and your Chromebook to the school between 12:00 and 3:00 on Thursday or Friday. When you get to the school you will need to log into your Chromebook to upload the completed materials to your teacher(s). Once that upload is done you can exchange the flash drive with the office.

It is important that you upload your work before exchanging flash drives because once it is turned in all files on your first flash drive will be deleted so that it can be reloaded with new materials.

This group of exceptionally talented children from Uganda are here in the United States as a part of their world tour, but are sheltering in place in North Carolina, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The choir shared some songs with our students, and were able to exchange questions about their lives at home, their studies, favorite sports and games, and what they like to eat. The Ugandan students love American lasagna and pizza! We are planning to have Zoom recorder lessons with our fourth graders and the choir over the summer break. Many thanks to our students who were able to connect to the Zoom, despite storm-related power outages!

We hope you are well and safe!

Did you know that the Census is one thing you CAN do from home during this time. Most Lake County residents received paper census forms, so you can submit that way or online if they have internet access.

Lake County currently has a very low response rate on the 2020 Census — just 8%. Response rates are updated daily and can be narrowed down by township: https://2020census.gov/en/response-rates.html#

We will be keeping an eye on this and continuing to encourage people and agencies as we can. More information (and where people take the census) is available atwww.2020census.gov.

We discussed the roots of contra and square dancing, and how the patterns and counting in dance steps all relate to mathematics. We talked about how dance etiquette and behavior is a very helpful social skill to have, and that the physical and connective aspect of dancing makes us FEEL GOOD. The students loved performing the dance, and begged to learn more. We will now be making dance a monthly activity in the music classroom.

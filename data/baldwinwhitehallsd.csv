This award recognizes that Baldwin-Whitehall School District is leading the way with learning opportunities as outlined in the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). The legislation guides implementation in the states and replaces the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) which was often criticized for an overemphasis on testing-while leaving behind subjects such as music.

At 10:22 a.m. the Secretary of Education and Governor of Pennsylvania declared that all public schools will be closed for the remainder of the 2019-2020 academic year. While we are still working through what this means for many aspects of our school district, it does provide guidance as to how we will finish the academic part of our work.

Online programming will continue through the end of the school year, with the last day of school being scheduled for students in grades K-11 being on June 11th and the last day for seniors being Monday, June 8th. Calendars were updated last night by the school board, however we will need to re-examine it based upon this new information.

Additionally, the District will now begin in earnest, the planning of any alternatives to the celebrations and other events that normally take place at this time of year.

Dear Parents:

The impact of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) on the community and our daily lives has had a profound effect. Schools have been no exception, as you are very well aware. It has only been three days but it seems like an eternity. Many questions are left unanswered about what the rest of this month, term and year will look like for all of us academically. I just do not have the answers for you at this time.

I did want to provide a collection of resources, generated from our teachers and principals, that may assist you in providing tools and activities for your children during these difficult times. Please know that the activities are voluntary and will not be graded or assessed in any way by the teaching staff. They are meant to support and enrich learning that has taken place in the classroom as of last Friday.

As conditions change and guidance may become more clear, we will provide additional resources as appropriate.

Thank you,

Randy Lutz

Parents, Music is huge part of our everyday lives! Here are ways you can incorporate music into this time of learning at home.

* Make instruments from items found around the house (drums, shakers, guitars).
* Learn to juggle. Juggling well requires rhythm. Start with scarves. They move more slowly through the air.
* Put on music and dance together. The funnier your dance, the better. Dance with scarves or balloons, do a freeze dance, dance like an animal. Play music with different speeds and moods.
* Play a piece of music and have your child describe the mood and feelings listening to it creates. Any genre will work ‚Äì classical, jazz, rock, pop, musicals, etc.
* Make up a Stomp routine. Stomp uses everyday items and uses them to make up a dance routine. Brooms, balls, buckets, use your imagination!
* Compose a rap or song about something new they have learned, or about their day. Have a concert to perform the creations.

Whatever you choose to do with music, have fun!

The safety of students and test center staff is our top priority. We have rescheduled the April 4 national test date across the U.S. in response to concerns about the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19).

All students registered for the April 4 test date will receive an email in the next few days informing them of the postponement and instructions for free rescheduling to June 13 or a future national test date.

Message from Supt. Dr. Wood Regarding the Passing of Brendon Meyers",80.0,"Our hearts are breaking to learn of the passing of a former GHS student, Brendon Meyers. Brendon grew up in our community, and had only recently transferred to Athens High School at the beginning of the last semester. Please read Supt. Dr. Wood’s message, as it details the days and times that our GHS Counselors will be available to support our kids who are grieving.

Also, for those interested, a gofundme page has been set up to pay for Brendon’s funeral expenses: https://gf.me/u/x6iwhw.

On behalf of the District, we offer our deepest condolences to his family and his many friends. Please keep them in your thoughts and prayers.

🎉🎉 RETIREMENT ALERT🎉🎉

If you see James ""JR"" Richards, wish him the best of luck in retirement. JR officially retired this week with 20 years of outstanding service to the Village of Chatham. We are sad to see him go, but, we know that he'll enjoy his retirement. He is looking forward to spending more time with his family.

JR held several positions within the department, and served as a firearms instructor, rapid deployment instructor, and field training officer. He was also very active within the school district. In 2010, he became CPD's first canine officer. He and canine ""Bella"" served the village from 2010 to 2017, when ""Bella"" entered retirement.

We congratulate JR on his retirement and wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors!",0.0,"The Ball-Chatham School District is grateful for JR’s work, but more importantly, for the positive relationships he’s built with our students and staff over the years.

We had a first today.

During normal times, at the end of every school semester, we give presentations to the Government classes at Glenwood High School. Typically, they receive a K9 demonstration from Officer Jacob Bouldin and his partner, Dagz, a presentation on DUI's from Sergeant Mark Poani, and a presentation on traffic stops and what to do if they get pulled over from Officer David Leach. With COVID-19 forcing the school closures, however, we were unable to give them in person this year. But the virus didn't stop us from having an opportunity to connect with the students and teach them. It just forced us to get creative and do it in a different way.

This afternoon, Officer David Leach and GHS teacher/coach David Hay gave a virtual presentation to 120 students via Zoom. We had a few bugs to work out, but, we all had a few good laughs too. By and large, the presentation went pretty well!",0.0,"This is awesome!!❤️

I've noticed from my own kids how hard it is for them to express how this quarantine has affected them. So I thought why not try and give them a voice? And a song? What better genre to express this than the blues?

So I had BES students fill out a Google Form answering the following questions...

-What is the one thing you miss doing the most during the quarantine?
-What is the one thing you miss about not being at school?
-Who is one adult you miss at school?

I took their responses and adapted them to the lyrics of the song made famous by Louis Armstrong and Billie Holiday - Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans.

My good friend, bandmate, and SHG Music Director, Damien Kaplan, and I then recorded a version of this for you all.

I hope you enjoy!"" ❤️

Awesome way to step up for our kids Subway!!!

As we all know, Illinois has closed schools temporarily in an attempt to control the spread of COVID 19. In addition, restaurants are only able to operate for drive thru, curbside pickup, and delivery.

We believe this is the right decision, but also understand that it may present challenges to families in our community. We're here to help.

If you are concerned about ensuring your children have lunch, please call us and order a kids meal free of charge. Kids meals consist of a mini sub (turkey, ham, roast beef, or veggie) a side item, and 20oz fountain drink.

We want to do our part to make sure our community gets through this.

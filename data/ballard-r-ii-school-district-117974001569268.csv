We still have 8 stars on the Angel Tree!!! Not bad considering we started with 84!!!! This tree is going to help 7 families and 21 children this holiday season! Way to go Ballard!!! You never disappoint!!
If you would like a star off of the tree but can’t make it to school, let me know and we will figure out how to get one to you. I would like all presents delivered by Monday so I have time to take stock of what we have and what is missing before delivering on December 20th! Thank you again!!!",0.0,"Miranda Bridges

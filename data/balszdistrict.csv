Crockett Parents we want to thank you for being a part of the our David Crockett Team over the past nine weeks. As I meet with principals from around Phoenix they are consistently amazed at what we have been able to accomplish and while we know it has not been perfect we take pride in knowing that we stayed engaged with 95% of our families. We sincerely hope have good summer vacation.

We look forward to starting the school year in August with the excitement of new beginnings. A beginning as we welcome new families to our community, celebrate our continuing families, and strive for ways to continue to move our school forward!

If you need anything, please feel free to reach out! Please know, our door is always open.

This decision is not made lightly, but it is the right thing to do to bring certainty and consistency to all Arizona schools. With schools closing, we are working together to provide assistance during this time and lessen the impact on all Arizona families.

It’s important for families & parents to know that while this will address operational issues, closing schools will not stop the spread of #COVID19. It is the recommendation of public health officials that kids who are not at school remain at home to the greatest extent possible.

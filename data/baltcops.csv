“We have heard loud and clear from our high school seniors that what they want are the traditional in-person graduations that their siblings and parents and grandparents had. As the parent of a graduating high school senior and a graduating college senior, I understand what they are feeling, . . . that they worked for years and that part of the expected reward was to be able to walk across the stage and be cheered on by friends and family. I also was looking forward to attending all the graduations. It was going to be a culminating moment in my first year as superintendent.

“I can assure all seniors and their parents that we will explore potential face-to-face celebrations when it is safe to do so in accordance with the Governor’s orders. In the meantime, this virtual graduation offers many of the same elements of a traditional one, and we are pleased to be able to offer it to our approximately 7,000 graduates this year.

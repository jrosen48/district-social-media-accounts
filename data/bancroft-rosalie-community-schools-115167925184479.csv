Explaining the risk dial-
The position of the Risk Dial is based on multiple local indicators and information from the previous three weeks. Below are five of the key factors they consider:

Case numbers. Does the trend shows an increase or decrease in case numbers?

Positivity rate. The average weekly positivity rate for the last three weeks- Is it going increasing or decreasing?

Contact tracing capacity. Is the number of contact tracers available to conduct case investigations sufficient and can keep pace with demand?
Is testing completed and results available in a timely manner or are there delays of the investigative process which impacts the department's ability to prevent the development of case clusters or outbreaks.

Hospital capacity. What is the percent of ICU beds available and ventilators available?

Some of you will remember when the old Bancroft building was torn down in 1998 and the new school was being built at that same spot.
We had school without any of the existing new classrooms or gym for a year, using the current elementary and shop classrooms for high school, and the old Rosalie school building for elementary and junior high.

Lunches were cooked in Rosalie and delivered over to Bancroft, high school students were served on the stage.
No locker rooms in the Fall- high school students went home after practice to shower.
For two weeks the shop class had to have class outside until the dry-wall was finished.
Mr. Peters had class in the basement of the old Rosalie school in a room that hadn't been used for over 10 years.

A crazy year.

We made it through.

Hope you’re all hanging in there!! We are still so disappointed our seasons had to end the way that they did....until we meet again. As both L-D and B-R schools come to an end, we are going to collect all Wolverine Youth Sports basketball jerseys and wrestling singlets that have not been turned in yet. There will be drop offs next week in both Lyons and Bancroft. Please note the details for both locations.

LYONS: when you return your equipment to school on Tuesday May 12th, there will be a box for you to drop off your gear.

BANCROFT: please leave your gear in the tote in front of the city hall from 8 a.m. - 3:30 p.m. M-F, May 11-15.

If it doesn’t work for you to return them to either location please contact Leah Miller 402-720-1355 to make other arrangements.",0.0,"Wolverine Youth Sports

Parents,
Due to the rain, we will have to use our alternate plan for drop off and pick up tomorrow. We will NOT be going through the field. Please enter the back lot, and follow the cones to snake through the parking lot. We will still have two lines for drop off, but those will start a little closer to the actual drop off area. If traffic gets backed up to transportation, we will have you enter transportation, go through their parking lot, and then exit back out onto 173. We will do this to keep as many cars as possible off of 173. Thank you for your cooperation with this.",5.0,"Alkek Elementary-Bandera ISD

Most weather sites are predicting between a 50-60% chance of precipitation for Friday, including multiple days of rain over the weekend and early next week. Most of the same sites are predicting no rain on Thursday.

In order to have the celebration in a way that is rain-free and appropriately honors our graduating seniors, we have made the decision to move the 2020 BHS Graduation Ceremony to Thursday, May 21st, at 7:00 p.m. at Alkek Field (located between Alkek Elementary and the BISD Transportation Facility). We are fully aware that this provides some logistical challenges for our families, but our goal is to make this celebration happen in a way that is fitting for our outstanding Class of 2020. Please continue to monitor www.banderaisd.net for the latest updates.",2020-05-19 18:48:43,,

Band Students and Parents,

Thank everyone for their help with the last instrument pickup at Bandera MS. It was a complete success and we could not have done it without your cooperation. There have been a few requests to still pick up instruments. Mr. Elrod will be hosting another instrument pickup drive at Bandera MS from 5 PM to 6 PM on Friday April 17. Please pull your vehicle to the door of the band hall through the bus loop at Bandera MS. Once Mr. Elrod has identified who is picking up an instrument, he will retrieve the instrument and bring it to the next door, where you can pick it up. Thank you for your support and keep practicing!

Students should be receiving emails from College Board regarding testing updates. If you are not receiving them, please log in to your CB/AP account and update your personal email address.

There is a Parent/Student webinar with Trevor Packer, the head of the AP Program, at 6:00 tonight to discuss how at-home testing will work. I'll share the registration link ASAP.

Parents, we have updated our assignment page/choice board. You will continue to access it just like you have for the last few weeks, but the layout is a little different. Below is a short video explaining the new assignment sheet. We hope this helps alleviate some confusion and stress. As always, if you have questions reach out to your child's teacher or to admin.

4th-Grader, Kirstin Pierce, sent in her science experiment today as part of our distance learning choice board! Mrs. Holland, Ms. Bearden, and Mrs. Kothmann are so proud of the independence and excitement for learning our students are showing during these trying times! Through these experiments our 4th Graders are learning about Weathering, Erosion, and Deposition! Feel free to post more pictures in this thread if you do this experiment too! üòÅüòÅ

Some of you need to complete video assessments and all students need to keep up their playing skills. The time slots are in 10-minute intervals because we can only have one student at a time in the Band Hall.

Whether you call it virtual learning, learning from home, or just good ole‚Äô Google Classroom, it is important to check in with your 4 core academic teachers (no electives this week). If you don‚Äôt already know how to link up, just go to the BISD webpage and click on the COVID-19 School Closure Information button, and then to Learning@Home button to scroll and find the right link.
Teachers will offer posted assignments, reviews, resources, prerecorded instruction, and/or the times and dates of live instruction & virtual classroom check-ins with your class.
Think of this as a new, first day of school!

Monday, March 23 is the start of our BHS distance learning program. Whether you call it virtual learning, learning from home, or just good ole‚Äô Google Classroom, it is important to check in with your 4 core academic teachers (no electives this week). If you don‚Äôt already know how to link up, just go to the BISD webpage and click on the COVID-19 School Closure Information button, and then to Learning@Home button to scroll and find the right link.
Teachers will offer posted assignments, reviews, resources, prerecorded instruction, and/or the times and dates of live instruction & virtual classroom check-ins with your class.
Think of this as a new, first day of school!
We hope that you are excited and ready to go. Your teachers have been working hard at putting this all together, so get after it, like a true Bulldog!",,,

World Read Aloud Day is happening on February 5, 2020! The worldwide event from Scholastic and the global literacy nonprofit LitWorld calls attention to reading aloud and sharing stories. Now in its 11th year and celebrated in over 173 countries, World Read Aloud Day is a wonderful reminder of the power and importance of this best practice.

An abundance of research points to how reading aloud is both beneficial and beloved!

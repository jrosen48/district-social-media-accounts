The JGHS Athletic Department is proud to announce the 2019-20 recipient of the Saginaw Valley League Male Scholar Athlete of the Year Award - BLAKE WAIBEL!

In his words - ""My favorite memory at Glenn was winning districts my sophomore year against Freeland. We battled all season with a very young team playing in the SVL for the first year. We had many tough losses and made many mistakes, but it payed off during the playoffs because we played through adversity all season.

Being a student athlete has taught me values like diligence, responsibility, and perseverance. It takes a lot of time to master a craft, and I’m proud that the work I have put both in the classroom and on the field has paid off.

My future plans are to go to college in the fall to become an engineer, and I will decide where in the next few weeks.""

The WHITE group will attend school on Thursday, September 3rd at 7:55 a.m. The Virtual group will begin working from home on their device on Monday, August 31st, using the Kickstand Platform. It is very important for students in the RED and WHITE group to bring a water bottle, face mask, and their fully-charged device to school each day they attend. If you missed the Technology Device Pick up day, you will need to call the school office at 269-427-6863 x3029 to make an appointment for device pickup. Thank you and have a wonderful night!

To the cast and crew of ""Mirror of Most Value"" and ""Hammered - A Thor & Loki Story"":

Today would have been Tech Sunday, the end result of weeks of rehearsal and prep. I am as proud of you now as I would have been if we were opening soon. I know this has been a crazy spring, and I am just as out-of-sorts as many of you. Anyway, I am thinking of you today, as I think of you often. We will be back on stage next school year, no worries. I look forward to that time.

Today would have been Tech Sunday, the end result of weeks of rehearsal and prep. I am as proud of you now as I would have been if we were opening soon. I know this has been a crazy spring, and I am just as out-of-sorts as many of you. Anyway, I am thinking of you today, as I think of you often. We will be back on stage next school year, no worries. I look forward to that time.

Excelsior!

As Superintendent of Bangor Public Schools, I am writing to ask that you reach out to respectfully request the State of Michigan to take immediate action to waive the School days which our students' learning has been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. The Bangor Community, along with all districts in the State of Michigan, needs clear direction in support of our students and staff.

I have included a letter from Chris Wigent, Executive Director for MASA (Michigan Association of Superintendents & Administrators).

Thank you,
Lynn Johnson, Superintendent

Earlier today, Governor Whitmer placed an Executive Order of ""Stay Home, Stay Safe."" This has brought about questions concerning the Food Service Programs the Bangor Public Schools has been doing to feed our children. I have included a copy of the correction from Governor Whitmer. We will continue with our Food Delivery Program, as this is considered essential workforce.

Last week, Wednesday, the District provided bags of food for 673 children (2 breakfasts, 2 lunches, each totaling 2692 meals). Friday meal bags were provided for 904 children (3 breakfasts and 3 lunches for a total of 5424 meals). Over a 2 day period, Bangor Public Schools provided children with 8116 meals. We will continue providing as long as the State of Michigan allows.

Thank you to all who have helped make this possible for our children!

We also tapped several sugar maples and we collected about 20 liters of sap. We are boiling it down on hot plates. It takes a long time. The students are learning a ton. In Biology we are discussing modern genetics, dna, crspr, and of course the current pandemic. Been warning about this for years, look out, here it comes.",2020-03-07 10:30:03,,

Back in November, 2019, high school senior, and member of the Valhalla Vikings ESports club, Eric, and I were asked to present about high school ESports at WMU. Coach Ward and I took our three senior gamers on a field trip there and had a great time!

The powers that be were so impressed with Eric, that the Executive Director of MACUL requested that Eric and I present during the MACUL ESports conference on Saturday, March 14th. I am very excited about this, and I hope good things come out of it for Eric. He is an excellent gamer, and I think he could go far in the ESports industry. Congrats Eric.

Also, our FN Valhalla Fortnite team is ranked 13th out of 49 teams! Playoffs are on March 21st. Congrats Juan and Gael!

I am pleased to announce that both groups earned a Division 1 at MSBOA District 6 Band Festival. This is the highest rating and both groups are now qualified for festival.

It was also nice to have such amazing support from administration, family and friends who were able to make it out to the performance. Thank you to all who attended including those who helped chaperone.

1. Set up a dedicated space for schoolwork.
2. Create a daily for schedule – include a time for exercise (outside if the weather allows since your child needs sunshine).
3. Tell your child to show you each completed assignment.
4. Resist the urge to immediately help your child when they struggle. Give your child time to investigate, research, or figure out on his/her own.
5. Plan for 5-6 hours each day.
6. Work whenever it is most beneficial for your child. Take breaks as needed. Movement every 30 minutes is beneficial.
7. You will get out of this what you put into this.
8. Try hard not to worry or stress. Everything is going to be fine. Our nation will get through this as will our school.

Packet Pick-up additional info

The front doors will be locked. We want to limit the number of people entering the building. If you see several people waiting outside, we would encourage you to wait in your vehicle or come back another time. (Remember we have three pick up times on Fridays.)
We printed packets based on the information you gave us when we contacted you earlier this week. So if you told us that you have internet, we probably didn’t print a packet for your child. However, if you would rather have a packet than participate in Google Classroom, we can make one. It will take a little longer since we won’t have it already made.
Packets are one-way. That means we do not want you to return them to us. We want to keep our staff safe so once you receive the packet it does not come back to us. We are working on some method where teachers can grade and give feedback on the packets when they are completed.
Packets contain work for the whole week. The second round of packets will begin Friday March 27th.

We have had many people asking if we have any extra shirts/hoodies for sale. Since there was such a response, we have decided to re-open the sale for additional orders. The sale will run through February 23rd at 11:59 pm. Closing the sale on this date, should ensure that the garments are printed and delivered to students before spring break.
**Keep in mind that we must meet our minimum of 12 items per design to be able to process the order. The performance hoodies must meet that minimum as well, since they need a slightly smaller printing area.**

""You might think it’s just a count of U.S. residents, but the 2020 census is much more than that: The count and various estimates produced from it channel billions of dollars in federal funds to Texas, its local governments and its citizens... An accurate census is vital: An undercount of just 1 percent could cost Texas hundreds of millions in funding for key programs.""

This includes funding for educational programs / services like special ed, free and reduced lunch, teacher training, class size reduction, and additional classroom technology.

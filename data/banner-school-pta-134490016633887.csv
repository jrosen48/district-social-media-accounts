From the desk of the Superintendent

To our Banner School Community, we have posted a Parent Guide to distant learning to communicate and answer upcoming questions. We have included all contact information for certified staff. We are scheduling days and times for parents to drive up and pick up student items and return library books and uniforms. We will have all student items bagged up and labeled. The days and times are April 7 from 7 am to 10 am and April 8 from 1pm-4pm. All parents will remain in their cars much like the parent pick up process. Please refer to the information we have posted in the Parent Guide. Your families' health and wellbeing is very important to us and we are here to help as much as possible. Thank you for your cooperation in this challenging time, Mr. Prior",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2986134348136092&id=134490016633887,,0.0,"Banner's Parent Guide for Distant Learning

High School AD's, coaches, athletes and teams, we are very excited to introduce our new (virtual) training platform. We have been working very hard at not only continuing our training and providing the best value for our athletes and adults. But now we have stepped up our game BIG TIME with this new training app!

We will be able to host large teams virtually and create a team like atmosphere by hosting it on Zoom. We will then be able to track the data inside our training app and also monitor the athletes readiness based off (stress, sleep, mood, energy, and soreness).

For the month of May we will be offering Team Training for all sports! Summer Training will be here before we know it, and you wont have to waste a month of your summer training getting ready, if you are staying ready!

5 years ago our Girls developed a Varsity team locker room under the leadership of Keith Willis. This year our boys have disciplined and organize themselves to develop their own Varsity team locker room under their coach Jon Beover.

These boys have done a great job this past week painting, cleaning, and developing their own space. Not only do they do all of the work, but they also take on any financial responsibility for it.

The players all know this is a privilege and along with it comes more responsibility, accountability and higher expectations. They not only have to use them correctly (based on school guidelines, but they also have to keep them clean and self monitor appropriateness and proper use.

This room and this process is and will be a great place for the boys to build team unity and chemistry!

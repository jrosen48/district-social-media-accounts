Golf, Cross Country, Volleyball, and Girls Tennis are already competing at this time.

All sports will be following the previously outlined safety protocols as they have been following since the beginning of June.

As with all planning it is subject to possible change, but right now we are excited for our students to enjoy the sports and activities that help shape their character and education in our district.

The goal was for us to preserve busing for as many students as possible this school year!

It is our intention to continue busing for BHS students after the 2020-2021 school year is over.

From a safety standpoint, we can only have 1 child per seat on the bus.

Staggered start and end times at each building help us make our busing schedule as flexible as possible this year AND ensure that large groups of students aren't entering / exiting our buildings at the same time... provide more physical distancing at each school buildings.

The start and end times for each building will be defined in our plan.

All of these measures were put into place to make sure we can continue to bus all of our youngest students and to keep students and staff organized and as safe as possible.

She never complains but in fact relishes the opportunity to teach them important life skills they will need to know in their post-secondary everyday life. Ms. Mair is always kind and understanding and our kids love going to her classes. Not only does she accept our students in her classes but she also is a huge part of the Special Olympics and getting our students ready for it and participating and getting them involved when there. Thank you Ms. Mair.""",2020-04-05 13:04:00,,

All after school activities and all school-related activities are canceled from now until after Spring Break ends on April 12. This means that Barberton students are not to come to school beginning Monday, March 16 until April 13.

If your student was unable to attend school today and has not received an academic packet, please pick it up on Monday at the school building – our staff will be there. It is crucial that your student does not fall behind academically during this interruption of regular school days.

If you have questions about academic packs please call your building’s main office and they will assist you.

Remember, in Barberton we take care of each other! Let’s use this time to bond as a family and come back ready to go! Stay healthy, and Go Magics!",2020-03-13 11:00:00,,

Another great opportunity for our Barberton students to get out and give back. Working with the Ben Curtis Foundation to create Birdie bags for the less unfortunate!! Awesome for our students not only just to participate but also to see the behind scenes that go into making things happen. They realize how many good people out there donate their time and money to help the people of need.
And a special note to Mrs. Curtis and her mom that are actively involved in this program. The were there working very hard at making it happen!!!

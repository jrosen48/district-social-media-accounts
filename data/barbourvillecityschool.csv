October 1st is quickly approaching, and that is the day the Financial Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) opens for all students attending/planning to attend college. The earlier it is completed, the better. Below is some very helpful information to review on what documents you need to fill out FAFSA, where to go, and what to do in special living circumstances.

We will be hosting individual virtual FAFSA help sessions with our seniors and their families led by the Eastern KY KHEAA Representative on October 1st. Students will receive sign up information next week on their Class of 2021 Google Classroom.

Our guidance office and Knox Promise Neighborhood are also working together to host workshops for various grades with KHEAA to talk more about financial aid, scholarships, KEES money, etc. throughout the year.

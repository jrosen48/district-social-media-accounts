Microsoft certification gives students and workforce candidates the power to chart their own course, fulfill their ambition, and realize their potential. For students, Microsoft Office Specialist boosts academic performance and preps them for college and career.

Holding a MOS certification can earn an entry-level business employee as much as $16,000 more in annual salary than uncertified peers.

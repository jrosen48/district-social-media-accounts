Dear Barre Students, Families and Teachers,

We are glad that the first days of school are going well and everyone is staying safe. As of today, our district 𝐝𝐨𝐞𝐬 𝐧𝐨𝐭 have a positive case of COVID-19. Our schools continue to take precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and we are ready to act if a positive case is identified in one of our schools. If we are notified by the Vermont Department of Health that an individual at one of our schools has tested positive for COVID-19 we will move the school to 100% remote instruction for seven days or until the Vermont Department of Health has given us different guidance. This will allow time for required contact tracing and quarantining of affected individuals. It will also allow us time to thoroughly clean the affected school building. Thank you all for your understanding as we help keep the Barre community safe.

Sincerely,

David Wells

Dear Barre families,

I am reaching out to you as we get closer to the start of school. You may have heard that the Vermont Agency of Education and Department of Health revised their guidance to schools on August 11th. This new guidance reinforces the need to safely return students to school, especially for children ages 10 and under and changes some of the distancing recommendations. The BUUSD Reopening School Team, composed of teachers, paraprofessionals, principals, a representative from our school nurses, and other administrators reviewed this guidance. We decided to stay with our plan to reopen schools with a Hybrid Model and a Virtual Learning Model. This is necessary during this initial phase of reopening to ensure that our safety procedures and staffing ratios are effective. I recognize that we need to return to full in-person operations as soon as possible. We will be monitoring our situation over the start of school and stand ready to adjust our plans as conditions hopefully improve.

Sincerely,

Notice for Families of Students with Disabilities:

The Vermont Agency of Education has contracted with Potsdam Institute for Applied Research to conduct this year’s Parent Involvement Survey to let us know how parents feel about their school’s efforts to create meaningful partnerships with them and how they believe schools can better meet their child’s special needs. This survey will be mailed to all families of students with disabilities on or around July 31, 2020. Please be on the lookout for an envelope from the Vermont Agency of Education with a SUNY return address. There will be a link provided for those who wish to take the survey online. Should parents need assistance, they may contact Vermont Family Network at vermontfamilynetwork.org",2020-09-18 13:00:18.930277,,

National Teacher Appreciation Week 2020 is this week, May 4 to May 8. I want to express gratitude to all our teachers (and encourage everyone in our community to do the same).

I also want to use the opportunity provided by National Teacher Appreciation Week to thank everyone else who has taken a role in supporting our students during this time, including our non-teaching staff, as well as parents, guardians, and family members who are working with students at home. I recognize the challenges this has presented in many homes, and we in the school system want to thank you for your hard work.

The stop that has been in front of the Mathewson School on Elm St. will now move to Jefferson St. between the Aldrich Library and Elks Lodge (at the same time). A Robo Call will go out prior to Monday announcing these changes. You can find the flyer with all stops and times on our COVID-19 webpage at the link below.

Power is now back on and we have returned to normal operation at Barre Town School. For original Notice please see below:

This message is to inform you that we had a brief evacuation at Barre Town School this morning. We determined the cause was a roof ventilator which was not functioning properly, causing a smell. The fire department came and determined it was safe to return everyone back into the school. Power remains out in parts of the building for the time being but Green Mountain Power believes they will find and rectify the cause and we will be back to normal operation by 11:45am. All students and staff are safe and comfortable. Please do not come to the school or try to call as this may hinder any efforts to return to normal operation. An update will be provided by 11:45am.

Greetings.

It’s been such a busy year here at Barre City Elementary and Middle School, and we continue to be so excited about all the wonderful things that go on here everyday.

In all of the busyness, however, our school Newsletter kind of got pushed to the sidelines this year. And even though we’ve tried to keep everyone updated through facebook and other means, we’re happy to announce that with the release of our Spring 2019 issue, we’re (hopefully) “back on track” providing you with news and updates on all the events happening here at school.

As we look to the upcoming school year, we’ll be releasing the newsletter on a more regular basis with information on activities, upcoming events, and articles of interest to parents and families.

In the meantime, we hope you enjoy our Spring issue, and thank you, as always, for patience and support.

Bulldog Bulletin Newsletter - Barre City Elementary & Middle School",0.0,"Bulldog Bulletin Newsletter
Greetings.

It’s been such a busy year here at Barre City Elementary and Middle School, and we continue to be so excited about all the wonderful things that go on here everyday.

In all of the busyness, however, our school Newsletter kind of got pushed to the sidelines this year. And even though we’ve tried to keep everyone updated through facebook and other means, we’re happy to announce that with the release of our Spring 2019 issue, we’re (hopefully) “back on track” providing you with news and updates on all the events happening here at school.

As we look to the upcoming school year, we’ll be releasing the newsletter on a more regular basis with information on activities, upcoming events, and articles of interest to parents and families.

In the meantime, we hope you enjoy our Spring issue, and thank you, as always, for patience and support.

Thank you. It has been a long road. The work toward a merged district began four years ago and has involved a lot of meetings; some differences of opinion; and far too many trips to the polls. But despite the challenges of the past four years, we’ve managed to keep one thing at the forefront of our decision making: Our children’s education. With the passing of our first merged budget, we now get a break from the polls until next March.

I’ve spoken often about the “Barre Pride” we all share, and I feel that strongly today.

So thank you. To every student, every parent, every staff member, every administrator, every board member, and every voter who supported our budget and essentially said, “Let’s move forward.” Please know – we take your confidence in us seriously, and we will do everything we can to live up to the trust you have placed in us.

3) We make every attempt to keep our schools safe for our students. We have safety plans, evacuation plans, crisis emergency response teams, protocols and procedures in place in every building. We constantly review and look to improve our protocols, with after action reviews following any major event and drill we experience. The implementation of the A.L.I.C.E. emergency response protocol is one example if an improvement we are implementing.

4) We train our staff to be trauma-informed, and train them in social curriculum such as Developmental Design and Responsive Classroom, with a goal of supporting students emotional needs at all times, but especially in times of crisis. We have advisory systems in place to connect students with a caring adult, and our school counselors and behavioral support staff are available to help students in need.

Again, we want you to feel comfortable sending your children to our school and we want them to feel safe when they are here.

Sincerely,
John Pandolfo

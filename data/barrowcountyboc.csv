2) It helps all Georgia communities plan for the future.

3) It is a count of everyone who lives in the United States, including non-citizens. No questions about citizenship will appear on the questionnaire.

We would like to remind everyone that although we are currently in a “State of Emergency” it is not a reason to panic. Declaring the COVID-19 a national emergency allowed the federal government to free up nearly $50 billion in disaster money to fight the spread of the virus. It will also allow for expanded capacity at hospitals and reduce other health regulations that could slow action. The president has also declared an emergency under the National Emergencies Act, which will allow for Department of Health and Human Services to modify or waive regulations for Medicare, Medicaid and other programs.

The Stafford Act was created in 1988 to allow the federal government to offer a wide range of aid to states, municipalities, hospitals and even individuals. These declarations of emergency are POSITIVE THINGS from a public health standpoint. Let’s all stay calm and work together throughout this event.",2.0,"Barrow County Emergency Services

Public Advisory
BOIL WATER NOTICE
The isolation of a large diameter water main for repair is causing water pressure in parts of the water system to drop to dangerously low levels. In order to protect the public from a potential health hazard, all citizens that have experienced water outages and/or low water pressures are advised to “boil” all water prior to use for drinking, cooking, or preparing baby food. The water should be boiled for at least one minute after reaching a rolling boil. Citizens should continue to boil their water until they are notified by the Barrow County Water Department that the water system has been restored to full operation, and that the microbiological quality of the water in the distribution system is safe for human consumption. This notice will be updated in 24 hours.

Public Advisory
BOIL WATER NOTICE

The isolation of a large diameter water main for repair is causing water pressure in parts of the water system to drop to dangerously low levels. In order to protect the public from a potential health hazard, all citizens that have experienced water outages and/or low water pressures are advised to “boil” all water prior to use for drinking, cooking, or preparing baby food. The water should be boiled for at least one minute after reaching a rolling boil. Citizens should continue to boil their water until they are notified by the Barrow County Water Dept. that the water system has been restored to full operation, and that the microbiological quality of the water in the distribution system is safe for human consumption. This notice will be updated in 24 hours.

SHOUT OUT to Coach Vermeire, the junior high cross country team, and all those who joined them for the commemorative, and memorable, 9/11 workout this week.

Not only did the middle school teams do the following workout, but the high school teams joined as well as the middle school volleyball team, parents and coaches:

9 Flights of Pain – (roughly 62.5m each) – The bleacher stairs represent all the flights of stairs the first responders had to climb in all their gear to reach those people they could save.

11 Sprints of Honor – (37.5 meters each – total of 412 meters) – The total distance of these sprints (412m) represents the number of first responders that died that day.

2001 Meters of Remembrance – (5 Laps + 1m) This final run rounds out the total distance for the workout to 2977m. 2,977 was the total number of lives lost on 9/11.

We would like to increase workout participation for 9/11/2020; be on the lookout next year if you or your team would like to join in honoring the heroes and victims of this tragic event.",0.0,"The Bruin Middle School Cross Country team, led by Coach Vermeire, hosted a commemorative 9/11 workout this week.

Jessica B. from Bartlett City Schools and Bartlett Ninth Grade Academy used a L.E.A.D.S. Grant to create a classroom library for Spanish learning students. Having a classroom library with books in the target language will help my students better absorb Spanish in its written state. Using this as a class resource will allow my students to learn more Spanish in a shorter period of time, improving their proficiency level as well as their results on the National Spanish Exam.

Jessica says, ""I’m so thankful for receiving this grant last year. It has helped my students immensely! We have 130 Spanish level one readers in our classroom library, and I’ve been able to purchase e-books for the upcoming year as well.""

We have completed several aspects of the renovations including the Career Technical Education building, turf football field and practice field, curb and paving along the front drive, an expanded student and teacher parking- with approximately 400 parking spaces at this time. We are also completing work to the offices inside the Main building with flooring and carpeting already installed. This week, work continues on the Main building, various building connectors, fine arts wing, cafeteria, auditorium, as well as other building façade improvements.

If you haven’t seen the Bartlett High School campus lately, we have made tremendous progress over the summer. Our renovation plans continue to stay on track, and we are scheduled to start school on August 12 with buildings being completed in phases. Our Superintendent and Operations staff continue to meet daily to ensure the project stays on track, and we are excited to share all of our progress to date.

This week, work continues on the Main building connector as well as the Attendance and Guidance areas in the Main building. Work is also being completed on the West building connector, the front drives along Woodlawn, and our auto shop.

If you haven’t seen the Bartlett High School campus lately, we have made tremendous progress over the summer. Our renovation plans continue to stay on track, and we are scheduled to start school on August 12 with buildings being completed in phases. Our Superintendent and Operations staff continue to meet daily to ensure the project stays on track, and we are excited to share all of our progress to date.

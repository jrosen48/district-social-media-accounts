We sifted through each response collected from teachers, parents, and students and plan to utilize the information now in preparation for possible Digital Learning Days in the future.

However, in the event of a health or weather emergency, students and teachers will soon be able to access Microsoft Teams, a video conferencing platform that allows for live, secure online classrooms and virtual office hours. More information will be released at a later date.

Additionally, we're looking into screencasting software so teachers can communicate more effectively through quick, clear ""how-to"" videos. The software lets you capture your screen and use narration to customize a video. Again, more details to come.

Brooklyn Grace has a way to make any day a little brighter. She sent a video message that made my day. “Hello Miss Cheryl!” She said in her sweet voice. She was dressed up in a red dress and pink high top sneakers. “It’s been a little while since we talked.”

Brooklyn Grace is positive and energetic. She was born blind but is an incredible ability to recognize the beauty in people and life despite a long list of medical challenges.

Her mom Lexie Hunt said, “We found out about her health condition when she was 7 weeks old.”

Brooklyn Grace never gives up.

“I’ve got some good news to tell you.” She smiled to the camera. “I graduated from Pre-K!” She celebrated her 4-year-old graduation at home with a beautiful banner and balloons around her. And she got the best gift ever. “And I got a new puppy named Copper.” He is a beautiful black puppy who loves to snuggle in her lap.

Brooklyn Grace graces shows us what it means to be the sunshine to someone – in any circumstance.

“I hope your family is doing well.” She said. “And please don’t catch the corona.”

She helps to build a bridge of collaboration and trust between the school and families. Her balanced perspective helps both parents and teachers to better understand each other’s views and experiences. In the three years I have been Director, Kim has been an accountability partner, an encourager, a resource, and a friend. Knowing Kim, we know that the last thing she seeks is recognition; however, we are excited for this opportunity to recognize her and her contributions to the BCSS school system. Congratulations Kim! - Tania Amerson, Executive Director for Exceptional Education",2020-04-16 15:32:47,,

Jeremiah was nominated by the Science department as November's Student of the Month!

Jeremiah is the epitome of a conscientious student. While in the science room he made sure he took good notes and asked questions when he needed help. He used his time wisely, making sure he was at school every evening when he had the opportunity to be here. After he completed the Biology course, he spent the next week reviewing for the Milestone test just to make sure he was as prepared as possible. Because of his hard work in science Jeremiah is now a Senior at MECHS.

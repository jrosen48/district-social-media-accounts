Departing Basin Staff 2020

Basin Elementary
May 22 at 3:59 PM ·

Say farewell to departing staff!
This year, we have five staff members leaving who will be sorely missed: Mrs. Hunter in the office, Mr. Mark on the bus, Miss Snider in the elementary, Miss Mary in preschool, and Mrs. Wadley the master of all trades from Writing to PE to MS English!

Students have had the opportunity to leave them a goodbye message in their daily choice boards, but we wanted to extend another opportunity and encourage parents, high school students, and alumni to send a message as well! We will compile them all into a memory book for each of them.

Feel free to write as little or as much as you wish, share your favorite memory or an enduring lesson they taught you, and send them off with all the love and thanks they deserve.

Parents/Guardians,

We greatly appreciate all that families are doing to support their children's learning at home as well as the patience that you have granted to us as we are navigating a whole new way of instructing! We recognize that you all are having to juggle multiple responsibilities, and we know that it is not easy! Now that we have completed our third week of remote learning, we are asking for your feedback again. We are all learning throughout this process and your feedback will help us make adjustments as we go. Please use the link below to give us your thoughts and ideas.

Additionally, I have had a few questions regarding grades as well as when families might be able to pick items up from the school. More information will be coming out next Tuesday on both of these topics.

Thank you and have a relaxing weekend!

We would like to greatly thank the community of Idaho City for helping advertise, collect, and sort food boxes. We would also like to thank Ada County and Canyon County for graciously donating the food items so we can make a few families lives a little better in this time of uncertainty.

Have you heard about Kiddle? It’s a visual search engine for kids as an alternative to using google. I’ve had a bit of a play around and any searches I’ve tried with words that might show images you wouldn’t want children to have access to, return the message “oops, try again.” There’s also kid friendly facts, videos etc. I’ll be switching our landing page on my classroom computers to here from now on 👍 Find it at kiddle.co

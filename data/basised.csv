BASIS Charter Schools Reopening Plan: Families Choose in 2020–21 | San Antonio Charter Moms

August 13 at 6:45 PM ·

In the COVID-19 era, school reopening plans tend to contain some common elements. Schools of choice offer parents the option of distance learning or sending their kids to school on campus—provided that local conditions warrant in-person opening. The plans paint a picture of how distance learning will work in the coming school year, building on what schools learned in the spring. They also describe safety procedures to protect students, teachers, and staff on campus, including what to do in case of an outbreak. Schools also need to ensure that all students, regardless of their families’ economic situation, have full access to distance learning.

Today we’re sharing plans from BASIS.ed for the 2020-2021 school year. Does your family have students at BASIS? What is your child’s school implementing as we begin the new school year?",3.0,"Check out San Antonio Charter Moms overview of our Families Choose in 2020-21 Re-opening plan!

RSVP to receive the private Zoom link, here: https://bit.ly/KitchenChemistrySACM

List of Materials Needed:

percentage like what you would find at Sally Beauty, that works even better!)
- Dish soap
- Dry yeast
- Warm water
- Food coloring (optional)
- Plastic bottle (dry, empty water bottle or soda bottle)
- Small cup/bowl
- Measuring cups
- Funnel (optional)
- Container/pan or plastic table covering (optional, but makes clean-up a breeze!)
- Lab coat/apron/baggy old t-shirt (optional)

Dear BASIS Charter School families in Arizona,

We hope you are safe and well. We would like to provide you with an update regarding the start of the 2020-21 school year. In light of Governor Ducey’s new executive order delaying in-person school instruction until August 17, 2020, BASIS Charter Schools in Arizona plan to begin instruction 100% online on the regularly scheduled first day of school. We plan to return to our 'Families Choose in 2020-21' program, with parents indicating whether they would prefer to have their students receive instruction in-person or via distance learning, as soon as the State permits.

We will continue to provide updates to you over the summer and as guidance from officials evolves. Please continue to enjoy your summer!

Sincerely,

Literati Club here.

In past years, Literati has been sold and distributed in physical copies. However, due to COVID-19 and quarantine, we deemed it impossible to do so in a way that was safe and accessible. So, this year's edition of Literati has gone digital! By working on Literati remotely and producing a digital copy, we are also able to reach a wider audience within the BASIS community and beyond.

We'd like to say a big thank you to the administration who supported our ideas, the members who worked on the book, and to everyone who submitted! We hope you enjoy it, and stay safe!

Love,

Literati

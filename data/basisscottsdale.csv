As you know, our educators and our school's faculty, staff, and administrators have been working diligently to prepare for what will be an unprecedented academic year. However, we are ready for anything! We are ready for our students to learn on-campus (if that is possible given the national, state, and local circumstances), and we are ready for our students to learn via our distance learning program. Please find the BASIS Charter Schools Re-Opening and Distance Learning Plan for the 2020-21 school year here: https://tinyurl.com/y7gpvszj

As the summer progresses, we will continue to provide pertinent updates.

Dear BASIS Charter School families in Arizona,

We hope you are safe and well. We would like to provide you with an update regarding the start of the 2020-21 school year.

We plan to return to our 'Families Choose in 2020-21' program, with parents indicating whether they would prefer to have their students receive instruction in-person or via distance learning, as soon as the State permits.

We will continue to provide updates to you over the summer and as guidance from officials evolves. Please continue to enjoy your summer!

You know those really cool pictures of galaxies, pulsars and other heavenly bodies? Well it is easy to take them for granted, but there is a lot of work that goes into extracting the image of interest. And that work starts with data‚Ä¶Terabytes of data. This is the focus (pun intended) of Zachary G‚Äôs Senior Project, as he works with the Astrophysics Department at ASU. They gather raw data from the Hubble Space Telescope and endeavor to filter out extraneous radiation that blurs images of the really cool things like galaxies. Along with working hard, Zak entertains us all with his witty blogs, stunning stick figure art and super clear images and simulations‚Ä¶like this past weeks sim of the Hubble orbiting Earth.

Adam is working at Chick-fil-A under the supervision of mentorship of Jesse Summer and his faculty advisor Mr. Johnson. Adam is designing a model to promote sustainable consumer behavior at Chick-fil-A. This project will document his time at Chick-fil-A, where he will continue to work with different managers to test different ways to decrease the impact of in-store waste. His analysis looks at the consumer's reaction to choice. and how being provided with different environmentally friendly options will affect their environment decision making. Adam hopes to reduce the amount of waste created by consumers while also ensuring the restaurant chain maintains its normal consumer basis.

Due to COVID-19, Adam is not working to help Chick-fil-A build long term response plans, or contingency plans, that will prepare the restaurant for what is to come.

Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs), the most recent type of single-photon detectors, have achieved high-speed, high-efficiency, low-noise single-photon detection. In recent years, technology has progressed to correct for limitations like constrictions and cooling to make SNSPDs very reliable and effective. The ultimate goal of Kyle's research is to experimentally confirm the relevance of SNSPDs for astronomical instruments and point to areas of application for further research to take advantage of the technology. In this research, a team of ASU graduate students and Kyle experimentally test the precision of the instrument by examining its signal-to-noise ratio and comparing it with an instrument that has no SNSPD.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2896630120387205&id=761474530569452,,0.0,"Congratulations to Kyle S., AP Research ""Blog of the Week""!

Through researching and analyzing existing investments strategies and the financial instruments used to deploy them, he will model a new strategy that can generate hedge fund-level ROI with less risk and then paper trade my fund concept to determine its viability and create a refined final product.

My homeroom class got to receive their sponsor books today! My second block class should be receiving them soon but I’m waiting on a few more to arrive first.

What is a “sponsor book?” This is my third year doing what I call “Sponsor a Student.”￼￼ I reach out on social media asking if anyone would like to sponsor a student. What a sponsor is signing up to do is to purchase a book for a student￼ and send them well wishes throughout the year. Many sponsors also write notes of encouragement inside the book if they are able to. Sponsors have been from all over the United States! The students get to keep the book at the end of the year, and it is a reminder that they will always have people that believe in them no matter what!￼￼

Thank you sponsors! We appreciate you!

All of the events will be livestreamed at TeachersCan.org/events, unless indicated otherwise there. And get some sleep , because your schedule of events starts at 7:30 each morning, including tomorrow. You don't have to be a teacher to participate, but we are doing this specifically to pay tribute to our awesome Texas teachers.

This morning our youngest learners at the Emile Child Development Center mixed up their own batch of playdough.

The students and teachers in Toddler 2 worked on math skills (measuring ingredients) and gross motor development (large movements). Students made snakes, tortillas, and balls by manipulating the play dough in their hands with the assistance of the teachers.

This is an easy activity you can do at home as well!

Playdough Ingredients:
1 cup flour
1/2 cup salt
1 T. Massage oil
1/2 cup of water

Combine all ingredients and mix well to playdough consistency.

If you want to add some color you can add tumeric for yellow, paprika for orange, blueberry juice for blue, or food coloring.",0.0,"Teaching math while doing a fun activity. #LearningIsFun

Our district has created a brief survey to better understand the perspectives and level of concern our stakeholders have regarding the reopening of our schools for students in September 2020.

The COVID-19 pandemic required significant action and disruption from our traditional face-to-face instructional model.

The information and data that is gathered from this survey will help our district best prepare and develop plans, protocols, and safety measures that are appropriate and align with our stakeholders' expectations. Our top priority is the health, safety, and welfare of our students, staff, and families.

Thank you for sharing feedback on these topics that relate to the reopening of schools in the Fall.

The lessons included additional informational resources as well as activities and projects from Mr. Rebisz and other fourth grade teachers.

It is also our hope that we also will be able to provide our Batavia High Seniors opportunities to be celebrated but we will need further guidance on safety protocols and social distancing. We will continue to communicate information as decisions are made.

A perfect picture that sums up so much of what we‚Äôve been witnessing through this whole event: people stepping up and then going above and beyond.

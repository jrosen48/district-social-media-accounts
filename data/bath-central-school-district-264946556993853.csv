Two candidates, Mr. John Herrick and Dr. Susan Narby, are running for one 5-year seat on the Board.

Please call Mrs. Kelly Oest, District Clerk, at 776-3301 if you did not receive an absentee ballot in the mail and wish to vote.

Just so everyone has factual information, there was a high school student who made several disturbing posts on social media over the weekend which were addressed as soon as we were made aware this morning. Local law enforcement is involved. The student is no longer on campus and is under constant supervision. Our staff and students are aware and there is no threat to our school. A robocall has been sent out to the parents and community to reassure everyone that all is safe and we are running under a normal schedule. This is a very serious matter and unfortunately, we are restricted on what can be shared with the public at this time due to student confidentiality.

Under a lockout scenario, all students go about their day in a normal routine within the buildings. No students are allowed outside of the building and no visitors are allowed in the building without proper clearance. This was only precautionary and as always, the students were wonderful!

In the event that this was a prolonged emergency which prevented the students from leaving school under normal circumstances at dismissal time, we would have contacted you with specific instructions for dismissal under the direction of law enforcement. We practice these protocols regularly with hope that we never have to use them and so that all of our staff and students understand what to do in a crisis situation.

Please feel free to call my office with any questions or concerns.

As you may have heard by now, the Haverling family lost a very special lady this week. Ms. Karin Machuga lost her battle with ALS and passed away early Tuesday morning at the age of 51 years young. Ms. Machuga has been an amazing first grade teacher here at the VEW Primary School, as well as an extra-curricular advisor to activities such as Academic All-Stars for many years. More importantly, Karin has been a role model for our kids, a mentor to many of her colleagues, and an inspiration to all of her friends. She was always available to lend an ear, give of her time, and bring a smile to your face. Even in the struggles of this recent school year following her diagnosis, Karin was dedicated to her students, and was often going beyond her limitations to provide a fun learning environment for her class. I am thankful to have had the opportunity to have worked with Karin, and even more grateful to have called her a friend. Please keep the Machuga family in your thoughts and prayers.

We would like to send a shout out to the Baxter baseball team for their amazing display of sportsmanship last night. Our JV team has a player who was up to bat for the first time ever in his life. The pitcher moved up on the mound and threw him way more than three strikes until he eventually hit the ball and got on base. The Baxter dugout cheered just as loud as ours did. Baxter – you were truly a display of good sportsmanship – which is exactly what our world needs right now. Thank you!",4.0,"Well done, Baxter Bolts. Real life lessons learned.

We will continue with our voluntary learning opportunities and we strongly encourage students to take advantage of them. As we get more information from the Iowa Department of Education and the Governor's office we will update you. Also all spring sports and activities have been cancelled and we will find out by June 1st about summer activities.

This is very disappointing news and I hope all of our Baxter families know how much we miss all of you and how saddened we are by the news that we don't get to come back and finish our school year together. Over the next few days we will be sending out more detailed information about things like collecting things from your desk or lockers and plans for events like graduation.

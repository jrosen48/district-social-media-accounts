To help Michiganders receive unemployment benefits as a result of COVID-19, the Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA) has developed a schedule for workers to file for benefits based on the first letter of their last name. The agency continues to see a historical increase in working families seeking emergency financial relief and this new schedule will improve functionally, accessibility and help alleviate bottlenecks in both the online system - Michigan.gov/UIA - and over the phone at 866-500-0017.

The day or time of day in which a claim is filed will not impact whether a worker receives benefits or their benefit amount. Additionally, claims will be back-dated to reflect the date in which a claimant was laid-off or let go from their job due to COVID-19. The eligibility window to apply has also been increased from 14 to 28 days from the date of their work stoppage.

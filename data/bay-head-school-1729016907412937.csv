Did you know that you should drink 8 x 8oz glasses of water per day? Water does so many important jobs in the body, yet it is very common for people to forget about water consumption throughout the day. Replacing fruit juices and soda with water can be an easy first step in achieving better health. For this week’s challenge, keep track of how much water you drink in a day and try your best to get to that 64 ounce total. If you don’t like water, try “sprucing it up” a bit by adding fresh fruit or herbs.

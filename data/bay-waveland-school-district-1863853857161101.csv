Hi, all.

A number of you have asked about purchasing the hat that we will be giving the graduates on graduation night.

I am including a picture of the hat as an attachment.

If you would like a hat and you want it guaranteed to be here to us by graduation day, you must place your order by 2:00 p.m. tomorrow. You may order one by sending a payment to the BHS PTO Paypal or Venmo accounts.

Bay High Paypal is bayhightigerspto@gmail.com and the Bay High Venmo is Bay High - PTO.

The cost of the hat will be $20 each.

If you send payment after 2:00 p.m. tomorrow, your order will be in after graduation. Orders will close at 2:00 p.m. on Monday the 18th.

Please type your contact phone number and email in the notes with your payment.

Thank you so much.

Some days are probably easier than others, too. There's the technology failures, kids squabbling, teachers forgetting to unmute themselves while they speak, and more.

Everyone give yourselves a break -- you're doing great! Teachers, students, parents -- think how far we've come, how much we've all done -- in a month. YOU ARE ALL AMAZING.

Here's a glimpse of what some of you have going on at home:

1) Brock and Clair took it outside for ""PE"" during their daily PE time recently. As you can see, a 5th grader playing with a 1st grader doesn’t always work out.
Brock attends Tenie Holmes and Clair attends Linnie Roberts.

2) First grader Phoenix enjoyed her Zoom meeting with Mrs. DeLong and Mrs. Godley. She attends Linnie Roberts.

3) Camden, a Cherry Pre-K student, practices writing and coloring a rainbow in Mrs. Davis' class.

The WIT program is designed for mentoring and encouragement to prepare students for STEM-rich programs at universities, two-year technical colleges, and technical certificate programs. By participating in WIT, students gain exposure to higher education and career opportunities while building the confidence to consider further STEM education. While the founding emphasis is based in nuclear energy and technology applications, the program is broadly open to all aspects of STEM applications. The WIT program engages students through local sponsors within participating schools in the State of Texas.
BCHS WIT sponsors are Jill Lowry and Angela Baker.

The meet featured over 200 seventh and eighth grade swimmers from all over the Houston area.

Top finishers for Bay City included:
Lucie F – 1st in 50 yard Freestyle; 2nd in 50 yard Butterfly
Megan M – 2nd in 50 yard Breaststroke; 4th in 200 yard Freestyle
Suhona K – 4th in 50 yard Backstroke

The mixed Medley Relay of Suhona K (backstroke) Megan M (breaststroke), Lucie F (butterfly) and Chris C (freestyle) finished in sixth place.

Head Coach Bob Button said, “We ended our junior high season on a high note with some excellent swims! I was especially proud of the way our eighth grade ‘veterans’ took care of the seventh grade ‘rookies.’ Most of our rookies hadn’t ever been to a meet of this magnitude and they handled the pressure very well.
This was a fun group of kids to work with this year. The improvement since November was tremendous and I hope they all stick with the sport.”

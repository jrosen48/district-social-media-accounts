By expanding this opportunity to include elementary and middle school students, we aim to provide families looking for a more flexible learning environment with the same high-quality instruction they have come to expect from Bay City teachers.

This expansion of virtual education will occur alongside the district’s plan for returning to in-person instruction in the fall. Today’s news that Governor Whitmer is also planning for students’ return to schools is encouraging. Based on her direction, we will be working with district and community leaders throughout the summer to prepare for students' safe return to our buildings in the fall.

HEMLOCK, Mich. — When Kolb and McAlear-Sawden elementary schools in Bay City won a CARE Grant recently from Hemlock Semiconductor Operations (HSC), it meant a whole new learning opportunity for the more than 1,000 students.

The money will help the schools purchase nonfiction reading materials intended to get K-5 students excited about science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). The schools also will be able to buy STEM kits that will give hands-on experience with these subjects to all students, including those in special education or learning to speak English.

“We’re so excited by this opportunity to buy these materials for our students, and to give our teachers new ways to engage their classes on these important topics,” said Bay City Public Schools Superintendent Steve Bigelow. “HSC’s support could spark a lifelong love for math and science in our elementary students.”",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1036632370037841&id=383757428658675,,0.0,"Special Shout Out to Rebecca Field, Sandy Stevens, and Jennifer Jungnitsch for receiving a grant from the 2019 DOW Corning Foundation/SVSU-Community STEM Partnership!

HEMLOCK, Mich. — When Kolb and McAlear-Sawden elementary schools in Bay City won a CARE Grant recently from Hemlock Semiconductor Operations (HSC), it meant a whole new learning opportunity for the more than 1,000 students.

The money will help the schools purchase nonfiction reading materials intended to get K-5 students excited about science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). The schools also will be able to buy STEM kits that will give hands-on experience with these subjects to all students, including those in special education or learning to speak English.

“We’re so excited by this opportunity to buy these materials for our students, and to give our teachers new ways to engage their classes on these important topics,” said Bay City Public Schools Superintendent Steve Bigelow. “HSC’s support could spark a lifelong love for math and science in our elementary students.”",2020-01-07 08:54:12,,

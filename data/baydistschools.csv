Our community-based task forces have been working for the past month and their ideas/suggestions/proposals will be presented to the School Board at a workshop on July 14th. If you‚Äôre unable to attend, the event will be live-streamed (we will post the link ahead of time) and we will post all of the documents to our COVID-19 webpage. AFTER the workshop, when plans have been discussed, we will be sending out another stakeholder survey to all parents, guardians, employees and others in the community to get your feedback about what you‚Äôd like to see when schools reopen and what your concerns are currently. We‚Äôve already accomplished so much together since the storm, no doubt we can tackle this pandemic together as well.

Although the methamphetamine pills appear to be kid-friendly, it is more likely the pills are designed to evade law enforcement detection.

Bayfield School District shared a link to the event: Bayfield PTSA Spring Fling and Color Run.
April 16, 2019 at 10:48 PM ·

Hello Bayfield PTSA Members -

We are in desperate need of volunteers to help us make the Color Run a success. If you can spare an hour of your time we would appreciate it. This is our only fundraiser and all the money benefits our K-5 students. We were able to give $10,000 back to the schools for the 2018/2019 school year.

Also, High School Students can fulfill some community service hours by volunteering for a station. Any officer can sign off.

Please spread the word. The sign up is below.

SignUp.com Mobile",2.0,"Hello Bayfield PTSA Members -

We are in desperate need of volunteers to help us make the Color Run a success. If you can spare an hour of your time we would appreciate it. This is our only fundraiser and all the money benefits our K-5 students. We were able to give $10,000 back to the schools for the 2018/2019 school year.

Also, High School Students can fulfill some community service hours by volunteering for a station. Any officer can sign off.

Please spread the word. The sign up is below.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT!

Teachers observed our classrooms and took part in a collaborative conversation to discuss what curriculum at BBCHS looks like. They also focused on how teachers can use their content area to set students up for success during their transition to high school.

Strategy 1.3 of our strategic plan focuses on partnering with elementary districts to improve K-12 articulation. Days like this are huge steps forward for our district. It is always an amazing experience to see teachers across the community collaboratively working together to set students up for success.

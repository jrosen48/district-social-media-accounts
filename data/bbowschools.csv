Hello everyone! We are Broken Bow students part of Youth Leadership Custer County. Our organization focuses on high school upperclassmen improving leadership skills, diversifying, utilizing their communication skills, and promoting community improvement. We meet once a month to learn new things, make connections with each other, and work on making the world around us a better place. For our community improvement project, we decided to celebrate Earth Day. We’re taking it one step further though, and educating people throughout the whole week to make an EARTH WEEK! We originally had many ideas to do activities to help the planet through our school, but because of the current situation, we decided to take it virtual and promote others to do the same! The week of Earth Week (April 20th-24th) we are posting challenges on our Facebook page that will challenge you to do something to better the Earth in our community. We can all improve our community by celebrating Earth Day and Earth Week with us! We hope you like our everyday challenges and celebrate with us!",0.0,"Please head over and like our BBHS Youth Leadership Earth Week page for some good information and activities!

As a follow up to the information that we sent out this past week about the Pre-Participation Physical Exams (PPE), I have received several emails asking for clarification regarding 7th & 8th Grade PPEs. So, I wanted to make sure that everyone was receiving the same response.

The requirement for students entering the7th grade to have a physical exam is Nebraska state education law and we do not have the ability to waive that requirement. However, the physicals that the current 7th graders have for the 2019-2020 school year can be used for NSAA purposes for the 2020-2021 school year.

After discussions with legal counsel and our insurance provider, due to our catastrophic insurance requirements, all current 8th Grade students that are going to enter the 9th grade in 2020, will STILL be required to get a PPE for the 2020-2021 school year. All other high school students entering grades 10, 11 & 12 grades that have a PPE paperwork for 2019-2020 school year, can use that physical for the 2020-2021 school year.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3310302688983417&id=584381134908933,"Broken Bow Public School-Activities Department

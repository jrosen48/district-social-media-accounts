If you weren’t able to go to the Smoking G’s food truck last night don’t worry they will be here tomorrow (weather permitting) on Wednesday July 1 for both lunch & evening￼.

The truck will be in front of the old fire station at 105 E Grundy from 11 to 1.

They will be in the gravel portion of the parking lot at the high school from 4:30 to when games are over (approximately 7:30).

Let’s support them so we can have them back!!

Remember to order your Team Rylee shirt! (order form attached) Rylee is a sweet 10 year old with muscular dystrophy and cerebral palsy along with other special needs. She is being raised by her grandma & grandpa. Rylee is currently in Ia City hospital ICU fighting for her life. She has gone through a few different surgeries to repair blockages and a twisted intestine. They have done separate surgeries so her little body could withstand the stress. She has been on a ventilator since being transferred from Marshalltown ER and still remains on it to let her badly infected lungs heal.
T-shirts orders can be mailed or dropped off at the superintendent district office (attention Mr. Parker or Pam), or at Hutch Screenprinting during normal business hours. $5 for each shirt sold will go to benefit the family. Please let Pam or Mr. Parker know if you have any questions. When orders are filled we will contact people to arrange for pick-up times.
Order forms will also be located at Hutch Screenprinting and the Gingersnap.

Attached is the shirt order form to benefit Rylee Rhodes/family associated with her care and stay at the University of Iowa Hospital. As many of you are aware, Rylee has had multiple surgeries in the last week, and is also fighting pneumonia and some other health issues.
Orders can be mailed or dropped off at the superintendent district office (attention Mr. Parker or Pam), or at Hutch Screenprinting during normal business hours. $5 for each shirt sold will go to benefit the family. Please let Pam or Mr. Parker know if you have any questions. When orders are filled we will contact people to arrange for pick-up times.

Thank you to Jacob Holub from Elite for being great to work with on the project!

Way to go Comets!!! In addition to the awesome school spirit videos posted, thank you to everyone who purchased a BCLUW United To Fight t-shirt. Nearly 300 shirts were purchased, raising $1,685 through the Elite Sports “We Got Spirit Challenge” for student leadership opportunities in our Leader In Me program at BCLUW. The program raised over $60,000 for schools/programs across the state. We are looking at sending a message out about shirt delivery at the end of the week. Deliveries should happen early next week after the shirts arrive.

Hello, this is Morgan Bergman with BCLUW Middle School. For the past 19 years, we have had a Veterans Day Program to honor our Veterans. We distribute flags to veterans, read poems written by 7th and 8th graders, and sing songs to thank the veterans. For our twentieth year, we are inviting a Grammy Winning musician, Dr.Monte Selby, to write music for the Veterans Day Program. Dr. Selby specializes in education, was a professor, teacher, and principal. Our 7th and 8th-grade band will also be playing the National Anthem and all the military branch songs.

We would like you to come and honor our veterans on November 11, 2019, at 2:00 for the twentieth year celebration.

Thank you- Morgan Bergman, BCLUW 7th grade",3.0,"BCLUW Middle School

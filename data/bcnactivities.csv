Ok, folks....this is a new post for the SPIRITWOOD area! I am not very familiar with that area at all so, I'm going to need your help!
I am planning only one night to try to get everyone I can in this area. That is set for Wednesday, May 20th.
Please comment on this post if you want to get on my schedule and make sure to text or message me with your address. Feel free to tag your neighbors and friends.
*Recall...this is a quick, no pose photo. By taking it, you agree to have it posted on my Facebook Page BAR NONE Photography and release the use of it for any other purposes.
**I am not asking for any compensation, but if you have the means to do so, please make a donation to a local organization in need (food pantry, fire department, park board, just to name a few)",2020-05-11 21:53:44,,

A favorite among BCPS staff, especially our directors and principals, and definitely our students and families is the annual Build A Backpack event at The Outreach Center, which is usually held the 3rd Saturday in August.

This event this year was one of many lost to COVID-19.

We did not get to see students’ smiling faces as they picked out their backpack, jumped in the bouncy house or gazed in awe at a firetruck.

But thanks to the Burke County United Way, The Outreach Center and a generous donation from Chartwells, 1,000 students were still able to receive free backpacks filled with much-needed school supplies.

At Monday's Board of Education meeting, Superintendent Dr. Larry Putnam recognized these agencies for their partnership, for their valuable work in our community and their support of Burke County Public Schools students.

Today’s stop on our stay-at-home tour of the NCSSM-Morganton campus is Goodwin Hall, a historic structure under renovation to feature our main welcome space (akin to Durham’s Bryan Lobby for all of our #NCSSMuni viewers out there!). Many of the existing spaces in this beautiful early-20th century building will remain with slight tweaks for increased accessibility – elevator access to all four floors, outdoor staircases, bull-pen style office bays, and even a small catering kitchen to maximize use of a penthouse conference room with incredible views. As you can see in this building and those that we’ll be touring in the days to come, designing spaces for connection, collaboration and community are at the heart of the NCSSM-Morganton campus plans.

Today’s stop on our stay-at-home tour of the NCSSM-Morganton campus is Goodwin Hall, a historic structure under renovation to feature our main welcome space (akin to Durham’s Bryan Lobby for all of our #NCSSMuni viewers out there!).

Tuesday, May 5 is Teacher Appreciation Day. On this special day, please help us show teachers how much we appreciate their commitment and support to students and families by displaying a light in a window or outside at 8:20 p.m. (2020 military time) for 20 minutes. Teachers, thank you for lighting the way to learning for North Carolina’s students.

Based on guidelines from the state as well as input from nearly 300 families and more than 250 staff members who responded to the district’s community survey, the proposed plan outlines a plan for BCPS students to return safely to learning in a way that minimizes the risk of the spread of COVID-19 to the greatest extent possible. The plan will be presented to the BCPS board of education on Monday at 5:30 p.m. and be made available on the BCPS website immediately following the presentation. We want to ensure all of our families can get their questions answered, so please join us for a live Q&A with Superintendent Carter on Wednesday, July 29 at 5:30 pm via Facebook Live.

At Battle Creek Central High School, we believe we are a part of the community and that community participation and input is critical to ensure that we are meeting the needs of every Bearcat. We are looking to engage more parents/guardians through our Parent Advisory Council. If you are interested in an opportunity to inform the work of Battle Creek Central High School please contact me, the Communities in Schools Site Coordinator at emccoy@battle-creek.k12.mi.us. We are a community, so we start each meeting off by having dinner together. Please RSVP to the above email, if you plan on attending. Meetings begin at 6:00 pm in the Media Center and we will meet on the following dates:
January 20th

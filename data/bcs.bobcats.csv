As you know, 3 dates have been set aside for possible in person graduation ceremonies. Unfortunately, we now know that we cannot hold a ceremony on June 13th. However, July 11th and August 8th still remain as possible dates, and we will continue to monitor the Governor's Executive Orders and guidelines from health organizations to determine when we are able to safely hold an in person ceremony. Please note that alternative graduation ideas may also be considered.

Caps and Gowns/Senior Products: The school does not have the products at this time. Additional information will be available next week regarding safe distribution of the products.

Tonight, I announced that in order to slow the spread of COVID-19 in Michigan, I am ordering the closure of all K-12 school buildings, public, private, and boarding, to students starting Monday, March 16 until Sunday, April 5. School buildings are scheduled to reopen on Monday, April 6.

I am working with partners across state government to ensure educators, parents, and students have the support they need, and to ensure our children who rely on school for meals have access to food.

I know this will be a tough time, but we’re doing this to keep the most people we can safe. I urge everyone to make smart choices during this time and to do everything they can to protect themselves and their families.

Information around this outbreak is changing rapidly.

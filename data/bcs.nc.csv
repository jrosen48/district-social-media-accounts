1. Letters were mailed yesterday with your child's A/B schedule.

2. Please make sure you contact magee@bcswan.net if you need bus transportation and have not signed up this year.

3. We appreciate all you are doing to help your child be successful! We know this is hard. 💜 Please be sure to check grades weekly--we have a lot of students who are participating in one or two classes, but not all four cores. Please encourage your child to attend all classes, every day.",2020-08-28 12:24:04,https://video-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/10000000_1011363012652364_2145632250724035782_n.mp4?_nc_cat=108&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=QUNUJEVeV94AX_qXPfj&_nc_ht=video-atl3-1.xx&oh=47b8677c661b510db0b0530a5dd09421&oe=5F5EB06D,

👩‍⚕️ First up is for the folks already in the buildings:

""Please remember to follow district guidelines regarding the 3 Ws (Wear, Wait and Wash).
Wearing a mask, social distancing and washing your hands helps to protect you and others.
Masks are required for all staff members while on school grounds unless you are working privately in your classroom, office or designated workspace.
Let's set a good example for our students and community by following these simple safety guidelines to keep everyone healthy.
Wearing a mask may seem trivial to some, but for others, it could be a matter of life or death.""

West Brunswick High School Remote Learning Plan - Student Version

West Brunswick High School Trojans
August 7 at 10:14 PM ·

Fellow Trojans! Welcome to the 2020-2021 school year!

Over the summer, West Brunswick High School created a school-based reopening team called Best for West. During the process, our team identified three guiding principles to lead the decision making: Health and Safety, Student Success, Quality Teaching and Learning. Here you will find the Best for West Remote Learning Plan.

Our school community represents the best of Brunswick County, and I know that we will move as ONE West during the 2020-2021 school year.

Normally in the spring JHMF would be visiting all of our local kindergarten classrooms to present Josh the Baby Otter and teach about being safe around water. We really miss seeing those little ones this year!

Here is a video of the story, Josh the Baby Otter, that we read to kindergarten. Please watch with your littles- great for ages 2-7 years. After the story take the Josh the Otter Water Safety Pledge together. For more otter fun, make the Josh the Otter puppet. Link will be in comments below. Look for the free mobile Josh the Otter app as well!

We hope you enjoy these activities with your kids and that they help reinforce the lesson that they should never go near water without an adult.

Normally in the spring JHMF would be visiting all of our local kindergarten classrooms to present Josh the Baby Otter and teach about being safe around water. We really miss seeing those little ones this year!

Here is a video of the story, Josh the Baby Otter, that we read to kindergarten. Please watch with your littles- great for ages 2-7 years. After the story take the Josh the Otter Water Safety Pledge together. For more otter fun, make the Josh the Otter puppet. Link will be in comments below.

Below is another video 📹 we hope you will find interesting and educational.

Have you ever been to a Career Day where people come in and talk about their jobs?

We thought it might be fun to have a “Virtual Career Day” and have some folks here at the Sheriff’s Office describe what they do in a short video.

🕵🏻‍♂️Ever wonder what it would be like to be a real detective? Today, Detective Stephen Baize with the Sheriff’s Office Criminal Investigations Unit talks about what it takes to be a detective and even demonstrates one important tool he uses to investigate crimes.

Have a question for Det. Baize? Post your question in the comments below or email us at brunswicksheriffpio@gmail.com.

‼️Attention students, parents, and teachers‼️

Below is another video 📹 we hope you will find interesting and educational.

Have you ever been to a Career Day where people come in and talk about their jobs?

We thought it might be fun to have a “Virtual Career Day” and have some folks here at the Sheriff’s Office describe what they do in a short video.

🕵🏻‍♂️Ever wonder what it would be like to be a real detective? Today, Detective Stephen Baize with the Sheriff’s Office Criminal Investigations Unit talks about what it takes to be a detective and even demonstrates one important tool he uses to investigate crimes.

Have a question for Det. Baize? Post your question in the comments below or email us at brunswicksheriffpio@gmail.com.

Beginning Monday, September 14, 2020, ALL B-C-S students (including ROLO) will be able to receive a FREE breakfast and lunch daily through December 18, 2020, or when grant funds are depleted, whichever is sooner.

You can pick up from either 9-10AM or 5PM-6PM. Please call the food service office to register at 419-898-4449 or email VCoffman@bcssd.com if you have not already done so.

This past week we had our HS Marching Band Camp. While it was far from a normal week, we were all glad to get back at it. This season will definitely put us in uncharted territory, but we are working hard to make the best of whatever situation presents itself.

We would like to give a BIG shout out to our students! From our student leadership to our new members, everyone worked very hard and was mindful of all of the restrictions we are working under. Band camp was entirely outside, and while hot, the students had a great attitude all week.

We also want to thank all of the adults who helped us. Thank you to all who helped with uniform fittings (especially our uniform chairs Mrs. Dedes & Mrs. Brough) and our band camp staff who helped us with music and marching preparation. We'd also like to thank our superintendent Dr. Parmigian for providing the band members with ice cream bars this past Friday! 😀

It takes a village to run a band program, and we are extremely grateful for our village of students, parents, and school personnel.

Thank you for your support of Benton-Carroll-Salem School District this school year. Remote learning in March, April and May required a monumental team effort between our teachers, staff, and families. I am proud of what we accomplished by working together. Thank you!

Like educators across the nation, I am hopeful and optimistic that students will be able to safely return to classrooms in the fall. It is important, however, for us to evaluate our remote learning services to make improvements, in case it is necessary to do remote learning again in the future.

It is with much Rocket Pride that I announce our 2020 Oak Harbor High School Top 10 Students and their ""Honored Educator"" who made a significant impact personally and educationally. The Top Ten Banquet where students have the opportunity to read why they selected their honored educator was originally to be held in April. It has been postponed to June 24.

For now, I direct you to the list of our Top 10 Students with their Honored Educator. I also direct you to the attachment where the student speeches have been printed. The speeches are heartwarming and speak to the noble character of both students and educators. I know that those who have been named as Honored Educators consider it an amazing tribute.

There were several MAJOR announcements made today that directly impact our bands:

1) ALL OMEA adjudicated events (including OMEA State Large Group) have been cancelled for the remainder of this school year. The HS Wind Ensemble and Symphonic Band will therefore not be performing at state this year.

2) The governor has requested schools close for a period of 3 weeks. The details of this situation are currently being worked out by the BCS administration, but it is EXTREMELY important that students make arrangements to get their instruments home ASAP (tomorrow!) in order to practice and complete playing assignments.

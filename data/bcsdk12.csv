On behalf of the Beekmantown Central School District we want to take a second to thank the community for your continued support over the last few months. Tomorrow we will begin counting our budget votes and the votes cast for school board members. This is a long process as votes cast for each item on the ballot will need careful and complete consideration. To ensure the process is valid, we have secured twenty (20) election inspectors to accurately and timely count each vote until all ballots are processed. Due to the large number of ballots received by mail and the inability to use the electronic voting machines we anticipate the counting process to take a few days. We will announce our outcomes as soon as possible with an estimated date of Tuesday, June 23, 2020.

We take pride in our district's efforts to reduce the spread of the COVID-19. As we enter Memorial Day weekend, take pride in knowing that there are actions that YOU can do to keep this virus at bay - the easiest way to show your Eagle Pride is by wearing a mask.

My mask protects YOU. Your mask protects Me.

Even if you don't have symptoms, wearing masks in public is important to reduce the possible spread of the COVID-19 virus.

WITHOUT A MASK:
• Your cough or sneeze travels a LOT farther.
• More germs are released into the air and onto surfaces.
• More people can get sick from your germs.

WITH A FABRIC MASK:
• Your cough or sneeze is more contained.
• Fewer germs are released.
• More people are protected from your germs.

When we had to cancel the North Country Honor Run, we asked our students how we could help the community. Among other things, they wanted to collect food for those in need, honor those who serve, and give out masks to as many people as possible. The North Country Honor Drive intends to do all three this Memorial Day Weekend.

The North Country Honor Drive is a partnership between the Beekmantown 7th grade, North Country Honor Flight, the United Way of the Adirondacks, and several local fire stations. Check out the Facebook for updates about drop off locations and times. Eagles Care

Today, I hosted a Google Meet that was STEM centered for any children in 5th grade down to PreK 3. It was amazing to see the students support each other with kind comments, respectful behavior of taking turns and microphone control, and be EXCITED! Watching them interact with each other really brought home the world we are teaching in currently...but their joy was the virtual hug my heart needed right now ❤️ Sharing photos from parents with their permission of our Google Meet today that went 70 minutes on one topic! ❤️🥰💡🏗📚 #BCSDEaglePride",0.0,"Another proud story to share...

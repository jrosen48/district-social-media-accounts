What started as a few kids and coaches at Fox Lane has quickly spread to rival districts (which sparked a new hashtag: #RivalsUnite4Heroes).

The initial $10,000 goal that was set five days ago has been increased to $15,000 as the challenge has already raised $8,492.

Thursday night we held our annual Seuss-A-Bration; an annual event that so many look forward to.Friday we started our day with the Bedford Hills Reading Train; all students, teachers and staff lined the halls and spent time reading independently. Our Seuss celebrations culminated with buddy reading and a school-wide assembly. The assembly included a performance of What Pet Should I Get? starring our fifth grade students!

We had fun, but now it‚Äôs done,
We can‚Äôt wait see, what next year will be!",2020-03-06 14:36:49,,

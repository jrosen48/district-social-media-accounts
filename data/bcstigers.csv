This is not a test. This is our future.

A kindergartener counted in the 2020 Census will be in high school when the next census comes around in 2030. That’s 10 years of community programs that benefit our state. Did you know that Alabama receives $13 billion a year to fund programs like nutrition, healthcare, transportation, roads, recreation centers, police, firefighters, and
more? This is your opportunity to help ensure our kids have a bright future.

Students are learning these key things about the 2020 Census and we want you to know them too:
*Everyone living in your home needs to be counted. That includes children, babies, grandparents, and even those staying with you temporarily. They all count.
*It’s easier than ever to respond to the Census. Complete it online at my2020census.gov or call 844-330-2020. It only takes about 6 minutes.
* Your responses are safe and secure. The law requires the U.S. Census Bureau to keep your information confidential.

You have the power to shape your future—and the future of Alabama’s children—by counting everyone in your home by September 30th.

Census Pledge:
I pledge to count my family.
I pledge to let my voice be heard.

We are super excited to welcome our students back SOON!

If you watched the live stream of the Board meeting last night, there was mention of a delayed student start date. Our revised calendar is scheduled for Board approval during the next board meeting. Based on the calendar, the student start date will be Thursday, September 3, 2020. Your Principal can answer any questions regarding the proposed calendar. A copy will be shared with you once it has been Board approved. Please read the attached newsletter for more information.

At the request of Board members, we have made the decision to start the first nine-week grading period online. The first nine weeks will be fully online for all students. We will continue to assess where we are as it relates to COVID at the midpoint. The plan has been revised to reflect the first nine-weeks as the remote learning model.

Bessemer — July 3, 2020 — It is with deep regret that we announce the tragic loss of Jonesboro Elementary School student, Royta Giles Jr. (pronounced Roy-TAY Jyles). The young child was killed during a shooting this afternoon at the Riverchase Galleria Mall in Hoover.

School administrators have been speaking with the child’s family members and offer support as they grieve the sudden and difficult loss. “Our hearts are simply broken at the tragic loss of Royta. We are here for the family in every way possible, and we ask that everyone lifts the mother, family, and our school community in your prayers. This is tough,” says Bessemer City Schools superintendent, Dr. Autumm Jeter.

Royta Giles was heading to the 3rd grade this fall. Principal, Dr. Anjell Edwards, and staff describe him as a smart child, who was a jewel, with big dreams of someday entering the music industry. “He was bright, articulate, and very convincing. We even tried to convince him to become a lawyer,” says former assistant principal Mr. Van James.

The school system will remain available and continue to support those within the Bessemer City Schools family by all means possible to help them through this time. Meanwhile, those without immediate relationship to the family are asked to be sensitive to this tragic situation.

All inquiries related to this press release should be directed to investigators. Thank you in advance for respecting this request, which allows the District’s attention to remain on serving the students and families of impacted by this shooting.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2650960815145213&id=1686521371589167,,0.0,"Bessemer City Schools family mourns the loss of student

I couldn’t be prouder of this year’s graduating high school seniors––as well as the teachers, coaches, and most of all, parents and family who’ve guided you along the way. Graduating is a big achievement under any circumstances––let alone during a pandemic. And some of you have had to overcome serious obstacles along the way to make it here. What remains true is that your graduation marks your passage into adulthood––the time when you begin to take charge of your own life.

So here’s my quick advice: Be fearless. Always do what you think is right. And work to build a community. No one does big things all by themselves. When you need help, Michelle and I have made it the mission of the Obama Foundation to give young people like you the skills and support you need to be leaders—and to connect you with other young people around the globe. But you don’t need us to tell you what to do, because in so many ways, you’ve already shown us how it’s done. Congratulations, Class of 2020––keep making us proud.",8.0,"President Obama’s address to the Class of 2020. Congratulations!

to the Bessemer City Class of 2020, congratulations 🎉! To myself, I am very proud of you ❤️. Though this journey wasnt easy.....With God’s help all things were conquered and made possible! Thank you to my family, closest friends, additional supporters & teachers for the prayers, discipline, heart to hearts, love and support through my entire academic journey❤️ nothing you guys have done for me will be taken for granted 💯. For the next four years I will be attending Paine College in Augusta, Georgia! Majoring in Clinical Psychology and Public Speaking. I plan to continue building my platform and helping teens & young adults not only within my new community but throughout the United States and around the world! I am very excited to attend #PC24! I am praying and hoping that I continue to be led by GOD, focus on my goals and over look my distractions ‼️👈🏽. I will continue Maturing, Mentoring, Learning and Investing in what GOD has led me to do while I am away to college making God, my parents, family and friends proud! To Bessemer City High School, thank you for having me as a student! I’ll always be a Purple Tiger At Heart💜🐯!

For the next four years I will be attending Paine College in Augusta, Georgia! Majoring in Clinical Psychology and Public Speaking. I plan to continue building my platform and helping teens & young adults not only within my new community but throughout the United States and around the world! I am very excited to attend #PC24! I am praying and hoping that I continue to be led by GOD, focus on my goals and over look my distractions ‼️👈🏽. I will continue Maturing, Mentoring, Learning and Investing in what GOD has led me to do while I am away to college making God, my parents, family and friends proud! To Bessemer City High School, thank you for having me as a student! I’ll always be a Purple Tiger At Heart💜🐯!

From day one , I knew exactly what I wanted & how I was going to get it ! Spent countless amount of hours staying up studying applying to colleges, seeing what I need to do to get accepted ! My daddy helped me worked towards goals .. I seen what I didn’t want to be like , and strive to be something better! I was determined to turn my dreams into reality. My senior year has been hard from office work , organizing things for my class , cheering , sga , beta club & Working a full time job.. all while maintaining nothing less than a 3.0 GPA. So here I am 8 months later ! +30 college acceptances letters , +100k in scholarships & now 17 years old with over 25 credits and a GRADUATE OF HIGHSCHOOL! I’m officially signing out!! ❤️💕I will continue my education at THEE ALABAMA STATE UNIVERSITY on a full scholarship! Bessemer City Schools

My name is Angela D. Bedgood and I am excited to be the Principal at Greenwood Elementary School! This is my 20th year in the field of education. I began my career with Bessemer City Schools as a Third Grade Teacher at Westhills Elementary. I have previously served as the Professional Development Supervisor and Parent & Community Engagement Coordinator for Bessemer City Schools. I have an open door policy to serve as a resource for the students, teachers, parents and community members of Greenwood Elementary. I will do everything possible for students to ensure that they receive the best education possible. I am looking forward to serving our scholars and staff and kicking off an awesome 2020-2021 school year.

I am the eighth child of the late Robert Lee Sr. and Louise Dawson. I'm a graduate of Wenonah High School, class of 1986. I received a Bachelors of Arts in Elementary Education, Miles College; Masters in Elementary Education, Alabama State University; Educational Administration AA Certification, Alabama State University and Educational Specialist, Samford University. I am married with two adult sons and the proud grandmother of Kennedi and Braylon.

Our extended break has come to a close and we officially begin eLearning with academic packets! We want you to know that you are not alone in this eight-week journey of learning while home. Your teachers, administrators, and others in the school system are dedicated to helping you and ensuring that you succeed. Our employees know that we are “out, not off,” so feel free to reach out if you need help. Teachers will be recording lessons, doing live lessons, emailing, calling, using interactive apps, Google Classroom and engaging in virtual meetings to teach sessions. Students and parents, YOU MUST DO YOUR PART and we know that you can do it!! We are on a positive path in Bessemer City Schools, but we need you to do what you can. Check on your friends, and ask them, “have you done your schoolwork.”

Very soon we will be posting our help desk phone number and email address. You can reach us that way anytime. Look for my video messages to you each week on Facebook, Twitter, the website and other BCS social media places.

In all things, we should give thanks, so take time to thank your teachers, Principals and others who have worked so hard to get ready for this new normal. This is NOT free time off, it’s simply virtual learning with academic packets. Your teachers are possibly balancing completing lessons with their own children while teaching you from afar, so be grateful, patient and be sure to complete your work!

Finally, I want to encourage all Bessemer families to read my FAVORITE children’s book (and watch the movie later), Wonder by R.J. Palacio. It would be so cool to see video clips of our families reading the book together!! Tag us on social media of you reading the book with your child or your children reading it to you!!!

Day 3 Wild About You Wednesday!

I decided to play this one because I am a product of Jess Lanier/ Bessemer City High School

So who was my favorite teacher?

I couldn’t pick just one because each of these ladies contributed something different to my years in high school!

Sonjanika Henderson-Green this lady is HILARIOUS. I understood virtually nothing about language when she taught it because it was not my favorite subject. But I went to her class just to get on her nerves and get cursed out 😂😂

Sabrina Mcneely-Jemison Ms. Jemison was a hidden Jem that not everyone got to experience. She was not to be played with but she loved you like her own. I gained my love of science in her class which is what made me major in Chemistry 🧪 in the first place.

My baby! Mrs. O’Neal!! 😢 even my mama knew this was my second mama. She was everything!! I could sit in her class all day long just to be around her. If I wasn’t in class my teachers knew to just call her because that’s where I was. I miss you! ❤️❤️

Day 3 Wild About You Wednesday!

I decided to play this one because I am a product of Jess Lanier/ Bessemer City High School

So who was my favorite teacher?

I couldn’t pick just one because each of these ladies contributed something different to my years in high school!

Parents, you’re invited to bring your son or daughter with you to find out more about Cub Scouting at our INFORMATIONAL MEETING ON TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 15 AT FOREST PRESERVE PARK.

A few of our favorite events are camping out in Memorial Stadium, the Pinewood Derby, the community food drive, and much more!

JUNIORS, TODAY AND TOMORROW ARE YOUR LAST CHANCE TO APPLY!!!!

Registration closes January 31st.

Here is why current student Hanna Munsterman Argenta-Oreana CUSD #1 High School thinks YOU SHOULD APPLY:

""CEO is awesome because you get to learn things that you wouldn't be able to in a classroom setting. You get to create your own business at the age of 17 or 18 and without this program, most of us wouldn't have that opportunity. You get to learn so much about yourself and others around you and what the true meaning of a team is. I will never get an opportunity like this again so I cherish every moment.""

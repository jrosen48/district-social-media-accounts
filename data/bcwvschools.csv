March 16 at 2:26 PM ·

The College Board is developing tools to mitigate the impact of school closures on students in the Advanced Placement Program. All AP students and teachers will be able to draw on the free online resources that were provided to every AP classroom this fall. Additional resources will be made easily accessible to AP students and teachers through mobile phones and other devices. These include free online AP lessons and review sessions from some of the top AP teachers in the country.

The AP program is finalizing streamlined AP exam options that would allow students to test at home, depending on the situation in May. We’re working to give every AP student the opportunity to claim the credit they’ve earned. The AP Program will communicate the details of these additional solutions to educators and students by March 20.

The College Board’s focus will remain on student safety and ensuring all students have the tools they need to work, and opportunities to receive the credit they have earned, during this challenging time.

We had seven students represent BHS at the West Virginia University Invitational Honor Band Festival this week. They had the opportunity to work with some nationally recognized conductors, as well as students from several of the surrounding states.

The honor bands gave some outstanding performances today! Congratulations to the following students:

Leah Baynham, flute
Jonah Eggert, percussion
Sidney FelouIs, percussion
Shaylee Groves, flute
Gage Keener, trombone
Riley McAllister, alto sax
Dalton Walnoha, tuba

Huge thank you to the band parents who helped out behind the scenes! You are sincerely appreciated!",2020-02-15 16:21:49,,

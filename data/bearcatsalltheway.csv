Please keep this chart in mind when deciding if your child is well enough to attend school for the day. We understand that it is allergy season and there are MANY reasons your child might have these symptoms, however we are not able to guess what the reasons behind the symptoms are. PLEASE do not give Tylenol or ibuprofen and send your child to school. These medications can cover up symptoms and we need to be very careful, in the school setting, not to do that. If your student feels bad enough to need the medicine, they would need to stay home from school. Remember, we now have the Bearcat Care Center in which students can be seen for their healthcare needs. Thank you for your help in making sure we keep our kids as healthy as we can!

This has been a great week of PD at Booneville School District. We want to thank Jam Mart, Community National Bank, and First Western for providing food. Our teachers have been working in different ways and taking on new obstacles in stride. We know everyone is anxious about starting school back, but our staff is ready. Thank you for your patience and grace as we work through the details. We live in the best community!

The Charleston School District is excited to be moving forward with team sports. Tomorrow night is Senior High (8/18) and Thursday night is Jr High (8/20). We are asking that only family members attend the football scrimmages this week. This will keep our crowd smaller, and allow us to see if additional safety protocols are necessary as we prepare for our first home games.

The Department of Health has required the following guidelines be met:
• Every other row of the bleachers must be unoccupied
• 6-feet distancing between spectators and family groups (even if standing along fence)
• Face coverings are required for all present over the age of 10, except when eating or drinking

We have made the decision to go ahead and move our senior nights up for football and volleyball.

Senior night for football will be August 28th vs Dardanelle. On that night we also recognize golf, tennis, cross country, band, and cheer.

Senior night for volleyball will be August 31st vs Paris.

Our hopes are that we can have full seasons. In the event that we cannot, we will have at least been able to get this important event in for our seniors.

We are preparing for the worst, but hoping for the best.

We were set to visit Booneville High School the week that Arkansas public schools were closed. Our visit was taking place to do a signing session for the entire school to witness our newest Mulerider accepting his band Scholarship.
Even though we didn’t get to make the trip, we want to introduce our newest Mulerider Band member. Help us welcome James, a trombonist from Booneville. James will be a music major joining us in the fall and we are so happy that he is coming home to SAU.

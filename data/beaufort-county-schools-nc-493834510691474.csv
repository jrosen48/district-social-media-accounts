She teaches 2nd grade at Bath Elementary School.

The one who nominated Mrs. Soistman had this to say: “She is a very interactive teacher always going the extra mile to grab the attention of students. She uses many different ways of doing so--whether it be for ELA and dressing up as the characters in the book they are reading (three little pigs), transforming her room into a thunderstorm and dressing the part to greet her friends as they arrive (science), to transforming her room to the American West and dressing the part (Social Studies). She makes learning FUN, and it’s contagious!”

We are honored and pleased to have Mrs. Soistman teaching in Beaufort County Schools.

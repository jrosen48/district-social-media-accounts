Good morning Beaverton community,

This is Superintendent Passalacqua.

We are hoping that this message finds everyone safe.

Due to the current situations, we have made some adjustments to our scheduled events.

All online classes will be cancelled for the remainder of the week. Also, staff meetings scheduled for today have been cancelled as well.

School will only be open tomorrow for food distribution from 11am to 2pm. We will have food available at Billings Township hall from 11am to 2pm as well. However, we will not be delivering meals and/or packets to the homes tomorrow.

There is no food distribution on Monday, May 25th due to Memorial Holiday.

We will resume meal & packet pickups next Tuesday.

Packet pickup/student belongings pickup for tomorrow is cancelled, but rescheduled for Tuesday, May 26th, 2020 from 4 to 6pm.

Good morning Beaverton community,

This is Superintendent Passalacqua.

We are hoping that this message finds everyone safe.

Due to the current situations, we have made some adjustments to our scheduled events.

All online classes will be cancelled for the remainder of the week. Also, staff meetings scheduled for today have been cancelled as well.

School will only be open tomorrow for food distribution from 11am to 2pm. We will have food available at Billings Township hall from 11am to 2pm as well. However, we will not be delivering meals and/or packets to the homes tomorrow.

There is no food distribution on Monday, May 25th due to Memorial Holiday.

We will resume meal & packet pickups next Tuesday.

Packet pickup/student belongings pickup for tomorrow is cancelled, but rescheduled for Tuesday, May 26th, 2020 from 4 to 6pm.

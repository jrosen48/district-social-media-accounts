As many of you know, seating capacity has long been an issue at the Junior High gym. Not quite as well known is that the gym floor was settling and cracking. Both issues have now been resolved.

The seating capacity has been increased from 126 to 376, and a new wooden floor has been laid over the old floor.

It is my hope that this better-functioning facility will be a source of Beecher pride for decades to come!

Lunch counts will be taken in the morning. If your child wants a school lunch, they should let their teacher know at that time. The lunches will then be distributed just before school lets out…remember, no eating on the bus! Lunches will be prepared and packaged so they are ready to eat when they get home.

Normal lunch rates apply: $2.90 per meal for Elementary School, all others $3.

If you have not filled out your paperwork for free/reduced lunches, please do so.

For students with free/reduced lunches who are Remote Learners, grab and go lunches will be provided in the Junior High’s front drive from noon to 12:30 each day that school is in session.

After releasing our back-to-school plan, there are bound to be outstanding questions prior to the first day of student attendance on August 28th. This is especially true as the District is asking you to let us know if your children will be learning in person or remote.

I will be hosting a Zoom webinar on Thursday night (the 13th) at 7p. If you would like to submit a question ahead of time to bcox@beecher200u.org, I will answer it for everyone. Since it is a Zoom meeting, you can also log in to “raise your hand” (also *9 on the call-in) and get your clarification in that manner.

I appreciate everyone’s patience as we move towards the opening of school in three weeks. I have provided the current Re-Opening Plan, as of today.

In summary, the major mechanisms have not changed: families have a choice on in-person or remote learning from 8-11:30a daily with 90 minutes of student-driven work in the afternoon. Students who come onto a bus or building must be wearing a mask at all times.

I really appreciate the dozens of staff and community members who donated their time to work on this plan, and in particular, our school nurses, Angie Cadwallader and Mary Kay Pittman.

Be safe. Be well.

As Illinois begins to re-open, the school will continue to serve free lunches to all students for the entire summer. These Grab-n-Go lunches will continue to be offered at the Junior High from 11 am – noon daily. I encourage you and your family to take advantage of this program, as we continue to move through this difficult time.

With Illinois set to move into Phase 3, all Beecher 200U building offices will re-open on Monday, June 1st.

As we begin to look towards our next school year, online student registration is slated to open June 10th. This is significantly earlier than usual to allow everyone the opportunity to be ready for the 2020-2021 school year.

With Illinois being sheltered in place, the Beecher 200U District Office will be the only office open on campus moving forward. If you have questions about anything, call 708-946-2266, and we will get you connected.

Speaking of connected, if you or someone that you know is having trouble with their internet or accessing online materials, give us a call.

Today is the beginning of the 4th quarter, so your kids should begin having new grades in the gradebook, if they haven’t already. Please go online, as your child’s third quarter grades should be posted.

Since the Governor put us out (at least) another week, you should expect new material being dropped on your doorstep soon, especially if you have younger kids.

I know that all of this is new and unusual, but we are doing great! Our kids are staying on track!

We wanted to clarify our Live Stream Remote class option. This option would be offered for those students who would like to stay at home during the pandemic phases rather than attend face to face. The classes would be live stream, or live classes that are offered at the same time as the face to face classes. There would be an opportunity for interaction with the teacher, asking questions and participating during the face to face time but your student would be attending from home. If this option sounds like something you would like to participate in please contact Mr.Kablan so that he may schedule your student for a full remote class option.

Students are not supposed to enter buildings or classrooms before 8:05 AM except Building A since we have supervision that covers that building and outside it. If your student is in C building before the bell it is likely they are not supervised and we do not want that for safety reasons obviously.
If your student is tardy or absent you MUST sign them in at the office. This is a state requirement and we need to know your student is at school and that they are safely in their correct class.
We know everyone is busy and always rushing but we truly need these few issues to be followed to ensure safety. Please support our efforts so students will be safe!

We still have room in 6th, 7th, 9th, and 12th. We have a wait list for 8th, 10th, 11th. Even if their student is interested in a class that is full, we will put them on a wait list and will let them know when a position becomes available.

We find that having an interested student ""shadow"" another student for the day is helpful when decided if they'd like to attend Beehive Academy. Contact Lisa to set up a time or ask questions: lisa.stearns@beehiveacademy.org or call 801-576-0070.",2019-03-18 16:24:17,,

Every year Beehive Academy families are given the great opportunity to host students from other countries. This is an excellent way to get to know other cultures and to add a wonderful new person into your life! These students are friendly, well behaved, and eager to learn. Each student comes with a local coordinator for their - and YOUR - support. All arrive with their own spending money and insurance. The responsibilities of host families are to provide a bed, meals, and transportation to and from school. Remember that you do not need to change your lifestyle in order to host an exchange student--far from it! The point of this program is to include this new person into your existing lifestyle.

Please support our award winning FTC robotics club which has done a fantastic job representing our school in the World competition the last 3 years! It takes money to compete and parents/students of FTC are the ones paying for most all of it. We'd like to help them by supporting their fundraising efforts.

Cards are at Lisa's desk in the office. You can pay with cash, check (made out to BSTA) or even credit card. Just use the card when purchasing a Jamba Juice smoothie and get a free one! Cards can be used at most any Jamba Juice store all over the nation up to 6 times. Great for friends or date night or family night out.

Thanks for your support!",2018-08-20 15:27:52,,

If you'd like to donate to the Utah food bank no need to wrap, just bring food items and place in the box under the tree. You probably have food items your family will not eat but someone else will love it! Give it a good home.

All items for the food bank or Angel Tree are due to Beehive Academy by Dec. 13. NHS members will then deliver them in hopes of helping others have a wonderful holiday.

This season help someone by taking a card off the Angel Tree in Beehive Academy's lobby and purchasing items for those in need!

The National Honor Society (NHS) Angel Tree Drive is going on now until Dec. 13 (the last day before Winter Break).

Each card on the Angel Tree is an item needed by someone. Blue cards have less expensive gifts from $1-15 and pink cards are more expensive from $15-30. Nothing on the tree should cost more than $30. Different items include food, toys, and other necessities so there are many choices! These gifts will be donated to The Christmas Box House, Big Brothers and Big Sisters, the Utah Food Bank, and the Road Home. If you'd simply like to donate food without taking a card, we'll have a box set up just for food.

If you choose to take a card, please wrap your item or put it in a bag with the card visible so NHS knows what has been donated. Simply return your gifts by placing them under the tree. Let's put lots of gifts under the tree!

Your household may be eligible to receive Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer (P-EBT) benefits to buy food.
P-EBT is for children 5-18 years old who received SNAP food benefits for the month of March 2020 and children up to 21 years old who are certified for free or reduced-price meals at school in Texas during the 2019-20 school year. Children that attend a school that offers free meals to all students (Community Eligibility Provision or Provision 2) are also eligible.
The online application for P-EBT is now open. Please review the criteria to see if you need to apply to receive these benefits. You will need your child's ID# but if you do not know it check their report card for the # or login into the parent portal for the ID# or ask your student.

APRIL BRUENE! 2019-2020 MORENO JR. HIGH CAMPUS TEACHER OF THE YEAR!
A theme that defines me as a teacher is teaching for meaning which fosters personal engagement with academic content. While studying the American Revolution, I have each student assume an identity of an historical figure. This identity is used to speed date, reenact events, and product a project such as a tombstone. Student comments such as “Hey King George, what were you thinking when you closed our harbor? Did you think we were just going to lay down and take that?” tend to be bantered around my room throughout the unit. In anticipation of the upcoming interactive lesson, students frequently ask if s/he can participate since their character is already dead. My response is always “Yes, I believe in reincarnation! You are going to return as a brave minuteman of Lexington.” Besides being fun, these types of spontaneous interactions demonstrate student engagement in what could be perceived as boring content.

“Some advice and reminders I would give to teachers are to make time and be present, sign-up to volunteer and help out other teachers and staff members. You need to build a rapport with each student, don’t just know their name, anybody can memorize names. Don’t give up on yourself and most importantly don’t give up on your students. You have to be the driving force behind them for success inside and outside your classroom walls. You matter; so take care of yourself! Know your limits, know when to push yourself, and know when to take a break. Communication is key: if you need something speak up, be an advocate for your school and for your children.

ATTENTION TROJAN FANS!

Here is some important information regarding parking at Friday's game against El Campo.

Sandcrab Stadium is located next to Travis Middle School (see map). You may exit I35 onto Virginia Street, then take a right on Sam Faubion Drive and head towards the stadium where you will be greeted by a parking attendant. Once the lot at Travis Middle School is full, you will have to park at the Calhoun High School parking lot which is located across I35. There will be two shuttle buses available from the CHS parking lot to the front gate.

We are the HOME team so BISD rules and policies will apply.

Posters, banners are allowed and must be removed immediately after the game ends. Powder, confetti, glitter, silly string, streamers, etc…are prohibited.

Noisemakers
Artificial noisemakers such as air horns or whistles are prohibited.

Man-made noisemakers (jugs with beads, inflatable boom sticks, clackers, cowbells) are allowed.

Gates open at 6:00 PM. Let's fill the stands!!",3.0,"AC Jones High School

As parents and citizens, we will talk to our children and the children in our lives about the dangers of drug abuse.
*We will set clear rules for our children about not using drugs.
*We will set a good example for our children by not using illegal drugs or medicine without a prescription.
*We will monitor our children’s behavior and enforce appropriate consequences, so that our rules are respected.
*We will encourage family and friends to follow the same guidelines to keep children safe from substance abuse.

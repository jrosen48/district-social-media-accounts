Unfortunately, according to our survey there was not enough interest in having a prom this summer. We will be working on the paperwork process of getting refunds to everyone who had already purchased a ticket.

Any time money is sent from the school to another person/place, the school board needs to approve payments, and this includes refunds. Please look for the refunds to be ready for pick up around July 14, but I will get a ""for sure"" date to you as soon as possible.

One amazing thing about being in a small town is that when anything happens, good or bad, we are able to lean and depend on each other. Even though school ended suddenly the amazing teachers and administrators have made sure our babies have felt loved and remembered no matter what.

A week ago, I saw a news story where another town’s teachers made a video for their students. Since our teachers have already done so much I thought we could do something similar for them. I made a group and posted an invitation, and obviously the response was overwhelming.

I hope this shows some truly amazing people that what they do does not go unnoticed. School or no school we will get through this together, because #wearebeggs

As many of you know the Oklahoma State Board of Education held an emergency meeting yesterday resulting in a mandate that all schools in Oklahoma close from March 17-April 6. This includes all extracurricular activities.

Members of the Beggs School administration are meeting today to develop our plan for continuing to serve our students during this time. We will share information as soon as possible on meal service through our child nutrition program.

The Beggs School leadership team is working diligently with the leaders of our state to stay abreast of the most recent developments.

Miss Myranda is here with this week's kid friendly activity!

All you will need for this outdoor physical activity game of memory are paper plates!
You will need to draw on all of the paper plates (you can have as few or as many as you want) but make sure that 2 plates have the same drawing or pattern so that you can match them!
This is also a good craft project since you can draw whatever you want on the plates!
Ones the plates are designed you are going to mix them up or spread them out, if it is nice out this game is a great one for outdoors
Then you just have to find the matches and be creative!
- Crab walk until you find a match
- Skip until you find a match
- Bear walk until you find a match
- Gallop until you find a match
- Run until you find a match
You can also add exercises into this as well, for example “if you do not find a match in 5 tries you have to do 10 jumping jacks!”",0.0,"Maple City Physical Therapy

The last day of school is officially June 18th at Belfast Central. Students are expected to be working through the end of the school year. We are working on a system to collect materials from students, but the dates will be June 17 and 18. As of now our list of items to return includes:

• IPads, keyboards, and stylus
• School Calculators
• Library books
• Instruments (please keep the name tags on your instruments)
• Textbooks
• Math tools (i.e. rulers, protractors)

Meals will continue to be delivered until June 26. BCS will also have the summer meal program again this year, which is free for all children ages 18 and under. More information on how the summer food program will function will be sent out to families in the near future.

I know that remote learning is challenging for students and families. Please stay in close contact with teachers and administrators and let us know how we can help.

Our custodial staff found several items of gym clothes and shoes that were not in assigned lockers last week when lockers were cleaned out. Our staff was able to bag items that were in the same locker. Unfortunately, we have no way to know what items belong to which students without having students look through the bags of clothes. Only students in grades 4-12 should have items in the locker rooms.

Tomorrow (May 13), BCS staff will be sitting with the unknown items from 9:00-5:00 in the parking lot by the playground for students and families to identify and pick up their gym items.

Miss Myranda is back with this week's pediatric PT activity to keep those kiddos moving!

This weeks PT game is called Walk the Line! It works on balance, proprioception, as well as strength!
All you will need for this game is tape, if you have it you can do different colors and if it is nice outside you can use sidewalk chalk!
You are going to draw lines of different designs such as the ones above! Pick a line and have the child walk on it, I would make it like the game “the floor is lava!” if they step off the line they must start over! Making the lines different designs works on balance in different ways!
You can have them do:
- Heel to toe walking
- Side stepping
- Backwards walking
- Walking on your heels, walking on your toes
- Walking lunges
- Jumping/hopping
You can also incorporate this into a scavenger hunt or having children pick up their toys! You can place toys on the sides of the lines and have them pick them up while keeping their balance!",0.0,"Here is Miss Myranda’s PT game for the week!

Miss Myranda Here!
This week’s weekly PT game is Balloon Volley Ball!
All you will need for this game is an open space and a balloon (if you do not have a balloon you can substitute a ball or even a small pillow)
You can make a volleyball net just by using tape! You can place it on the ground or tape between 2 chairs to make the net higher and more difficult!
You hit the balloon back and forth until the balloon touches the ground and the other team then gets a point!
You can add some balancing/strengthening tasks to make it harder
- You can only hit the balloon over the net if you are standing on one leg
- You can only hit the balloon over the net if you jump up before you hit it
- You must hit the balloon over the net from a crab walk position
You can add an exercise to it
- If the other player scores you must do 5 sit ups
- If the other player scores you must do 5 jumping jacks

You can make a volleyball net just by using tape! You can place it on the ground or tape between 2 chairs to make the net higher and more difficult!
You hit the balloon back and forth until the balloon touches the ground and the other team then gets a point!
You can add some balancing/strengthening tasks to make it harder
- You can only hit the balloon over the net if you are standing on one leg
- You can only hit the balloon over the net if you jump up before you hit it
- You must hit the balloon over the net from a crab walk position
You can add an exercise to it
- If the other player scores you must do 5 sit ups
- If the other player scores you must do 5 jumping jacks
More balloon games to come!",2020-04-20 11:25:36,,

With the weather this week being a little rainier I decided to choose a game that can be played inside but still involve physical activity!

Playing Card Fitness with GO FISH!
For this activity all you will need is a deck of playing cards!
You will deal out the cards just like you are playing GO FISH, each player gets 7 cards
You pair up your matches and then begin the game! If a player must “go fish” since the other player did not have the card they ask for, they choose a card out of the pile. Depending on the card they draw they must complete that exercise that matches that specific number!

Example: If I must go fish and I draw a 3 I must do mountain climbers.
If they player draws the card that they ask for then the other player must do the exercise
Example: If I ask for a K but must go fish and I draw a king from the pile the other player must complete 4 burpees!

Have fun, stay active, and stay home!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=765336770664773&id=194920121039777,,0.0,"Here is our weekly physical therapy game from our physical therapist, Miss Myranda:

With these changes, BCS will review our instructional plans through the extended closure. Students and families should continue to work with teachers and administrators on what needs to happen to continue student learning.

You use tape to make different shapes on the floor, you can also use numbers or letters (or math facts for older kids) so this can double as a learning activity!

Have the child start on their favorite number, letter, or shape Then give them directions to make it from one letter/shape/number to another. An example would be “crab walk to the circle” or “frog jump to the letter A.”
Other ideas:
-bunny hop
-bear crawl
-gallop
-skip
-army crawl

This game can also be made harder by having them hold a sustained posture or do an exercise when they get to the intended shape/letter/number. For example “skip to the number 2 and then stand on 1 leg until I say stop!”

This can also be combined with other games like musical chairs, twister or simon says if there is more than 1 child playing!

For this activity all you need is string or yarn. You take the string and tie it to different objects around your house, make sure you are doing different heights! The child then is on the hunt for some sort of object (this is where you can get creative) some ideas would be objects of a certain color, a certain texture, or a specific object in general. The child then has to climb over or crawl under the string and find the objects.

This works on balance, body coordination, and overall gross motor movements. You can increase the difficulty by making the child jump over the string or crab walk under the string to further engage leg and core muscles!

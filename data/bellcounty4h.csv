Due to unforeseen circumstances, we will not host the 2020 District 8 4-H Horse Show. This decision was not made lightly, as we are trying to make sure that all of our students, agents, and their families are as safe as possible.

Please keep in mind, that the State Horse Show will not be a qualifying event this year. We highly encourage you to attend that and represent District 8 4-H well! Entries are due for that by June 30th on 4-H Connect.

Balance is an essential characteristic when evaluating livestock at a judging contest. A balanced sheep will have plenty of muscle while maintaining the appropriate degree of finish. The lamb should be long and clean about his neck which should connect smoothly to the top of the shoulder. A smooth level top line and hip design will add to the balance of a wether as well. #texas4h #youthlivestockmatters #livestockjudging #livestockjudging #tipthursday",0.0,"Texas Youth Livestock and Agriculture

This does not have to be anything that anyone has heard of. We want to see your creativity come out! Create your recipe, make your dish, taste it, and share that recipe with us!

To help with this, each day of this break, we will be posting a new activity to try! We are also looking into a virtual ""Meet Up/Walk in the Park"" for later this week. In the meantime, let's start out with a super fun science experiment!

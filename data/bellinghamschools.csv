Thanks to the wonderful people from King Arthur Flour's ""Bake for Good: Kids"" for treating Parkview Elementary School 4th & 5th graders to a great baking lesson on Wednesday! And the excitement and learning can continue at home as each student was given a baking kit with everything needed to make bread with their families. Bake for Good's ""learn, bake, share"" approach encourages students to bring some of what they bake back to school to be donated to a meal program for people who are dealing with food insecurity.

The King Arthur Flour team will be teaching students at Concrete Elementary School on Thursday 11/14, and on Friday 11/15 the students at Sumas Elementary will get the Bake for Good program. What a gift this program is!

As a reminder, we will continue our traditional, albeit socially distanced, Senior Parade this Friday, May 15, 2020 starting at 6 pm. Seniors are invited to decorate their vehicles and arrive at the high school at 5:45. The parade map is below. We invite all faculty, staff and community members to support and honor our seniors by making banners and cheering on these wonderful students as they pass by.

PLEASE REMEMBER: we cannot congregate. Please cheer on our graduates from the safety of your vehicle or from your front yard. We are grateful to the Belpre Police Department and Public Health Department for working with us to approve this event but it can only be held if we all follow the protocols and stay socially distant and safe. We thank you in advance for adhering to these guidelines and for all that our community is and has done to help our graduates celebrate this momentous occasion.",2020-05-12 18:55:57,,

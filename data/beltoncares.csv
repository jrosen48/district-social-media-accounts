How do I Prevent Skin Cancer?

Exposure to UV light is the most preventable risk factor for all skin cancers. The easiest, yet most significant way to reduce your skin cancer risk is to protect yourself from the sun. Some of the ways to protect your skin from harmful UVA/UVB rays include:

Wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 every day (even when it‚Äôs cold or cloudy outside)
Stay out of the sun during peak hours (10 am to 4 pm)
Reapply sunscreen at least every two hours when you‚Äôre out in the sun
Avoid tanning booths
Take breaks from the sun when outdoors for long periods of time
Wear hats to protect your scalp and face from direct sun exposure
Consider wearing long sleeves and/or pants to protect your skin from sun exposure

Congratulations to the Service Leadership Class at Belton School District #124 on being awarded TRACTION Team of the Year.
This class initiative was to pass a law to help save drivers lives by wearing seat belts. They took the project from start to finish and City Council approved a new law by which drivers can be pulled over for not wearing a seat belt. It is great to see the youth in our community making a difference.
Members of the Board of Education and Administrators of BSD 124 were in attendance at the City Council meeting last night to help Justice Howard, Emeline Bender and Caden Hand celebrate their accomplishment.
TRACTION (formerly Team Spirit) is a youth traffic safety leadership training program designed to empower youth to take an active role in promoting safe driving habits.

The frontal cortex, the part of the brain that's responsible for decision making and impulse control, is not fully formed during adolescence, making youth more likely to take unnecessary risks with their health and safety.

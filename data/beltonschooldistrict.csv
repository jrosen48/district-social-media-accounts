We're ready to celebrate our 2020 Seniors --

We'll be sharing photo collages throughout the first week of May commemorating these Pirates and sharing their post-high school plans. If you don't see a Pirate you know, stay tuned in because there are over 325 in the Class of 2020!

The students gave information about their intentions to the BHS counseling office before the closure -- so you'll see Pirates who have made military enlistments, college selections, work force plans, and trade school commitments. Others are still undecided at the time, considering furthering their education, and more. If their plans have changed, please know while we can't change the graphics, we sincerely wish them all well.

Lessons will be tied to the curriculum standards, and many will also blend in some social-emotional learning activities; we realize this time can be confusing, frightening, stressful, and challenging for everyone.

So, we are using the phrase Just Press Pause, Pirates -- join us and use the two days to find a balance, prepare mentally and emotionally, and stay connected with each other.

In an effort to make college or vocational education available to every Missouri high school graduate, the Missouri General Assembly established the A+ Schools Program as part of the Outstanding Schools Act of 1993.

Graduates of designated A+ schools who successfully complete the requirements of the A+ Program may be eligible to receive reimbursement for the cost of tuition and general fees while attending a Missouri public community college or vocational/technical school.

Pretty amazing!

“My mission as a speaker is to help people believe in themselves and their self-worth, to believe in their passions and their goals, and to believe in their capabilities of reaching many great achievements in their lifetime,” Bulinski commented.

Bulinski’s message “Perseverance with Grit” is delivered as much of a performance as an educational opportunity. Her programs are designed to help audiences realize their potential and then turn that potential into a reality. Bulinski challenges audiences to think… to really think, and to think big. “Another important part of what I do: help audiences understand failure is part of success.

We kept our maintenance and custodial crews busy this summer with all of the staff moves across the district!

Making the move to Hillcrest from Scott are Mr. Jay (counselor), Mrs. Jergensen (art teacher), and Ms. Baxter (1st grade).
**OOPS -- we forgot Mr. Villigram coming from BHS to teach physical education!

So, we pulled what we felt were the three strongest words from it to form our vision. Our vision is not only a call to action for our staff, but for our students, their families, and the Belton community as well.

Our mission statement: Each time we go through a complete strategic planning process with staff, community members, and students (which is about every 5 years), the team revisits, reviews, revises, and revamps our mission.
It identifies what we aim to be and what we value.

It can be found on our website and framed on the walls in each building...and each school also has its own tailored mission statement!

While their lists will never be as awesome as our memories think ours were, haha -- the PreK-8 school supply lists for the 2019-20 school year are ready!

We'd love to hear your memories of your favorite school supplies...Star Wars lunchbox? Gel pens? Smurf pencils? Full House notebooks? Garbage Pail Kids art box?

The students made the trip to the BMS Forum Theatre where a small group of Noble's band students performed a short clip of each instrument on stage, while also demonstrating other musical concepts like solos, duets, trios, and quartets. Then the entire jazz band played a few songs for them.

After all the performances were complete, each of the BOSCO students got to try out playing the tuba for fun! It was an amazing experience for students from both schools -- they were all able to learn, share, demonstrate, understand, and teach.

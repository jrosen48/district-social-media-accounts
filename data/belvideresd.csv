This is Mr. Carrubba of the Belvidere School District. I wanted to take a moment to give everyone a quick schedule update. On Monday March 16th the Belvidere School District will operate on an early dismissal schedule for students only. We will be using the time in the afternoon for staff planning. While we feel that it is highly unlikely that we would have to shut the district down in case of an outbreak of CoronaVirus, we feel that it is important to have a plan in place in case of the unlikely scenario.

We will be providing aftercare at Belvidere Elementary from 12:20-2:25 for parents who will be unable to make arrangements for their children. We do ask that you please update the Parent Portal if you do need to take advantage of the aftercare for Monday or contact the main office of your school.

As students gather school supplies, teachers across the district are preparing classrooms and learning spaces for remote teaching and learning.

Because she will be teaching from her fourth grade classroom, Evergreen Elementary’s Kimpha Keoborakot wants students to see positive and welcoming messages as they connect remotely for lessons. Love that shiplap paper border, Mrs Keoborakot!

She also got creative in her attempt to find the best way to set up her station for remote classroom learning.

The fourth grade teacher used two crates and a shelf to place her docking station for a laptop.

“This way, I can angle my camera down,” she explains. “I have connected a keyboard and mouse by USB. I also placed my document camera on the shelf for when I'm modeling work.

This video features many of the students (but not all) involved in Beauty and the Beast this year. Most pictures and video were taken during rehearsal, some during quarantine….all with the intent to say THANK YOU donors for the generous “Help Us Put The A in STEAM” Go Fund Me Band & Theatre Arts campaign.

After one and a half years of fundraising, we are ending this very successful campaign. With your generosity, you have helped raise over $4,000 and have elevated both programs. The Band program was able to purchase much needed equipment and the Theatre program purchased the professional accompaniments for two musicals.

If you would like to make a tax deductible donation before its end, the GoFundMe donation link will be available until May 31 at https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-us-put-the-a-in-steam

Teachers play a very important role in shaping the future leaders of our country, aka our children. They educate them, they support them, they listen to them, they guide them, they spend countless hours with them, they mentor them, they do a LOT! Today their job is even harder since they are doing all of this via remote learning tools.

So today, National Teacher Appreciation Day, send your teacher (past or present) a quick message to let them know you care, tell them what a great job they are doing and how much you appreciate all that they have done/are doing for you.

To all of the teachers throughout West Chicago, we say thank you for your continued dedication to all of your students.

Dear Parents and Guardians,

Out of an abundance of caution and in response to the rapidly evolving Coronavirus (COVID-19) situation, Benjamin SD 25 will be closing schools and canceling all sports/activities for students beginning tomorrow, March 14, 2020, through spring break with a tentative plan of returning on April, 6, 2020. This includes PALS Daycare. We will utilize our e-learning platform for the next 10 school days beginning on Monday, March 16, 2020 through March 27, 2020.

While we realize e-learning is not a substitute for classroom instruction, we are endeavoring to make it as viable as possible over the next 10 school days. Our hope is to reconvene classes as usual on Monday, April 6 at the conclusion of our regularly scheduled Spring Break. As events develop we will continue to communicate to you any changes and updates. This is a unified DuPage County decision and we are acting on the guidance from our governing agencies in the best interests of keeping our communities safe.

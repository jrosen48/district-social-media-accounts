ALL USD 240 Students - Food Service Announcement

The USDA made an announcement this week stating schools could provide a free breakfast and lunch to ALL students regardless of their status from now until December 31, or when the state/federal funding runs out. We have applied for the waiver and have been approved to begin providing this service to all students starting September 4. No lunch accounts will be charged until this funding source is no longer available.

We will not reimburse lunch account funds at this time as those dollars will be used once this program is over.

Because of other funding programs, we still request you complete the free/reduced application form and submit to your school as soon as possible. These reports assist in funding Title and At-Risk services and add additional dollars to our schools. Application Link: https://www.usd240.org/vimages/shared/vnews/stories/594930b04f342/20-21%20HouseholdApplication.pdf

USD 240 has the option to order additional masks for students, however we don't want to submit this order if everyone already has enough masks. These masks would be in addition to the school specific masks we have coming for each school, and will be a generic color not specific to a school.

Please add a comment if you are interested. If there is enough interest, we will submit an order. We will have the disposable masks available until our orders arrive.

UPDATE: Our intentions are to order these masks if there are enough students that still need a mask or two. We are using covid funds to make the purchase so we will not be allowed to sell them. They will be available for those that need them.

Good Evening Twin Valley Family!

I am excited to be here and working with all of you to serve the students and families that are part of USD 240.

I can honestly say that I never thought I would become a Superintendent during a pandemic, but here we are :-)!

I am planning to have a virtual parent meeting on Wednesday, July 8th at 6:30 pm. I'll post on Monday or Tuesday what format the meeting will be, either Zoom or Facebook Live. I'm still trying to figure out what we have and what's best to use to coordinate our communication.

We certainly don't have all of the answers, but we would like to share where we are with our planning process for reopening schools and our work to keep both staff and students safe. We will also discuss the timeline for when we will receive the KSDE guidance, as well as when we are hopeful to have a fairly vetted plan for the opening of the 20-21 school year.

I hope you can join us for the discussion!

Happy 4th of July!

Stay safe and have a great weekend!

Attention Twin Valley patrons. We have a company coming into the district to resurface the tracks in Bennington and Tescott during the months of May and early June. They will be starting in Bennington as early as Monday, May 4. After they are done there, they will proceed to Tescott and address that track. It will take approximately 3 weeks per location.

During the time the renovation, those areas will be off limits. We will announce when the public is allowed to begin using the tracks after the work is complete.

Contact Mr. Van Ranken if you have any questions or concerns. We are very excited to get these completed for Twin Valley kids next year!",0.0,"Twin Valley Usd 240

From the Cochise County Library District:

Hello Cochise County! We wanted to send a quick note to highlight a couple of improvements in the Library District‚Äôs digital collections, which seem like they will be of special interest to schools and families during the public health crisis.

The Library District has offered ebooks and digital audiobooks for years, but in the last week, with help from OverDrive (our ebook vendor) and Sierra Vista Public Library, we have added more than 4,000 new and classic titles for all ages.

The other big improvement is that we have added Instant Digital Card, which allows people who do not have a library card to access the collections using their mobile phone number.

These collections are available for residents countywide, at no charge, and they are a great way for families to keep reading while libraries and schools are closed.",4.0,"Thank you Cochise County Library District! ü§ìüìòüêæ

The last senior of the 2020 Benson Softball Team. Lauren Wrobleski- Lauren is an extremely passionate person about softball. Every team needs a personality and character like Lauren. Besides the passion she brings the fun, the entertainment and desire to win. She is a true team player willing to help in any facet of the game. As a student of the game, she has done an nice job behind the plate as a catcher. She has earned my respect from the hours she has put in catching for multiple pitchers in the gym and cage. Lauren will play anywhere. She loves to hit and run the bases and simply brings energy every time she performs. Best of luck in the future Lauren!",0.0,"Benson Softball Association

Let’s celebrate Senior, Mariah Rodahl- Talk about versatility! As a junior Mariah was a utility infielder. Most of her action was at second and first base in 2019. She played nine games with 18 at bats her junior year. She has a good sense and ability running the base paths. Her flexibility as a player and desire proves to be her strongest assets both offensively and defensively. I have seen her leadership shine, helping out the younger girls in early season practices. Mariah has a lot going for herself on and off the field. We wish her the best of luck beyond Benson High!",0.0,"Benson Softball Association

This week we continue with our Benson High School Softball Senior Tribute. Cally Miller- Cally pitched on varsity in 2019 for around 35 innings. She succumbed to a hip injury during the first game which sent us into a tailspin for a while. However, we saw her grit and desire to make a comeback at the end of the season working through some pain and giving us her best effort. Cally brings a calmness, has an easy demeanor and is steady on the mound when healthy. It would have been awesome to see what she could have done in 2020 on the mound with a healthy start.

Let’s celebrate Senior, Hannah Andrews- Going through the softball ranks Hannah was unsure of her ability until she hit stride and started to gel in her skills at the end of her sophomore year. It has been fun to watch her grow and develop confidence over the years. She finished the 2019 season with a consistent second highest team batting average of .340. She was a strong, left handed, top of the order, lead off hitter that could hit to the opposite field for a base hit or put down the bunt. She led the team in walks (13) and runs scored (17) in 2019. Her consistency helped her gain All Conference honors and she would have been pushing for more of the same in 2020. Hannah made the All Academic Team this year and helped the team earned All Academic Team Gold honors. She also represented our school in the Breakdown Sports USA magazine sponsored by the MSHSL. Congrats Hannah. You have an awesome future and we wish you the best!",0.0,"Benson Softball Association

Re: Summer Marching Band Canceled
_________________________________________________

Given the current Covid-19 pandemic and the health risks to Benson School students and staff, the decision has been made to cancel the 2020 Benson School’s Summer Marching Band season. Along with the Pioneer Band Parade and Memorial Day Parade, all other parades on the Benson Marching band schedule have been canceled. The Marching Band trip scheduled for Colorado this summer is also canceled.
Benson School’s Summer Marching Band has a long tradition of excellence and is a wonderful opportunity to showcase Benson Schools, our talented musicians, and our state leading music program. At the same time, marching band is a terrific time to for students to continue to build musical skills and have quality social time with classmates. This is a difficult decision as it is another opportunity that this virus has taken from students. We look forward to another exciting and successful Summer Marching Band season in 2021.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1573927972763447&id=196534587169466,,0.0,"Media Release

At the meeting, Superintendent Laumeyer unveiled the design plans for the facility, discussed the need for a safer, more effective and larger activity space for the gymnastics program and other school activities, and shared the financial details and tax impact for our residents.

Next week a fact sheet and additional information will be available on the Benson Public Schools website! Watch for more details soon!

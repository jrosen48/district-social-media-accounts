“Kindra Neis, a Benton Community Junior, worked diligently on creating a Computer Aided Drafting (CAD) file of a USA flag. She researched the standard dimensions for all features of the flag and was extremely particular about all measurements. Once the design work was complete, Kindra used the Computer Numerical Control (CNC) Plasma Arc Cutter (PAC) to cut the 3/8” mild steel. After some grinding and durable painting, the project was ready to go on display. Kindra has been an active student in the Benton Industrial Technology and Engineering program, where she learned the skills and knowledge to operate the equipment to fabricate projects like this. Kindra currently plans to attend Iowa State University after graduating, where she will major in Mechanical Engineering.”",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2838456876244427&id=765183983571737,,0.0,"Happy Friday, Bobcats!

This week we typically hold our Drive Your Tractor to School Day. This allows our members to bring awareness of the agriculture industry as our whole student body and staff see the tractors all lined up in the front parking lot. As we honor this day, our members salute our agriculture industry by our modified Drive Your Tractor to School Day, making the best of our circumstances. 🚜 We cannot thank our food supply chain enough for the work they continue to put in so we have food on our tables, not to mention the thousands of products we use daily that contain byproducts from agriculture.

Thank You to ALL in the agriculture industry. YOU are appreciated! 💙

The intent of this newsletter is to provide students and families with information on digital resources to access remotely to maintain academic skills during this COVID-19 school closure. The school closure situation is fluid. As a district, we will continue to provide information as it becomes available.

At this point, the plan is to provide an updated list of digital curricular resources each week school is closed. Again, this may change as information and direction become available at the federal and state levels.

We know and understand these digital resources can in no way replace or replicate the impact teachers have on students in a collaborative, in-person learning environment. If you have specific questions about the resources shared, please reach out to Anna Upah, Director of Curriculum and Instructional Services. (aupah@benton.k12.ia.us)

We were halfway through our rehearsal schedule for The Addams Family when the world turned upside down. I am so proud of the work we did. And while the show will go on next year, it will do so with a much different look.⁣

You were just beginning to find the spirit and voice of your characters. You had put so much work into learning the songs and choreography. You were doing amazing work and it was getting better every day.⁣

There are some things I enjoy about Directing.

Casting is not one of them.

Gretchen Bennett and I had the unenviable task of casting ten principal roles out of a pool of 44 crazy-talented students.

Ten. Out of 44.

Whew.

I wish the cast could understand how difficult it is to make these decisions. I lose sleep over stuff like this.

But... we have a cast. And it's pretty great.

Come see The Addams Family at the Benton Civic Center April 17-19.

Musical Auditions are Jan 13th (430pm-730pm) with Call Backs on Jan 14th (beginning at 430pm).
If you want a speaking part, you must have a memorized monologue prepared and read from the script; along with preparing a song. All others just need to sing. We will have a live accompanist, so bring sheet music.

TOMORROW IS THE FIRST AUDITION DATE!
Hope to see lots of you at auditions for the Rodgers & Hammerstein classic ""Carousel"" we're presenting this summer at the Benton Civic Center! Two audition dates to choose from: Saturday, April 27, starting at 10 in the morning OR Monday, May 6, starting at 5 pm. Both auditions will be held at the Benton Middle School. Meet in the commons area. Bring a song (we encourage you to choose one that you are comfortable with), accompanist will be provided. Depending on your age, you may be asked to read from the script. This will be a multi-generational cast, so it's the perfect chance for families who want to do something memorable together. Those who have been involved in our shows typically comment that they love the friendships they develop over the summer and from year to year. We truly are a family and welcome newcomers! Please share this post with your friends/family. Thanks!",0.0,"Susan Derry Summers‎Pyramid Players Community Theatre

Hey, high school seniors planning to come to RLC in the fall: I just wanted to remind those actors out there that Rend Lake College offers Intro to Acting ONLY in the Fall semesters. If you are wanting to hone your acting skills in a lively, hands on type of class, sign up for THEA 1101 - Intro to Acting. It's worth three credits and will help you with shyness, memorization skills, and character believability. It's a good class for ANY major, not just Theatre. Contact me at 618-437-5321, Ext. 1295 or private message me. I am always looking for new talent!",0.0,"Tracey Brouillette Webb

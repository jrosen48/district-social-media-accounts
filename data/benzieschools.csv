THE MARIGOLD EFFECT
“Many experienced gardeners follow a concept called companion planting: placing certain vegetables and plants near each other to improve growth for one or both plants. For example, rose growers plant garlic near their roses because it repels bugs and prevents fungal diseases. Among companion plants, the marigold is one of the best: It protects a wide variety of plants from pests and harmful weeds. If you plant a marigold beside most any garden vegetable, that vegetable will grow big and strong and healthy, protected and encouraged by its marigold.

Marigolds exist in our schools as well – encouraging, supporting and nurturing growing teachers on their way to maturity. If you can find at least one marigold in your school and stay close to them, you will grow. Find more than one and you will positively thrive.”

Together,

Though a winding road, we will continue to navigate.
It has been two weeks since Governor Whitmer released the State’s 63-page plan for re-opening schools in Michigan (June 30, 2020). The recommendations and requirements vary based on the status of the Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19), in our geographic area at any given time during the school year. Our Benzie County Central Schools Administration and staff are diligently developing multiple plans; each with different safety protocols, for the various phases.
We fully anticipate starting school on our official first day of school, Tuesday, September 8, 2020 (HALF DAY).

What is she up to?
Lauren is currently working on, and near finished, with her CCAF (Community College of the Air Force) Associates Degree. She is certified on all weapons systems and routinely carries on the job. Lauren just completed a Heavy Weapons proficiency course. This week alone, she has provided 60 hours of security for the Air Forces nuclear assets.
Given COVID-19, she is anxiously awaiting to tackle something new. Mrs. Crossman is thinking we need to send a little liking, a whole lot of loving, and a ridiculously crazy amount of sharing to send bucket fulls of love and support to Lauren Nordbeck.

This position came up, as opportunities often do, in an unexpected fashion. Part of the allure of this position was the fact that it would still allow me to both remain a Benzie Central resident AND also continue to support Benzie Central, albeit in a new fashion.

“BENZIE COUNTY — Four student interns from Benzie Central High School began their school year by interviewing individuals who had played a role in Benzie County's past, but now they are finishing their school year by turning their focus to history in the making.
These interns — Reeve Katt, AuSable Kreiner, Melia Lorenz and Finn McLaren — have spent the past nine months interviewing local individuals of all walks of life, using their training from the University of Michigan School of Information and professional recording equipment purchased through a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services.
They had expected to conclude their many interviews with the legacy portion of the internship this spring. This called for them to interview — for 90 minutes each — two individuals who had played key roles in Benzie County's history, however, COVID-19 had other plans.” -Record Patriot

Benzie Central High School - Jasmine Makayla Kenner.
Copemish, Michigan
Jasmine is the daughter of Tony and Diane Kenner.
Jasmine enjoys playing softball, hanging out with friends, going to the beach, and camping.
When asked about her favorite teacher, Jasmine replied, ""Mrs. Fagerstrom, my TBA CTC Allied Health teacher. She never once gave up on me, and she made sure that I understood the material. She also was a friend when and if I needed it.""
What advice would Jasmine give to those students still in school? ""Get involved! Never give up, and push yourself.""
Jasmine plans to attend Schoolcraft College in Livonia, to become a medical assistant.
Jasmine would like to leave us all with this, ""Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind"" - Dr. Seuss
Congratulations, Jasmine. Our Husky hats are off to you. We extend our senior salute.

""The pandemic has been an interesting time as it relates to ""thinking ahead"". Like many (most) institutions, we have had to be so focused on the present and the ever changing landscape, that thinking ahead has been challenging. Even so - that has been a critical part of our district leadership's time, especially as of late. Even with relatively limited information, we are doing everything we can to think about some big questions that lie before us.

What you need to know....
There has been an MHSAA rule change for the 2020-2021 school year regarding the requirement for student athletes to have a sports physical.

Here is the link to the NEW Health Questionnaire. This is the new form that students who had a valid sports physical in 2019-20 (completed on or after April 15, 2019) can complete with required signatures to meet the pre-participation health status requirement in 2020-21.

If your student did not get a physical in 19-20, which will be all the 6th graders and many of our 7th graders, they will still need to get a traditional sports physical on file in our office this year.
Please contact Katrina Grose in the athletic office if you have questions.

If your student did not get a physical in 19-20, which will be all the 6th graders and many of our 7th graders, they will still need to get a traditional sports physical on file in our office this year.
Please contact Katrina Grose in the athletic office if you have questions.

Go Kelsey!
“BENZIE COUNTY —
Kelsey Novogradac’s dream began with volleyball but after taking a chance on a new sport her senior year, the Benzie Central senior will take on the role of college athlete in a different sport: women’s wrestling.
For many years, Novogradac’s main love was volleyball.
If anyone had asked her about playing a college sport prior to this past winter, she would have likely said it would be volleyball or nothing.
But fate held an exciting opportunity for her.
Benzie Central’s wrestling coach Josh Lovendusky just happens to double as the school’s physical education teacher. The past few years, he has taught a unit of self-defense classes in his physical education class, during which he gave students a week-long introduction to wrestling.”

Novogradac earns wrestling opportunity at Davenport",5.0,"🐾❤️Novogradac earns wrestling opportunity at Davenport
Go Kelsey!
“BENZIE COUNTY —
Kelsey Novogradac’s dream began with volleyball but after taking a chance on a new sport her senior year, the Benzie Central senior will take on the role of college athlete in a different sport: women’s wrestling.
For many years, Novogradac’s main love was volleyball.
If anyone had asked her about playing a college sport prior to this past winter, she would have likely said it would be volleyball or nothing.
But fate held an exciting opportunity for her.
Benzie Central’s wrestling coach Josh Lovendusky just happens to double as the school’s physical education teacher. The past few years, he has taught a unit of self-defense classes in his physical education class, during which he gave students a week-long introduction to wrestling.”

Caden is the son of Lisa and Randy Teichman.
Hunting, fishing, and golf, are just a few of Caden's interests.
His favorite school memory is without a doubt homecoming week his senior year.
When asked about his favorite teacher, Caden replied, Mr. Seymour. ""Mr. Seymour connects well with his students, and he is just a nice person to talk to.""
Advice Caden would give to those students still in school? ""Keep your grades up, and try to make connections out of the school setting.""
Caden plans to attend Ferris State University in the fall, to study Professional Golf Management.
Caden would like to leave us all with this, ""Until the lion learns to write, the story will always glorify the hunter."" -African Proverb
Congratulations, Caden. Our Husky hats are off to you. We extend our senior salute.

Hey, hey, hey, John Plumstead!
""Despite missing the majority of his senior season in 2003 with an injury, John Plumstead graduated from Benzie Central the following spring among the top rushers and scorers in Michigan high school football history – and those accomplishments now are reflected in the MHSAA record book.
Plumstead ran for 5,595 yards over 40 games and four seasons, and also scored 72 touchdowns. The career rushing yardage still ranks 15th all-time. He went on to play linebacker for Army at West Point.""

“Feeding families

Benzie Central is geographically one of the largest school districts in the state. For socially isolating during the pandemic, Superintendent Matt Olson says that distance is a good thing.

""The problem is is that ground creates a barrier for a lot of our families,"" Olson said.

Olson says parts of the district are rural, low-income and far from big grocery stores. The school district has held food drives before but many families didn’t have the time or resources to make it in person.

""We figured if we’re gonna do this the only way we're going to be successful is to get it to them where they are,"" Olson said.”

Tonights read: ""I am Human: A Book of Empathy"" - A hopeful meditation on all the great (and challenging) parts of being human, I Am Human shows that it’s okay to make mistakes while also emphasizing the power of good choices by offering a kind word or smile or by saying “I’m sorry.” At its heart, this picture book is a celebration of empathy and compassion that lifts up the flawed fullness of humanity and encourages children to see themselves as part of one big imperfect family—millions strong.

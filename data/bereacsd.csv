Join us to recognize and celebrate the strength and resilience of military-connected children and families! ✨🇺🇸✨

This month we honor Ohio's 35,000 military children for the sacrifices they make while members of their family serve in our nation's Armed Forces.

Frequent moves and family separations brought about by deployments can present many challenges for these students. Because of their ability to handle these life-changing events, military children are an inspiration and source of pride to our communities, state and the nation!

Thank you to our partners at Broad View Eye Center and U.S. Bank Berea for serving as collection sites for the cards.

This is a great project for kids while schools are closed or for any community members that would like to contribute an encouraging note.

We will continue to collect cards and materials as long as the state mandate preventing visitors at nursing facilities is in place. We are also working with the facilities to follow CDC guidelines to ensure these materials can be delivered and distributed safely.

The College Board is developing tools to mitigate the impact of school closures on students in the Advanced Placement Program. All AP students and teachers will be able to draw on the free online resources that were provided to every AP classroom this fall. Additional resources will be made easily accessible to AP students and teachers through mobile phones and other devices. These include free online AP lessons and review sessions from some of the top AP teachers in the country.

The AP program is finalizing streamlined AP exam options that would allow students to test at home, depending on the situation in May. We’re working to give every AP student the opportunity to claim the credit they’ve earned. The AP Program will communicate the details of these additional solutions to educators and students by March 20.

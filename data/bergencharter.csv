Hi my name is Lizanni. I have been attending BASCS since I was in 2nd grade. Throughout my time in this school I enjoyed being apart of the schools plays, and I recently joined the following clubs: Pathway to College, Heroes and Cool Kids, and National Junior Honor Society. I am sad to say that this will be my last year in BASCS as I will be attending Passaic County Technical Institute. I would like to thank all of my teachers and mentors for all of your efforts throughout the years. Ôøº

With so many students learning from home, the critical question we face as educators today is: what does effective and productive distance learning look like exactly? Through distance learning, schools can continue making great strides forward with students for the future. In fact, with the right infrastructure and learning management systems in place, along with hotspots to allow all students Internet access from home, distance learning can still result in real learning. Without these systems already in place, continuing education at the same rate as before would be virtually impossible. Many schools across the country are struggling to provide the resources necessary for students to continuously be challenged in meaningful and measurable ways from home.

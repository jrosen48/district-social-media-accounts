The day is a celebration of creativity, courage, and collaboration, inspired by Peter H. Reynolds’ book, The Dot.

The Dot is the story of a caring teacher who dares a doubting student to trust in her own abilities by being brave enough to “make her mark.” What begins with a small dot on a piece of paper becomes a breakthrough in confidence and courage, igniting a journey of self-discovery and sharing, which has gone on to inspire countless children and adults around the globe.

The students and faculty at Hoover each designed their own dots which were then turned into a masterpiece!

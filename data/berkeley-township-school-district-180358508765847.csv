New York, NY— August 7th, 2020 — Bayville, NJ artist, 11 year old Isabella work has been selected by Rockefeller Center to be part of its public art installation in New York City. The International design challenge asked artists to design flags that represented their love for New York City.

Isabella’s work can be seen both in the plaza and flying high on one of the flagpoles in the public art installation (normally the flags of the members of the United Nations fly there). Over 1,200 entries were received from around the world and only 180 were selected. Each winning design was made into an 8-foot by 5-foot flag. “My design represents my point of view of how we’ve been living these past few months…through a computer. My original characters represent all different types of people coming together to keep each other strong. I added my twist to the Hamilton poster with my original character because we had Hamilton tickets but the show was canceled because of Covid-19,” said Isabella.",0.0,"Berkeley Township School District added 3 new photos.

What a great week! Thank you to all who made our opening days successful. Reminder - ""parent homework"" did not go home in paper form, you should log in to your PowerSchool account and fill out all your forms there.

Also, our remote learning pickups are tomorrow. Please see our published schedule for your time slot. Please bring some bags or maybe a bin for materials. Also remember to wear your mask and verify that you have answered all standard COVID screening questions before coming onsite. And, although we will be so happy to see you all, we need to be cognizant of time and space for all. Please check in at the High St gym entrance and we will support you in getting your items.",0.0,"Berlin Elementary School

We can't wait to see you back next week, students! We will be in GREEN for school opening (barring any substantial COVID outbreak over the weekend, of course). We have secured HEPA air purifiers for classrooms where there is currently no active air exchange. The companies that work on our HVAC system will begin work on our task list of repairs starting Tuesday. Your Principals will follow up with reminders of what next week's schedule will look like. The info can also be found on our sau3.org website, along with bus schedules.",15.0,"Julie King

Thank you to all that attended tonight's Community Listening Session For Reopening Schools! The session was recorded and will be posted on both SAU 3 AND SAU 20 websites soon for all who wish to watch it. We will schedule more sessions and make sure to vary times of the day so all have the opportunity to join live. We will also be looking at your questions, especially those we didn't have time for, and answering them as we go along. SAU 3 families can expect a survey soon to give us an initial idea on numbers for onsite versus remote pathways so we can hopefully work out options that best fit each families needs and comfort level. There is much work to be done and little time to do it so I thank you all for your patience. Stay tuned and stay healthy😊",6.0,"Julie King

We would like to have an opportunity to officially congratulate our 3 State Championship Teams, Unified Basketball, Girls Ice Hockey and Boys Ice Hockey! It was a great run for all three teams with the fan support from the student body and community. Every athlete should have an experience to play in front of a “Berlin Crowd”, there is nothing like it!
We will be recognizing in the foreseeable future each of our state champions. We are in the process of purchasing State Champion T-shirts and lawn signs for each of our State Champions. The plan is to deliver each of these items to their houses individually with an escort by our local police and fire departments and a Berlin School bus. We have purchased two 3x10’ banners to be hung up in the city to celebrate these accomplishments. 3 State Champions in one season is remarkable! Congratulations to all of our State Champions and your families! The Berlin and Gorham communities are very proud of you all!

So here is my snowman. Actually, its a Super Hero Snow Teacher. You can tell because it has 4 hands because teachers always multitask. She needs to wear a hat because goodness knows, once this pandemic is done, her roots are going to be horrible. Look at the gray hair already! Oreos for eyes and buttons....if that package stays in my house any longer, I will eat the whole thing. No nose because all the fresh veggies are gone from the store and I can't replace it. The skirt is because we need to always be dressed appropriately. Her cape....it's a flag with a teacher theme. And the scarf.....left over from when I dressed as my favorite character.

Since meals and checklists are separated by bus and stop, please pick up the meals at the bus stop you indicated on the survey.

For those of you who have not signed up already and would like to start receiving meals please fill out the meal survey. We will work to add you to the prep and deliveries within 48 hours.

The free meals are available to all children under 18. Those over 18 are eligible as long as they are a student.

Hello My ASP Family!!!

Starting this Wednesday I will be doing zoom meetings for our K-2 ASP students to attend. The schedule is posted here. I will have open zooms from 9:00am to 9:30am and 11:30am to 12:00pm for students to just talk to each other and keep that social connection going each day if they want to sign in.

I will also do a live book reading each day starting at 1pm that they are welcomed to join as well. This will include some discussion about the reading.

If you have any questions, please email me at joe.young@frc123.org

If you have not already spoken with your students group leader and want to be included in the zoom, please email me the best email address to send the invitation to.

It certainly does feel like the first day of school even though we are three quarters of the way through it!

To do today:

1. Take your First Day picture! If you're posting it, make sure to tag us 😉

2. Check your school email account for messages from your teachers. Some teachers snail-mailed info so check your mailbox too. Also check your Google Classrooms.

3. If you're having trouble getting the Chromebook online, check the instructions on the sau3.org website in our remote learning tech help section (see link in previous FB post) or email your teacher or call 752-6500 and leave a msg with your name and phone number.

My 7th grade Foods Class were all given Box Mixes as their first assignment. I included the box mix, eggs, and butter needed in each kit that went home. They had to read the directions, follow safety and sanitation rules, and clean up their mess. All things we have been working on this term. Once they bake, they are to share a selfie with me so I know they completed the assignment. Owen shared his picture right away!

Teacher, Denise Palmer shared:

My 7th grade Foods Class were all given Box Mixes as their first assignment. I included the box mix, eggs, and butter needed in each kit that went home. They had to read the directions, follow safety and sanitation rules, and clean up their mess. All things we have been working on this term. Once they bake, they are to share a selfie with me so I know they completed the assignment. Owen shared his picture right away! The assignment that kids need to do next week is to help their parents prepare, or prepare themselves, 3 meals (breakfast, lunch or dinner). And not leave a mess for their parents to clean up 😊",2020-03-17 20:03:00,,

No matter the arrangement, new parents, guardians, grand families, and more face a challenging yet exciting task. Children do not come with instruction manuals, but Home Visiting Programs can offer the next best thing!

Home Visiting Programs are meant to level the playing field for children, giving every child an equitable start. By taking a preventative approach, Home Visitors reach children before they fall behind in their development and school readiness.

Home Visiting participation is also linked to higher rate of employment, greater participation in education and job trainings, higher monthly incomes, and reductions in the use of welfare and cash assistance programs. To find a home visiting program near you, visit www.nhchildrenstrust.org/local-services.

We set out on a two year journey to answer the question: What influences student learning in NH?

Education is more comprehensive and nuanced than a school building, a teacher, or even a student in an academic setting - it reflects and involves the entire community and context in which a student is learning and growing up.

Learn more with our resources, including:
➡️ A comprehensive report that guides readers through the findings
➡️ Interactive data visualizations
➡️ Community and school district profiles for each NH community, that show indicators and trends over time

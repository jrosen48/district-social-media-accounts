We recognize that the Coronavirus pandemic is both a public health crisis and an economic crisis. In many families, this pandemic has directly impacted jobs and household income. If your family has been economically impacted, we want to remind you that it is still possible to apply for the 2019-20 Free and Reduced Price School Meals/Milk plan. The application is available at the link below:

https://www.bkwschools.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/BKW-19_20-Application.pdf

Our meal delivery & grab-and-go pick up meals are available to all district students, at no cost, for the duration of this school closure, which is currently scheduled to last through May 15. But filing the application for free-and-reduced lunch now may qualify your family for the program when school resumes. Additionally, eligibility for the 2019-20 program will carry over into the first 30 days of the next school year.

If you have any questions about the application process, please contact Susan Frank at susan.frank@neric.org or Claire Groudine at claire.groudine@bkwschools.org.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3728473850558559&id=129105603828753,"BKWSCHOOLS.ORG

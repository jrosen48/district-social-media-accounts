The USDA has extended a waiver which will allow ‚òòÔ∏èBerrien Springs Public Schools‚òòÔ∏è to provide students Free school meals until December 31, 2020, or until the available funding runs out.

Students will be able to eat breakfast and/or lunch at no cost for that time period. When the notification is given by the USDA that the funds are gone, we will go back to the normal charging of student meals, therefore it is still necessary to fill out the Free and Reduced School Meals application for your student(s). The application can be done online at www.lunchapp.com or paper applications are available at your child's school building.

Dear Parents/Guardians and Students,

The Berrien Springs Music Department will host a drive-thru drop-off event on Wednesday, May 20, 2020. This will give students and parents the opportunity to drop-off music items including uniforms, music, folders, and instruments. Parents and Guardians can also pick up fundraiser money and reimbursements from missed festivals during this event. We will not accept non-music items.

The drop off location will be at the Berrien Springs Middle School from 2pm to 5pm. Please use the front circle drive and remain in your car. Students are not allowed on campus at this time due to the stay home order from the Michigan government.

We appreciate your continued flexibility during this quarantine. We miss making music with your students and we are looking forward to being together again.

The staff at Sylvester are trying to reframe our thinking about being apart from students and families for the remainder of the year.

We like to think of it as less about being apart and more about being differently TOGETHER.

Today we celebrated our first Students of the Week through a ZOOM pizza party. üçïüíª

Mrs. Williams delivered frozen pizzas to each student‚Äôs home on Thursday and families prepared the pizza lunch for our 12pm ZOOM meeting!

Not quite the same as our monthly pizza lunches but still a great time to be TOGETHER and celebrate our ROCKS values. ‚òòÔ∏è

Our students ROCK üíö‚òòÔ∏è! When it comes to Compassion (the ‚ÄúC‚Äù in ROCKS) our Sylvester Learning Community rises to the occasion.

Not only did we raise awareness but we also raised $120.00 for the Jump Rope for Hearts campaign through the sales of candy grams.",2020-02-15 08:28:28,,

The USDA has extended a waiver which will allow ☘️Berrien Springs Public Schools☘️ to provide students Free school meals until December 31, 2020, or until the available funding runs out.

Students will be able to eat breakfast and/or lunch at no cost for that time period. When the notification is given by the USDA that the funds are gone, we will go back to the normal charging of student meals, therefore it is still necessary to fill out the Free and Reduced School Meals application for your student(s). The application can be done online at www.lunchapp.com or paper applications are available at your child's school building.

If you have any questions, please contact Pam Evans, Food Service Director @ 269-471-8860.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1707787469398687&id=481067455404034,,0.0,"Exciting Food Service News!

If you know children K-12 who would like weekend food, have them tell their school office. If they are attending in person, they will receive the bag at school.

I'm so incredibly proud to be a choir teacher and I'm also so happy to teach at Berrien Springs. What a great school! The music in this video is from 10 students in my choirs who sent in recordings and then it was put together by the talented Alan Selvidge. My school then took the music and took pictures from last year to celebrate the amazing students, teachers, and staff at Berrien. Music is so powerful and I miss making it with all of my students.

Two Important Information Items for students and parents.

First, a reminder that any students who ordered a class ring can pick orders up Tomorrow at the High School from 11:00am to 12:00pm.
Second, we are happy to announce that we will be able to host graduation for our seniors on June 28, 2020 at the Berrien Springs Youth Fair. The ceremony time has been moved to 1:00pm. We will be using a large portable stage with two video walls. This will be a drive in movie style ceremony with guests remaining in their cars. Audio will be available in vehicles and students will be called forward in small social distancing groups to walk across the stage and receive their diploma. The entire event will be live streamed on Facebook and Youtube. We will be sending out all the details to seniors and their families by the end of the week.",0.0,"Berrien Springs High School

The drop off location will be at the Berrien Springs Middle School from 2pm to 5pm. Please use the front circle drive and remain in your car. Students are not allowed on campus at this time due to the stay home order from the Michigan government.

We appreciate your continued flexibility during this quarantine. We miss making music with your students and we are looking forward to being together again.

Seniors

Berrien Springs High School will be holding a drive up cap and gown distribution on Friday, May 22 from 11:00am to 12:00pm. Parents may pick up items by driving through the High School gym parking lot. We are not able to distribute graduation items ordered until they have been fully paid for. If you owe anything for graduation items you received an email from Mrs. Luttke explaining how to take care of the amount owed. This will also be an opportunity to drop off books and school materials. Please bring all school issued items and return them during the cap and gown pick up. Seniors do not need to turn in chromebooks and chargers or cases. Those may be kept by seniors. We are planning to have senior lockers cleaned out and contents ready to be picked up on the 22nd as well.

We currently have a plan for a graduation ceremony held on June 28. We will continue to communicate with seniors anything that needs to be taken care of prior to the ceremony.",0.0,"Berrien Springs High School

The staff at Sylvester are trying to reframe our thinking about being apart from students and families for the remainder of the year.

We like to think of it as less about being apart and more about being differently TOGETHER.

Today we celebrated our first Students of the Week through a ZOOM pizza party. 🍕💻

Mrs. Williams delivered frozen pizzas to each student’s home on Thursday and families prepared the pizza lunch for our 12pm ZOOM meeting!

Not quite the same as our monthly pizza lunches but still a great time to be TOGETHER and celebrate our ROCKS values. ☘️

Congrats to Fatima, Khloe, Alex G., Raquel, Kenya, and Anna. 🤗🥁🎈🎉

The High School students and staff are doing an amazing job working from home. We had a 13hr notice before we went home on Friday, March 13th and students and staff adapted and overcame to rise to the challenge. Today we are starting a virtual Shamrock Pride post. Please comment on this post with a picture or video showing your pride for our great community and school. I will start it off with picture of our one and only Shamrock Tree!",2020-03-26 20:03:15,,

So much goes into the “behind the scenes” work at Sylvester Elementary.

Day in and day out teachers, coaches, and Mrs. Williams are working hard and collaborating to improve instruction for our students.

The Fifth grade team-pictured here- is holding an after hours Professional Learning Community (PLC) meeting because one of their teammates was attending a workshop during our last half day.

All of our staff is committed to pulling out all the stops to make certain ALL Sylvester Scholars are successful! ☘️

Today was a different kind of day at Sylvester Elementary. Over half of our staff attended a reading and writing training out of the building.

Rather than rely on substitute teachers to fill in for our teachers while they were away we took a bit of a different approach.

We ran an “Academic Field Day” today.

Students engaged in many different academic activities throughout the day in a class size larger than normal. (35-50 students instead of the usual 25)

At Sylvester we are committed to turning our challenges in to learning opportunities.

In the month of October the Sylvester staff noticed that students were struggling to show RESPECT- specifically to the adults in the building. 🙁

So we challenged students to participate in a ☘️RESPECT☘️ poster campaign throughout the month of November.

The poster contest winners were selected last week!

Congratulations to the following students;

☘️Genevieve Bontemps - PBIS Winner

☘️Titan Shaw - Encore Winner (selected by Music, Art, Gym, Technology, and Library teachers)

☘️Malia White - Student Council (selected by student council members)

☘️Emma Baker - Lunchroom (selected by cafeteria workers)

8th graders have worked the past few days on creating piñatas. Next week they will decorate the piñatas and fill them with candy and then illustrate a children’s story they have written. The students are excited to present their final products to Mars and Sylvester classrooms! Thank you to retired teacher, Iris Vergara, for providing us your piñata expertise!",0.0,"Berrien Springs Middle School

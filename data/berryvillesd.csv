Berryville Youth football is ready to go this year. Its taken awhile to get things going but we are finally ready. This year will be somewhat different than previous years. We will be adding the 3rd grade into the league. Teams will be made up of 3rd and 4th grades making up one team and 5th and 6th grades making another. I will have signup sheets at intermediate and middle school offices and try and get as many sent home with the kids as possible. If you don't have a signup form i will have plenty on signup day. Cost is $50 per player. We will have signups Saturday August 29th behind Bobcat Arena in the parking lot. 3-4 grades starting at 10am to 11am and 5-6 grades 11am to noon. Please share this with all who may be interested. Looking forward to another fun and exciting year of Bobcat youth football!",4.0,"https://www.facebook.com/groups/606755573543900/permalink/606773246875466/

BHS Graduates of 2020 and Friends and Family,

We are excited to announce that we have scheduled what we hope to be a traditional graduation on July 17th at 8 pm in Bobcat Stadium. (July 18 will be an inclement weather date.)

At this time planning is limited, and we are unsure of many guidelines including those that will affect attendance.

As we approach this date, we will continuously review the guidelines set forth by the CDC, Governor Hutchison and Arkansas Department of Education.

Beginning tomorrow, AMI work can be submitted.

If your child’s teacher wants work electronically, they will communicate the best method for accepting work.

There are drop-off boxes at each building for paper submission (see post below).

It is very important that each child’s work be secured together (no loose papers). Each paper needs to have the student’s first and last name and their teacher’s name written at the top.

Families, we understand this is all new and everything is not easy. Please communicate with our teachers, so they know how to help your student(s), or simply contact the teacher to let them know you are doing well! Our teachers want to hear from their students and their parents/guardians!

AMI AR info for Second Grade:
Accelerated Reader (AR) option for Library AMI Credit
All 2nd graders and few first graders in participating classrooms that are reading on an independent level have AR accounts. These students may read and take AR tests as often as they like. Each passed AR Test will count as the library AMI credit for the day if your student chooses to do so. Just initial in the library box and write AR next to it. The test must be taken between 8am-3:30pm.

*Go to the Elementary Library page on the Berryville Elementary School website or use this link:
https://bes.bobcat.k12.ar.us/index.php?pageID=471801_3

More details will be included with the next set of AMI instructions available later this week.

Thank you to everyone who came out to the game tonight and made such a great atmosphere for these guys, and thank you to all the parents for the early mornings and late night dedication! I know it isn’t easy! Been a fun year to say the least. These young men poured their hearts and souls into every practice and game, were incredibly coachable all season and did everything I ever asked them to do. They are great young men and deserved every thing that they received this season including a 19-4 (10-1) record, with a Conference regular season Championship and a District Championship at the end! Couldn’t be more proud to be called their Coach and will always love em like my own! Love you guys and thanks for a very memorable year! Go Bobcats!

Here are the latest numbers for Bertie along with the break down of cases.

➕This is a marathon, not a sprint. The curve is flattening. We know things have been difficult, and we thank those of you who are taking this seriously. We must all continue with this plan until we receive further word from Governor Roy Cooper.

➕Face coverings/masks in public are helpful, but not fool proof. Still cover coughs, sneezes, and maintain distance.

➕ Increase your ""personal bubble"" size to include 6 feet in front of, behind, and next to you on each side when out in public.

➕Be mindful of the new Executive Order and signage at stores. Pay attention to ALL directives inside the store (one way aisles, limit of customers in the building at once, etc).

To the Staff of Windsor Elementary,
I read that to be defeated is temporary, but giving up is what makes things permanent. And you guys are no quitters for sure. Continue to maintain by showing love and compassion to our students. It is my duty to make each of you smile in some kind of way and I will continue to do just that. Keep pushing and most of all continue to be great.

#WhatyareadingWednesday #BertieCountySchoolsVirtualSpiritWeek

During this time of unplanned worlds turned upside down, the very heart of this book is being displayed by school employees not only in Bertie County, but around this country. In chapter 3, it discusses by title embracing the mind-set of change. While the book is discussing how to reach students effectively, by changing what we are doing in order to literally change the brain, every educator is having to embrace the change right now. We are literally having to change everything that has been done and walk into a world unknown, but in the long run, this may be one of the most effective changes to affect education in this country, state, and in our county. Despite how others may see it, educators are rising to the challenge, and reaching out to the students. I think you will see the effects continue long after these covid days have passed.

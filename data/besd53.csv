We are aware that an article was written about BESD #53 stating “Nearly 90 in quarantine in Bourbonnais Elementary district”. It is important to remember that we only isolate students from in-person instruction as we are following the IDPH guidelines. The District has only experienced 2 positive cases thus far. Therefore the vast majority of individuals being “isolated” (not “quarantined” as that is a function of the Health Department) are due to single symptom isolation precautionary measures that the District is following. The nearly 90 individuals referred to in the article is evidence of the District taking these guidelines serious and implementing the guidelines as they are written. I hope this provides some clarity and context to the figures presented in the article.

Again, we appreciate your continued understanding and cooperation during these uncertain times. We will also continue to provide timely communication with our school community as information becomes available.

Cảm ơn quý vị đã hỗ trợ đặc biệt trong nhiều ngày qua, khi chúng ta đang chung nhau bảo vệ cộng đồng của chúng ta trong đại dịch coronavirus/COVID-19 đang phát triển. Để bảo vệ Illinois khỏi bị siêu vi lây lan, Thống Đốc JB Pritzker đã tuyên bố bắt buộc đóng cửa trường học bao gồm tất cả các tòa nhà, cả công cộng lẫn tư nhân, phục vụ học sinh từ mẫu giáo đến lớp 12. Thống đốc tuyên bố rằng những ngày này là ngày ""Đạo Luật của Chúa Trời"" và không cần phải đi học bù.

Việc bắt buộc đóng cửa này có hiệu lực từ ngày thứ Ba, 17 tháng Ba. Hiện tại, chúng tôi nghĩ sẽ mở cửa lại trường vào ngày thứ Ba, 31 tháng Ba.

Các bữa ăn sáng và trưa miễn phí hoặc giảm tiền vẫn có sẵn cho tất cả các học sinh nào đủ điều kiện. Tất cả các bữa ăn sẽ được phân phối theo cách đến lấy rồi đi (grab and go) và sẽ được phân phối qua phòng đa mục đích (multi-purpose room, hay MPR) tại Alan Shepard. Xin vào từ ngõ sau của MPR nằm về hướng đông của trường học, gần sân chơi.

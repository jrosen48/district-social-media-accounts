Civic Memorial High School is joining high schools across the country in honoring the Class of 2020. At 8:20 pm (20:20 military time), on Friday, April 17, 2020, the lights at Hauser Stadium will be turned on to shine a light on the Senior Class. The lights will be on for 20 minutes and 20 seconds. We are asking the community to join us in this celebration by turning on their porch lights. While the stadium is closed to the public, the event will be streamed live on Facebook. Dr. Griffin and Mr. Newell will read the names from our senior class. This tribute is a token of our appreciation for their hard work and dedication throughout their educational career. We want our seniors to know that Eagle Nation loves and cares about them and stands behind them during this difficult time. #BeTheLight #GoEagles

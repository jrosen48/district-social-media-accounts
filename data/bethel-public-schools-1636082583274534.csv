Dear Students,

First, I hope this email finds you healthy and safe.

As we have seen troubling events unfold over the past week, I have been searching for the words to address all of you in a way that is meaningful and supportive, despite not being together at Bethel High School. The disturbing circumstances around George Floyd's death have likely stirred many negative feelings, including but not limited to anger, anxiety, despair, and horror. How this injustice could happen is a question that we are forced to ponder far too often; I wish I had answers that would lead to immediate solutions. What I do know is that our strength lies in our ability to support each other. With that in mind, if any of you would like to speak with me or another staff member, please don't hesitate to reach out.

I am happy to present the first edition of #quarantinesessions. The idea is that I arrange a tune that inspires me every few weeks or so and call musicians in my network to record their parts from their home in quarantine.
This edition features my arrangement of Bheki Mseleku's ""Timelessness"".

Ben Fitzpatrick- Alto Saxophone
Marios Charalambous- Tenor Saxophone
Cesare Mecca- Trumpet
Tommaso Perazzo- Piano
Daniel Nagel- Bass
Marcello Cardillo- Drums
Attie Bauw- Mix and Master
Gregory Ney- Video Editing

Enjoy!

I am happy to present the first edition of #quarantinesessions. The idea is that I arrange a tune that inspires me every few weeks or so and call musicians in my network to record their parts from their home in quarantine.
This edition features my arrangement of Bheki Mseleku's ""Timelessness"".

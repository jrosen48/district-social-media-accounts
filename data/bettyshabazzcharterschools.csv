The Symposium took place on May 30, 2019 at the Gwendolyn Brooks Library on Chicago State University's campus. There was a reception with light refreshments where guests were able to meet with panelists before the symposium.

The auditorium was packed and we are still receiving positive feedback from attendees. The symposium was moderated by Dr. Kim Dulaney (Chicago State University) and the panelists were Dr. Carol D. Lee (co-Founder of Betty Shabazz International Charter Schools), Dr. Megan Bang (VP of The Spencer Foundation), and Mr. Jose Lopez (E.D, of the Puerto Rican Cultural Center).

We appreciate the support of everyone who attended and look forward to having you join us again next year!",2019-06-12 09:00:00,,

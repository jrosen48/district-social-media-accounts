Every 10 years, the U.S. Census Bureau undertakes a mammoth task: counting all the people residing in the United States. This count affects the allocation of funding for our community’s public resources (e.g., roads, hospitals, schools), how we plan for the future, and our voice in government.

Be on the lookout! Between March 12-20, you will receive an invitation to respond online to the 2020 Census. To learn more about the importance of the #2020Census and how to participate: www.2020census.gov. #LifeinBex",2020-01-21 10:56:11,,

District News and Alerts:
I am informing parents that a family member of a child in Mrs. Cansler's Kindergarten class has tested positive for Covid-19 (I repeat-a family member, not the child). The child has tested negative and has shown no symptoms. Our policy states that the child, although not showing symptoms, will stay at home for two weeks. I have contacted the county health department and they say that the rest of the children in the class are considered ""non-contact"" and are at very minimal risk. To their credit, our elementary staff has done a great job of keeping grade levels separate. We also sanitize constantly throughout the day-wiping with disinfectant and using electrostatic sprayers. If you have questions, please feel free to contact the elementary school.

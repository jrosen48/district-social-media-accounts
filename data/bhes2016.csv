This is a message from the Brandywine Heights Area School District. To help families prepare for tomorrow morning I wanted to send a message out this evening with an update on the status of school tomorrow. Due to the anticipated overnight snow accumulations, the School District will be operating under a three hour delay for tomorrow, Monday, March 4th. The extended delay will help determine the impact of the storm tomorrow morning and see if it is feasible to have roads and school grounds cleared for school. We are going to closely evaluate the event and any additional calls will be made by 8:30 AM.

Please stay safe and warm this evening,

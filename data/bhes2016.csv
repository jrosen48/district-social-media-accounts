We all learned about the differences between geometric and organic shapes and how artists use shapes to create different types of art. We also explored abstract artist Reggie Laurent and robot artist Leonard Zimmerman. Our artists then used abstract and geometric shapes to create abstract art and to design their own robots! Many of our robots were also doing a fun activity like eating cheeseburgers or playing soccer!

This is a message from the Brandywine Heights Area School District. To help families prepare for tomorrow morning I wanted to send a message out this evening with an update on the status of school tomorrow. Due to the anticipated overnight snow accumulations, the School District will be operating under a three hour delay for tomorrow, Monday, March 4th. The extended delay will help determine the impact of the storm tomorrow morning and see if it is feasible to have roads and school grounds cleared for school. We are going to closely evaluate the event and any additional calls will be made by 8:30 AM.

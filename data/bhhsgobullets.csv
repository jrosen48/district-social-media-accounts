Please be safe in your travels if you are doing so, and enjoy the time off. As we find ourselves nearing the halfway point of the year, we just want to say how proud we are of all of the accomplishments made by our students in their classrooms, as well as in our community.

We look forward to the rest of the year with our students and are excited about everything that 2020 will bring to the High School.

We hope that you have an enjoyable holiday season with your family and friends, and we will see you in the new year when we return on Thursday, January the 2nd.

The deadline to have senior portraits turned in for the yearbook is Wednesday, November 21st, 2018. If you do not meet the deadline, then the yearbook staff will use your portrait taken on picture day in the yearbook instead of whatever pictures you get taken outside of school. Pictures must be sent to Miss Day digitally (maeday@bhasd.org); hard copies will not be accepted. The photos must also be 300 dpi (dots-per-inch) or higher in order to be accepted.

This is a message from the Brandywine Heights Area School District. To help families prepare for tomorrow morning I wanted to send a message out this evening with an update on the status of school tomorrow. The School District will be operating under a two hour delay for tomorrow, Friday, February 10th. The strong winds and cold caused drifting and black ice in areas. A two hour delay will allow additional time for roads to be treated where necessary and a safer travel in daylight.

Please stay safe and warm this evening,

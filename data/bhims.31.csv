As we begin our Fall break, and reflect on this time in the season of giving thanks, I am beyond thankful for these past 64 days and am so excited to see the new heights our students will reach as we continue progress through this year. Thank you families for sharing your awesome children with us, and it is truly our privilege to work with them. I, also want to take this opportunity on behalf of myself, Mr. Riggins, and the entire faculty and staff of the IS and MS, to wish all of our families a relaxing and enjoyable break.

At approximately, 7:15, a fuse blew at the rear of the school, as caused by a squirrel chewing on the power line. This outage has impacted electricity in areas of the building, and currently our back-up generators are supplementing power where available.

However, with preparation in mind, should our building lose power again this evening, we will be in contact with families to share updated information and contingency planning.

I want to take this opportunity to thank our families, our students, and our teachers and staff for their cooperation and assistance with this afternoon’s unanticipated early dismissal due to the power loss in our school. Our students responded maturely and responsibly and our staff, professionally and safely ensured all of our kids were able to get to their rides home. I am happy to report that at this time, power has been restored to the Intermediate and Middle School and we do not anticipate any disruptions to tomorrow’s school day. However, with preparation in mind, should our building lose power again this evening, we will be in contact with families to share updated information and contingency planning.

Thank you and have a wonderful evening.

This is a message from the Brandywine Heights Area School District. Unfortunately, we will need to CLOSE school today. Secondary roads in the back part of the school district are still snow and ice covered and not safe for bus travel.

Thank you for your patience.

The School District will be operating under a two hour delay for tomorrow, Friday, November 16th. Based on the many variables with weather overnight, a delay will allow time to clear roads and school grounds. We will evaluate conditions in the morning and any additional calls will be made by 8:00 am. The early dismissal scheduled for Elementary and Intermediate School at 1:00 pm will continue.

Due to the impending snow storm today, the school district will be dismissing students early today. We will be dismissing at 10:00 am for the High School and Middle School. The Intermediate and Elementary will dismiss at 11:00 am. As a reminder, we will be utilizing the alternate bus transportation plan for families/students which this impacts.

BCTC will be canceled today for our High School students who attend.

Students will have the option to purchase and take a packed lunch home with them.

All after school and evening activities for today are canceled (including the parent athletic night).

If there would be a need for a delayed-start tomorrow, the Elementary and Intermediate Early Dismissal at 1 pm will CONTINUE due to the high number of planned parent-teacher conferences scheduled.

Thank you for your cooperation and understanding as we work to ensure the safety of all our students,

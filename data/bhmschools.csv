Oh WOW! We are getting so close to our $2020 scholarship goal! One week from today we want to not only commit to being able to give this $2020 Scholarship but would also like to be able to give additional scholarships of a minimum of $500 each. The number of additional scholarships is dependent on donations from our amazing community!
SO, Let's set a new challenge! Let's hit our first goal $2020 by the end of TODAY (Friday, May 8, 2020)! THEN, let's hit a goal of $500, per day, for the next 6 days! I know that we can do this!

My name is Lindsey Andrews and I will be completing my student teaching with Miss Watson this fall in English 3 & 4. I graduated from Bismarck-Henning in 2016 and I am so excited to be back! There is no other place I would rather complete my internship than home.

While I was a student at Bismarck, I participated in volleyball, basketball, softball, NHS, and student council. After graduating high school, I continued my education and softball career at Kankakee Community College and The University of St. Francis. The last two years I have lived in Joliet, but this spring I moved back to Bismarck with my family.

Once I complete my student teaching this fall, I will graduate from USF with my Bachelor‚Äôs in Secondary English Education.

Daughter of Pattie & Terry McCord

Emily will be a biology major on the pre-medical track at Saint Louis University this fall.

What's your favorite BHRA memory? Spending study hall, physics, and most homerooms in Mr. Stoens‚Äôs room Junior year. He is an awesome teacher and advice-giver.

What's the best piece of advice you've ever received? If there‚Äôs a will, there‚Äôs a way. If there‚Äôs a Quizlet, there‚Äôs an A.

Where do you see yourself in 10 years? I will hopefully be finishing up my medical residency in Pediatric Hematology.

Any superstitions? I never walk under ladders, and I knock on wood to avoid a jinx.

Which teacher has influenced you the most or made the biggest impact on you, and why? Mr. Head has influenced me the most because of the passion he has for the science he teaches. He inspired my love for science, and I have no idea what my future career path would be if he wasn‚Äôt my biology teacher.",,,0.0,"Congratulations Emiley McCord!

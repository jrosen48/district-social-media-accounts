Message from Supt. David Marshall:

[June 26, 2020] Greetings Brookings-Harbor School District Families,

I am looking forward to continuing to get to know the Brookings-Harbor community and would like to thank the people I’ve met so far for their warm welcome. I want to let community members know that I have an open-door policy and am happy to visit with and listen to your thoughts and concerns.

I recognize that one of the pressing topics on many people’s minds is what will the start of school look like this fall.

Our focus is on the safety of our students and staff as we develop our plans to reopen the schools in the fall. The Oregon Department of Education put out this guidance that was developed in collaboration with the Oregon Health Authority and the Governor’s office. If you have the opportunity, I encourage you to have a look at this document. We will be using it to guide our planning efforts this summer. (Link to document: https://www.oregon.gov/ode/students-and-family/healthsafety/Pages/Planning-for-the-2020-21-School-Year.aspx)

Your input is an important part of the planning process and it would be very helpful if you would take a few minutes to respond to this survey that will be used to inform the planning process. (Link to survey: https://forms.gle/GwqdBLD3CLttZB467) You are also welcome to email me directly or set up an appointment to come in and visit.

As we determine our next steps, we will post them on an FAQ page on our web site and share the information via newsletters and other channels.

A few important highlights of the guidance (though this is far from all of it!):

- Physical distancing of up to 6 ft or 35 square feet per student in spaces is required. (We will need to calculate what this means for our class sizes and the number of students we can have in a building at one time.)
- We will need to stagger where students enter and exit the building and keep track of who’s coming in and out.
Playgrounds will be open to students during the school day (limited groups at a time) and sanitized between use.
- We will need to keep student groups together (such as classes) to the extent possible.
- We will need to work with our health department in the event of a case or an outbreak.

Please know that, throughout our planning, we will always keep in mind that our schools must continue to be warm, caring communities, even with these new rules.

Thank you for our continued patience and grace as we work through this together with our students’ best interests in our hearts.

Respectfully,
David Marshall, Superintendent

[26 de junio de 2020] - Saludos Familias del Distrito Escolar de Brookings-Harbor,

Espero seguir conociendo a la comunidad de Brookings-Harbor y me gustaría agradecer a las personas que he conocido hasta ahora por su linda bienvenida. Quiero informar a los miembros de la comunidad que tengo una tactica de puertas abiertas y estoy feliz de visitar y escuchar sus pensamientos y preocupaciones.

Reconozco que uno de los temas apremiantes en la mente de muchas personas es cómo será el comienzo de la escuela este otoño.

Nuestro enfoque es la seguridad de nuestros estudiantes y personal mientras desarrollamos nuestros planes para reabrir la escuela en el otoño. El Departamento de Educación de Oregon publicó hizo esta guía que fue desarrollada en colaboración con la Autoridad de Salud de Oregon y la oficina del Gobernador. Si tienes la oportunidad, te animo a que leas este documento. Lo usaremos para guiar nuestros esfuerzos de planificación este verano.

Su contribución es una parte importante del proceso de planificación y sería muy útil si toma unos minutos para responder a esta breve encuesta que se utilizará para informar el proceso de planificación. (enlace de la encuesta) También puede enviarme un correo electrónico directamente o programar una cita para vernos en persona.

A medida que determinamos nuestros próximos pasos, los publicaremos en una página de preguntas frecuentes en nuestro sitio web y compartiremos la información a través de boletines y otros canales.

Algunos puntos destacados importantes de la guía (¡aunque esto está lejos de ser todo!):
- Se requiere un distanciamiento físico de hasta 6 pies o 35 pies cuadrados por estudiante en un espacio. (Tendremos que calcular qué significa esto para el tamaño de nuestras clases y la cantidad de estudiantes que podemos tener en un edificio al mismo tiempo).
- Tendremos que tambalearnos por donde los estudiantes entran y salen del edificio y realizar un seguimiento de quién entra y sale. .
- Los patios de juego estarán abiertos a los estudiantes durante el día escolar (grupos limitados a la vez) y desinfectados entre usos.
- Tendremos que mantener a los grupos de estudiantes juntos (como las clases) en la medida de lo posible.
- Tendremos que trabajar con nuestro departamento de salud en caso de un caso o un brote.

Tenga en cuenta que, a lo largo de nuestra planificación, siempre tendremos en cuenta que nuestras escuelas deben seguir siendo comunidades cálidas y afectuosas, incluso con estas nuevas reglas.

Gracias por su paciencia y gracia mientras trabajamos en esto juntos con el mejor interés de nuestros estudiantes en nuestros corazones.

Message from Supt. David Marshall:

[June 26, 2020] Greetings Brookings-Harbor School District Families,

I am looking forward to continuing to get to know the Brookings-Harbor community and would like to thank the people I’ve met so far for their warm welcome. I want to let community members know that I have an open-door policy and am happy to visit with and listen to your thoughts and concerns.

I recognize that one of the pressing topics on many people’s minds is what will the start of school look like this fall.

Our focus is on the safety of our students and staff as we develop our plans to reopen the schools in the fall. The Oregon Department of Education put out this guidance that was developed in collaboration with the Oregon Health Authority and the Governor’s office. If you have the opportunity, I encourage you to have a look at this document. We will be using it to guide our planning efforts this summer. (Link to document: https://www.oregon.gov/ode/students-and-family/healthsafety/Pages/Planning-for-the-2020-21-School-Year.aspx)

Your input is an important part of the planning process and it would be very helpful if you would take a few minutes to respond to this survey that will be used to inform the planning process. (Link to survey: https://forms.gle/GwqdBLD3CLttZB467) You are also welcome to email me directly or set up an appointment to come in and visit.

As we determine our next steps, we will post them on an FAQ page on our web site and share the information via newsletters and other channels.

A few important highlights of the guidance (though this is far from all of it!):

- Physical distancing of up to 6 ft or 35 square feet per student in spaces is required. (We will need to calculate what this means for our class sizes and the number of students we can have in a building at one time.)

Information on Pandemic EBT funds from State of Oregon

If your children normally get free or reduced-price school meals, you’re eligible to get extra grocery money. It’s a new program called Pandemic-EBT (P-EBT).
For each month that school is closed and you are eligible, you will get $5.70 per day for each of your children in a K-12 school, school-based preschool, or school-based Headstart that normally participate in the National School Lunch Program. AND you can still get “grab and go” meals from school during the pandemic.
Immigration status does not matter for Pandemic EBT. Pandemic EBT will not count in a public charge test.
Here are the ways your family can receive the Pandemic EBT benefit:

1. Already get SNAP? The extra money will be loaded on your Oregon Trail EBT card automatically.

2. Don’t have SNAP, but already qualify for free or reduced school meals? A new EBT card will be automatically mailed to you with instructions. If your whole school gets free meals (such as Kalmiopsis Elementary, which is a “Provision 2 School” with free breakfast and lunch), you will qualify too. Even though Pandemic EBT uses the same type of card as SNAP, Pandemic EBT is NOT SNAP benefits and is not considered in a public charge test.

3. Never received SNAP or free and reduced-price school meals before? A simple way to access the P-EBT benefit is by applying for free school meals here: https://www.mymealtime.com/Apps/SignIn.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fapps

4. Receiving SNAP benefits can also qualify you, here's how to apply https://govstatus.egov.com/or-dhs-benefits. You will automatically be given Pandemic EBT benefits starting the month you’re approved for either free school meals or SNAP.

To find out more information, you can visit oregonhunger.org/covid-19 or call 2-1-1. We can also field questions at Brookings-Harbor School District, please email Food Service Director Cindy Badger at cindyba@brookings.k12.or.us.

The USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) authorized DHS to provide Oregon P-EBT Pandemic School Meal Replacement Benefits to more than 351,000 students receiving free or reduced-price school meals in Oregon, including almost 147,000 students already receiving Nutrition Assistance. Households will receive benefits equivalent to one free
lunch and one free breakfast for each eligible child – $5.70 per normal school day for the months of March, April, May and June.

[Actualización BHSD #8 - 6 p.m. Martes, 17 de marzo de 2020]

Queridas Familias del Distrito Escolar Brookings-Harbor,

La gobernadora de Oregón, Kate Brown, ha anunciado una extensión de su mandato de cerrar las escuelas de Oregón para ayudar a prevenir la propagación de COVID-19 (coronavirus). Las nuevas órdenes del gobernador significan que las escuelas permanecerán cerradas hasta el 28 de abril de 2020.

Sabemos que este es un momento difícil y que la cerrada de nuestras escuelas es un desafío. Por favor, sepa que estamos haciendo todo lo posible para planificar el regreso potencial de nuestros estudiantes y estamos buscando orientación adicional del Departamento de Educación de Oregón durante esta cerrada extendida.

Lo que sí sabemos en este momento:

Continuaremos con una distribución de alimentos en caja o embolsados del distrito escolar y distribuiremos ""paquetes de bocadillos"" del banco de alimentos local. Consulte nuestro sitio web para obtener información sobre fechas y horas.
Nuestras instalaciones permanecerán cerradas a los estudiantes y a la mayoría del personal durante la cerrada extendida.
Mientras nuestros estudiantes están fuera de la escuela, por favor ayúdelos a entender la importancia de esta emergencia nacional de salud fomentando el distanciamiento social, la buena higiene de las manos, evitando a las personas enfermas y cubriendo sus tos y estornudos. Las reuniones de más de 10 personas no son recomendadas por el gobierno de los Estados Unidos en este momento.

Agradecemos su comprensión mientras navegamos por esta situación en constante cambio. Estamos compilando recursos en nuestro sitio web para que pueda acceder rápidamente a la información. Puede acceder a nuestra página de información y recursos de BHSD COVID-19 en www.brookings.k12.or.us.

Estaré en contacto con más información tan pronto como tengamos un plan para navegar por esta cerrada extendida. Por favor, haga lo que pueda para ayudar a prevenir la propagación de este virus.

Gracias,

Chris Eberhardt, Superintendente
Distrito Escolar Brookings-Harbor

¿Continuarán los programas de alimentos del distrito escolar durante la cerrada?

[Actualización BHSD #8 - 6 p.m. Martes, 17 de marzo de 2020]

Queridas Familias del Distrito Escolar Brookings-Harbor,

La gobernadora de Oregón, Kate Brown, ha anunciado una extensión de su mandato de cerrar las escuelas de Oregón para ayudar a prevenir la propagación de COVID-19 (coronavirus). Las nuevas órdenes del gobernador significan que las escuelas permanecerán cerradas hasta el 28 de abril de 2020.

Sabemos que este es un momento difícil y que la cerrada de nuestras escuelas es un desafío. Por favor, sepa que estamos haciendo todo lo posible para planificar el regreso potencial de nuestros estudiantes y estamos buscando orientación adicional del Departamento de Educación de Oregón durante esta cerrada extendida.

Lo que sí sabemos en este momento:

Continuaremos con una distribución de alimentos en caja o embolsados del distrito escolar y distribuiremos ""paquetes de bocadillos"" del banco de alimentos local. Consulte nuestro sitio web para obtener información sobre fechas y horas.
Nuestras instalaciones permanecerán cerradas a los estudiantes y a la mayoría del personal durante la cerrada extendida.
Mientras nuestros estudiantes están fuera de la escuela, por favor ayúdelos a entender la importancia de esta emergencia nacional de salud fomentando el distanciamiento social, la buena higiene de las manos, evitando a las personas enfermas y cubriendo sus tos y estornudos. Las reuniones de más de 10 personas no son recomendadas por el gobierno de los Estados Unidos en este momento.

Agradecemos su comprensión mientras navegamos por esta situación en constante cambio. Estamos compilando recursos en nuestro sitio web para que pueda acceder rápidamente a la información. Puede acceder a nuestra página de información y recursos de BHSD COVID-19 en www.brookings.k12.or.us.

Estaré en contacto con más información tan pronto como tengamos un plan para navegar por esta cerrada extendida. Por favor, haga lo que pueda para ayudar a prevenir la propagación de este virus.

Gracias,

Chris Eberhardt, Superintendente
Distrito Escolar Brookings-Harbor

Oregon Governor Kate Brown has announced an extension to her mandate to close Oregon schools to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 (coronavirus). The governor’s new orders mean that schools will be closed until April 28, 2020.

We know this is a trying time and that the closure of our schools is a challenge. Please know we are doing all we can to plan for our students’ potential return and are looking for additional guidance from the Oregon Department of Education during this extended closure.

What we do know right now:

- We will continue a food distribution of boxed or bagged food from the school district and distribute “snack packs” from the local food bank. See our website for information on dates and times.

- Our facilities will remain closed to students and most staff during the extended closure

While our students are away from school, please help them understand the importance of this national health emergency by encouraging social distancing, good hand hygiene, avoiding people who are sick, and covering their coughs and sneezes. Gatherings of more than 10 people are not recommended by the U.S. government at this time.

We appreciate your understanding as we navigate this constantly-changing situation. We are compiling resources on our website so you can quickly access information. You can access our BHSD COVID-19 information and resources page at www.brookings.k12.or.us.

I will be in touch with more information as soon as we have a plan to navigate this extended closure. Please do what you can to help prevent the spread of this virus.

The Brookings-Harbor School District Board of Directors -- in partnership with the District Leadership Team -- has established the priorities of student success, high-quality staff, and increasing positive relationships.

As a district, we are working on aligning our Continuous Improvement Plan with these district priorities. Through this process and the submission of our plan to the state, we expect to receive an estimated $1.2 million through the Student Success Act/Student Investment Account process for the coming 2020-2021 budget cycle.

We will continue to monitor progress towards the district’s priorities through superintendent reports during our monthly regular board meetings, including tonight's meeting at 5 p.m. Wednesday, Jan. 15, in the Kalmiopsis Elementary School Library.

THE SEASON FOR GIVING!

What a wonderful night of heartfelt stories and the power of giving!

Wild Rivers Community Foundation awarded $22,000 in grants Wednesday to 29 nonprofit organizations, agencies and churches that provide thousands of children and adults in Curry and Del Norte counties with much-needed food, clothing, gifts, companionship and other services.

“This is a celebration of all of you and the hope you give those in our communities who really need it,” said WRCF Director Gina Zottola. More than 60 people gathered for the Holiday Partnership ceremony at Howenquet Hall in Smith River.

This is the twelfth year that WRCF has awarded holiday grants ranging from $250 to $2,000. The grants — funded by donations from family trusts, foundations, businesses and individuals — support programs that provide children with winter coats or Christmas presents, and holiday food for hungry families. The grants are also used for warm clothes for struggling veterans and the homeless, and support services for abused or neglected children.

“We are so amazed by the generosity of the community and happy to be a part of it,” said Kelly Schellong, of Bicoastal Media, which hosts the annual Coats for Kids campaign. “Last year, we used this money to provide coats to 1,407 kids in Curry and Del Norte counties.”

Roger Gilbert, of the Brookings Presbyterian Church, said the grant will be used to cover some of the costs associated with providing a free Thanksgiving meal to needy residents via the Community Kitchen program operated by five churches in Brookings. “It’s all about eliminating hunger in our community, and on Thanksgiving we were able to provide more than 100 hot meals.""

Daphne Cortese, of the new nonprofit Del Norte Mission Possible, will use the money to provide essential supplies to homeless people. “I’m going to let them know that this money is from the community, to let them know that they have value. They are valued. This is going to do more than buy socks, it’s going to build bridges.”

Zottola thanked WRCF’s donors who provide the grant funding. “Tonight wouldn’t be possible — we wouldn’t have this pool of resources — if not for our community partners. Last year, the grants blessed the lives of more than 7,000 people. It’s proof that, collectively, we can move the needle. We can affect change in our communities.”

This year’s donors include the Brattain Family Trust; the Dale & Jo Ann Thomas Charitable Fund; the John G. Atkins Foundation; Pacific Power; Patricia D. & William B. Smullin Foundation; St. Joseph’s Health System Humboldt; South Fork/Big Flat Endowment Fund; R. Baird & Jane Rumiano Family Fund; Gordon Elwood Foundation, The California Endowment and WRCF.",0.0,"Thank you Wild Rivers Community Foundation and donors for the generous Holiday Partnership mini-grant for the Brookings-Harbor High School Youth Transition Program (YTP) to create canned cranberries for donation to local food programs, and funds to create a Thanksgiving tamale feast!

Many thanks to Dollar General Literacy Foundation for awarding Brookings-Harbor School District a Dollar General Youth Literacy Grant for 2019 of $1000. These DG grants were announced in September and provide $2.8 million to organizations across 44 states to support youth literacy initiatives during the 2019-2020 academic year. We are one of only 6 organizations from Oregon to receive this competitive nationwide grant.

The funds will be used to purchase copies of the illustrated children’s book “30 Minutes Over Oregon” for all students in the 5th grade as part of a local history project culminating with events with community members, local historians, and high school history and social studies classes.

An Orbis Pictus Honor Book for Outstanding Nonfiction 2019, “30 Minutes Over Oregon” is a story of war and reconciliation. It tells the story of Japanese pilot Nobuo Fujita who dropped bombs in the woods outside Brookings during WW2, the events that brought him back to visit twenty years later, and the enduring connection to Brookings.

We are excited to be in talks with author Marc Tyler Nobleman and illustrator Melissa Iwai who created “30 Minutes Over Oregon” for possible school and community visits this spring. The Chetco Community Public Library — which is the home of Nobuo Fujita’s family samurai sword — and the Chetco Historical Society Museum are partners in this effort to engage students in local history.

The Career Technical Education program at Brookings-Harbor High School would like to thank the Brookings Harbor Education Foundation for a grant donation of $1,000 to purchase metal for student welding and fabrication projects in the metals lab. This generous grant will be spent locally to provide raw materials that students can create with, and will support student success in learning new skills working with metals and welding.

Last week was an exciting week for our program with the final phase of the installation of a new ventilation system underway. The team from Umpqua Sheet Metal of Roseburg has been working hard with our school district facilities and maintenance team to complete the installation and wiring. When complete, students will be able to push a button in individual welding booths to activate the vents.

The metals program also welcomes community-driven project suggestions for things that can be utilized by the community that students can create. For further information, please contact teacher Chris Thompson via email at christ@brookings.k12.or.us.

Since September, BHEF has provided more than $1,900 in grants to Brookings-Harbor School District classrooms and programs. In addition to the recent donation to Chris Thompson’s welding and metals classes at BHHS, there have also been mini-grants to help purchase robotics “Bots” kits for Jennifer Bietschek’s math classes at Azalea Middle School, tree planting materials for K’la Kennedy and Kelly Margolis’ kindergarten classes at Kalmiopsis Elementary, and further support for prizes and materials for the district-wide Oregon Battle of the Books program coordinated by District Librarian Patty Clark and her team.

Flu season started on October 1st and continues until March 31st. During our last flu season, the CDC estimated that there were 40 million flu-related illnesses, up to 647,000 flu hospitalizations, and between 36,400 and 61,200 flu deaths.

The flu is spread easily through tiny droplets produced when people with the flu talk, cough, or sneeze. Touching surfaces with the flu virus on them and then touching your mouth, nose or possibly eyes can also spread the infection, although this occurs less frequently.

People are most likely to spread the flu during the first three to four days of their illness. Flu symptoms may include fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, and sometimes nausea and vomiting.

If you get the flu, try to avoid contact with sick people. Keep your hands away from your mouth; cover your coughs and sneezes; wash your hands often, and keep surfaces clean.

The best prevention is to get vaccinated. The local pharmacies offer flu vaccines, as do most health care providers.

What will my responses be used for?
The results of the survey will be used to inform the school district's continuous improvement plan and determine funding priorities for new funds available through the Student Success Act.

What is the Student Success Act?
Signed into law in May of 2019, the Student Success Act is a historic opportunity for Oregon schools. When fully implemented this act will invest approximately $2 billion for early learning and K-12 education, and close to $500 million will go directly to Oregon school districts and eligible charter schools through the Student Investment Account. This account is a non-competitive grant. The focus of the Student Investment Account is on key areas for improvement – from reducing class size, increasing instructional time, addressing health and safety needs and ensuring a well-rounded education. The law requires school districts to meaningfully engage stakeholders to determine the best investments for students in their local community while explicitly focusing on student mental and behavior health, addressing disparities based on race or disability, and improving teaching and learning conditions.

The results of the survey will be used to inform the school district's continuous improvement plan and determine funding priorities for new funds available through the Student Success Act.

What is the Student Success Act?
Signed into law in May of 2019, the Student Success Act is a historic opportunity for Oregon schools. When fully implemented this act will invest approximately $2 billion for early learning and K-12 education, and close to $500 million will go directly to Oregon school districts and eligible charter schools through the Student Investment Account. This account is a non-competitive grant. The focus of the Student Investment Account is on key areas for improvement – from reducing class size, increasing instructional time, addressing health and safety needs and ensuring a well-rounded education. The law requires school districts to meaningfully engage stakeholders to determine the best investments for students in their local community while explicitly focusing on student mental and behavior health, addressing disparities based on race or disability, and improving teaching and learning conditions.

However, a slide on South Bank Chetco River Road has cut off part of our regular bus route (Route F - Bus 61). The new turn around point and final stop for this route will be Blackberry Lane. Stops at Mt. Emily Road and 99804 S. Bank Road will not have morning pick-up.

All staff and students, please exercise caution when traveling to campus this morning and call your school if you will not be able to come in due to flooding or road conditions in your area.

The district is currently seeking applicants to fill two very important roles at Brookings-Harbor High School for the coming school year: Principal and Assistant Principal.

Brookings-Harbor School District recently received the resignations of Lisa Dion, Brookings-Harbor High School Principal; and Mark Hebert, BHHS Assistant Principal. Both plan to leave at the end of June.

Ms. Dion has served the district for five school years as BHHS Principal coming from Tillamook School District, and Mr. Hebert for one year arriving from Bend-LaPine School District. During Ms. Dion’s tenure, the graduation rate has risen to just below the state average after a long time period of very low percentages in comparison to other school districts. During Mr. Hebert’s tenure, he started the truancy court program in partnership with the City of Brookings which has resulted in a 25% decrease of absences overall at BHHS.

As of last week, both positions are posted to the district hiring website and shared on regional and national search websites. The district will be implementing a comprehensive process with staff input to find effective leaders who are a good fit and can carry on the important work already established. Any questions in regards to the hiring process can be directed to Dede Corpening – HR Assistant and/or Sean Gallagher – Superintendent at 541-469-7443.

The retrofit and remodel is funded as part of the $4.5 million in grants from Business Oregon that the district has won for seismic safety projects in the past few years. Ausland Group of Grants Pass, working with local subcontractors, has covered all phases of the project.

Our Azalea Middle School team, the ""Miniature Literature Libro Llamas"" took second place at the southern Oregon regionals in Rogue River on Saturday. Region 5 had 20 teams competing and will send two teams to the state competition on April 6 at Chemeketa Community College in Salem. So, that means that our Llamas are ""state-bound""!! Congratulations!

Last Saturday's regional competition started with ""pool play"" where each team competed in four battles and points were accumulated. The top 16 scoring teams went on to ""bracket play"" with the ""Llamas"" ranked No. 1 after pool points were counted. In the regional finals, they lost to Ashland Middle School, who is last year's defending State Champion at the middle school level.

Azalea Middle School
March 11, 2019 at 11:19 AM ·

Our Azalea Middle School team, the ""Miniature Literature Libro Llamas"" took second place at the southern Oregon regionals in Rogue River on Saturday. Region 5 had 20 teams competing and will send two teams to the state competition on April 6 at Chemeketa Community College in Salem. So, that means that our Llamas are ""state-bound""!! Congratulations!

Last Saturday's regional competition started with ""pool play"" where each team competed in four battles and points were accumulated. The top 16 scoring teams went on to ""bracket play"" with the ""Llamas"" ranked No. 1 after pool points were counted. In the regional finals, they lost to Ashland Middle School, who is last year's defending State Champion at the middle school level.

Way to go, Alyssum, Acacia, Daisha, and Alison! Good luck at State!

Here are 5 tasty facts about food service in our schools - Did you know?

1. Kalmiopsis Elementary is a Provision 2 school. This means we serve FREE breakfast and lunch daily to all Kalmiopsis students. Azalea Middle School and Brookings-Harbor High School provide free and reduced meals to students who qualify. Find daily menus at https://www.brookings.k12.or.us/menus/.

2. Kalmiopsis Elementary launched a ""Breakfast in the Classroom"" in Fall 2017. Every day, students have the opportunity to eat a free, simple breakfast after the bell in their classroom, providing them with the nutrition needed to succeed throughout the school day.

3. In the summer, the school district hosts the Summer Food Program, where youth ages 1-18 can eat free breakfast and lunch Monday to Thursday in the Brookings-Harbor High School cafeteria. Adults can dine with their kids for just $2.50 at breakfast and $3.75 at lunch.

4. Recently, our school district applied for and won a grant from the Oregon Department of Education's Child Nutrition Programs! Starting this summer, we will reach even more youth in need in our Brookings-Harbor community and surrounding rural neighborhoods. We are retrofitting a full-size school bus into a meal delivery vehicle and a dining car that will make daily stops in neighborhoods across our community.

5. The Summer Food Program daily salad bar incorporates farm-to-table produce from the school gardens! And, did you know that Kalmiopsis Elementary is a “Monarch School USA” — one of just a handful across the country? This summer, we will host enrichment activities with hands-on opportunities to learn about gardens, food, and nutrition through a partnership with “Ag in the Classroom” for Summer Food Program participants.

Recently, our school district applied for and won a $20,000 Summer Meal Program Start-Up and Expansion Grant from the Oregon Department of Educations’ Child Nutrition Programs! Starting next summer, this new grant will enable us to bring the Summer Food Program to even more youth in need in our Brookings-Harbor community and surrounding rural neighborhoods.

For the third year in a row, volunteers around the school district led by Molly Earl have organized a drawing to benefit Katelyn’s Cause.

Katelyn’s Cause is a local Brookings nonprofit that raises money to purchase gifts to be hand-delivered each December to children with cancer receiving treatment at Doernbecher Children’s Hospital in Portland, Oregon. Contributions to Katelyn’s Cause also enable gifts to be distributed over the entire year to patients battling cancer, sometimes even delivered the day the child is diagnosed.

Chis and Molly Wallace founded Katelyn’s Cause after losing their daughter Katelyn in 2008 to synovial sarcoma at the age of 17. Katelyn was a student of Brookings-Harbor schools.

Prizes in this year's drawing include:

* Two pairs of Legging Army leggings and a chicken pot pie, donated by Molly Earl. (Chicken pot pie will be made in the BHHS certified kitchen).
* A stained glass art piece, a framed floral painting by Cathy Dean, and a beautifully painted driftwood Santa, donated by Gina June.
* A painting donated by Ria Shanon, valued at $72.00.
* A candle basket, valued at $45.00, donated by Melissa’s Favorite Things.
* A one-month gym membership at Ironside Fitness in the Brookings Harbor Shopping Center valued at $50.00 & a gift certificate with personal trainer Nicole Stephens, valued at $200.00 donated by Fit With Nic.
* A basket of dog supplies by Sherri and Jennifer Legat.
* A Katelyn’s Cause T-Shirt and unity scarf.

Students learn how to prepare a traditional holiday meal for themselves and their peers. Student-generated funds cover the other items needed to complete the meal.

The grant was also used to purchase locally sourced cranberries from Cape Blanco Cranberry Farms and canning jars/ supplies. The students learn how to process and can the cranberries into both whole berry and jellied cranberry sauce. The finished product is used as gifts for students, their families, and also given to the Brookings-Harbor Food Bank and two community kitchens.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=318165212103277&id=151658442087289,"Wild Rivers Community Foundation

Wild Rivers Community Foundation presents $24,000 in holiday grants

Christmas came early for 32 nonprofit organizations in Curry and Del Norte counties that received grants totaling $24,000 from the Wild Rivers Community Foundation to provide children and adults with food, clothing and other critical supplies and services during the holidays. (See full list below.)

As part of its Holiday Partnership Grant program, the foundation awarded grants ranging from $250 to $2,000 using funds that came from community donors, including family trusts, foundations, business owners and individuals.

“There are many, great programs and projects in our community and these grants will help them accomplish their mission to help those in need during the holidays,” said WRCF Director Gina Zottola.

The organizations — from Klamath, California, to Port Orford, Oregon — applied for mini-grants to fund programs that provide children with winter coats or Christmas presents, holiday food for hungry families, warm clothes for struggling veterans and the homeless, and services for abused or neglected children.

The organizations will receive their grants and have the opportunity to talk about their programs during a reception at 6 p.m. Dec. 5 at Howonquet Hall in Smith River.

Wild Rivers Community Foundation (WRCF) is an affiliate of Humboldt Area Foundation, serving all of Del Norte and Curry counties. WRCF promotes and encourages generosity, leadership and inclusion to strengthen communities. For more information call 707-465-1238 or 541-412-6277, or visit wildriverscf.org.

The 2018 Holiday Partnership Grant funds are used to support a holiday meal for the students by purchasing four turkeys to provide a Thanksgiving dinner for the students enrolled in YTP Employability and YTP Exploring Careers classes. Students learn how to prepare a traditional holiday meal for themselves and their peers. Student-generated funds cover the other items needed to complete the meal.

The grant was also used to purchase locally sourced cranberries from Cape Blanco Cranberry Farms and canning jars/ supplies. The students learn how to process and can the cranberries into both whole berry and jellied cranberry sauce. The finished product is used as gifts for students, their families, and also given to the Brookings-Harbor Food Bank and two community kitchens.

Wild Rivers Community Foundation presents $24,000 in holiday grants

Christmas came early for 32 nonprofit organizations in Curry and Del Norte counties that received grants totaling $24,000 from the Wild Rivers Community Foundation to provide children and adults with food, clothing and other critical supplies and services during the holidays. (See full list below.)

As part of its Holiday Partnership Grant program, the foundation awarded grants ranging from $250 to $2,000 using funds that came from community donors, including family trusts, foundations, business owners and individuals.

“There are many, great programs and projects in our community and these grants will help them accomplish their mission to help those in need during the holidays,” said WRCF Director Gina Zottola.

The organizations — from Klamath, California, to Port Orford, Oregon — applied for mini-grants to fund programs that provide children with winter coats or Christmas presents, holiday food for hungry families, warm clothes for struggling veterans and the homeless, and services for abused or neglected children.

The organizations will receive their grants and have the opportunity to talk about their programs during a reception at 6 p.m. Dec. 5 at Howonquet Hall in Smith River.

Wild Rivers Community Foundation (WRCF) is an affiliate of Humboldt Area Foundation, serving all of Del Norte and Curry counties. WRCF promotes and encourages generosity, leadership and inclusion to strengthen communities. For more information call 707-465-1238 or 541-412-6277, or visit wildriverscf.org.

This is the Great Oregon ShakeOut, one of the largest earthquake drills ever. Practice now so you can protect yourself during a real earthquake. This is an earthquake
drill. Right now, drop cover and hold on.

Drop to the floor, now. During a large earthquake, the ground might jerk strongly and knock you down.

Take cover under something sturdy to protect yourself from objects that can be thrown across the room.

Hold on to your shelter until the shaking stops. If you can't get under something, stay low and protect your head and neck with your arms.

Now, look around what objects might fall or be thrown at you, that you should secure in place before a real earthquake.

Finally, a strong earthquake may cause a tsunami. If you're near the ocean during an earthquake, drop cover and hold on. Then, quickly walk to high ground after the shaking stops.

This drill is over. Visit https://www.shakeout.org for simple steps to help you survive and recover from a major earthquake. Thank you for taking part in the Great ShakeOut.

The high school leadership classes planned a slate of traditional events at the high school including today's Noise Parade for which the freshman, sophomores, juniors, and seniors were up late last night decorating floats to parade through town at approximately 2:30 p.m. They also planned a variety of philanthropy events and fundraisers that will continue through November and include an upcoming Blood Drive for the Red Cross.

Coronation of a homecoming king and queen will take place at tonight's home football game. Come and hear the BHHS marching and pep band! And, expect to see some dressed up students about town Saturday night for the annual homecoming dance.

Reminder: The Homecoming Noise Parade will process through town today at approximately 2:30 p.m. Hope to see many friends and alumni at the Homecoming football game tonight at 7 p.m. at BHHS's Elmer Bankus Field.

On Wednesday night, the ""Powder Puff"" football event (where teams of girls from each grade competed in flag football) raised $500 for Katelyn's Cause! The sophomores prevailed.

Also: An upcoming ""Powder Tuff"" event is planned on Nov. 1 at 7 p.m. in the high school gym (where the boys will play volleyball). Admission will be donations only and will once again go to Katelyn's Cause. This local nonprofit helps local families in medical emergencies. They provide families traveling to Doernbecher Children's Hospital in Portland with gas cards and other needs that they may have because a child is having medical tests or procedures.

Did you know? The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), in coordination with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), will conduct a nationwide test of the Emergency Alert System (EAS) and Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) on Oct. 3, 2018. The WEA portion of the test commences at 2:18 p.m. EDT, and the EAS portion follows at 2:20 p.m. EDT. The test will assess the operational readiness of the infrastructure for distribution of a national message and determine whether improvements are needed.
The WEA test message will be sent to cell phones that are connected to wireless providers participating in WEA. This is the fourth EAS nationwide test and the first national WEA test. Previous EAS national tests were conducted in November 2011, September 2016, and September 2017 in collaboration with the FCC, broadcasters, and emergency management officials in recognition of FEMA’s National Preparedness Month.

The EAS is a national public warning system that provides the President with the communications capability to address the nation during a national emergency. The test is made available to EAS participants (i.e., radio and television broadcasters, cable systems, satellite radio and television providers, and wireline video providers) and is scheduled to last approximately one minute. The test message will be similar to regular monthly EAS test messages with which the public is familiar. The EAS message will include a reference to the WEA test:

“THIS IS A TEST of the National Emergency Alert System. This system was developed by broadcast and cable operators in voluntary cooperation with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Federal Communications Commission, and local authorities to keep you informed in the event of an emergency. If this had been an actual emergency an official message would have followed the tone alert you heard at the start of this message. A similar wireless emergency alert test message has been sent to all cell phones nationwide. Some cell phones will receive the message; others will not. No action is required.”

Cell towers will broadcast the WEA test for approximately 30 minutes beginning at 2:18 p.m. EDT. During this time, WEA compatible cell phones that are switched on, within range of an active cell tower, and whose wireless provider participates in WEA should be capable of receiving the test message. Some cell phones will not receive the test message, and cell phones should only receive the message once. The WEA test message will have a header that reads ""Presidential Alert"" and text that says:

“THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.”

The WEA system is used to warn the public about dangerous weather, missing children, and other critical situations through alerts on cell phones. The national test will use the same special tone and vibration as with all WEA messages (i.e. Tornado Warning, AMBER Alert). Users cannot opt out of receiving the WEA test.

The test was originally planned for Sept. 20, 2018 but has been postponed until Oct. 3, 2018 due to ongoing response efforts to Hurricane Florence.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=302241847028947&id=151658442087289,,0.0,"Reminder: Nationwide emergency text alert test planned for Wednesday, Oct. 3, during school hours 11:18 am PDT.

designated ‘Monarch School USA’ site!

The City of Brookings was designated a “Monarch City USA” in May 2017, as the first city in Oregon to receive the distinction, and now Kalmiopsis Elementary School has been designated a “Monarch School USA” — one of just a handful across the country and only the second school in Oregon to receive the honor for its commitment to restoring critical habitat and forage for the conservation of monarch butterfly populations.

There will be a brief ceremony for the hanging of a “Monarch School USA” sign at 10 a.m. Thursday, Aug. 23, at the Little Bear Patch garden, at Kalmiopsis Elementary School, 650 Easy St. A celebratory potluck will follow, all are welcome.

The monarch butterfly is one of the most recognizable butterflies in North America and yet has faced declining numbers due to habitat loss and fragmentation throughout its massive migratory range. Brookings Oregon Monarch Advocates (BOMA) is a local group of concerned individuals engaged in all aspects of conservation of the monarch butterfly. BOMA aims to educate the general public regarding captive, responsible rearing of monarchs and growth of host plants for caterpillars and adults.

Recently the school district’s Youth Transition Program students partnered with BOMA to clean out 36 beds in the Little Bear Patch garden to establish a pollinator garden containing host plants such as milkweed for caterpillars; and nectar plants for adult butterflies, as well as bees and other pollinator species. Such gardens provide important way stations for monarchs.

It took a village: The YTP students and other students enrolled in classes with teacher Michelle Prudden were a big part of the renovation, along with BOMA volunteers, Stacia Ryder, Lynette McPherson, Maureen Leigh, and Wade Stumpenhaus. The Elkton Butterfly Sanctuary provided the school district with discounted nectar plants, Eco-Nutrients donated organic locally sourced fertilizer, South Coast Lumber Co. donated the lumber, and Gold Beach Lumber donated supplies as well. Curry County Master Gardners donated funding for soil that the district received at a discounted rate from Hambro in Crescent City.

Monarch City USA is a national nonprofit, based in Washington State, with the goal to inspire the nation's municipalities to become supporters of the monarch butterfly by planting milkweed and nectar plants throughout their areas. Brookings City Councilor Dennis Triglia, a BOMA volunteer, learned that Monarch City USA also had a Monarch School USA program, and inquired on behalf of the schools.

""It was very exciting when Monarch City USA received the membership application for Brookings and the K-School,” said Russell Stubbles, head of the Monarch City/School USA program. “We could now formally recognize the wonderful work being done by the local citizens, particularly BOMA, and the students. We have members in many states, but Brookings’ participation shows the nation that the efforts to save the monarch butterfly goes from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean.”

The Monarch City USA program currently has two sites in Florida, representing the East Coast. The only other school in Oregon with this Monarch School USA designation is Sisters Middle School in Sisters, Ore.

The BOMA volunteers have also participated with the school to raise monarch eggs and caterpillars to adult butterflies. After they emerge from their chrysalises and are ready for release, each butterfly is “tagged” with a small sticker containing a specific number for each butterfly and an email address for tracking their migration to overwintering sites in California. Releasing the full-grown butterflies has been a highlight of the year for several elementary classrooms.

“It is a citizen science effort and a wonderful educational tool in the STEM toolbox for the students,” Triglia said.

BOMA is planning a First Annual Monarch Festival from noon to 4 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 15, at Azalea Park in Brookings. The event aims to recruit and teach more citizen scientists to plan milkweed plants and how to raise and monitor monarchs.

designated ‘Monarch School USA’ site!

The City of Brookings was designated a “Monarch City USA” in May 2017, as the first city in Oregon to receive the distinction, and now Kalmiopsis Elementary School has been designated a “Monarch School USA” — one of just a handful across the country and only the second school in Oregon to receive the honor for its commitment to restoring critical habitat and forage for the conservation of monarch butterfly populations.

There will be a brief ceremony for the hanging of a “Monarch School USA” sign at 10 a.m. Thursday, Aug. 23, at the Little Bear Patch garden, at Kalmiopsis Elementary School, 650 Easy St. A celebratory potluck will follow, all are welcome.

The monarch butterfly is one of the most recognizable butterflies in North America and yet has faced declining numbers due to habitat loss and fragmentation throughout its massive migratory range. Brookings Oregon Monarch Advocates (BOMA) is a local group of concerned individuals engaged in all aspects of conservation of the monarch butterfly. BOMA aims to educate the general public regarding captive, responsible rearing of monarchs and growth of host plants for caterpillars and adults.

Recently the school district’s Youth Transition Program students partnered with BOMA to clean out 36 beds in the Little Bear Patch garden to establish a pollinator garden containing host plants such as milkweed for caterpillars; and nectar plants for adult butterflies, as well as bees and other pollinator species. Such gardens provide important way stations for monarchs.

It took a village: The YTP students and other students enrolled in classes with teacher Michelle Prudden were a big part of the renovation, along with BOMA volunteers, Stacia Ryder, Lynette McPherson, Maureen Leigh, and Wade Stumpenhaus. The Elkton Butterfly Sanctuary provided the school district with discounted nectar plants, Eco-Nutrients donated organic locally sourced fertilizer, South Coast Lumber Co. donated the lumber, and Gold Beach Lumber donated supplies as well. Curry County Master Gardners donated funding for soil that the district received at a discounted rate from Hambro in Crescent City.

Monarch City USA is a national nonprofit, based in Washington State, with the goal to inspire the nation's municipalities to become supporters of the monarch butterfly by planting milkweed and nectar plants throughout their areas. Brookings City Councilor Dennis Triglia, a BOMA volunteer, learned that Monarch City USA also had a Monarch School USA program, and inquired on behalf of the schools.

""It was very exciting when Monarch City USA received the membership application for Brookings and the K-School,” said Russell Stubbles, head of the Monarch City/School USA program. “We could now formally recognize the wonderful work being done by the local citizens, particularly BOMA, and the students. We have members in many states, but Brookings’ participation shows the nation that the efforts to save the monarch butterfly goes from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean.”

The Monarch City USA program currently has two sites in Florida, representing the East Coast. The only other school in Oregon with this Monarch School USA designation is Sisters Middle School in Sisters, Ore.

Kalmiopsis Elementary was recently approved to participate in the Provision 2 National School Lunch and School Breakfast Program. This means that this school year we will be serving not only breakfast but lunch FREE to all Kalmiopsis students.

In order for the district to complete this process to make the most for this exciting program, WE NEED YOUR HELP. We are asking all head of households to fill out a Free or Reduced application regardless of income in the household. By doing this it will help provide the most funding we can get as far as providing the free meals to your children(s) over the next several years.

There are two ways to fill out the ""free and reduced application"":

1. Go to www.brookings.k12.or.us. On the right-hand side of webpage, you will find a box that says ""Online Payments."" Set up your account. Once registered, go to the online application box. In order to complete the application you will need your child(rens) school lunch I.D. number. Once complete, please submit. We highly suggest filling out the online application.

2. Fill-out a paper form. You can find paper forms at any one of the front offices at any of the BHSD schools.

Regardless if your child(ren) participate in the free breakfast and lunch program, we need ALL households to fill out the application. Provision 2 only requires this process once every four years, so for the next three years no applications will be collected, and the free breakfast and lunch program will continue at Kalmiopsis.

Pssst... We passed 25 days until the first day of school on Friday (sorry for the late post). The first day of school for Grades 1-5, 6 and 9 and any other new students to the middle school or high school is Tuesday, Sept. 4.

Did you know that the Brookings-Harbor School District has added propane-powered buses to its fleet in recent years? The district currently has 3 buses that are powered by propane, and a fourth arriving this summer. Propane is a promising alternative fuel for school buses because it is widely available, even in rural areas, and it can cost less than diesel or gasoline. In a recent study, some school districts save nearly 50% on a cost per mile basis for fuel and maintenance relative to diesel. Propane buses are also quiet and create a lower amount of carbon emissions.

Starting Kindergarten isn't just learning letters and numbers. It's important that you help practice independent tasks with your child ahead of time. Here are some ideas for places to start. It's OK to make a game out of it and give them lots of encouragement.

- Going to the bathroom (unbuttoning and fastening pants)
- Dressing (changing clothes, zipping coats, and fastening shoes)
- Eating lunch (opening juice boxes)
- Separating from parents
- Knowing full-name and phone number
- Following two-step directions

The middle school is undergoing an extensive seismic safety retrofit this summer! The retrofit work includes checking existing structure strength and flexibility and checking for hazards. That includes reinforcing building infrastructure, removing some large windows throughout the buildings, re-supporting heavy HVAC units and other large items, and making sure that brickwork is tied into the walls correctly. The update will ensure that everything from the roof to the foundation is connected properly to provide safe passage for evacuation and to help prevent a major collapse in the event of an earthquake.
Because this work requires the opening of most of the walls and ceilings in the school, students will return to new fresh paint and new fixtures, such as improved lighting, ventilation systems and even new showers in the locker room!
Last summer (2017) Kalmiopsis Elementary received safety updates, and next summer (2019) the plan is to complete a similar project at Brookings-Harbor High School. All told, the school district has received about $4.5 million in grants from Business Oregon for the safety projects. The program provides funding for construction work on schools and other critical public buildings to better prepare the structures to withstand a major earthquake, and to ensure that safe community gathering places are available for emergency response.
Project management on behalf of the district is provided by Darryl Anderson of Anderson Engineering and Surveying, all design engineering and construction is in partnership with Ausland Group of Grants Pass, in addition, multiple local subcontractors have been hired for the project.

I’m so excited to start my NASA JPL internship tomorrow! I can’t wait to dive into my project and gain all of the knowledge and experience I can. I’m excited to contribute and learn. I’m disappointed that I won’t have the chance to travel to California, but I’m glad to have the opportunity to work remotely.

Our teachers are still doing the prep work, planning, teaching online and be available for questions on work assignments. Most of all grading these assignments that do count.

Remote learning both creates an opportunity for students and teachers to interact online and allows students to continue learning subjects and material that are a key part of their curriculum that they must know.

Have a great week everyone!

A few of the first graders had another Google Meet this morning only this time, it was Show and Tell Day! Each first grader, and Mrs. Paulson, brought something to share with the class. We’re doing our best to make this unconventional learning practice into a memorable life experience while still staying connected with one another.

My students have worked hard over these past 3 weeks being home. From this day forward, they will learn from me via video and chatting on Google Hangouts. Also, they will email me and complete assignments via Google Classroom. Learning has not stopped in our 5th grade classroom. We have just moved it into the cloud! I've included a picture of my teacher workstation at home (with Garfield posters!!!) and screens of us learning. Stay safe and healthy!",2020-04-03 14:10:27,,

In this video, Director Mimi Klotz is reading Song for Papa Crow, written and illustrated by Marit Menzin, and Gregg Bruff is telling us a little about two members of the Corvid family - Crows and Ravens.

If there are any titles that you would like to get for your family, you can contact Canterbury Book Store in Escanaba, MI by phone, email or Facebook (contact info will be given in the comments).

We look forward to sharing more of these with you over the coming days/weeks. Meanwhile, stay home and stay safe.",0.0,"Clear Lake Education Center

We are recommending patients go to www.osfhealthcare.org to utilize our chatbot Clare, a digital assistant capable of educating and triaging people who are concerned about COVID-19.

Additionally, community members can use OSF COVID Companion, which is a free text messaging tool that provides guidance about COVID-19. The text messaging program links users with critical recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. To subscribe, users can text OSF to 67634. People also have a third digital option, which is to call the triage line directly at (833) OSF-KNOW.

Please plan for delivery between 9:00am and noon. Staff members will be assisting drivers and running food to the doors for drop-off. This will be a three-day meal delivery and will include lunch and breakfast options for each day for each child.

The next planned delivery will be Friday, March 20th during the same 9:00am-noon timeframe and will include meals for Friday and the upcoming week.

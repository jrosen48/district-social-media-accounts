• In-person learning for all students
• Hybrid learning with strict social distance and capacity limits
• Distance learning only

We will miss you!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3193678787319840&id=111638015523948,,0.0,"At the end of this school year, Big Lake Schools will say goodbye to four longtime teachers who have dedicated more than a combined total of 133 years to educating our students. Mark Boeckman has worked 36 years in education and 33 years at Big Lake.

""I have enjoyed working with all of my colleagues over the years; I will miss the good times and conversations. It has been more than just a job to me. I have formed many lifelong friendships. Making connections with students not only as a teacher, but also as a coach, is something I will never forget. Memorable moments include when Chuck Heitz dressed as MC Hammer and lip synched and dance to Hammer Time during a pep fest, watching John Muir dress up like Roy Orbison and sing Pretty Woman, meeting my wife at a staff meeting, and being able to teach where my boys went to high school.""

Congratulations Mr. Boeckman! We will miss you!",2020-05-27 13:48:47,,

Online registration for summer programming is open now! Kids Club and Hive Time summer registration is also open. During the registration process, no payment will be taken, but your spot will be reserved by your credit card. Confirmation of your registration will show that your payment will be deducted 1 week before the class starts. Due to the uncertainty of how COVID-19 will affect the future of Community Education programming in our community, we have opted to delay mailing a printed catalog.

When we are ready to accept payment we will give notice via email, social media, and our website.

What steps are Big Lake Schools taking to ensure that my child is safe while using Zoom?

Answer: Teachers have the ability to block Zoom meeting participants' cameras, disable their Zoom chat capabilities, and boot participants from meetings altogether to help keep all students safe. Teachers treat student behavior within Zoom meetings the same way as a physical classroom setting, and will report any student misconduct to parents and administrators.

Zoom has enabled a ""Waiting Room"" feature where teachers will have the ability to admit students individually into the virtual classroom before class begins. This empowers teachers to have more control over their virtual classrooms.

If you have any questions or feedback on distance learning we encourage you to fill out our parent feedback form.

What are students supposed to do for elective classes like physical education, art, culinary, music, etc.?

Answer: Elective classes such as physical education, art, culinary, music, and others will follow the same format as our student's core classes like math, science, and english language arts. Each elective class has a page on the Student Portal (blstudent.org) where students are able to view their lessons and assignments.

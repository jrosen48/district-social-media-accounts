BSISD understands that all teachers and students look forward to the ""brain break"" often provided by the summer months. However, some of you have also requested some learning opportunities to keep your child engaged and prevent any loss of learning.

Texas Home Learning has provided the following at home learning activities (both online and printable) if any of you are looking for some free educational resources. https://texashomelearning.org/parent-home-situation

BSISD encourages you to spend a few minutes each day keeping your child's academic skills in top shape while also promoting free play, creativity, and enjoying typical summer activities.

Shout out to these fine young men! On Monday my granddaughter was burned at her house in Crowell, Tx and had to be care flighted to University Medical Center in Lubbock. Yesterday, members of the Big Spring baseball team visited and brought her a unicorn. I just wanted to let Big Spring know what a great group of young men you have representing your town on the baseball team. Big Spring, Texas is doing it right!! Best of luck this season, and the Steers just gained a life long fan!!",2020-03-06 18:25:31,,

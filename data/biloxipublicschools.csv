This year, due to COVID-19, she had a parade party rather than a large get together for her birthday and rather than receiving gifts, Adrienne asked that her friends and family bring donations for HSSM!

Adrienne raised $100 as well as over 65 pounds of pet food, dog and cat treats, pet toys, paper towels, blankets and pillows for our shelter pets!

Adrienne aspires to be a Vet when she grows up and is very passionate about helping cats and dogs. She has 3 cats of her own and they are all rescues. Keep up the GREAT WORK, Adrienneüëèüëè",2020-06-05 12:30:14,,

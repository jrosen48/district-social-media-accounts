As soon as the pandemic began, district administrators began exploring products that would sanitize classrooms, bathrooms, and other high traffic areas in an efficient manner. The BCSD has purchased 13 electrostatic sprayers that will be distributed throughout its buildings, as well as two larger backpack-electrostatic sprayers that can be used to disinfect larger areas, like cafeterias and gymnasiums, when necessary.

These electrostatic sprayers use positively charged ions that allow the disinfectant to adhere not only to the tops of hard surfaces like desks and counters, but also to the undersides of objects and on vertical surfaces. This allows for maximum exposure of the disinfectant.

Elaine was a fifth-grade program aide at Horace Mann. She said one of the highlights of her career was when her students would read the book 'Hatchet' by Gary Paulsen and she would gift each child a necklace with a 'hatchet' charm on it. She loved working with children and has been spending more time with her family in her retirement. Thank you for your dedicated service to the BCSD! #BPatriotProud,2020-06-18 15:08:40,,

With the return of students to face-to-face instruction, BISD has created a dashboard (“the Dashboard”) to provide BISD families information about active COVID-19 cases in the District. An “active case” is defined as an individual who has been in a school and test-confirmed to have COVID-19. Individuals who test positive are excluded from participation in any in-person/on-campus activity until the campus nurse verifies that the individual meets the return criteria set by state and local health authorities. Once the individual is cleared to return, they are no longer considered an active case and the case is removed from the Dashboard count.

This data will be updated weekly.

With the start of face-to-face instruction in BISD on Sept. 8, parents are encouraged to take and pick up their child(ren) at school each day. If parents are unable to transport their child(ren) to school, and they qualify for bus transportation, the District does provide bus transportation. However, BISD wants parents to understand that social distancing may NOT always be possible for those riding the bus. On routes where social distancing is not possible, there will be two students per seat in order to be able to run the bus routes.

Since social distancing will not always be possible, BISD will require ALL riders to wear a cloth or paper mask while on the bus; when possible, load the bus from back to front and unload the bus from front to back; and leave numerous windows open to help circulate clean air throughout the bus. These safety measures will be followed every day, along with regular cleaning of the bus, to help keep students and staff safe.

When a Touch of Class nomination is received, a certificate and a copy of the nomination will be sent to the honoree's supervisor. The supervisor will determine the appropriate time and place to recognize the employee and present them their certificate. In addition, random comments will be selected to be shared on the District's website, as well as in its community newsletter, Birdville ISD News, and the employee newsletter, Birdville Bulletin.

There are nearly 500 incoming freshman to Birdville High School and with our current situation it was not realistic to have a formal Fish Camp. Instead, this morning, some of the most kind and genuine leaders at Birdville High School embarked on a tremendous task. They are currently visiting the homes of EVERY 9th grader to personally welcome them to Birdville. ⠀
⠀
Along with a home visit, the 9th graders will be receiving their freshman shirt and a hand written letter (written by their junior and senior leaders) welcoming them to BHS and letting them know that they are not alone as they transition to high school. ⠀

Congrats, Fish Heads, on your selfless leadership as you help support your fellow classmates, school, and community. Way to soar, hawks! 🤩💚💛🦅⠀

Birdville ISD is proud of the diversity of the BISD family. The District has a rich history of recognizing and respecting our diversity. We believe that social injustice of any kind has no place in our classrooms or anywhere in our school district.

I am confident that BISD will continue to be a safe and inclusive environment for all students and staff when they return in the fall. We cannot remain silent, and we will stand against hate, intolerance, and racism.

BISD Celebrates Teachers May 4–8

“Teachers teach because they care. Teaching young people is what they do best. It requires long hours, patience, and care.”
—Horace Mann

Birdville ISD is celebrating Teacher Appreciation Week May 4–8. Though the school buildings are closed, teaching continues. In addition to reading, writing and arithmetic, we are teaching and learning about quarantines, social distancing, handwashing while singing the ABCs, masks, and so much more.
This week we want to say thank you, but because of COVID-19, we must do it from a distance this year.
BISD invites parents and students to share a message of appreciation for their child’s teacher(s) on social media using the hashtags #BISDteacherscan and #teacherscan.
With the District closed for the remainder of the school year, campuses are not able to accept and distribute gifts to teachers. However, if a family wishes to reach out to their child’s teacher(s) privately, they can email the teacher(s) directly.",,,0.0,"Teacher Appreciation 2020: How to Say Thank You from a Distance

Richland High School Robotics were invited to participate in the North Central Texas Aerial Robotics Showcase. Over 200 students from BISD attended along with students from several local districts. Tyler Payton coached our district representative in the superintendent's challenge. Team members Anthony Cooper, Freddy Serrato, Gillian Kotera, Jordan Ensminger, Alexandra Serrato, and Justin Shelly went head-to-head with Southwest High School in an exhibition match to demonstrate the drone competition. They performed well and completed the event in half the time of the other school. Other team members Kevin Dockery, Austin Dick, Sullivan Wall, and Cory Mercado worked the display table and fielded questions from students, educators, administrators, and people of industry. We are very proud of how all of our students worked together to make this event a success.A huge thank you to instructor Dana Harris for her fabulous leadership!

When a Touch of Class nomination is received, a certificate and a copy of the nomination will be sent to the honoree's supervisor. The supervisor will determine the appropriate time and place to recognize the employee and present them their certificate. In addition, random comments will be selected to be shared on the District's website, as well as in its community newsletter, Birdville ISD News, and the employee newsletter, Birdville Bulletin.

Held during the third full week of October each year, National School Bus Safety Week is an active and evolving public education program and an excellent way for parents, students, teachers, motorists, school bus operators, school administrators, and other interested parties to join forces and address the importance of school bus safety. Designed to promote school bus safety, school districts throughout the country observe National School Bus Safety Week.

2019 National School Bus Safety Week: October 21–25, 2019 and the theme is ""My School Bus, The Safest Form of Student Transportation!"" The theme of National School Bus Safety Week is derived from the Poster Contest the year before. The 2018 winning poster was drawn by Shivangi Ojha, an eighth-grade student at Belton ISD in Belton, TX.",2019-10-21 07:00:03,,

The Red Ribbon Campaign originated when drug traffickers in 1985 murdered DEA Federal Agent Enrique Camarena. The Red Ribbon became the symbol behind the nation's war against drugs. The Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse is proud to sponsor the Red Ribbon campaign in the state of Texas. The National Federation of Parents sponsors the national campaign.

Wearing and displaying the ribbons during this observance helped to present a unified and visible commitment to promote drug-free communities.

The theme for this year's Texas Campaign goes beyond the symbolism of the red ribbon and asked our families, friends and neighbors to support Send A Message. Stay Drug Free.™

The long-term goal and challenge is to develop a healthy, drug-free lifestyle as a community standard in our neighborhoods, in our state, and across our nation.

We regret to inform you that Healthy Schools, our flu shot provider, notified the District this week that they have discontinued the program. Birdville ISD, therefore, will not be able to offer the free flu vaccine clinics this fall.

Healthy Schools told the District that low turnout across the country in previous years, combined with lower than expected parental consents for this year’s upcoming flu vaccine clinics and the growing cost of running these clinics, has made the program unsustainable. Consequently, it has become impossible for Healthy Schools to continue the program in Texas this year and in the future.

It is recommended that parents reach out to their local health department or child’s pediatrician to inquire about an alternative cost-free flu vaccine or visit the CDC flu shot finder website to locate local flu vaccine providers.

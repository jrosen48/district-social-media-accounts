We wanted to provide an update this morning following our message last night. Know that we are developing plans to deliver a temporary, online alternative for students during this extended closure. We will communicate more about those plans by Monday evening.

In preparation for that work, our middle and high school buildings will be open from 12-3 p.m. and our elementary schools, BCS and Early Childhood Center will be open from 12-4 p.m. for students to pick up their belongings and any personal supplies, if needed.

Congratulations to Birmingham’s Robotics team, Automation Nation. They competed at the FIRST Robotics World Championship, held at Cobo Hall and Ford Field in Detroit, MI, April 25-27. The team was in the Carson Division, where they compiled a record of 8 wins against only 2 losses, propelling them to 6th place out of 68 teams. For the elimination rounds, they moved up one more spot and were the 5th place alliance captain. Birmingham’s alliance won their quarterfinal matchup, advancing to the division semi-finals, where they lost to the number one seeded alliance. The world championship featured over 400 high school teams and over 10,000 students, elementary grades through high school. The team is led by teachers Bernie Simms and Pat Hoover.

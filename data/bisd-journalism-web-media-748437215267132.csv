BUCKAROO football fans!

Today, season tickets go on sale to last years season ticket holders. They go on sale to the public next Wednesday, August 12th.

You can purchase them at BISD Administration Office. Monday-Friday 8am-4pm (closed from 12-1).

They are $30 each.

We ask that you keep in mind there are orders in place that we have to adhere to. DUE TO COVID, things may look and run different this year. Like the stores, we have to follow the rules put in front of us. We will try to run as normal as possible, but things WILL be different this year.

We hope that next year we can return to normal.

Senior Parents!

I will be taking pictures of your seniors today as they receive their diploma. Because of the circumstance, a lot of family will be distanced away from your seniors as they receive their diploma and I realize how frustrating that is that you wont get to snap an image of that moment. So, because of this, I am going to give everyone of the images I take today to all of you, free of charge. Once they are ready, I will share a link on my personal page with a pin number so that you may download them with full print release and print at your discretion. I will also ask the school to share this link so you might find it on their web and Facebook page. Our family wants to send our condolences to all of you on all of the monumental moments you and your seniors have lost this spring, we are heartbroken for you. We also want to extend our congratulations to your seniors on completion of this phase of their life. We are so proud for you! God bless you and keep you! Go change the world!!!

Buckaroo Seniors, Parents and Community Members:

Here is the most recent update to the graduation. TEA has provided us with some more guidance and clarification and I have included that in the video.

Health screener forms can be picked up in the HS foyer. They will also be emailed out to senior emails.

The Texas Department of Agriculture has once again changed their rules and are no longer allowing BISD to provide meals during weekends. Therefore, effective immediately, we will only be providing breakfast and lunch, Mondays through Fridays.

Also, effective Monday, April 6, 2020, BISD will reduce the number of feeding sites down to one location. We will serve meals out of the back of the High School Cafeteria. Please refer to the BISD website for the map - this is for DRIVE-THRU meals only. Our service hours will change to 11:00 AM-1:00 PM, Monday through Friday. We apologize for any difficulties this may create, but these changes are outside the control of BISD.

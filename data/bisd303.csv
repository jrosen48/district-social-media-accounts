The Spartonics 4915 robotics team was a highlight and influenced my choice of majors and even my career.

COMMENTS FROM COACH DREW KELLER: Ayver is a jack of all trades both on and off the pitch. A very physically strong and technically gifted player, he pushes the tempo of the game in an already fast league. Always a positive and supportive teammate, Ayver expects the most from himself and those around him.",0.0,"Head on over to the Bainbridge High School Facebook page to read all about the Spring Soccer Senior Spartans. #bisdconnected #bisd303

NAME: Sarah Spray

ROLE AT BISD: Accounting @ BHS

HOW ARE YOU STAYING CONNECTED? I'm using email, phone, text and FaceTime to connect with colleagues and family. Most of my family is far away so checking in regularly with each other has been comforting. We just set up Zoom to connect with our son who is up in the Yukon and doesn't have an iPhone. I'm looking forward to seeing him on my computer screen soon!!

IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE? I'm very grateful to be living in a community such as ours and feeling the love and support from our community. I'm in awe of school leaders and colleagues working so hard and successfully adjusting to make education work in such an uncertain time.

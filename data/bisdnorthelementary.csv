This six weeks we are working on the character trait of Fairness. Last week we discussed that treating people fairly does not always mean equally. Here is the definition we are using to help our students understand what it means to be fair.

Fairness -
1. Play by the Rules
2. Take turns and share
3. Be open-minded
4. Listen to perspectives other than your own
5. Don‚Äôt take advantage of others
6. Don‚Äôt blame others carelessly
7. Treat all people fairly

Please review this definition of being a good citizen with your child at home.

Thank you,

This week we wrapped up our character trait of citizenship. We finished by learning what makes a good citizen and discussing who the students think are good citizens. We found out that it is important to be a good citizen of our country, our state, our town, and our school.

Next 6 weeks, we will be learning the new character trait of Fairness.
Here is our definition of fairness.

Fairness:
Play by the Rules
Take turns and share
Be open-minded
Listen to perspectives other than your own
Don‚Äôt take advantage of others
Don‚Äôt blame others carelessly
Treat all people fairly

Please review the definition of Fairness with your child and discuss ways you as a family show fairness.

Thank you!

This week we have learned about what it means to be a good citizen. We discussed the importance of leaving things and people better than we found them. Our students learned that helping others and our community is a great way to become a good citizen.

Things you could do at home to extend this learning are:
1. Show your child examples of people being good citizens.
2. Get involved in a community project with your child.
3. Every time you go somewhere, make it a family plan to leave it better than you found it.

Thank you for all you do!

In this first week of our study on citizenship, we focused on respecting authority. The students learned what authority means and who authority figures are. Then went practiced real-life scenarios about respecting authority figures. Our students were not only taught that they should follow the rules and laws, but they should do it with a good attitude. You can further your child‚Äôs character learning by doing the following at home:
-Discussing who are authority figures in your household.
-Discussing who are authority figures in your life and how you handle authority as an adult.

Here is the definition of citizenship to review with your child:

Citizenship - Do your share to make your school and community better
Cooperate
Get involved in community affairs
Stay informed/vote
Be a good neighbor
Obey laws and rules
Respect authority
Protect the environment

This week we focused on setting a good example. Our students know that the world can be changed by the example they set. It is our hopes that all of our students are setting an example of responsibility and caring. You can help reinforce this at home by:

1. Explaining to your child what a good example would do?
2. Asking your child who looks up to them?
3. Telling your child who was a good example in your life.
4. Discussing who are good examples and who are not.

‚ÄúOur Children will become what we are: so be what you want them to be.‚Äù - author unknown

Thank you,

Dear Parents and Families:

Did you know? Reading just 20
minutes a day exposes your child to about 1.8 million words per year. Reading helps students develop a stronger vocabulary, and in addition, students who read for pleasure average higher grades in English, mathematics, science, and history!

Encourage your child to read books
for fun by attending our upcoming Scholastic Book Fair. Allow your child to choose the books they want to read! It‚Äôs a wonderful selection of engaging and affordable books for every reading level.

Mark your calendar!

Book Fair dates: December 10-14
Shopping hours: Daily 7:30 am to 8:00 am, 11:00-1:00, Thursday 3:30-7:00 pm

Special activities: Winter Poetry Night, December 13, 5:30-7:00

We look forward to seeing you and your family at our Book Fair! Remember, all purchases benefit our school. Thank you for supporting our readers!

Sincerely,

Jennifer Gillard

We have continued our topic of caring by discussing gratitude and how we show appreciation. Gratitude is something this world could use a lot more of. We also discussed forgiveness. Forgiving someone is a sign of kindness. I hope you will extend your child‚Äôs character education by doing some of the following at home:

1. Have your child show gratitude to others.
2. Have your child write a thank you card for someone.
3. Discuss how forgiveness makes you feel.

4. Have your child call a family member to tell them thank you for being a part of their lives.

Remember caring means to:
Be kind
Be compassionate (show you care)
Express Gratitude Forgive Others
Help People in Need

Thank you!

Each class will be participating in a service project for our community to show North Elementary cares about our community and the people in it. Please review the definition of caring with your child.
Caring- Be kind
Be compassionate (show you care)
Express Gratitude
Forgive Others
Help People in Need

Also, take time to discuss ways you and others are caring and recognize your child when you see him/her caring for others.

Other things to do with your child:
Ask what would it be like if people did not care for each other?
Have your child tell you ways they can show they care for others.

Thank you for all of your support!

Be compassionate (show you care)
Express Gratitude
Forgive Others
Help People in Need

Also, take time to discuss ways you and others are caring and recognize your child when you see him/her caring for others.

Other things to do with your child:
Ask what would it be like if people did not care for each other?
Have your child tell you ways they can show they care for others.

Thank you for all of your support!

We have continued our discussions and learning of the character trait respect. We have talked about how to treat others with respect and how to treat ourselves with respect. We have discussed that one way of showing respect is by using good manners.
At home, please:
1. Have your child practice good manners.
2. Role play scenarios and have your child try to use the appropriate manners for the situation. Ex: What to say when you meet someone new? What are good manners at the dinner table? How do you ask for help?
3. Discuss why good manners are important in the home, in the workplace, and at other events you attend.
Review what respect means with your child:
1. Treat other with respect - Follow the Golden Rule (treat others the way you want to be treated)
2. Be tolerant and accepting of differences
3. Use good manners
4. Don‚Äôt use bad language
5. Never threaten, hit or hurt anyone
6. Be considerate of the feelings of others
7. Deal peacefully with anger, insults, and disagreements

This was our last week to discuss the importance of trustworthiness. I hope you and your child have enjoyed the activities. But most of all I hope your child has learned the value in being trustworthy! Next week will begin our 2nd 6 weeks of school. During this 6 weeks, we will work on the character trait respect. Please help your child get a head start on next week's learning by reviewing the definition of respect with him/her.
Respect:
1. Treat others with respect - Follow the Golden Rule (treat others the way you want to be treated)
2. Be tolerant and accepting of differences
3. Use good manners
4. Don‚Äôt use bad language
5. Never threaten, hit or hurt anyone
6. Be considerate of the feelings of others
7. Deal peacefully with anger, insults, and disagreements

Have a marvelous weekend!

This week we have learned about being reliable, telling the truth, and doing the right thing. We also discussed to always gain permission before borrowing things because if you do not it is considered stealing. Your child is developing character through in-class discussions and activities. You can help your child continue their character education by doing some of the following activities at home:
Make sure your child always asks before they borrow things.
Tell your child of a time when someone borrowed something of yours without permission.

Trustworthy - Be honest (don‚Äôt deceive, cheat or steal)
Be reliable (do what you say you‚Äôll do)
Have the courage to do the right thing
Build a good reputation
Be loyal (stand by your family, friends, and
country)

This week we discussed that keeping your word is part of being a trustworthy person. Our students learned that trust is like an eraser, it gets smaller with each mistake. We discussed all the things you need for a friendship and discovered that friendships must have trust. Your student also wrote a letter to someone who they think is very trustworthy.

To extend this learning at home you can do the following:
1. Discuss a time when you lost trust in someone. Did they ever gain your trust back? How long did it take?
2. Draw together the images that come to mind when you think of the word trustworthy.
Trustworthy - Be honest (don‚Äôt deceive, cheat or steal)
Be reliable (do what you say you‚Äôll do)
Have the courage to do the right thing
Build a good reputation

This week we discussed loyalty as part of trustworthiness. We discussed staying loyal even when our teams are losing or when there are hardships. We taught our students that loyalty means being faithful and reliable.

To extend this learning at home you can do the following:
1. Discuss who and what you are loyal to and why?
2. Draw together the images that come to mind when you think of the word loyalty.
3. Discuss how being a loyal friend, family member, and citizen are part of being a trustworthy person.

Trustworthy - Be honest (don‚Äôt deceive, cheat or steal)
Be reliable (do what you say you‚Äôll do)
Have the courage to do the right thing
Build a good reputation
Be loyal (stand by your family, friends, and
country)

Thank you for all you do!

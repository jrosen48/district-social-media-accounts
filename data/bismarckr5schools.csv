3. Materials - Essential materials posted in the resources website will be covered in class again once school resumes.

Players need to have a physical.

Players should bring clothes to practice inside and outside. If it is nice outside, we will be outside. If it is too cold or rainy, we will be inside somewhere. Please dress in layers for outside. Bring baseball equipment for practicing.

Practice is from 3:20-4:45 every day.",2020-02-27 18:27:09,,

Before testing they made predictions on what they thought each bridge would be able to hold and most of them predicted correctly based on the bridge designs.

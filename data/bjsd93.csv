BIGGGGGGG win tonight against skyline!! We beat them 5-1 at the complex tonight! First goal was scored by Ali assisted by Reagan. Skyline scored immediately after to tie the game back up. from there we scored 4 unanswered goals starting with Kenzie unassisted to take the lead again. Brooklyn scored unassisted. Kylie assisted by Faith, and Kylie scored the 5th goal of the game unassisted off a mishandle by the keeper. Jaz had 6 saves.

School is starting! Take notice of school zones in your route of travel and near where you live and work. Watch for speed limit changes, students on foot and on bicycle, cross walks, and those big yellow school busses with the flashing lights. We DO NOT want you to be involved in a crash where you, the occupants of your vehicle, or a student is hurt. Talk to your children about walking and riding in the appropriate areas and using the cross walks, especially where a crossing guard and/or a blinking light is installed. Wear your seatbelts, pay attention, slow down, and obey all traffic laws. We hope you travel safe wherever you are!",6.0,"Bonneville County Sheriff's Office

The plant takes about 7,000 cubic feet per second or more than 52,000 gallons of water to generate close to 8 MW of power.

Ammon playgrounds are open. We thank Ammon based, Cleaner Cans & Surfaces - Power Washing Services for coming out yesterday afternoon to clean and sanitize all 8 Ammon city playgrounds. Playgrounds were cleaned using eco-friendly general purpose cleaner mixed with bleach and water. The water was applied at 200 degrees and rinsed with 2500 PSI. Obviously, this does not prevent COVID-19 from spreading from this point. Parents, please make decisions you are comfortable with and use good judgement. We encourage the community to continue social distancing, regular hand washing, and other protocols outlined by the CDC and local officials.",14.0,"City of Ammon

This is the song I wrote in memory of my mom after she passed unexpectedly in January, and until these singers sent in their videos, I had never heard this performed by voices.

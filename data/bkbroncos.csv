Now we are planning for our return to school in August and what it will look like for students, staff, and families.

""After countless meetings, rewrites, days of filming and editing, our strictly five-minute short film ""We All Bleed"" made it to All-State for speech after earning straight ones at State. This is only the second year doing short film at BK, yet we beat out 30 other films at State to reach All-State. The purpose of a short film is to either entertain or share a message, which we have done through spreading awareness about teenage domestic abuse.""

Cesar Duran is a Belmond-Klemme High School Healthcare Career Exploration student. For one class period a day, he joined our staff to explore career opportunities available in the hospital setting.

Beginning in September, Cesar was able to interact with the following departments: family medicine, specialty services, respiratory therapy, cardiac rehab, lab, radiology, pharmacy, ambulance, emergency, and nursing. We enjoyed the opportunity to showcase opportunities for careers at ISH.

Cesar is shown receiving a certificate of completion for fulfilling the entire semester with us in good standing. We look forward to having future students!

As a side note, we would like to also offer our congrats to Cesar who just earned his nursing assistant certification, and we wish him well in his future!",0.0,"Congrats Cesar! School to community partnership is amazing at Belmond Klemme!

Rachel Roberts is this week’s BHS Speaker of the Week. Rachel is the only senior on the team and one who has committed herself to it since she joined in 7th grade. A versatile performer, Rachel has tried her hand at a variety of competitive speaking categories, beginning with Extemporaneous Reading, then moving on to Prose and Drama, to a year in Discussion, and now—in her senior year, double entering in the categories of Humor and Duo Interpretation with partner, Kaydre Gullette. Rachel is a consistent performer and a natural leader who has brought this year’s team together with a family atmosphere that she has fostered as team captain.

With a lack of height on the team, the consistency of his toughness inside is huge for us. Ethan is a warrior, plain and simple.”
Freshman Sadie Stroeing plays both JV and varsity for the Drakes basketball team and Drakes head coach Dan Hangaard said that she does an excellent job contributing to both teams. “She is really good at knowing both teams schemes and has been a big part of our varsity success,” said Hangaard. “Sadie is a great rebounder and can score on anyone in the paint.

Basketball players Ethan Merrill and Sadie Stroeing have been named Athletes of the Week for Blackduck High School sports this week. Ethan Merrill is a BHS junior who is a forward on the Drakes basketball team. “Ethan has been a great leader, taking younger players under his wing to help them develop,” said Drakes head coach Pete Ofstedal. “His positive attitude and coachability is an example to all. With a lack of height on the team, the consistency of his toughness inside is huge for us. Ethan is a warrior, plain and simple.”
Freshman Sadie Stroeing plays both JV and varsity for the Drakes basketball team and Drakes head coach Dan Hangaard said that she does an excellent job contributing to both teams. “She is really good at knowing both teams schemes and has been a big part of our varsity success,” said Hangaard. “Sadie is a great rebounder and can score on anyone in the paint. She can also handle the ball when needed. We are very excited for Sadie’s future in basketball!”",2020-02-14 15:18:33,,

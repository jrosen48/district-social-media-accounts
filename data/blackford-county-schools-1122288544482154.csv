However, I noticed that the Blackford Band was underrepresented in quality merchandise. Early on, I wanted to give our students and community a chance to represent the program that they work so hard for. This is less about being a fundraiser and more about giving our students and supporters options to show off their support for the band.

BJSHS will be moving forward with its planned July 12th Graduation ceremony. There will be two sessions and students will be assigned to the sessions according to alphabetical order. Administration believes the two-session approach will help with social distancing and provide an opportunity to clean between the two ceremonies.
Session one will start at 1 p.m. and will include all students that have last names A through L. The second session will start at 3 p.m. and include students M through Z. While face masks are not required to be utilized, they are highly recommended.
The gym will open 30 mins prior to the ceremony and tickets will be required for entry. The ten tickets that are available for each student to distribute will be handed out during the practice sessions which will be held on Friday, July 10th. The 10 a.m. practice session will be for last names A-L and students M-Z will practice at 11 a.m.

BJSHS will be moving forward with its planned July 12th Graduation ceremony. There will be two sessions and students will be assigned to the sessions according to alphabetical order. Administration believes the two-session approach will help with social distancing and provide an opportunity to clean between the two ceremonies.
Session one will start at 1 p.m. and will include all students that have last names A through L. The second session will start at 3 p.m. and include students M through Z. While face masks are not required to be utilized, they are highly recommended.
The gym will open 30 mins prior to the ceremony and tickets will be required for entry. The ten tickets that are available for each student to distribute will be handed out during the practice sessions which will be held on Friday, July 10th. The 10 a.m. practice session will be for last names A-L and students M-Z will practice at 11 a.m.

Dear Parents and Staff,

The Indiana Department of Education (IDOE) has partnered with Panorama Education to provide school districts in Indiana the opportunity to collect valuable data as we plan for the 2020-2021 school year. Two of those opportunities are (1) Parent/Caregiver Needs Survey and (2) Staff Distance Learning and Well-Being Survey. These surveys are voluntary, anonymous, and only provide district level data. The surveys do not provide building level data, but will provide data based on grade levels. Your honest responses to these surveys will help Blackford Community Schools plan and prepare for the 2020-2021 school year.

You can access the surveys at the following link: http://bit.ly/idoeremotelearning

Again, these surveys are anonymous and voluntary, and we would greatly appreciate your participation.

Hello! I was hoping you could help me send out a Huge Thank You to all the BJSHS teachers for stopping by the house to wish Noah a Happy Birthday today. I’m not friends with most of them on Facebook and I’d just like them to know that it was very appreciated! We don’t have family that live nearby and would normally make the drive to go see them and have a party for him, but couldn’t do so with everything going on.

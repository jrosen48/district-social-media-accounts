We are looking for a few people to help us out with chains on Friday nights and JH football games on Tuesday nights. There are only 3 regular season games for both teams. And the varsity does have a scrimmage this Saturday that we need a couple people to work.

Good news is you will see the games live as we will probably have very limited numbers of fans due to Covid.

If you are interested, please contact Tony Uggen, A.D. at tuggen@blackfordschools.org as soon as possible.

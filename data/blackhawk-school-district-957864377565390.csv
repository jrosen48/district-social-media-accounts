2.Any NEW reservations for pick-up meals should be made by 9 am. We have had such an overwhelming response that we need the extra time to make sure we are prepared for you.
3. Any NEW reservations for DELIVERED meals should be made by 4pm the day before. We need to allow the transportation company time to create the routes for the following day.
4. Meals can be picked up between 11 am and 12 pm. Deliveries will occur during this same time. But don't panic if the deliveries are running behind! There are over 100 meals being delivered!
Reservations can be made by calling (724)846-9600 or by emailing fleischmanc@bsd.k12.pa.us.

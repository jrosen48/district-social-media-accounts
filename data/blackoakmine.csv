Today’s El Dorado County Board of Education meeting is hosted at the GT School of Innovation - a New Tech Network school. Board trustees listen to high school representatives about event highlights and Black Oak Mine Unified School District Superintendent/Principal Jeremy Meyers who gave a comprehensive presentation about the many forward-thinking programs that are positively moving the needle for students. Trustees are also treated to a tour of classrooms where student ambassadors explain how they now absorb crucial lessons through hands-on, project-based learning. “It’s the difference between reading about a roller coaster and actually riding one!” Beautiful schools!",2019-04-02 16:22:55,,

Dear GSJSHS Families,
Please note the schedule change for next week, Thursday March 14 and Friday March 15. Both will be full school days. School will be dismissed Thursday at 2:40 and Friday at 1:50.
This change is a response to the snow and power outage days we have experienced so far this year and to avoid any change to the final day of school.
Additional schedule changes are also planned:
• Former “snow days” will now be regular school attendance days:
o May 3 – regular schedule
o May 24 – regular schedule
• Finals week schedule will be revised. Minimum days will become full days. This schedule will be provided at a later date.

I wish to express my gratitude to the good people on The Divide. Rob and I left two and a half years ago and moved to Paradise. Of course two months ago that has all changed. The sudden loss of home and community has resulted in a grieving process that continues to this day. That being said, the loving gestures of friends and strangers alike has been a healing balm to our hearts and souls. Thank you Divide people for your generous, thoughtful outreach to Paradise and to us personally. Special mention to the yoga community led by Traci Williamson Preble and Lynette Baugh Masztakowski, Jill at Cool Massage, the sweet women at Drug Free Divide, the kind souls from Black Oak Mine School District, the Calvary Chapel Georgetown Shawl Ministry, and the countless individuals- you know who you are. Please know that your words of love and encouragement and the thoughtful gifts are indelibly inscribed in our hearts and souls.

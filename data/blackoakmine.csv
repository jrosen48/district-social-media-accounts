I wish to express my gratitude to the good people on The Divide. Rob and I left two and a half years ago and moved to Paradise. Of course two months ago that has all changed. The sudden loss of home and community has resulted in a grieving process that continues to this day. That being said, the loving gestures of friends and strangers alike has been a healing balm to our hearts and souls. Thank you Divide people for your generous, thoughtful outreach to Paradise and to us personally. Special mention to the yoga community led by Traci Williamson Preble and Lynette Baugh Masztakowski, Jill at Cool Massage, the sweet women at Drug Free Divide, the kind souls from Black Oak Mine School District, the Calvary Chapel Georgetown Shawl Ministry, and the countless individuals- you know who you are.

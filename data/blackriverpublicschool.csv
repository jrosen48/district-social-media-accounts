A message from Chief Messer

“On behalf of the Holland Department of Public Safety, we want to thank the community for the peaceful protests in Holland this weekend. After what was witnessed in Grand Rapids and other parts of the nation, we feel very fortunate to be part of and serve a community that takes a non-violent stance against social injustice.

What happened to George Floyd was wrong and has no place in law enforcement.

The Holland Department of Public Safety does not tolerate police brutality in any form. We will continue to build on the foundation of decades of community involvement and building trust through community policing efforts. We look forward to deepening our involvement and relationships with our partners throughout the community.”",5.0,"Officer Nicole Hamberg asked us to share this important post with all Black River families and staff.

Today's student spotlight is on Lauren Cooper, Class of 2020. Lauren contacted history teacher, Jake Stid two weeks ago to let him know that she was making masks for members of the medical community in our area during this time. She knew Mr. Stid's parents were doctors and wanted to know if their office would accept masks that she had made. After ironing out some logistics South Washington Family Medicine now has 30 PPE masks because of Lauren's awesome project. Below is a picture of some of the staff. Pictured on the left is named Sydney Knapp, mom of two daughters that are fellow River Rats in the 6th grade and Kindergarten.

Hello BR families,

We wanted to take a moment to officially introduce Officer Nicole Hamberg from the Holland Police Department. Nicole is a Black River parent and also works with the school however she can. While she is not employed by Black River, we are so happy to know that Officer Hamberg has more flexibility in her schedule to spend more time with us here. Because of this, she is making a point to be on campus as much as she can when kids are dropped off and picked up, both to offer any assistance she can but more to show our kids how positive police can be in our everyday life.

Besides drop off and pick up times, Officer Hamberg will likely spend time with our students reading to elementary classes and also offering her expertise during our CAP classes to our older kids.

We have known Nicole for a long time and we are excited that she can spend even more time here at Black River!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2942355262458357&id=174666315893946,,0.0,"A Note from Mr. Shannon Brunink, Head of School

Officially a week away, Blackwater PTO is having a Dinner and Live Auction July 25th in place of our Annual Spring Carnival, which is our main and most important fundraising event, we had canceled due to covid-19. We are offering Drive-Thru services at the Kitchen door in the back of the school for those whom still would like to avoid crowds. We would love your support as this fundraiser will not only help by school supplies such as scissors, notebooks, hand sanitizer, pencils, and many of the other things that make leaning more productive in the classroom, it also helps fund incentives and field trips throughout the school year. Hopefully, this year will be as normal as possible. As always we are very thankful for any and all your support either by volunteering your time, buying a meal, donating auction items, or placing a bid on any of our fantastic auction items.

Students didn’t get the chance to participate in their traditional Leadership Development Events this spring. Our District and State Association decided to formulate digital completions for students. Students were allowed to submit written materials electronically and then provide videos of their speeches, presentations, or interviews. Two individuals and one group decided to participate in the 2020 LDE competitions.

Caroline Herigon competed in Advanced Prepared Public Speaking and placed 2nd out of 15 contestants. Her manuscript and video will now be sent to state to compete.

The Agricultural Issues Forum Team of Maggie Davenport, Sydney Joy, Lilli Hendrix, Payton Luscombe, and Aidan Meyer placed 1st in Districts and their portfolio and video will know be sent for state judging.

Gracie Imhoff competed in Employment Skills and placed 8th out of 11 contestants.

We are so proud of these students and can’t wait to see how they do in at State competition!!

“The Little Red Hen”. This is a three video lesson. Story and then two videos with 3 letter words. For this activity I would have magnet lowercase letters on the board with the boxes. The students would name the characters and I would place pictures to go with. We would take turns finding the letter for the sound and place it in the box. I miss getting to see their little brains work and the excitement when they could pick the letter. I would follow up with the little book for them to fill in and take home to read to mom and dad!!!",0.0,"Jenni Henks Harvey is with Tanya Brown.

Please don’t make your kids sit at the kitchen table and do worksheets all day because that is NOT what they are doing all day at school. Take this time to develop social and emotional skills. Here is a great list of activities to do with your children. So many of these activities are beneficial for physical, social, and cognitive development!

Please know that we are continuing to assess our current situation with regards to school closure and COVID-19. Thanks to all parents who so quickly responded on the question of Internet access at home. We are keeping the survey results in mind as we move forward.

School will be in session tomorrow, Tuesday, March 17, 2020. We, like most other districts, are making these decisions on a day-to-day basis. I will post decisions on this page, as well as through Remind, when they are made.

These are unprecedented times that we are facing. Thank you for your understanding and patience and know that I am making the best decisions I can with the information given. If you prefer that your child stay home to minimize exposure, please communicate that with me. These absences will not count against attendance. Students will be expected to complete homework and may be picked up at the end of the school day.

As always, please don’t hesitate to contact me with questions.

Please know that we are continuing to assess our current situation with regards to school closure and COVID-19. Thanks to all parents who so quickly responded on the question of Internet access at home. We are keeping the survey results in mind as we move forward.

School will be in session tomorrow, Tuesday, March 17, 2020. We, like most other districts, are making these decisions on a day-to-day basis. I will post decisions on this page, as well as through Remind, when they are made.

These are unprecedented times that we are facing. Thank you for your understanding and patience and know that I am making the best decisions I can with the information given. If you prefer that your child stay home to minimize exposure, please communicate that with me. These absences will not count against attendance. Students will be expected to complete homework and may be picked up at the end of the school day.

As always, please don’t hesitate to contact me with questions.

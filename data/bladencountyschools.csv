Based on current weather patterns from the national weather service showing the possibility of an inch of snow falling late in the afternoon on Thursday we will have a one-hour early release for all schools on Thursday. This will allow time for buses to safely transport students home before the weather conditions deteriorate.

We expect that road conditions will be impacted overnight Thursday and early Friday morning. As a result, we will have a two-hour delay on Friday morning for students and staff.

Should conditions become worse than expected we will provide additional updates through the all-call phone system, local news media, and social media channels. Please continue to monitor the news for updates.

Congratulations to Mr. Steve Ray, Custodian at South Elementary School, for being recognized as the Blair Lions Club and Blair Community Schools Staff Member of the Week.

""You won’t find a better custodian than Steve. He takes such pride in the cleanliness and condition of our building. He is always there to help in any capacity we or the students are in need of. He’s our “go to guy” who fixes anything from jammed lockers to broken zippers. And always with a smile. We can rely on him to help us in more ways than I can count. He is kind and cares for everyone in our building. He deserves to be recognized for over 30 years of dedication to the staff and students of South school!!""

Four classrooms came out into the hallway to honor Mr. Ray. He is obviously well loved by both students and peers! Boomer 973 helped present this week's Blair Lions Club Staff Member of the Week.

Congratulations to Mrs. Ashley Miskowiec, Kindergarten Teacher at Deerfield Elementary, for being recognized as the Blair Lions Club and Blair Community Schools Staff Member of the Week.

""Mrs. M goes above and beyond academics in her room. She looks at the students holistically and teaches them how to be little people. She is compassionate, patient, and truly interested in what is best for her students. She is a team player and uses school resources to help students learn. She has excellent communication with her students’ families. She is one of the best teachers I have encountered in my 10 years having students in BCS. My son has been blessed to have her on his team.""

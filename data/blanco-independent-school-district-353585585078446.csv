Welcome back from the holidays and unfortunately, back to flu and cold season. We have had several confirmed flu cases on each of our 3 campuses. Rest assured that our campus custodians are hard at work disinfecting common touchpoints such as doors, faucet handles, light switches, and computer keyboards at school.

The Blanco Police Department recently partnered with the local Dollar General in Blanco to make several local children's Christmas a little brighter. The Dollar General placed a contribution box in their store for their generous customers to donate items. The box containing several items were given to the Police Department and they were distributed last week to students in the Blanco ISD. The SRO Officer Steve Harris is seen in the photo reading to students after distributing several books that were donated.

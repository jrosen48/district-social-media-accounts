It is with great excitement and pride we get to introduce our newest videographer and editor (part time, cause he is an amazing FULL TIME Youth Minister at The Way Bible Church) Korey Hankins. He killed it in his debut project filming his Alma Mater’s basketball team. Great work Korey and thanks for easing my load.

Our brothers to the east suited up Tuesday evening to face the Bland Tigers in the first round of the playoffs. Unfortunately Como-Pickton came up short but, not for lack of effort and hustle. Congrats to the Como-Pickton Eagles on a great season!

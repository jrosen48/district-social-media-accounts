Why not buy a blanket in July?!?🤣
The Bloomfield Football team is selling Bees blankets in anticipation of the upcoming season! Would also make a great gift for all past and present Bees fans! 💙

I have to have a minimum of 50 blankets for the first order, and then increments of 10 after that. They can take 4-6 weeks, so I wanted to get them ordered before the fall weather starts to turn cooler. If you are interested in ordering, please message or text me. (402) 651-5093

The two-sided blankets are 60”x80” and will be $50 each. I will be placing the order on Monday August 3rd. Payment will be due before order is placed. You can drop money off to Matt or I, or mail....307 S Broadway St. Please make check out to Bloomfield Football. Also, let us know if it will be a gift so we don’t spoil the surprise. If you have any questions, feel free to send me a message. Thanks for your support!",0.0,"Bridget Schmeckpeper Kuchar is with Matt Kuchar.

Debi Kauth Freeman had a great idea for Senior Banners. I talked with a few places and found a place I can get banners made and Jeannoutot Plumbing would donate them to honor our Senior class!

Although we are still hopeful that at some point there will be a ceremony we would be honored to help the BHS Senior class feel a little more special on their graduation!

During this quarantine, it is a great time to talk to your kids about safe driving. Explain the importance of wearing seat belts, driving focused, and respecting the laws. After doing this, please sign the teen/ parent agreement. Feel free to email a picture of you doing so to Mrs. Risor so we can upload to our school Facebook page. Her email is rrisor@blfdbees.org. This will help our Teens in the Driver's Seat program receive points and rewards so we can keep promoting safe driving in our school. I have attached the link below.

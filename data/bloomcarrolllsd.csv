Sending an ill child to school who ends up testing positive for COVID-19 will result in students and staff being quarantined by the health department and the likelihood of athletic/co-curricular events being suspended during the quarantine period.

If we do not have teachers and staff available due to quarantines then it is very likely we will be forced to close our schools.

Our District is doing everything we can to stay open; however, it will be extremely difficult if parents do not partner with us and send ill students to school or back to school too soon.

What are Blizzard Bags?
Blizzard Bags are pre-designed lessons and activities that allow students to work from home in the case of a school closing.

State law allows school districts to use calamity make-up assignments/Blizzard Bags for up to the equivalent number of hours for three school days. The school hours missed do not count against the total number of hours required by law when make-up assignments/Blizzard Bags are utilized.

Students will be assigned Blizzard Bags on the 3rd, 5th, and 8th calamity day of the 2019-2020 school year.

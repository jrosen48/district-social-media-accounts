Bloomingdale School District 13 is a unique and special school district in many ways. One of the most identifiable ways is by the District’s employment of paraprofessionals. Combining all three buildings, 48 paraprofessionals serve Bloomingdale students; 32 as general education parapros and 16 as special education parapros. More than just “teacher aides”, Bloomingdale School District 13 paraprofessionals are, in most cases, certified teachers. These highly trained individuals support instruction daily and are able to lead classrooms in the absence of the assigned teacher. Last year, the District instructed 1,377 students in all three buildings combined. That means that the ratio of students to paraprofessionals in District 13 was 28.7 to 1.

Si continuamos siguiendo la guía de salud pública, menos de nuestros amigos y familiares se verán afectados por COVID-19. #StayHomeTexas",2020-04-08 16:05:10,https://video-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/92834267_2927671853922647_2442170034307465216_n.mp4?_nc_cat=109&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=9zIm3UY3qO8AX8vfdR5&_nc_ht=video-atl3-1.xx&oh=bd56f29534bda615ae1311900883fbeb&oe=5F6369AA,

Due to school closures, I will be offering free art lessons on our Facebook page each weekday until our kiddos return to school. These will be family oriented for a range of ages and utilize supplies typically found in your home.

Creativity can ease stress, expedite learning & allow us to see circumstances in different ways. Since we will all be home gathered together over the next few weeks unexpectedly, it is the perfect time to discover and grow new talent! We will be offering take home kits from the studio for additional lessons beginning next Wednesday.
I always pull from my classical training as a BFA studio art major and 25 years as a professional artist, but also love to introduce process learning- In other words- I like to show you how to do it AND get messy!

Join us at 1pm CT this Monday for our first lesson!
Hint: For Monday, gather plain paper, a baking sheet, cooking spray/oil and pencils...we will be drawing faces!",10.0,"Free live online art classes every day.

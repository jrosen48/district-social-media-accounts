In that timespan, I think we are all a little more cognizant of teachers and the many hats they wear. Teachers as well as our other service providers have gone above and beyond expectations to try and get our students to continue with their learning. From printing off packets to Zoom meetings to late night phone calls and messages from students. They converted their teaching on a whim and couldn’t have done it without the help of many different people. The amount of people that have gone above and beyond during this time to help kids learn is immeasurable. If you have helped a student during this time, you are part of the Bobcat family.

At Blue Hill we have 37 teachers and 1 Big Extended Bobcat Family.

37 Teachers + 1 Bobcat Family = 38 Strong

We did not get through these 38 days without all of us.

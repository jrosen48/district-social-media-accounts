I hope that all of you are staying safe and healthy. I met with school personnel to discuss our options for Prom. Since it is impossible to social distance at a dance and it would involve more than 50 people, we are unable to have a safe Prom. This makes me very sad for the kids. However, we are still planning on having a virtual coronation. Everyone on court will submit a video introducing themselves, who their parents are, and what town they are from. I will put all of the videos together and announce the King and Queen at the end. We will crown the new King and Queen at a scheduled time later to take pictures. We will post these pictures on the district FaceBook page. Mr. Kramer will upload the video to our school YouTube channel on July 25 @ 5:00. Students who are on court will be receiving more details in a separate email.

UPDATE: the roads are now reopened

Due to potential further flooding, the following areas have been closed to through traffic:

1. The intersection of John and High St to the north to Allen St and East to Williams St
2. Williams Street between High and Allen Streets.

As you can see on this video, the viaduct is at its max capacity and we may have more rain. So we are closing this area for safety as well as Williams St which is under water. Thank you for your patience!",10.0,"City of Farmer City

The City attended a very informative small business assistance teleconference with Congressman Rodney Davis held this morning. The Small Business Administration is offering federal disaster loans to small businesses to get through this difficult economic disaster due to COVID-19.

These loans can be used to pay debts, payroll and other bills. The Interest rates are 3.75% for small businesses and 2.75% for non-profits and can be for up to 30 years and $2 million.

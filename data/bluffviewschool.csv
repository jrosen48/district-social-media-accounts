Here is the framework of our plan for this offering of Child Care.

The hours are 7 am to 6 pm. We start tomorrow, the 18th.

Staff will be here at 7 to greet you, and help your student get on their way. This is a drop in format, and I believe all parties coming tomorrow have shared the general hours of need, so the drop off time is whatever individual families need it to be.

We have a detailed schedule, and will have inside and outside times, art times, PE like times with Mr El, story times with Ms Swogger, and many other things-it is a fluid plan as we get started tomorrow.

We will practice good handwashing, etc. We will work with ""social distancing"" in age appropriate ways.

The kids will be broken up into ages just like they are during the school day...groups of 10 or less including the 2 adults assigned to them.

Lunch can be brought by students, or provided by the school.

I believe that everyone that is eligible for this service is signed up at this point-if you are not sure, call the office in the morning or refer to previous emails.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2794318110656619&id=143255829096207,,0.0,"Greetings all,

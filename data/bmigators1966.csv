In addition to that, being specific rather than vague with promises increases the likelihood that they can be achieved.

For instance, if your child says “I promise to be nicer to my sister” you could ask them how they plan to do that. There are multiple ways that this task can be accomplished, of course, but if they’re able to say specifically how they will do it, then it becomes much easier.

That's why it's important we help grow kids that keep promises to become adults who stick to their commitments.

One way to do this is before committing to anything, ask yourself ""is this something I can really do?"" While it is important that your kids make goals that will stretch them, it is equally important that their goals and promises are realistic so that they can actually achieve them.

In a perfect world people would just always been kind. That's definitely a world we want to live in. However in a world that sometimes rewards or encourages selfishness we need to keep working at being kind each day. If you're looking for inspiration that can help you and your family practice kindness each day The Random Acts of Kindness Foundation have just the thing for you! You can download their Free Kindness Calendars for the rest of 2019 and all of 2020.

⁣⁣
Drug prevention starts at all ages. While teens are more likely to experiment with drugs than younger children, that doesn't mean the education should wait. Younger kids may confuse everyday activities they see adults and only kids do. For example they may confuse grandpa's blood pressure medicine bottle for the daily vitamins you give them each day. Additionally, some popular songs have a way of glamorizing drug use and it's important we teach our kids so that the world doesn't give them the wrong information. ⁣⁣

Avoid the chaos and stress of doing everything the weekend before by starting early (if you already haven't) to get your child's school supplies together.

Reading beyond Books?

Reading is about comprehension. It builds visualization, thinking and language abilities but it doesn't always have to be words on paper (although those are highly recommended). Audio books are a great addition to traditional reading. They help children build up aural comprehension while getting lost in the story they are hearing, similarly when you read to them. You can listen to them in the car, or turn off the TV and have the family listen to them together. Maybe try audio books for books they've already read. Does the story seem different this time around?

Additionally, if you discover that your child is having trouble with reading, he or she may have a learning disability. 80% of children with a learning disability have difficulty with basic reading and language.

Also, let your children read to you. For younger children, point out the relationship between words and sounds.

Another alternative is to create your own mini book club. Pick books you'd both enjoy reading, read them, and then discuss your thoughts. This is the way to develop habits of the mind and build capacity for thought and insight.

There's still a lot you can do to be good to your body while stuck indoors, stretching for example is a great way to keep the mind limber and relive stress.

Looking to take it up a notch how about giving yoga a try?

There are a lot of things that can help but one simple thing that often gets overlooked is remembering to celebrate the small victories.

The big wins are great, no doubt. But we should encourage our kids to also be happy with small gains while they work towards the grand victories. This helps keep kids motivated and continuously striving for better.

Did your child have a small victory recently? We want to celebrate with them, post it in the comments (no victories are too small to celebrate)!

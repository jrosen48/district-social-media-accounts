Please remember:
School campus will open at 7:35 am. Students are not to be on campus prior to this. Students will go directly to their classroom upon arrival. We will have plenty of staff around to help direct students.

Buses will run routes close to last year's routes. We will have a staff member on each bus to assign seats to family groups. If we are not able to social distance between family groups, we will have the students wear masks. We will have masks available to students on the bus. We have added an additional route to some of our town stops.

Please be patient in the parent pick up and drop off line for the next week or so! It takes a few more minutes during the first week of school while everyone gets the routine down!

Happy National School Counseling Week - Mrs. Mayo and Mr. McCoy are here to help you be resilient. One of our goals is to help you learn new skills to help you succeed. Facing your fears is one of those skills, and it’s one we have to practice, too. Determination, self-confidence, and bravery – all of which are characteristics of resilience – can be hard. But being brave, determined and self-confident starts with standing up to fear. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt once said, “We gain strength and courage by each experience in which we really stop to look fear in the face.”",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=986365421747142&id=264844710565887,,0.0,"Bloomfield Middle School Bulletin for Tuesday, February 04, 2020

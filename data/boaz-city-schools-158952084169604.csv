I love this!

Ranai Ortega is a freshman lineman at Boaz High School. A young man of modest means, Ranai’s mode of transportation has been his beloved bicycle. But when Ranai’s bike broke, he didn’t have a way home from practice.

Get this: Ranai’s teammates heard about his troubles and decided to pitch in their own money to buy a Ranai a new bike!
The players pooled their money, went shopping and picked out the bike themselves (just click on video below to watch)!

I’m so proud of the kids from Boaz!
During what has been a difficult time, these kids stepped up and gave from their hearts.
Be sure to give your best to Ranai, his teammates and coach Jeremy Sullivan.

IT IS NOT REQUIRED, but please feel free to let your child read and test on books as we are away from campuses. Your student should know his/her login and password already. If he/she does not, your child can click to recover password from the login screen. Again, this is an optional activity and not required, so please do not panic if your child cannot login.

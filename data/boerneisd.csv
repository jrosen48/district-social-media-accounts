The TEA guidelines, as well as the executive order from the Governor, state that outdoor graduations can be held in all counties in Texas starting on June 1st as long as certain safety guidelines are followed, which could include spaced seating, sanitizing stations, face mask requirements, and possible ticket limitations. Per the TEA, be advised, this permission is subject to change as underlying public health conditions change. We can now share the following information regarding Boerne ISD commencement ceremonies.

Graduation dates for Boerne ISD will be moved to June 4th (Boerne - Samuel V. Champion High School) and June 5th (Boerne High School). The ceremonies will still be held at Boerne ISD Stadium at 8pm.

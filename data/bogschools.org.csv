Louisiana is reopening the Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer (P-EBT) program for families who did not apply in May and June. Families of children who receive free or reduced-price school meals may be eligible to receive financial benefits for meals missed in 2019-2020 when schools closed due to the pandemic. Apply from September 8 at 8 a.m. to September 29 at 5 p.m. These one-time benefits total $285 per child of families who were eligible for free and reduced-price meals during the entire closure last spring. Parents who started receiving free and reduced-price school meals in May will receive $91.20 per eligible child. The online application is simple. The information submitted must exactly match the information on file with the school system in order for the application to successfully submit. #louisianabelieves

59 BHS 9-12th graders attended District Literary Rally at Southeastern Louisiana University today. Their teachers selected them as top students in their subject area to compete on tests where they were ranked according to their scores among other students from all over our district. BHS is proud to say eight students placed in their tested subject with three of those scoring in the top tier of testers. These students are now eligible to move on to state competition.

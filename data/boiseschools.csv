Brooke Linville of Boise did something extra special for the teachers at several local schools. She’s a mom, so she knows how tough things have been lately with all the school decisions being made.

“It’s been a long week for teachers and parents. Many people don’t agree with the decision that was made, and not everyone is kind about it. I wanted to be sure our teachers and staff knew they were appreciated around the district.

Today, I dropped off snacks and supplies to Whitney, Whittier, Garfield, and Grace Jordan on behalf of the Boise community. I wanted to be sure that the teachers know that they are supported as we head into a year of uncertainty and unknowns. “

Thank you, Brooke.

Kindness goes so far.

Dear Boise Schools Parents, Guardians and Staff,

In a statement made on July 23rd to our Board of Trustees, Central District Health indicated that we are currently in Category 3. Under those conditions, if school were to start today, our recommendation would be to have all students in a virtual space and not physically attending our schools.

Central District Health has also made it clear that no formal recommendation has been made for a reopening category based on our proposed start of school date of August 17th. CDH is developing metrics and will make a recommendation on August 3rd.

We understand that this is a very stressful situation. We will continue to work closely with Central District Health and area health professionals to ensure that we are making decisions based on the latest science and are in the best interests, safety and welfare of our students, staff and community.

Sincerely,

“The PBS Media Literacy Educator Certification provided me in-depth, essential lessons with opportunities to practice, expand, and strengthen my skills in creating and evaluating media. Most importantly, I now feel confident and prepared to teach students how to produce high quality media and to think critically when engaging with media. This is an outstanding professional development opportunity, and I recommend it for all teachers interested in deepening their media literacy skills.”

IDAHO'S CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION STATE PLAN APPROVED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

“This approval is the culmination of a year and half of outreach and consultation by Division staff with a wide-variety of stakeholders,” said Idaho Career and Technical Education (ICTE) Administrator Clay Long. “Idaho’s plan provides increased funds for rural and remote districts, reduces the number of waivers needed from districts, and the ability for districts to utilize funds in expanding program offerings, among many others. Perkins funded projects is one way Idaho CTE continues to focus expanding opportunities and access to secondary and postsecondary students across the state of Idaho. We have greatly appreciated the collaboration, input, and feedback we received as we prepared Idaho’s State Plan.”

The Food Services team, led by Christy Smith, has partnered with multiple local agencies to serve grab-and-go meals to students. The team even began using the lifts on handicapped school buses to more safely and quickly serve over 3,500 meals each day from 12 sites and routes.

These grade-level materials are designed to help your student maintain and develop their skills in core subjects.

With the help of the school's other counselors and the administrators, Showalter made Boise High's new ""Zen Den"" a reality! The Zen Den is a quiet space filled with peaceful music where students can color, play with a fidget toy or zen garden, even make a cup of tea and practice yoga! This is such a neat idea and a great opportunity for students to de-stress in a designated space! Boise School District Boise Brave Parents

We completely enjoyed partnering and collaborating with DTEC of Boise School District supporting the training of the workforce of tomorrow on OSHA safety.

More than a dozen students received their OSHA-10 cards at a short ceremony today - shown in these pictures with principal Jason Hutchison. The small ceremony was a one-of-a-kind event in Idaho.

Here's to many more training opportunities and ceremonies to come!

The Boise School District is dedicated to developing our younger generations into well-rounded, thoughtful individuals. We've launched multiple initiatives throughout our schools that instill life lessons, like the importance of empathy and kindness. An example of this are the ""buddy benches"" that live in the playgrounds of some of our elementary schools. These simple benches provide a place where students can sit if they're feeling lonely or overwhelmed and need a friend. Other kids keep an eye on the bench, sit down with that new friend, and ultimately develop a sense of camaraderie and kindness at a young age.

Have you heard about these benches or other initiatives in your child's school? Share your story in the comments!

“I am grateful every day that I get to spend such huge blocks of time with awesome kids who are kind, smart, and care about the world.

""I'll be going to Haiti in a few years to volunteer, and I'm really excited. I get to see how they live and what it's like compared to how we live. When I go, we'll be mostly moving rocks, like big rocks, from trucks. We'll get to spend a day at the beach. When my dad goes to Haiti, he comes home with videos of the kids. It's really cool to see because my dad has them say my name, my sister's name, and my little brother's name. It's really cool to hear how they say our names."" — Rohnan, 6th grader at White Pine Elementary #volunteering #volunteer #boise #boiseschools #idaho #everythingspossiblebsd #boiseschoolskind #boisekind",2019-11-02 03:29:30,,

In 2016, Rama Ramadhani came to Boise from Tanzania with his family. Knowing only his native language of Swahili, it was through soccer that he learned how to speak English.

During his junior year at Borah High School he was part of the junior varsity team where he scored 34 goals, earning him the Best Striker Award and a spot on the varsity team for his upcoming senior year.

Now as a senior, Rama plays forward on the Varsity Men’s Soccer team. Last week, he scored the game winning goal, beating Eagle High School 1-0, to claim Borah’s first district title in the program’s history.

“For me, it’s a dream to win district for my school in a place that I love,” Rama said excitedly. “Boise is my home now. I feel safe, I love living here and I enjoy playing soccer here.” #iamboise

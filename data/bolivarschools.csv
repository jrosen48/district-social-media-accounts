Rolling dates for graduation: We will have graduation on the earliest date that public health guidelines allow for us to gather. Also, the location will be at BHS in the main gym, with overflow to the auditorium.

If we are still not able to have a traditional graduation on any of these dates, we will defer to an alternative style ceremony on July 26th. The details for what that would be will depend on what public health guidelines will allow at that time. #GoLiberators #LiberatorStrong",12.0,"We are so proud of the class of 2020 and look forward to celebrating them!🎉 See the original post for information on our plans in regard to graduation.⬇️⬇️ #LiberatorStrong #GoLiberators

One of my seniors made this for her uplifting video project.

With her blessing, I have to share this because it perfectly represents a seniors view point.

It's painful right now and it's okay to mourn the circumstances. She's right though, they have so much more life to live. We should all remind ourselves that the sun will come up in the morning, and there is light at the end of the tunnel.

3. Starting at 8:00 am regular bus routes will be run, going to each bus stop and delivering daily meals to any student in Bolivar School District

The BHS Student Council is going ONLINE with the sales of the shirts this year! We have also added a couple of mask options. There are several garments!
The store closes on August 20th.

SOME extras will be ordered but not many - so, this gives you a month to ""SAVE UP AND SHOP""!! The items will take about 3-4 weeks to be delivered after the store closes. They will be delivered to BHS and then delivered to campuses (hopefully).

Here is the store link:

Mackenzie Person has been a member of the Lady Warrior Softball program the last four years. I have watched her grow as an athlete and a person. Mackenzie is the kid that defines the cliche of ""hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work"". She is a true ""Warrior"" created by her willingness to put in the time both on and off the field. She works year round to perfect her craft. Mackenzie works hard academically as well, showing that one must do well off the field as well as on. She is among the top in her class.

Every student that has signed up for athletics (NOT pre-athletics) will need to fill out their packets through this website. All incoming 7th graders and any transfer student MUST get a physical this school year. Anyone else who was in the district last year and does not have concerning answers on their medical history form, will not have to have one for the 20-21 school year.

We have attached the parent guide for dragonflymax.com, the online platform we are going to use for physical packets this year. This will keep us from having to mess with any guidelines on paper packets!

I am excited to announce that after reviewing the in-person, outdoor graduation ceremony guidance put out by the Texas Education Agency late this afternoon, we can appropriately honor our Class of 2020 graduates while keeping everyone safe. Bonham ISD will be able to hold an in-person, outdoor graduation ceremony for the 2020 graduates and their families!

In order to be in compliance with the guidelines, I know the graduation date will have to be pushed to June 1 or later and specific procedural guidelines will have to be followed.

Our goal within the next 2-3 days is to set the graduation date, finalize our specific procedures and disseminate that information to our 2020 Seniors and their families.

I have enjoyed the last four years of high school as much as anyone else. But to point out some favorites of mine would have to be with my sports. I was with the medical trainers for all four years. I loved going to football games and helping the players. I was involved in powerlifting for the last three years. Coach Dills helped me get to Regionals. To say I was excited is an understatement. I have been involved with FCA, Fellowship of Christian Athletes since 8th grade. Having prayer in the morning always lifted my spirits. I plan to join the Airforce after I graduate.

Athletic Trainer Appreciation Day! BHS wants to give a huge shout out to our own Athletic Trainer Coach Dayna Payne. She is at every home athletic event for high school and junior high AND teaches our health science classes, helps keep our athletes healthy, and leads a group of student trainers. Never complains and always willing to jump in and help us anytime she is asked. BHS has the BEST and we are glad she is part of our team. Thank You Coach Payne!",2020-03-25 21:34:08,,

Dear Warrior Family,
BISD Teachers are calling every student today to check-in with them and to ask a few questions and will be in contact with them throughout the week.
This will probably be from a number that you do not recognize. If you do not answer your child’s teacher will leave a voicemail message to call back.
If you have not received a call, please call Bonham’s Administration Office at 903-583-5526 to make sure that we have the correct number on file.

Thank you,
Bonham ISD Administration

What an unbelievable couple of days! I shared with my staff this morning how we are navigating uncharted territory. I emphasized that as long as every decision is made with the students in our hearts, we can't go wrong!

We made the decision to close this week to give us time. We didn't (and don't) think this week is all that is necessary to help 'flatten the curve' of COVID-19; rather we needed a few days to help make a more informed decision - and do it quickly enough to give you all a heads up that closure was coming. As closure announcements have begun around our state, you are beginning to see districts announce they are closing for 1, 2 - even 3 weeks. I don't know anything definitive at this time, except that there is a very real possibility that we have a long road ahead of us. I plan to make a decision about operations for at least the week of March 23-27 by the middle of this week in order that families can prepare.

Earlier this week, three of our board members and our Executive Director were delighted to accept a donation of $5,502 from Bonham ISD Superintendent Kelly Trompler. These funds were collected at the gates of the foootball and volleyball games during Homecoming week. The funds will be designated towards the center's new building fund.

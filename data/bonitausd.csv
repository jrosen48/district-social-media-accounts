Such a beautiful moment at Shull today. One of our second graders was surprised by her daddy. He has been deployed overseas since last Easter. Most staff was in tears watching their reunion. Truly one of the best moments and a true gift for us all. Such a wonderful lesson in what true sacrifice and service looks like.

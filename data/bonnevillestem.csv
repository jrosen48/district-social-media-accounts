Thank you to all the parents who came by the PTO table at drop off this week. We appreciate all our parent volunteers. I am sending out this google form for those who couldn't make it. Please consider signing up for at least one committee. Our first activities are approaching quickly and it would be great to start planning. Remember if you are wanting to help remotely we can still use you!

Our most urgent needs are:
Room Parents (I will try to remove teachers as I get volunteers so if you don't see your teacher that's why)
Book Fair
Teacher Appreciation
Fundraisers
STEM Fair

2020-2021 Bonneville Academy PTO Board Nominations",0.0,"From the PTO:

Parents we are still in need of 2-3 individuals to join our PTO board.

Never been involved in PTO before? That's ok! No experience required.
Wanting to continue social distancing practices and stay home? That's ok too! We have many committees and activities that can be set up and run from home.
What we are looking for are people who are willing to be involved, share ideas, oversee different committees, and make Bonneville Academy the best it can be.
Please consider filling out this form and joining the PTO board today!

This could be a family step challenge, creating an in-home circuit exercise routine, or setting a timer that would go off reminding everyone when it is time to stand, stretch, walk, climb a set of stairs, or even garden.

If everyone put a focus on their daily health goals, imagine how healthy our community would be. It is cool to be leading healthy lifestyle changes as a kid.

Alvin J. Fellows of New Haven, Connecticut made the lives of carpenters, electricians, seamstresses, and countless other tradesmen and craftsmen easier. On July 14, 1868, Fellows was granted a patent for “Improvements in Tape Measures” that created a whole new era for measurement. Enter the generation of retractable tape measures.

The first recorded use of the tape measure goes back to the Romans, utilizing marked strips of leather. Before Fellows’ patent, Englishman James Chesterman designed a steel measuring tape, but it was expensive for its time. At $17 in 1853, it was equivalent to $300 in today’s U.S. dollars. Chesterman’s big, bulky design didn’t fit in a pocket or even a toolbox. When Fellows’ patent came along, tape measures became the sliced bread of the toolbox.

FEEL GOOD POST: With so many students in Bonny Doon losing their homes in the fires, the teachers at Bonny Doon Elementary School decided to create a website of videos of teachers reading cherished picture books to their students. What an incredible effort to provide connection and some comfort to the students who don‚Äôt know when they will be going back to school. Because of your donations to Bookshop's KEEP KIDS READING Fire Relief Fundraiser, we were able to provide books to school staff for this project. Ultimately, we are working with school librarians to buy books for children who lost their homes and belongings in the fires. The more donations we receive, the more books we can supply.

It's not too late to join us for the Krause Center for Innovation Computer Science Crash Course. As a computer science teacher and instructor for the course it brings me great joy to see the possibilities unfold for teachers as they begin to understand that computer science is something that they can do and utilize in their practice for themselves and/or with their students. Throughout the week I have the amazing experience of seeing teachers create algorithms using flowcharts, understand problems solving, discover the excitement of playing with the micro:bit, and express the joy of coding a project in Scratch / Python. Please enjoy the glimpse into our workshop and we can't wait to share these feelings with more teachers from all over the country.

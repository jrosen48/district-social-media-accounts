Ms. Davis' biggest passion, she says, is inspiring passion in others. ""As a recent college graduate I have experience with numerous online learning tools that I look forward to utilizing in my classroom. I also just recently returned from teaching abroad in Thailand.

Madalynn Gregory is the artist of the month for April.

For the second semester, Portfolio students created a themed series. Their series consist of a cohesive body of work based on a central theme. Students created each piece with the same medium to maintain the cohesiveness of their series.

This painting is 1 of 3 in Madalynn's series, and is of a woman with cancer. The following is taken from Madalynn’s artist statement:

“My subject matter is women outside of the beauty standards. The women that I chose to paint are beautiful in their own way. These people do not fit the beauty standards of today’s world. I love supporting other women and I firmly believe that all women are beautiful. Each and every woman has some pretty amazing and beautiful qualities.”

If we were in our traditional classroom setting, the students in Ag Science II would've been in the shop learning how to mig weld and bend with the oxyfuel torch. They would've been using these skills to create their horseshoe project, well, we weren't able to do this. So students were challenged to create a project a home. It could'be been a mechanics project, craft project, baking, or whatever they wanted. Here are just a sampling of a few of the items including very good looking baked items, quilts, crocheted items, and various mechanics projects.

It is with great sadness, yet understanding during this difficult time, the closure of school for the remainder of the school year. Governor Parson, during his daily address, ordered all Missouri schools closed until the end of the school year.

While school buildings are closed, this does not mean that school is over for the year. We will continue to educate our students for the remainder of the originally scheduled school year through Alternative Instructional Methods.

As a District, we have many hurdles to work through in the next few weeks including honoring commencement, prom, and our staff and students. We will send communication early next week with additional information.

Good afternoon Boonville Music Department students and families,

We just received the following message from the Missouri State High School Activities Association:

“Due to concerns for the health and safety of our student performers, spectators, accompanists, directors, adjudicators, and staff, MSHSAA is suspending all district solo/small ensemble and state large group music festivals through March 21, 2020. Our office will continue to monitor the situation and determine how best to proceed with the festivals in the upcoming weeks.”

This decision impacts us because March 21 was the day for our District Solo/Small Ensemble at State Fair in Sedalia.

We will keep you informed as we are notified of any additional changes to upcoming festivals and concerts.

FBLA Goes To Denver
The third weekend of November, FBLA attended National Fall Leadership Conference in Denver, Colorado. Boonville took five students to the conference: Michael Browning, Clint Penny, Kyle Platt, Chris Weisner, and Amanda Mize. There were over 2,000 students in attendance, and Missouri had the largest attendance with over 500 attendees. The conference consisted of two keynote speakers and workshops. The workshops educated students on the steps to growing your own business, ethics, and how to increase membership in FBLA chapters at home.
The Denver trip may have been focused around the conference, but the group had many opportunities to explore the great city of Denver. From walking around the 16th Street mall to exploring Red Rocks Amphitheater, this trip is never to be forgotten. Senior Michael Browning quoted it as “a completely new experience.” This trip truly highlighted what city life is like. For some, it made them realize how much they wanted to move into a city. Others, however, realized that the midwest is their home.

FBLA Goes To Denver
The third weekend of November, FBLA attended National Fall Leadership Conference in Denver, Colorado. Boonville took five students to the conference: Michael Browning, Clint Penny, Kyle Platt, Chris Weisner, and Amanda Mize. There were over 2,000 students in attendance, and Missouri had the largest attendance with over 500 attendees. The conference consisted of two keynote speakers and workshops. The workshops educated students on the steps to growing your own business, ethics, and how to increase membership in FBLA chapters at home.
The Denver trip may have been focused around the conference, but the group had many opportunities to explore the great city of Denver. From walking around the 16th Street mall to exploring Red Rocks Amphitheater, this trip is never to be forgotten. Senior Michael Browning quoted it as “a completely new experience.” This trip truly highlighted what city life is like. For some, it made them realize how much they wanted to move into a city. Others, however, realized that the midwest is their home.

Thanks to some Jefferson City friends, I was able to find a WWII veteran and former POW to speak to all of my students at the high school today. Mr. Ralph Kalberloh held the full attention of almost 200 kids as he told his story. At the end, some of my students, who are also in Jr ROTC, presented Mr. Kalberloh with a Boonville Pirate hat to make him an “honorary Pirate” for the day.
Abowk Florist donated the Boonville Pirate Hat, Maggie’s Bar and Grill donated lunch for Mr. Kalberloh and his wife, and the Boonville Museum and Friends of Historic Boonville offered to host them for tours.
We are rounding out our WWII/Unbroken unit learning about empathy through the stories of real people. 💙

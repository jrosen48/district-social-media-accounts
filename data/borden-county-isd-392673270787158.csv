Colbin has always loved the farm. Some people think he has farming in his blood. Colbin has been helping his father on the family farm since he was able to see over the steering wheel. His future plans include attending Angelo State University and majoring in animal science. His ultimate dream is coming back to Borden County to be a farmer.

One highlight in his showing career was placing first at the State Fair of Texas with his Simmental steer Adam. He is an active member in FFA, and currently he is the Borden County FFA Vice-president. He participated in football and track during junior high.

The positive attitudes and ideas that I could hear from those sharing some great ideas just made me smile. (I hope they could see that behind my mask!) I know the decision to keep your kids at home or to send them in person is a hard one but the good news is either decision will be the right one because you are doing what your family needs to do. Either way, we will be ready to give your kids the best possible year! I will be sharing a more specific plan next week on what your child‚Äôs day will look like and you will also be hearing from the teachers.

Everyone was so great with the students and had so much patience answering all of their questions. My students have all become lifelong fans of these artist.

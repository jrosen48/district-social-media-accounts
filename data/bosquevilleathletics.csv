I want to thank our senior athletes for all they have given to Bosqueville. You will be missed. You have done a great job of leading by example. Thank you for your countless hours of work. Words can’t really express what we are all feeling at this time. Hopefully you have learned some life lessons along the way that will help you deal with this, and other hurdles you face down the road of life. Once again, thank you, and we love you.",2020-04-17 18:57:14,,

Our JH athletes, who had the gym set up for the meet in an hour and a half.
Our volunteer table workers who kept everything organized and moving along.
Our high school boys for being there to help spot and load the bars all day
The athletic booster club for running a great concession stand all day
And especially the coaching staff who spent all day working, and putting up with me when I get a little stressed and on edge.

Our meet is consistently one of the, if not the best meets in the state each year. This would not be possible without each and everyone chipping in to help.

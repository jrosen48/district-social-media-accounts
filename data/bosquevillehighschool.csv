Tomorrow we will honor Emmie’s heavenly birthday by wearing crazy socks. If you have socks to donate we will still be taking them.

On Saturday, from 2:00-4:00, we will have a packing celebration in the elementary cafeteria. We will pack individual pairs of socks and get them ready to distribute to different non-profit organizations. It’s a great event for kids to see how kindness can go a long way.

Friday will be our first pep rally! The theme will be tie dye. The pep rally will start at 2:50 and we will begin to load buses to go to the HS at 2:35. If you are picking your child up to take them to the pep rally you can pick them up at 2:35. If your child rides the bus to the pep rally then they must ride the bus back to school for dismissal. The football game is home this week. Elementary students must be accompanied by an adult. Please remind your children to stay off the track and do not play under the bleachers. The volleyball games are also at home and will start at 5:00. Come on out and support our Lady Bulldogs and Bulldogs!",0.0,"Bosqueville Elementary

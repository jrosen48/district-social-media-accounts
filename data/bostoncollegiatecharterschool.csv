These panels, called the Boston Employer Forum Series, will also feature insights from hiring directors in these industries.

The Boston Employer Forum Series, which is free and open to the public, will cover the following industries: Healthcare, Hospitality, Construction, Retail and IT/Tech.

Each of these panels will feature the latest sector-specific labor market data presented by Dr. Alicia Sasser Modestino, an Economist and Associate Professor at Northeastern University.

Here is a summary of our Blue Shirts Program for Seniors.

A team of 5 to 10 youth, (ages 14-18 years old) will provide yard work services at a seniors home. Youth will be supervised by a peer leader and the project will be overseen by my PM's. Seniors will not have contact with youth workers. Youth workers will not need to gain access to the interior of homes. We anticipate completing 1 yard per day. Our goal is 35-40 homes over the course of 8 weeks.

The program will start on July 6th. Let me know if you have additional questions.

Here is a summary of our Blue Shirts Program for Seniors.

A team of 5 to 10 youth, (ages 14-18 years old) will provide yard work services at a seniors home. Youth will be supervised by a peer leader and the project will be overseen by my PM's. Seniors will not have contact with youth workers. Youth workers will not need to gain access to the interior of homes. We anticipate completing 1 yard per day. Our goal is 35-40 homes over the course of 8 weeks.

The program will start on July 6th. Let me know if you have additional questions.

Thanks,

I hope this message finds you well. Each spring, our College Counseling team hosts an informational meeting for junior parents and guardians to talk through the college search and application process and the support our team plans to provide throughout that process. Although things look quite a bit different than usual at present, we would still like to host a meeting over Zoom. The meeting will be held the evening of Monday, May 18th at 6:30 pm. The presentation will also be filmed and a link shared after the fact, so if anyone is unable to attend, the content should still be accessible. In the meantime, if you have any questions you would like to ask or if there are any topics you hope to see covered, please feel free to reach out over email or phone prior to the meeting.

Today, at the Boston City Council Meeting, we recognized Sergeant Roman Colon Jr. for his quick and life saving response to a medical emergency. I am so thankful for his heroic act which happened right here at City Hall.

We also welcomed students from Boston Green Academy from #Brighton into the chamber for a meet and greet with a few of the Councilors. Love having students visit us!

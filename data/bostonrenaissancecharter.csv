150 Boston Renaissance Charter Public School scholars recently visited Gillette Stadium and the Patriots Hall of Fame to learn from a sports related STEM design challenge offered by the Patriot's education program. Scholars were challenged to think about and design football helmet safety features into models designed to simulate impacts. After analyzing helmet safety features, and using materials provided to build safety features into their model helmets (styrofoam bowls), students tested their designs by dropping croquet balls onto them from a height of 3 feet!

Afterward students were treated to a tour of the Patriots Hall of Fame Museum.

A very enterprising BRCPS scholar raised $2,917 with the help of her fellow elementary school students for charity using an idea she created on her own!

Inspired by the ""Dress Down"" Fridays at her sister's school, Tamil successfully gathered almost 200 student signatures on a petition which she presented to her Principal, asking her to implement a similar policy at BRCPS where students are allowed to wear clothes other than their uniform on half day Fridays if they bring $1 for charity.

Here we see Tamil and her best friends who helped her with the project present a check to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital for the $2917 that they raised this year.

This morning BRCPS hosted a special event honoring our scholars’ mothers, grandmothers, aunties, and other female role models, with over 250 guests in attendance! The program included a guided meditation, live performance by the Voices of Renaissance Chorus, and some delicious breakfast treats for all. It was so nice to see the women in our school community have time for dialogue and fellowship!

Our goal with this event - as with those hosting our Dads and male role models earlier this year - was to show our appreciation for the adults who raise, support, and love our scholars every day. We Thank You for all you do, and look forward to continuing to build strong connections between school and home. It is so powerful for our children to know they are loved and supported by this community of caring adults!

Dr. Menge explained to our scholars how as a leading scientist at the CRREL (Cold Regions Research Engineering Laboratory) in Hanover, NH., she has been studying the changing thickness of arctic polar ice for many years now to see how it reacts to changing temperatures in our atmosphere.

She talked about the technology she invented to measure the thickness of the ice year-round from anywhere in the world, the many wild arctic animals she has encountered, and all the tools, gear and especially all the very warm clothes it takes to work in such a challenging environment.

She's also the proud mom of our very own 1st grade teacher, Ms. Menge!

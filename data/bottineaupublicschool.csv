Bottineau Public School would like to announce that we will be providing free breakfast and lunch to students that are enrolled K-12 beginning immediately under USDA guidance. Free meals will be offered through December 31st, 2020 or until USDA funding runs out, whichever comes first. If funding ends unexpectedly before December 31st, we will let you know through our normal parent communication methods.

All lunch balances will remain at their current level until the USDA funding runs out, at which time normal breakfast and lunch charges will resume.

Also, we strongly encourage that families continue to complete the Free and Reduced applications as this will insure that students will receive free/ reduced meals without interference and is needed to help with educational funding sources.

As we begin to move into operations for next school year, we are taking a keen look at the actions of the past. To gather data about our distance learning we are asking you to respond to the survey for our ongoing efforts of school improvement.

Please take the time to complete the survey and let us know the feedback from the spring quarter. We also want to thank you in advance for taking the time to complete the survey and also Thank You for all of your patience and understanding of the 4th quarter we went through.

As we find ourselves a week into the month of May, our thoughts turn towards the end of the school year. Without question, this school year has brought most unique challenges to all of us, including a unique conclusion to our 2019-2020 school year. Next Friday, May 15th, will be the last day of lessons/assignments in our distance learning model. The week of May 18th, will be utilized by our teachers and staff to assist students with make-up work that needs to be completed. The week of May 25th will consist of a schedule of times for families to return computers and other school materials. A schedule for this will be shared in the near future. School lunch will continue to be offered until May 29th.

As we find ourselves a week into the month of May, our thoughts turn towards the end of the school year. Without question, this school year has brought most unique challenges to all of us, including a unique conclusion to our 2019-2020 school year. Next Friday, May 15th, will be the last day of lessons/assignments in our distance learning model. The week of May 18th, will be utilized by our teachers and staff to assist students with make-up work that needs to be completed. The week of May 25th will consist of a schedule of times for families to return computers and other school materials. A schedule for this will be shared in the near future. School lunch will continue to be offered until May 29th.

We want to extend our sincere gratitude to our students and parents/guardians for your support, understanding, and efforts during this unprecedented time in education.",2020-05-07 15:17:45,,

The Bottineau Public School has made the decision to continue to operate school at this time. This decision was made with guidance from the ND Department of Health, and the Governor’s Office, we utilized the same information provided to all schools in ND.

With that being said, Bottineau PSD will be implementing a variety of measure that have been recommended and can best be described as precautionary. For us to implement these with fidelity, we need time to meet with our employees and go over these changes in detail. This cannot be done if we have 650+ student in the building. I know that this will be an inconvenience for some of you; but know that we believe it is the best way to prepare our staff for what we are going to ask them to do.

Parents,

Bottineau Public School has been provided an opportunity to have our staff (teachers, para’s and administration) participate in a professional development (PD) day in Rugby on January 20, 2020. The day will consist of a keynote speaker in the morning and break-out sessions throughout the rest of the day. This is an opportunity that I feel we must take advantage of; the keynote speaker (Brian Mendler) alone is worth their time to see, listen and interact with.

For us to attend this PD day, we will not be able to have students in school on January 20th, I hope that this notice provides enough time for you to make arrangements for your students for that day. We will be sending out reminder notices as the day approaches.

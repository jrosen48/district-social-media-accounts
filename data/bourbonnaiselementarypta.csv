Dear BESD #53 Families and Community,

We are aware that an article was written about BESD #53 stating “Nearly 90 in quarantine in Bourbonnais Elementary district”. It is important to remember that we only isolate students from in-person instruction as we are following the IDPH guidelines. The District has only experienced 2 positive cases thus far. Therefore the vast majority of individuals being “isolated” (not “quarantined” as that is a function of the Health Department) are due to single symptom isolation precautionary measures that the District is following. The nearly 90 individuals referred to in the article is evidence of the District taking these guidelines serious and implementing the guidelines as they are written. I hope this provides some clarity and context to the figures presented in the article.

Again, we appreciate your continued understanding and cooperation during these uncertain times. We will also continue to provide timely communication with our school community as information becomes available.

Sincerely,

Please join us as we brainstorm ways to raise funds for teachers and classrooms.

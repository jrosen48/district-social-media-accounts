Today was a big day for our BIS GT students as the final level of competition was completed. They had their virtual interview for the international competition. The judges will be looking at their problem solving process, underlying issues, solutions, video, scrapbook, interview and written report to select an International Winner in the Junior Division. The awards will be announced Tuesday and we will be anxiously waiting.

It is amazing what 9-11 year olds can problem solve, plan, execute, and accomplish. Through hard work, community support, and dedication our students will help many students relieve stress and have ample space to play at BIS for years to come. They have made our community a better place!

After their interview, via Zoom, the Partners in Play members received their medals for being the State Junior Grand Campions in community problem solving!

Announcements 4-17-20

I am not doing a live version of the announcements today because, to be honest, I can’t get through what I have to say without crying.

Bowie Elementary will be closed for the remainder of the school year. Please see Mr. Enlow’s message to the district.

Please know that the teachers and staff at BES are still here for you and we are all very disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to be with your kiddos again this school year.

I know you have a lot of questions about registering for next year, kindergarten graduation, report cards and yearbooks, etc. I promise to share information with you as soon as the information becomes available.

In the meantime, keep on doing the amazing job you are doing with your kids. We are still preparing lesson and videos to help support the learning that must continue.

If you need assistance in anyway, please reach out to your child’s teacher, Mrs. Mandrell, Mr.Neese or myself. We are all in this together and we must support each other.

God Bless and have a good day!

After two weeks of packet pickup, this week's process will be tweaked.

Students or parents may pickup packets on Friday, April 10 between 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM. Packets are only available for students who have requested this method.

The front foyer doors will be unlocked. Please enter the doors on the right. Buckets will be available for turning in assignments and/or scholarship applications. Make sure that every assignment sheet returned has the student's and teacher's names. Do not return notes, books, etc. provided by the teacher....ONLY the assignment(s). If possible, students can take pictures of assignments and text to the teacher's number. Students will be able to get Week #3 assignments from the buckets organized by grade level. Please exit through the doors on the left (by the shelves that had lunch pickup).

We ask that everyone practice social distancing and not congregate in the foyer or by the front of the school.

""Teamwork Makes the Dream Work"" is an understatement at BIS. Teachers are ""working out"" for Workout Wednesday by moving, stacking and sorting materials.

What I love about this staff is their willingness to pitch and do whatever needs to be done. They don't complain and we turn everything into fun! We laughed a lot and accomplished a ton of work.

Parents, we are going to be ready and organized for Friday's pick up day!

""Teamwork Makes the Dream Work"" is an understatement at BIS. Teachers are ""working out"" for Workout Wednesday by moving, stacking and sorting materials.

What I love about this staff is their willingness to pitch and do whatever needs to be done. They don't complain and we turn everything into fun! We laughed a lot and accomplished a ton of work.

Parents, we are going to be ready and organized for Friday's pick up day!

Bowie High School Principal, Sergio Menchaca, spoke to the Bowie Rotary Club on January 22nd. Instead of talking about BHS, he told about his passion as a Bowie knife historian and a knife maker. He noted that the original Bowie knife shape was created from a combination of Creole Louisiana knives and 1800s pirates cutlasses from the Gulf of Mexico. It was very specifically designed to be a fighting knife with a blade of at least 9 ¾ inches to 13 inches in length.

After learning discipline in martial arts and training with fighting knives, he learned how to forge Bowie knives and chef/kitchen knives as well, from reused steel. Under the name of Texas Sage Forge, his interest and passion has gradually become an unusual part time job, as he makes and sells a variety of knives from Bowies to chef knives, on order. He explained the process and the manual work and attention to detail that goes into each knife.",0.0,"Rotary Club Bowie TX

We have the most awesome students! Since starting clubs and talking school wide about leadership, respect, responsibility, being inclusive and showing kindness our students have really stepped up. There have been multiple groups of students want to create clubs and help others. We’ve had more than one group of students want to help others in need by bringing can food items and donating it to the Bowie Mission. We’ve decided to make this a school wide food drive. Independently these students have made flyers and placed a collection box in the front hallway. Please join us in helping others by bringing can food to school.",0.0,"Bowie Intermediate School

They could only use 1 piece of paper, 1 piece of aluminum foil, and 2 pipe cleaners. They also had questions to answer based on their research, and they completed a data sheet for each plane.

In case you didn't know, the Intermediate Campus has clubs for the students to attend. There are 16 full weeks in the school year and the students meet with their club on each Friday of those weeks during their last period. Each club lasts 4 weeks and then the students are rotated to a different club that they chose from on the list given to them. Officer Magers got with the school and was able to secure a classroom for us to host a Junior Officers Club. The 4 lessons that will be covered during each 4 week period are as follows: Week 1- Community, Week 2- Leadership, Week 3- Druge Education(grade/age appropriate) and Week 4- Policing(and how they all relate to each other). At the end of each 4 week period the Junior Officers will ""graduate"" and be given a special custom Bowie Police badge of their own. Badges are going to be ordered sometime in October. They will say Junior Officer on top, Bowie, Tx on the bottom and will have the Bowie Police Badge emblem in the center of them.

***Bus Information***
Students who ride the bus are coming home with a color coded identification badge zip-tied to their backpack. This is to help students get to their correct bus line. Should an issue take place the staff can quickly identify the student and contact you by phone immediately.

Students who are picked up from school daily at times need a quick change in routine and often the bus is their second option. If you need to make a change on how your child will get home please call transportation and arrange which bus your child should get on. Once you have made that contact please call the elementary front office and ask for the secretary to notify your child's teacher of the change. We will not allow a child to get on the bus if the change was not made through transportation and the front office.

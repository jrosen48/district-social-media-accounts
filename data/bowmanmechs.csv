Please see the attached flyer that will be presented to students who are sent home from school (for a Remote Hike). Students presenting signs or symptoms of COVID-19 or that have had a risk of exposure will be sent home to work virtually. Just becuase we send students home does not mean that the student has COVID-19 or that they should stop working in their coursework. We will always encourage the student to work from home until they can return to campus.",0.0,"Mountain Education Charter High School

Congratulations to Bowman Site senior Ca'nyia Bush! Ca'nyia plans to further her education at Albany State University and major in biology (pre-med). Her favorite quote is by Maya Angelou, “You will face many defeats in life, but never let yourself be defeated.”
She thanks all the staff members at MECHS who always encouraged her and never let her give up. Ca'nyia would like to specifically thank Ms. Moon and Mrs. Hill for always making her laugh even on bad days and for pushing her to do and be her best self.

Our hope has been to continue the education of the children in our school district the best we could under the circumstances. We understand this has not been ideal and it has placed unusual pressures on you as parents. We have tried to adapt and make this situation the best it can be.

Thank you for all you have done and will continue to do. It is my complete belief that when we start school back up our professional educators will know how to access all the students’ learning and knowledge and in a short time catch them back up to where they need to be. In the meantime thank you for your help.

There are scientifically proven benefits to being kind! Not only does it make you feel calmer and happier, but it improves your health. Being kind to someone releases oxytocin, which lowers blood pressure and makes you feel more kind and loving. The best part of kindness is that it’s contagious: the people you help will help others, and this spreads across a community, a city, a country, and the world.

Fathers, like mothers, are pillars in the development of a child’s emotional well-being. Children look to their fathers to lay down the rules and enforce them. They also look to their fathers to provide a feeling of security, both physical and emotional. Children want to make their fathers proud, and an involved father promotes inner growth and strength. Studies have shown that when fathers are affectionate and supportive, it greatly affects a child’s cognitive and social development. It also instills an overall sense of well-being and confidence.",0.0,"Dr. Dave - USU Extension

Preparing our children when they are young can have lasting positive effects as they grow older. The effectiveness of any teaching will depend on our relationship with our children.

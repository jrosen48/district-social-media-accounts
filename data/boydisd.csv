Great news!!!

Beginning Tuesday, September 8th, all students will receive breakfast and lunch at no charge. Students will not enter their PIN numbers or scan their bar codes at the register unless they are purchasing additional items.

Last week, the USDA released flexibilities to ensure all children have access to nutritious food as the country recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. The plan is for this to last until December 31, 2020 or until funding runs out. If you can, please take advantage of this great opportunity!

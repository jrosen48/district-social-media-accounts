Preston's Pantry Drive-Through Food Drive

As we continue to follow the state's guidelines, we are working on alternative ways to provide support to the growing needs of the Pantry during this time. We are holding out hope that we'll be able to have our official food drive and celebration later this summer.🤞

Donations will be collected drive-through style at the Boyertown Area Multi-Service Building. When arriving, please use the one-way entrance at the rear of the building and park your car under the overhang in front of the Senior Center doors. If no one is outside, please ring the bell and a volunteer will be able to collect your donations. Below you'll find a list of the most needed items to help support the needs of the community.

Donations will be accepted between 9-10 am and 1-3 pm on:
- Monday, May 18
- Friday, May 22
- Tuesday, May 26

We couldn't continue to assist those facing food insecurity without the AMAZING support and dedication of the Boyertown community. Thank you, thank you, thank you!! <3",4.0,"Preston's Pantry Project

Hello Boyertown Community! Even if you don't have a senior in your family who is graduating this year, we're sure you know a senior who would appreciate your support. How about acknowledging our students who work(ed) at the grocery store, car wash, or local restaurants? How about the little kid who would ride bike in your neighborhood and who is now ready for another kind of adventure? Graduation for our students is going to look different this year. Let's ALL show our support and salute the students of the Class of 2020 who far outshine anything this virus is throwing their way! ONE BOYERTOWN!

This order form is for our generic lawn signs ONLY. The child-specific order form has been attached to previous posts and is available on our website at www.foundationbe.org Orders are due by May 8th, 2020. All proceeds benefit the students of our district!",2.0,"You do not need to be the family of a senior to celebrate this year's BASH Class of 2020!

The students work on part of each problem independently, part with a partner, and have support from parent volunteers throughout each problem. The process is not linear – it requires the students to revise their work as they work towards finding a solution. POW gives students a chance to be exposed to real-life problems they may not normally be exposed to in the classroom.

Each day, students complete a different part of the process. Today, students received a new word problem and were tasked with determining what they noticed in the problem (what they know from reading the problem) and what they were curious about (what they would still like to know after reading the problem).

Today, the MSE principals, instructional coaches, staff, and outside presenters worked together to provide a unique learning experience for the 8th graders aimed at giving them a deeper understanding of Colonial America.

Colonial dress was encouraged for 8th-grade staff and students, and some of the outside presenters were in full colonial attire.

The 8th-grade students did not have traditional classes but rather a schedule of colonial activities that they got to choose from. Activities included: Colonial Clothing and Toys, Digging Colonial America, Ciphers and a Scavenger Hunt, Dance, and Crocheting Poor Man's Lace.

The main event was an outside presenter, Noah Lewis, who plays “Ned Hector”, an American Revolutionary War soldier. His assembly is very interactive and the students were up on stage with him at times throughout the event.

In celebration of World Kindness Day, we held our first assembly-in-the-round yesterday. Not only could our kiddos see Mrs. DeRenzo, but they could also see each other and she could be closer to each of them.

She shared the book ""ishi: simple tips from a solid friend"" and talked about the importance of being kind to yourself. It was such a great message for our students!!

Later this week, all of our students and staff members will get a chance to create their very own 'ishi'. All of the 'ishies' will be placed on display in our display case as a reminder to all of us that it is so important to be kind to ourselves every day!",0.0,"Colebrookdale Elementary School Boyertown

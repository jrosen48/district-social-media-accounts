The Boylston community has been so generous at providing foodstuffs and cash donations since the pandemic hit. Our food pantry is currently experiencing a large surplus of food and Stop & Shop gift cards beyond what we need to service our usual friends. You can help us serve new friends by using the attached form to make us aware of people you know who are in need. We are especially thinking of people who are unemployed, laid off, disabled, on a fixed income, and the like. You can mail the attached form to us or just provide is with the information by email. We will be grateful for anything you can do to help.

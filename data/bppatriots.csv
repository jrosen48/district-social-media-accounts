Virtual Spirit Week at Broadalbin-Perth Central School District! #BPSpirit Day 2 - Talent Show Day

Stepping waaayyyy out of my comfort zone with this post and sharing my talent! I'm missing my kiddos so much and want them to KNOW and feel just how much we ALL do. This is a strange time, uncharted waters for all of us but you are handling it beautifully.
I look forward to the day, hopefully soon, Somewhere Over the Rainbow, when we'll all be together again!

We love and miss you more than you could know but we're still here for you - we're just a google classroom or email away!

Loving you, always!

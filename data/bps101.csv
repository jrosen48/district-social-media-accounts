Three Batavia High School students have been named finalists in the 2021 National Merit Scholarship Program:
Ellen Chlachidze
Alexander Holzman
Lauren Zeilstra
These academically talented Batavia High School seniors have an opportunity to continue in the competition for some 7,600 National Merit Scholarships worth more than $30 million, which will be offered next spring. About half of the finalists will win a National Merit Scholarship, earning the ‚ÄúMerit Scholar‚Äù title.
Approximately 1.5 million juniors from more than 21,000 high schools entered the 2020 National Merit Scholarship Program by taking the 2019 Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT), which served as an initial screen of program entrants. Out of the 1.5 million student applicants, 15,000 advanced to National Merit Scholarship Semifinalists, and 90 percent of the semifinalists advanced to finalist status. The nationwide pool of finalists represents less than one percent of all U.S. high school seniors.

Are you ready, Bulldogs!?

Whether you have a child remote learning from home or heading back to school in person, it‚Äôs back to school weekend for the Batavia Bulldogs! We are here to help you get into the school spirit!

The Batavia boosters organization relies on community fundraisers to provide so many amazing events throughout the year. With the current restrictions on social gatherings many fundraising events and activities have been cancelled out of the safety for our community.

So... THIS WEEKEND and THIS WEEKEND ONLY, we are donating ALL proceeds of our Batavia gear (hats, tees, hoodies) to the Batavia Booster Organization!

Come out and grab your school spirit gear to support the Batavia Boosters organization, shop local, and support Six + Cypress!

(* If we run out of any apparel you love or need a different size, we will get more to insure we can help you support your Batavia businesses and organizations)

We would like to celebrate Kathleen Tieri Ton as a 2020 Illinois Art Education Association Secondary Art Educator of the Year Award nominee.

""Kathleen Tieri Ton inspires both her students and colleagues. By building an artistic environment that ensures all learners feel supported, heard and appreciated, she not only creates a space that students gravitate to, but also one where they feel empowered to create some of their best works, safe to explore new ideas and let their voices be heard. Kathleen has widened the opportunities for the students of Batavia through her many community partnerships, clubs and additional real life experiences in the graphics field. Kathleen inspires me as an educator to dream larger, help more, and be better. She has been an asset to our program, school and community."" Dawn Zalkus, nominator

Thank you to all of our families who have helped make our pick up process run so smoothly! We love seeing the smiling faces and words of encouragement. If you have not picked up your students belongings, we will be here tomorrow, Thursday, May 21 from 12-3 or 4-7. Please come in off of PaperMill Hill Dr., not Raddant. It also helps if you come with your student's first and last name written on paper and displayed in your car's window.",2020-05-21 13:23:40,,

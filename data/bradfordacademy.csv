Meet Krista Wylin, High School History Teacher!

‚ÄúA fun fact about me is that I am from a small agricultural town in Macomb County and this is the first summer that I have spent farming.‚Äù

¬∑ What drew you to Bradford?
What drew me to Bradford the most was the drive they have to instill curiosity in their students. They don't just want to show students the answer, they want them to be able to find it for themselves. Also, not everyone comes from the same background or shares the same experience, and I believe that we can all learn from one another. I have so much I am ready to share with my students and I know they will have a lot to teach me as well.

Meet Caitlin Mahinske, Lead GSRP Teacher!

¬∑ What drew you to Bradford?
I‚Äôve always heard great things about working with a charter school. A good friend of mine recently started at Bradford and told me all about it, so when an opening became available, I felt I needed to take the chance!

¬∑ Why did you choose to work in education?
I choose to go into education for a few different reasons, but the main reasons was to watch and help the little ones explore and grow.

¬∑ What are you most looking forward to for the 2020-2021 school year?

Meet Lauren Angel, Bradford Kindergarten Teacher!

""Growing up I always loved school and that was mainly because of my teachers. I am going to make sure that this year is amazing for everyone and I am so excited to be a part of the Bradford family!""

¬∑ What drew you to Bradford?
A school with a strong sense of diversity within their students and staff is something very important to me. Bradford has this while also having such a strong sense of community and unity.

¬∑ Why did you choose to work in education?
Working in education is such a fulfilling job where you are constantly learning more while having the opportunity to learn from others - especially students. Children deserve to have a positive and safe learning environment, and that is what I wish to provide them!

¬∑ What are you most looking forward to for the 2020-2021 school year?
I'm looking forward to having the opportunity to be in school again! Last school year was cut short so I am looking forward to safely seeing students face to face again.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=4362598303782121&id=348836745158317,,0.0,"‚ú®New Teacher Spotlight‚ú®

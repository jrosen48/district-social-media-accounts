The first day of school went remarkably well. Thank you for helping make today a reality. It was an absolute pleasure having students back in the building. All of our students should be commended for their efforts to keep social distance, wear masks when needed and adapt to new circumstances.

One quick reminder for our parents and students. Homeroom starts at 8:25 AM. If needed a student can come to the school at 8:00 AM, however it would be preferred if they arrived closer to 8:20 AM. If students can go directly to their homeroom after being dropped off this will help us keep congestion down before school begins.

Thank you to all of our students, parents and staff for making today such a success. I can't wait to do this all over again tomorrow. Go Braves!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3527601143971199&id=391780297553315,,0.0,"Dear BCS Families,

We received notification earlier today of (2) important developments regarding our current school closure.

First, school will remain closed through April 28th. As of now the earliest we would return to school would be on April 29th. This date is subject to change depending on the health and safety conditions being experienced in our area or throughout NYS.

We also were informed that all Regents Exams in June 2020 have been cancelled. We expect to receive further guidance on this matter in the coming days. As of right now we do not know what this means in terms of graduation implications or if students will be expected to make these exams up in the future.

Thank you for your patience and understanding during these uncertain times.

Wishing you all health and safety.

Dear Members of the Community,

Please be advised that we have been instructed by Schuyler County to prohibit gatherings of adults or students on our school campus. Some examples given were to prohibit pick-up basketball games, groups of children on playground equipment etc. It was suggested we shut our campus down completely, but we’d like to allow a community member to walk on the track or a parent and child to use the playground as long as we possibly can. We ask that anyone who is on the school campus needs to adhere to social distancing guidelines. Thank you for your understanding and
cooperation. Stay safe and healthy everyone.

With this in mind, I wanted to take an opportunity to address head lice as they are an ongoing issue of childhood and it is rare that a family gets through their children’s school years without a visit from the little critters. Head lice are not a health issue, but they are a nuisance and they do not discriminate based on cleanliness of homes or student hygiene. They can visit anyone at anytime. Please remind your student(s) not to share items such as hats/caps/helmets or hair items such as combs/brushes/hair bands/hair ties. If you find head lice or nits on your student, you should simply treat but they should not be excluded from school. There are many over-the-counter treatment options available. Please know you are not in this alone, I am available to assist with resources so please feel free to reach out to me with any questions or to seek help!

Message from Dr. Rosario, MS/US Orchestra Instructor...
""I have accepted a tenure-track Assistant Professor position with the Department of Music, at Kansas Wesleyan University. I will work as the Orchestra Director, Strings Area director, and upper strings professor (applied violin and viola.
It is breaking me and my kids’ hearts the possibility of moving without a chance for a proper goodbye to the students, teachers, and friends. Furthermore, we know that it is nearly impossible for us to find a school like Bradford Prep in Kansas or anywhere else. Bradford has provided me with so many things possible for my family, me, and for the orchestra, so many doors were open, and I am leaving with beautiful and joyful memories, and with my heart full of gratefulness for such a wonderful time.""

Senior parents – Please share the information below with your senior. We would LOVE to see the seniors TOMORROW!

Hey, Seniors! We miss seeing your smiling faces every day but we have a remedy for that. The graduation items you ordered through Jostens have arrived. We will have a drive-thru system set up this Thursday morning from 10am-noon for you to pick them up. Just drive through the middle loop and stop at the cones. We will have someone bring your items out to your car. We can only give out items that have been paid for in full. If you have a balance due, you should have received an email from Jostens yesterday.
We look forward to seeing you Thursday! If for some reason you are unavailable to stop by Thursday, we will have the items available for you to pick up in the LS office next week Tuesday – Friday from 10am-2pm.

Jayden recently joined us at our March Saturday Summit in Charlotte to speak with our current Scholars about GenerationNation. Learn more about Jayden and his experience in the College LAUNCH for Leadership Program below.

My name is Jayden and I am a senior at Bradford Preparatory School. In the Fall, I am attending the illustrious Winston-Salem State University (GO RAMS!). I will be majoring in Chemistry or Biology (Pre-Dentistry track) and a minor in Business Administration. College LAUNCH helped me realize that I need a better study and organization habits. LAUNCH also taught me that it is okay for me to ask questions when I am confused or need help.

Great job to the PE staff for organizing the Amazing Race event! So wonderful to see students working together.. and seeing their reactions when they ran into the gym for the first time! Truly an amazing day. Students were saying how awesome the gym is all day, amazed at the size and in awe that it is THEIRS! We cannot thank the supporters of the Give.Grow.Together campaign enough! Thanks to you, these students have amazing bleachers, beautiful locker rooms, awesome performing art space and more. At the end of the day a 7th grade student came up to me and said ""We are so lucky to go to school here, Bradford is the BEST!""

The term “mentally retarded” used to describe a person with a cognitive disability. The term became derogatory in the 1950s and is still, unfortunately, used as an insult or as a joke today. Please think about who you are hurting before you speak. A person with a disability is a person, first and foremost. They just happen to be different, but we’re all different in some way or another, right?
So grateful for the Best Buddies club for heading up this initiative at our school; signing a banner, selling t-shirts, passing out wristbands and stickers.

It is just the beginning for Matthew. He broke and set the new school record for most wins in a season going 55-9 for the season. This gives him an overall record of 75-21 over two seasons.

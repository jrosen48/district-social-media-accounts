Our preschoolers are excited to start school next week! Families were able to come and meet their teachers and see the classrooms this week, and we were so happy to see all the excited preschoolers! We can’t wait for next week! We still have some preschool openings available so give us a call.

We are also preparing for the start of ECFE and will be giving you sneak peeks right here on our FB page so be watching for that soon!

Approval for these forward looking educational investments came from the voters of Independent School District 181, which is approaching its 150th year of delivering educational services to children in central Minnesota.

Photographed here, on May 28, 2020, are select exteriors of BHS and of the PAC, as well as iconic images of Brainerd, as seen from the front of BHS (Brainerd's historic water tower), and of BHS, framed by a tree in the approach to the front door of BHS (an area under construction as the former outdoor commons in the center of North Campus is transitioning into educational spaces consuming most of the commons, a major entry point being the South Fifth Street front door entrance).

NAME: Trey Pike

FAVORITE SCHOOL MEMORY: One of my fondest school memories was going to Preservation Hall during our band tour to New Orleans. It was an amazing experience, and I am very lucky to have been given that opportunity.

ADVICE FOR YOUNGER STUDENTS: High School is easy, and only gets easier as you go on. You don't need to go to college to get a good job. It's cheaper to learn a trade, such as plumbing, and go from there. Many trades are in high demand because nobody wants to do them. If you do plan on going to college, you don't need to have a plan right away. Plans make it easier, but often fall apart. Go to CLC for your first 2 years. It's a great school to start off at, and also allows you to stay at home for your first years of college.

FUTURE PLANS: I'm going to CLC to get my AA, and then to a 4 year to get a bachelor's in business.",0.0,"Senior Spotlight #Classof2020

ADVICE FOR YOUNGER STUDENTS: Trust yourself more, because mistakes are inevitable. A bad test score or two isn't worth the headache. Everyone fumbles at one point or another, and as long as you do what you can that's all that matters in the end. But most importantly, remember to have fun with it.

FUTURE PLANS: I plan to attend UMN this fall and potentially major in Sociology of Law, Criminology, and Deviance.",2020-05-08 12:59:22,,

NAME: Cassidy Christenson

FAVORITE SCHOOL MEMORY: So many great memories were made these last four years. My favorites were all the football, volleyball and basketball games, getting into the nerf wars championship and making so many new friends! I’m also glad to become friends with many of the foreign exchange students these past two years. It was fun getting to know them and learning about their countries!

ADVICE FOR YOUNGER STUDENTS: Participate in pepfests, spirit weeks and attend sports games! Cherish and appreciate the moments you have with your friends and favorite teachers. Never take the time you have for granted! It goes by a lot faster than you think! Be a light and most importantly have fun!

They started with being introduced to Pop artist, Jim Dine, and his art using the symbol of the heart. From there, they were to create something using the heart motif for others to see and communicate the message of love and hope during this time. This was our first distance learning assignment.

""Mandy Gill of Bismarck, ND created a Facebook site for communities to show solidarity and support during quarantine by asking people around the world to place hearts somewhere in or outside of their homes using whatever materials they had. They started with being introduced to Pop artist, Jim Dine, and his art using the symbol of the heart. From there, they were to create something using the heart motif for others to see and communicate the message of love and hope during this time. This was our first distance learning assignment. I hope you enjoy what the Forestview Middle School 8C art kids did to contribute and what they had to say about it."" -Kara Hall #aworldofhearts",2020-04-10 09:56:37,,

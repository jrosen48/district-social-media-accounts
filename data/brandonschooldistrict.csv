Kids are back! Matching your mask to your outfit is so 2020!

Thank you parents and guardians for entrusting us and sending your children to school this week. I’ll tell you it really warmed my heart to hear so many kids expressing their joy and excitement around being able to return to school! Also, they really nailed it with the social distancing and following new safety procedures. Way to go Oakwood kids!!

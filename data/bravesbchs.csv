We have had several people ask about tickets for the auction Saturday. We have been sold out for several weeks. If you did buy tickets, but won't be able to make it, please let Kylene/ Dustin Steward or Ben/Jodi Tiemeyer know because we do have a waiting list of people interested in tickets that they can buy back from you.
There's a legal limit to the amount of people allowed in the building at one time and we're maxed out, so you MUST have a ticket to enter.
We are going to attempt streaming the live auction on Facebook Live on Kayia's Journey page. If you are interested in items, but unable to attend, you can ask a friend who has a ticket to bid for you on said items. But that person must pay for ALL items before leaving. It will be between you and the bidder/buyer to get reimbursement. Remember all items must be paid for before leaving Pewter Hall with CASH or CHECK.",0.0,"Kayia's Journey

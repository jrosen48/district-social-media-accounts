If you haven't filled out a 14-15 page application online, then you haven't enroll your student for the next academic school year. Please go to http://www.thebrazosschool.org/enrollment-information-bryan-campus to fill out the application. Additionally, because we are a charter school and you are opting to bring your student to our campus, you must fill out the application every year. Your student's enrollment doesn't roll over every year as it would for the school your student is zoned to go to based on their residency. We hope that clears up any questions you may have. We are here to serve and help. Please let us know if you have any questions. Thank you.

9 11 NEVER FORGET TODD BEAMER : FLIGHT 93

September 11 at 4:39 PM ·

I think each of us can remember exactly where we were when we learned about the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centers on Sept. 11, 2001. I was in a classroom in E wing at Brazoswood HS. We just had TVs mounted in our classrooms and students and staff were glued to the news in disbelief. One of my favorite stories of heroism from 9/11 is of Todd Beamer. He was a passenger on UA flight 93 that was headed to Washington D.C to do more damage. Todd and other passengers figured out what was happening and overtook the cockpit and terrorist, with the now famous words of “Let’s Roll!” This courageous act of bravery undoubtedly saved many Americans lives.

6/28/20 In a situation that is changing daily and with great uncertainty, we are doing our best to continue to serve the children in our community. In doing so, we are also trying to keep our team safe and do our part to keep each other well. A large number of our team is in quarantine right now and we respect their concern for their families and those that we serve. While we are operating with a small team, we will continue to do as much as possible for our community.
We will continue curbside at two locations: Ney Elementary and Velasco Elementary. Anyone with children 18 and under can pick up at these locations.
Our bus will not run on Monday but we are doing our best to get it back on route early this week. We will post on here when we are ready to roll again.
Thank you for your patience and understanding. We look forward to seeing you soon! #BISDFamily",4.0,"BISD Child Nutrition Team

Our Seniors attended an “After The Fire” assembly today.

Alvaro Llanos and Shawn Simons are two survivors of the deadly Seton Hall dormitory fire. Alvaro and Shawn present about their ordeal of being college burn survivors nationally at many colleges and high schools across the country. They also speak at fire safety training or firefighting seminars.

Their motive is to be advocates for fire safety and prevention so that no other students will have to endure the pain that they suffered. Also, they strive to be the voice of many burn survivors across the country who may feel ""trapped in their new skin."" They inspire to motivate students and professionals that life will give you many obstacles. It's how you overcome those obstacles by drawing strength, knowledge and motivation from those around you and from within. #BISDpride #Bportpride",0.0,"Seniors attended an “After The Fire” assembly.

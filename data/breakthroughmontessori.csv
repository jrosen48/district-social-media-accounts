This piece in the Washington Post does pretty well by Montessori: gets a lot of things right, doesn't get anything too far wrong, and highlights NCMPS demonstration school Breakthrough Montessori Public Charter School.

The article also features quotes from NCMPS E.D. Keith Whitescarver, NCMPS partners Mira Lutgendorf Debs (Education Studies Director at Yale) and Terry Ford (E.D. at Lumin Education), Breakthrough/NCMPS team member Allison Jones, and Breakthrough teacher Marissa Howser.

The Journal of Montessori Research (https://journals.ku.edu/jmr) and the Jeff Bezos announcement (http://www.montessoripublic.org/2018/10/amazons-jeff-bezos-pledges-blllions-for-montessori-inspired/) get mentions as well.

Adam and I are happy to share that our son Delano Thomas Hedin was born at 12:50 AM on Sunday, September 17, 2017.

Delano proved impatient to get started with life and was delivered by his mother and father in the car on the shoulder of Interstate 270.

Delano (or Del, as we’ve begun to call him) weighed 6 pounds and 15 ounces and measured 19 inches long.

We have since learned that Interstate 270 was legislated under the presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, so perhaps Del had a plan all along.

This story came our way today and we just had to share!

""Today is twin day at Laurel Elementary School in honor of Red Ribbon Week. With having a non-verbal son I was afraid that he would not be able to ask a ""twin"" or relay to me if he was asked by someone. One of his teachers, Ms. Danielle, jumped at the opportunity to twin with Dylan! After Ms. Danielle has shared some photos with me, I cannot believe the SMILE on Dylan's face! He is so thrilled that one of his favorite teachers matches him!""

We are so lucky to be surrounded by true Superheroes each and every day!

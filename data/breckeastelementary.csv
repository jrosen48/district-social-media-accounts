Thank you for all your hard work at home teaching and help students to complete their work. To finish out the school year, we have provided a fun bingo board to encourage students to continue growing and learning through the end of the school year and over the summer. Each week, have your child complete a BINGO by choosing 3 activities from the board. Send a short message to your child's teacher celebrating their BINGO. Teachers will still be available for help and support through May 21st.

Think about what makes you happy right
now.Today we are going to draw a picture of what makes us happy right now.
Have students draw a picture of what makes them
happy right now.

Challenge:
In this lesson we learned to embrace every
moment and to be happy. I challenge you to focus on
being happy. If someone happens to say something
or do something that makes you sad, try to turn that
frown upside down and find the happy or positive in every day! I will be finding the positive too!

Have a great weekend!

Prompt: Let’s think about different ways we can make a difference when we Live to Give to others!

Brainstorm with your family about ways you can make a difference. It’s important for them to see that giving to others doesn’t mean they have to give big things or gifts that cost money.
1. Start the list with examples such as a hug or a smile.
2. Encourage kids to think of small ways to give that are free.

Challenge:
We need to stretch ourselves and try our best in order to live to give. I challenge you to give to someone in your family in an unexpected or small way. Giving can be done many ways, like holding open the door, reading to younger sibling, letting someone else go first, and saying please and thank you.

In this first week of our study on citizenship, we focused on respecting authority. The students learned what authority means and who authority figures are. They went practiced real life scenarios about respecting authority figures. Our students were not only taught that they should follow the rules and laws, but they should do it with a good attitude. You can further your child’s character learning by doing the following at home:

Discussing who are authority figures in your household.

Discussing who are authority figures in your life and how you handle authority as an adult.

Here is the definition of citizenship to review with your child:

Citizenship -

Do your share to make your school and community better

Cooperate

Get involved in community affairs

Stay informed/vote

Be a good neighbor

Obey laws and rules

Respect authority

Protect the environment

volunteer

Have a great weekend!

Caring is the character trait we are studying this six weeks. Our students spent this week learning about compassion and discussing how we can show others that we care about them. We also discussed how to be encouraging to our classmates.
At home you can extend this learning by:

Modeling compassion towards others

Having your family write small appreciations on notes to give each other

Planning an act of kindness that your family can do for someone else

Have a great weekend!

Our students are doing a fantastic job showing respect to their friends, their school, and their teachers. I hope they are showing respect at home, as well. Please remind your child that respect means:

1. Treat other with respect - Follow the Golden Rule (treat others the way you want to be treated)

2. Be tolerant and accepting of differences

3. Use good manners

4. Don’t use bad language

5. Never threaten, hit or hurt anyone

6. Be considerate of the feelings of others

7. Deal peacefully with anger, insults, and disagreements

Here are a couple ideas on how to incorporate character education at home:

1. Explain the importance of using nice words and actions towards others.

2. Tell your child different words of encouragement that they can use with teammates that show respect.

We are looking forward to the 4th of July Celebration next week and have heard from a few people who are equally excited and want to know how they can help support the event. Donations can be made to the Breckenridge Area Action Committee, a promotional committee of the Gratiot Area Chamber of Commerce, and can be dropped off at the Village of Breckenridge offices. All money raised will go to the cost of the fireworks. We also have sponsorship opportunities available for businesses.

Another great way to support the event is to run or walk in the Firecracker 8K that morning. The money goes to support the fireworks that evening, and you get a great tank top for participating: https://runsignup.com/Race/MI/Breckenridge/FirecrackerRunWalk

Lately when I ride my bike around the section I don't see a single car. Part of the quarantine I figure. The thing I do see is the Breckenridge School Buses out delivering food to many of the families and children in our area. I am so happy this is happening and I think about how excited some of these kids are to see this extra food during this time. I raised 3 kids and I know kids always seem to be hungry. Thank you to all of those that are making this happen and especially to the bus drivers,and those who are helping deliver the food packages. I am so proud of our schools here and I am amazed at all of the great people that live in this community.",5.0,"We appreciate the post Cindy.

During this COVID-19 outbreak we wanted to help do our part and give back. We found a great way to use our resources to disinfect and clean the shopping carts at our local grocery store.

Thanks to Siler's Market for allowing us to give back to the community. If you're ever in Breckenridge, stop by and see Kurt in the meat department. Our employees love their beef sticks. 😋

We used an Alkota 5355KNL pressure washer and our disinfectant; Chlor Clean.

A message from Mrs. Giles.

Hi all,
The local scholarship applications are still due on April 6th. I would like you to scan them and email them to me. Mrs. Pilmore says there is an app that will allow you to scan it to your phone and then you can send it as an email. I do not want this to cause stress for anyone so talk to each other if you are having difficulty. There were a couple of you who already gave it to me. I will email you individually if I have it.
Please contact your classmates and tell them to check email.
Let me know if you have questions.
Please do your part to stay healthy and safe!
Hope to see you all soon!!!!

Due to school closures, I will be offering free art lessons on our Facebook page each weekday until our kiddos return to school. These will be family oriented for a range of ages and utilize supplies typically found in your home.

Creativity can ease stress, expedite learning & allow us to see circumstances in different ways. Since we will all be home gathered together over the next few weeks unexpectedly, it is the perfect time to discover and grow new talent! We will be offering take home kits from the studio for additional lessons beginning next Wednesday.
I always pull from my classical training as a BFA studio art major and 25 years as a professional artist, but also love to introduce process learning- In other words- I like to show you how to do it AND get messy!

Join us at 1pm CT this Monday for our first lesson!
Hint: For Monday, gather plain paper, a baking sheet, cooking spray/oil and pencils...we will be drawing faces!",0.0,"Make

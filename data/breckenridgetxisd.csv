Dear Parents,

In this first week of our study on citizenship, we focused on respecting authority. The students learned what authority means and who authority figures are. Then went practiced real-life scenarios about respecting authority figures. Our students were not only taught that they should follow the rules and laws, but they should do it with a good attitude. You can further your child’s character learning by doing the following at home:
-Discussing who are authority figures in your household.
-Discussing who are authority figures in your life and how you handle authority as an adult.

Here is the definition of citizenship to review with your child:

Citizenship - Do your share to make your school and community better
Cooperate
Get involved in community affairs
Stay informed/vote
Be a good neighbor
Obey laws and rules
Respect authority
Protect the environment
volunteer

Have a great weekend!

Dear Parents,
This week we have concluded our study on being responsible. Our focus this week has been on thinking before you speak. The students should know that before they speak their words should be T-true, H-helpful, I-inspiring, N-necessary, K-kind. Next six weeks we will be looking into the character trait of Citizenship. Please help your child get a head start on next week's learning by reviewing the definition of Citizenship with him/her.
Citizenship -
1. Do your share to make your school and community better?
2. Cooperate
3. Get involved in community affairs
4. Stay informed, vote
5. Be a good neighbor
6. Obey laws and rules
7. Respect authority
8. Protect the environment
9. Volunteer

Have a marvelous weekend and see you on Tuesday!

We wrapped up our unit on caring this week. I hope your children enjoyed learning and doing a service project. It is always good to help others who are in need. I hope you get a chance to spend quality time with your loved ones this holiday season. When we come back from break, we will be studying what it means to be responsible.

Have a Merry Christmas!

TAKE THE SURVEY!

Results so far show that different groups definitely have different priorities. Here is what these three groups have selected as their highest priority so far:

Students -- Creativity and Innovation
Teachers -- Personal Responsibility
Parents -- Academic Mindset

It's not too late to get in the game!

Breckenridge ISD is about to embark on a new endeavor; that is, to determine 'why' we exist. Of course, the short answer is because kids need to learn. But learn what? And how? And why? Has any of that changed in the last 100 years? Are we preparing our kids based on their future or our past? Are we raising up a generation that will help drive our community forward?

You are invited to complete this survey, in which you will be asked to select the most critical 21st century competencies our students need to prepare them to be successful lifelong learners and contributors in our complex, rapidly changing world.

Dear Parents,
This six weeks our students are learning the character trait respect. We have talked about how to treat others with respect and how we should treat others the way we want to be treated. We went into detail about the golden rule and why we should follow it. We also discussed that we should always think before we speak.
At home, please:
1. Have your child practice showing compassion to others.
2. As a family, plan and do an act of kindness over the weekends.
3. Discuss a time that you did not think before you spoke. What was the outcome? Did what you said hurt someone else? If so were you able to fix the relationship?
Review what respect means with your child:
1. Treat other with respect - Follow the Golden Rule (treat others the way you want to be treated)
2. Be tolerant and accepting of differences
3. Use good manners
4. Don’t use bad language
5. Never threaten, hit or hurt anyone
6. Be considerate of the feelings of others
7. Deal peacefully with anger, insults, and disagreements

Thank you!

TAKE THE SURVEY!

Results so far show that different groups definitely have different priorities. Here is what these three groups have selected as their highest priority so far:

Students -- Creativity and Innovation
Teachers -- Personal Responsibility
Parents -- Academic Mindset

It's not too late to get in the game!

Breckenridge ISD is about to embark on a new endeavor; that is, to determine 'why' we exist. Of course, the short answer is because kids need to learn. But learn what? And how? And why? Has any of that changed in the last 100 years? Are we preparing our kids based on their future or our past? Are we raising up a generation that will help drive our community forward?

You are invited to complete this survey, in which you will be asked to select the most critical 21st century competencies our students need to prepare them to be successful lifelong learners and contributors in our complex, rapidly changing world.

October is Clean the Curbs Month! Two Breckenridge Civic Organizations are teaming up this fall to keep downtown clean, even making it a contest to see whether the North or South side of Walker Street is kept cleanest.

Join in this effort to Clean the Curbs in Breckenridge by cleaning the curb at your place of business or residence and then help someone that cannot do it for themselves!

We will be posting pictures of curbs that are cleaned.

The city is having brush pick up this month, as well, so this is a good time to clean up the whole yard!

Share this with everyone you know in Breckenridge!

Breckenridge ISD TRE 13.m4v

Tim Seymore
August 9, 2018 at 9:42 AM ·

THE BRECKENRIDGE AMERICAN IS WRONG

Current Total School Tax Rate = $1.1685

Total School Tax Rate if the Tax Ratification Election Passes = $1.17 (Even though the voters are technically approving a tax rate of $1.30, the board has already taken action to reduce the I&S portion of the tax rate $0.13, so that the Total Tax Rate will be $1.17)This will result in the district receiving additional funds from the state of an estimated $270,000.

Total School Tax Rate if the Tax Ratification Election Fails = $1.17

$1.17-$1.1685 = $0.0015 That increase will happen whether the election passes or not. ($0.0015 , not $0.5315 like the Breckenridge American says. The article stating that Early Voting for the August 25 Election ends November 2 was incorrect, as well.)

Tax Increase on a $100,000 home resulting from $0.0015 tax increase is $1.50. And this increase will happen whether or not the TRE passes. (The tax increase noted in the paper is not accurate.)

Leon County voters back Oakwood school district tax swap

Voters in the Oakwood school district in Leon County overwhelmingly approved a ""tax swap"" during a special tax ratification election, or TRE, on Saturday.

According to officials, the process involves moving pennies from the interest and sinking side to the maintenance and operations side. By transferring the pennies, the district will be able to generate additional state funding without increasing the tax burden. The total tax rate remains $1.2444, but $70,000 to $80,000 in additional funds is expected to be generated.

""Finding strategic methods to increase school funding without asking our taxpayers to shoulder the cost is becoming harder each year,"" said Superintendent Donny Lee in an April press release announcing the initiative. More than half of all Texas school districts have passed TRE's, which demonstrates that communities support their children and public education.""

Former Breckenridge High School Principal, Bryan Dieterich, was one of 8 outstanding school administrators honored at the Vocational Agriculture Teachers Association of Texas conference this morning. This award is in honor of exceptional achievements made by administrators who have made significant contributions to agriculture education.

Mr. D, as most of our students call him, was an agriculture teacher prior to his long running service as high school principal. As an administrator he could still recite the FFA creed and taught students the significance of the Lonestar degree. His support of BHS Ag teachers and FFA members has promoted student leadership through agriculture and has grown the BHS FFA program to one of the best in the state of Texas. Our hats off to you Mr. D! Thank you for your support.

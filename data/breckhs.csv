BUCKAROO football fans!

Today, season tickets go on sale to last years season ticket holders. They go on sale to the public next Wednesday, August 12th.

You can purchase them at BISD Administration Office. Monday-Friday 8am-4pm (closed from 12-1).

They are $30 each.

We ask that you keep in mind there are orders in place that we have to adhere to. DUE TO COVID, things may look and run different this year. Like the stores, we have to follow the rules put in front of us. We will try to run as normal as possible, but things WILL be different this year.

We hope that next year we can return to normal.

We thank you all for supporting BISD and the Breckenridge Buckaroos. 💚",0.0,"Brittany Edgar

You can purchase them at BISD Administration Office. Monday-Friday 8am-4pm (closed from 12-1).

They are $30 each.

We ask that you keep in mind there are orders in place that we have to adhere to. DUE TO COVID, things may look and run different this year. Like the stores, we have to follow the rules put in front of us. We will try to run as normal as possible, but things WILL be different this year.

We hope that next year we can return to normal.

We thank you all for supporting BISD and the Breckenridge Buckaroos. 💚",2020-08-03 08:33:30,,

So proud of this kid, I know he is going to go do great things at the next level! I didn’t expect to get so emotional today but then again these boys are like my own. What I wanted to say about G that my emotions didn’t let me, is the kind of person he is. I had the privilege to coach Gerardo Palacios for 6 years and he is always was very respectful, good natured, and worked hard. He always had a smile on his face no matter the situation and I liked the confidence he brought to the field.

These two young people took the bull by the horns and made it happen. With school never resuming after Spring Break, it was a formidable challenge to say the least, and they rose up and did Buckaroo-Riffic work -- hard and often highly detailed work! Plus, you just cannot find more courteous and responsible kids! Thanks be to all who sent us pictures and quotes and to the local businesses that bought ads.

BHS 2019-2020 Yearbooks are now on sale. We will add all of the Cap & Gown pictures that Rachelle took this week, and starting next week, we will attempt to get a ton of senior pictures from students/parents and graduation invitation cards, all of which we will add to the yearbook. We are working hard to make an outstanding book in spite of the pandemic. Price is $60.00. Book delivers the first or second week of August, and we will have some kind of organized get-together and book signing if at all possible. Here's the link to purchase the book online, and that's how we need to do it given the circumstances. We already have an excellent cover, care of Mia Hughins, and the main editors, Katlyne Andrade and Isaak Eutimio, have done a masterful job of showcasing school life in every aspect right up to spring break. Students will vote online for Senior Superlatives next week. Go, Bucks!

About Regular School Underclassmen Portraits & Senior Tux & Drape Pictures: We went through all of the formal high school pictures today. These are the numbers of missing shots or portraits: 11 Freshmen; 12 Sophomores; 12 Juniors; and, 11 Seniors who did not take a Tux & Drape photo. On Wednesday, 04/29/20, I, Mr. Best, will spend the morning calling all of these students on the phone. The retakes for those will be with Rachelle Jones on Wednesday, 05/06/20 at Bailey Auditorium. I will post this Wednesday afternoon the exact schedule.

We should be able to take limited retakes of Tux & Drape pictures on Wednesday, 05/06/20 but will need to do so with social distancing in mind. If you need a Senior Tux & Drape retake, please email Calvin Best so that he can set it up on a shoot schedule with Rachelle.

Dear Buckaroos & Parents:

The Texas Department of Agriculture has once again changed their rules and are no longer allowing BISD to provide meals during weekends. Therefore, effective immediately, we will only be providing breakfast and lunch, Mondays through Fridays.

Also, effective Monday, April 6, 2020, BISD will reduce the number of feeding sites down to one location. We will serve meals out of the back of the High School Cafeteria. Please refer to the BISD website for the map - this is for DRIVE-THRU meals only. Our service hours will change to 11:00 AM-1:00 PM, Monday through Friday. We apologize for any difficulties this may create, but these changes are outside the control of BISD.

Thank You

Starting Tuesday March 24th, we will only serve once a day, from 11:30 A.M.-1:00 P.M., but we will send home that day's lunch and the next morning’s breakfast.

On Friday, March 27th, and every Friday moving forward, we will send home 6 meals per child: 3 will be for breakfast and 3 will be for lunch. This will provide 2 meals per day per child through Monday morning.

From Mark Young, Head Boys' Track Coach:

The boys JV and Varsity track team traveled to Hamlin last Friday and had a really good showing and represented Breckenridge on a high level. Last season we had an upper class level of competitors. This year 85% of the team are freshmen and sophomores...but that has not stopped them from competing to the best of their abilities and laying it on the line every track meet and every event. This year and our future is very bright!

This fall, BISD is unveiling a new curriculum in schools called the 7 Mindsets (www.7mindsets.com). This curriculum focuses on building a positive mindset within our administration, teachers and students. The idea is to promote a positive culture within our schools. It's not a secret that happy, positive people are more likely to reach their full potential. Our number one goal is always helping each student leave school with the best education they can receive, and this is another piece to building well-rounded citizens.

Each month students will learn a different mindset concept, with lessons taking between 15-20 minutes a week. Students at BHS will learn this lesson on ""Mindset Monday"".

The attached letter explains the program, and each month a new letter will be attached to this page. Strike up a conversation with your student about what they are learning.

Dear Parents,

We need your help! With the sudden closure of school this Spring, students were not able to return all of their school issued equipment, technology or Library books. We need all of those materials back so that we can take inventory and make plans for the 2020-2021 school year. All school issued property has replacement fees. The most common fees are as follows:

ALL Library books - $10

ALL calculators - $100

However, tomorrow, July 1st from 11am - 1 pm will be accepting ALL items with no penalty. This means that YOU WILL NOT BE CHARGED IF YOU RETURN ITEMS (INCLUDING LIBRARY BOOKS AND/OR CALCULATORS) TOMORROW. We will begin preparing invoices for missing materials Thursday, July 2, 2020.

There will be a return box located by the front doors of BJH and at the Buckaroo Field House. You may return items at either location tomorrow only.

Thanks!

THURSDAY WEATHER UPDATE

While we were optimistic temperatures would allow for some thawing this morning, it appears that will not happen in time for a 10am start.

BISD will remain closed, Thursday.

Administration will begin working on a plan to address missed time, as this closing will take us over the allowable limits. Thank you for your patience as we try to make the best decisions possible for our kids and community. That often means waiting until weather presents itself, rather than reacting to forecasts which are not always accurate.

Dear Buckaroos & Parents:

The Texas Department of Agriculture has once again changed their rules and are no longer allowing BISD to provide meals during weekends. Therefore, effective immediately, we will only be providing breakfast and lunch, Mondays through Fridays.

Also, effective Monday, April 6, 2020, BISD will reduce the number of feeding sites down to one location. We will serve meals out of the back of the High School Cafeteria. Please refer to the BISD website for the map - this is for DRIVE-THRU meals only. Our service hours will change to 11:00 AM-1:00 PM, Monday through Friday. We apologize for any difficulties this may create, but these changes are outside the control of BISD.

BISD Families --
We will not be asking you to return students' library books at this time! If you have our library books at your house, please enjoy them!! In the meantime, please follow this page. I will be posting lots of resources for online reading, as well as hosting some fun competitions for our BISD kiddos. Remember, we want our kiddos reading EVERY DAY for at least 20 minutes. If you are at home with your kiddos, try to find space for reading every day for you too. Reading can be incredibly healing, and it's a great way to escape from the moment when things seem overwhelming. Much love to all of our students and families during this time!",0.0,"A message from our BISD Library page -- be sure to follow them for great online reading resources!

BISD Families --
We will not be asking you to return students' library books at this time! If you have our library books at your house, please enjoy them!! In the meantime, please follow this page. I will be posting lots of resources for online reading, as well as hosting some fun competitions for our BISD kiddos. Remember, we want our kiddos reading EVERY DAY for at least 20 minutes. If you are at home with your kiddos, try to find space for reading every day for you too. Reading can be incredibly healing, and it's a great way to escape from the moment when things seem overwhelming. Much love to all of our students and families during this time!",2020-03-20 12:58:27,,

üòçIt's #GivingTuesday today! üòç I'd love for my FB friends to consider donating an online gift card for my students at South Elementary to buy books from our Book Fair this week!

Did you know that 61% of kids from low-income families do not have books at home to read?üò≠ And ACCESS to books is the #1 contributing factor to developing reading skills and developing a love of reading... which we all know can be life-changing!

I am running a Book Fair all this week at South and would love to get books into the hands of our students who can't afford one otherwise. Would you consider helping me? Your donation of a $10 gift card could actually buy a book for TWO students! Such a small gesture can make a huge impact!üìö

Here's how to do it (it's SO EASY!!)... Go to www.follettgift.com and select a gift card. Email the gift card to me at abby.moore@breckenridgeisd.org, and I'll make sure it gets to a kiddo who needs it! Also, please share this graphic with your friends!

If you plan to pick up your child after school, we have updated our procedures! These changes will ensure safety for our students and will hopefully create a smoother process overall. Check out the diagram below for instructions! Some things to note:

* We will mark 3 lanes (one for each grade level). If you have siblings in multiple grades, just choose a line to use throughout the year.

* Teachers will be walking students to their cars, and all traffic will remain STOPPED until given a signal to go. This will help maintain safety for all students and faculty.

* Do not park in the parking lot. Please pull into one of the corresponding lanes.

* Any students whose parents are parked elsewhere (i.e. along Elliott, Shelton, etc.) will be considered walkers. For safety concerns, they will be the last students released to go.

While we were optimistic temperatures would allow for some thawing this morning, it appears that will not happen in time for a 10am start.

BISD will remain closed, Thursday.

Administration will begin working on a plan to address missed time, as this closing will take us over the allowable limits. Thank you for your patience as we try to make the best decisions possible for our kids and community.

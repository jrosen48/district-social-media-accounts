Fun fact: running will help reduce stress and anxiety. It’ll also help enhance the immune system. Even though there may not be a DK gift card on the line, you will still be rewarded. You will be improving your health mentally and physically and to me, that is the best reward anybody could ever receive!

The best of luck to all of the students the rest of the year!

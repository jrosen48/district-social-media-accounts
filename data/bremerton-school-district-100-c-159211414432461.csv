On Friday, we sent out a link to our Fall 2020 Connected Learning Start-Up Guide for families, with some important updates.

However, we have made another very important update TODAY based on new information from OSPI this morning.

Today, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced that schools can continue serving free meals to ALL children into the fall months.

That means we can serve meals to ALL children age 18 and under (or up to age 21 if enrolled in the District). STUDENT IDs will NOT be required after all!

We are so thankful for this late-breaking news that will help ensure children have access to nutritious food as our community recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Throughout its history, NASA has made numerous critical and exciting discoveries, and has improved our access to space. Their missions inspire our youngest generation to pursue education in the crucial fields of science and technology - which can help lead to more job opportunities for them in the future, more qualified employees for local employers, and more economic resiliency for our communities. I’m thrilled to be able to host a virtual student Town Hall and Q&A session on August 11 with NASA Astronaut and Washington-native, Dr. Michael Barratt, and NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine, to discuss NASA’s Artemis program which aims to land the first woman and next man on the Moon in 2024 – and answer questions about how an education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) can help ensure today’s students can be successful and innovative in the workforce.

Research shows that students learn best when they are healthy, safe and feel connected to their school. This can help students avoid unnecessary absences and reach their full academic potential.

Mrs. Crisp’s class at Kitsap Lake Elementary has been doing a ""Noon Zoom"" meeting every weekday since school buildings closed. Mrs. Crisp tries to recreate the morning meeting they had every day in the classroom which includes a greeting (each week is a different language), a share, and then a fun activity. Some of their favorite activities are ""Mad Libs,"" directed drawing, quick writes/discussion and scavenger hunts. Mrs. Crisp has been having 17-19 kids participate everyday (out of 21)...and a few times she’s had 100% participation. Parents have shared with Mrs. Crisp that sometimes the morning meeting is the thing that gets their kids out of bed. For Mrs. Crisp, it has been a great way to continue building relationships and an easy way for families to ask questions - and have fun with her students.

We are celebrating Fun Friday (and teachers!) all week!

Teachers change their students every day. With the abrupt end to the physical school year, our teachers have done even more to continue education with virtual classrooms and home-based lessons. All to ensure every student has the tools they need to reach their full potential.

It's in these challenging times that we truly recognize and appreciate how our educators play such a pivotal role in our children’s lives—inspiring a lifelong love of learning and discovery and making a difference in their well-being and long-term success.

While we often thank our teachers every day, it’s during Teacher Appreciation Week when we like to pause and really show our love for the teachers in our lives. We encourage our students and families to take a moment this week to reach out and thank their teachers!

April is designated as the Month of the Military Child, underscoring the important role military children play in the armed forces community. Month of the Military Child is a time to applaud military families and their children for the daily sacrifices they make and the challenges they overcome.

Because we are in a military community, we have applied for and received three department of Defense Activity (DoDEA) grants that fund programs and support for the entire District and help pay for our 1:1 Chromebook Initiative, our AVID Schoolwide system, professional development for staff, STEM activities (including our annual Math Blast/STEM Night) and much more!

Join us on this sunny Friday in honoring our military families and children today by wearing purple - and sharing your photos with us in the comments!

Dear folks! The Brigade needs some help! Our normal distribution sources and food drives are out of commission during this crisis. But we're still trying to help 150 families in need in our community.
For instance, we're using our last shelf-stable milk supplies in the 'Take Home' bags going out Wednesday.
So, please look at the accompanying picture, and if you are out shopping and can grab some of these items to donate, please do.
Donations can be dropped off by appointment at the pantry (please call Myra Battin at (360) 471-9588) or at the Kitsap Habitat Store, 3451 Wheaton Way.
Schools are done for the this school year but we will continue to aid families in need in conjunction with the Bremerton School District Grab-N-Go meal program.
Thank you, Bremerton, for your help in making this possible.

**Students can get meals at ANY school in the District - not just their own school! We invite you to go to any location that is convenient for your family.

**As more families participate in the program, our buses may be running late. Please plan on the possibility of buses running 10-15 minutes late. Thank you for your patience. Families can also go to any bus stop convenient to them.

Rates are per $1000 of assessed value.

Here is how to calculate the estimated impact on a home assessed at $200,000:

>>Current rate: $3.14 x 200 = $628 / 12 months = $52.33 per month

>>Proposed rate: $3.73 x 200 = $746 / 12 months = $62.16 per month

If the two replacement levies pass, the owner of a $200,000 home would see an estimated increase of $118 annually, or $9.83 per month.

This rate per thousand is actually LOWER than the local rate in 2017, before the state changed its funding mechanism for school operations and programming due to the ""McCleary Decision.""

It is important to remember these are estimates. Voters approve a collection amount and the actual rate per thousand is determined based on assessed values of homes in the area.

Around 7:00 a.m., a bicyclist reported that a bus made contact with her bike while the bus was traveling at very low speed, turning from 13th Street onto Lincoln Avenue.

Our transportation dispatcher contacted 9-1-1. The State Patrol and Bremerton Police Department responded. They found no evidence that contact was made with the bus. The bicyclist did not report any injuries. No citation was written.

One student reported hitting her head on the seat in front of her when the bus stopped. She was given an ice pack and her parent/guardian is being contacted.

We will be notifying parents of students assigned to Bus L this afternoon - after school is out so we aren't interrupting parents' work days with a non-emergency ""robo-call.""

If your child isn’t comfortable talking to strangers or has a hard time expressing herself in writing, work together to come up with a different way for her to show her appreciation. She could try giving a smile or a thumbs up if someone holds the door, or show grandma how much she loves her new coat by drawing a thank you picture (or taking a smiling selfie!) instead of writing a card.

Have a talk. For some kids, especially young children or those who have trouble understanding emotions, it can help to have a talk about how showing appreciation makes other people feel. Try asking your child how he feels when people say thank you to him for doing something nice, and then how he feels when they don’t. Going over his own feelings will help him understand how his behavior affects others and make it easier for him to understand the emotional benefits of being grateful.

Point out generosity. Call attention to it when people (including your kids!) do things that go beyond what’s expected — helping without being asked, being especially thoughtful, or taking extra time to do something because it’s important to someone else. Send the message that you will notice if they knock themselves out for you, or for someone else.

Throughout the month, we'll be sharing 10 tips from the Child Mind Institute on how to raise a grateful child.

Here is tip #1: Set an example. Kids learn a lot from watching their parents. Show them what it means to be grateful by offering a genuine “thank you!” to a waitress who serves your food, a helpful neighbor, someone who holds the door open for you. But don’t stop there — include your kids, too. Thanking children for doing things that are helpful, even when they are chores like putting away toys, reinforces the behavior and lets them know they’re appreciated.

_________
Welcome to Almost, Maine, a town that’s so far north, it’s almost not in the United States—it’s almost in Canada. And it almost doesn’t exist. Because its residents never got around to getting organized. So it’s just…Almost.

One cold, clear Friday night in the middle of winter, while the northern lights hover in the sky above, Almost’s residents find themselves falling in and out of love in the strangest ways. Knees are bruised. Hearts are broken. Love is lost, found, and confounded. And life for the people of Almost, Maine will never be the same.

Welcome to Almost, Maine, a town that’s so far north, it’s almost not in the United States—it’s almost in Canada. And it almost doesn’t exist. Because its residents never got around to getting organized. So it’s just…Almost.

One cold, clear Friday night in the middle of winter, while the northern lights hover in the sky above, Almost’s residents find themselves falling in and out of love in the strangest ways. Knees are bruised. Hearts are broken. Love is lost, found, and confounded. And life for the people of Almost, Maine will never be the same.

ALMOST, MAINE: It’s love. But not quite.

“Yesterday, we talked about how in second grade we “get what we need, not just what we want.”
To start the conversation, each student told a time they got hurt and where the injury was. I simply said ""I'm so sorry to hear that. Let's get you a band aid."" No matter where the injury was (head, arms, knees, elbows) everyone got a band aid on their hand.
There was confusion at first, but then we talked about how I DID give each a band aid so they should be perfectly fine! The students, on their own, agreed they all got band aids, but it wasn't okay because they didn't get them where they NEEDED them. This led to a great discussion about self awareness and knowing what they need (educationally and emotionally) and how teachers try to make sure each person gets what they NEED even when they may not WANT to do what teachers ask.”

To start the conversation, each student told a time they got hurt and where the injury was. I simply said ""I'm so sorry to hear that. Let's get you a band aid."" No matter where the injury was (head, arms, knees, elbows) everyone got a band aid on their hand.
There was confusion at first, but then we talked about how I DID give each a band aid so they should be perfectly fine! The students, on their own, agreed they all got band aids, but it wasn't okay because they didn't get them where they NEEDED them. This led to a great discussion about self awareness and knowing what they need (educationally and emotionally) and how teachers try to make sure each person gets what they NEED even when they may not WANT to do what teachers ask.”
This is a great example of how in Brentwood, we see each child and support them along their individual pathway! Thanks to Mrs. Walkenbach for sharing!",2019-08-28 15:54:00,,

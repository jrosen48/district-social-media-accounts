Finally, in this time of civic unrest, let's continue to do what the Brentwood Community does best—listen carefully and hear other people's concerns and criticisms because only when we look to improve individually can we hope to improve our communities.

Thank you and have a great week and we look forward to seeing everyone soon. #BrentwoodProud #BrentwoodStrong",2020-06-07 21:52:12,,

April 6, 2020

Governor Cuomo extended the date schools will be closed until April 29th. That is exactly two weeks later than the last closing.

The district will still be offering breakfast and lunch at the six schools, but we will be giving out meals for multiple days on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

Also, today we were told that all Regents examinations scheduled for June have been cancelled. We have not received any additional guidance from the State Education Department on what those cancellations mean to our high school students but as soon as we find out we will communicate that to the community.

On behalf of the Board of Education and the staff we hope that everyone continues to stay safe and healthy. #BrentwoodProud #BrentwoodStrong",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2841744079275627&id=347511038698956,,0.0,"A Message from Mr. Richard Loeschner, Superintendent of Schools:

On Monday we will provide food for Monday/Tuesday, Wednesday we will provide for Wednesday/Thursday and on Friday we will provide for Friday/the weekend.

Also, we will be continuing with our Learn at Home this week, so we encourage every student and family to continue to check the district website and your school's webpage and expect to hear from your teachers throughout the week.

Brentwood’s students in Mr. Sequoyah Wharton’s Media Communications/Broadcast TV class are breaking down the narratives around stereotypes and misconceptions for the PBS NewsHour’s Student Reporting Labs. With new gear—Canon camera and apparel generously donated by PBS PBS NewsHour—students will conduct interviews with their peers to discuss a time when students in the building felt misunderstood, labeled or stereotyped. Afterwards, the raw footage will be distilled into small video segments and short clips to be featured on social media and the PBS NewsHour nightly broadcasts. This project-based learning not only allows students to understand stereotyping and each other’s experiences, but to take on the challenge to help change the narrative in our community.

It wasn’t just the numbers on the scoreboard from the varsity football team’s victory over Riverhead that impressed the crowd. It was the Brentwood players’ character that truly shined through. Nearly halfway through the National Anthem sung by a Riverhead student, the microphone malfunctioned, and her voice became barely audible. Shortly after, the voices of the young men in Brentwood Indians uniforms could be heard joining in song with the young lady, ensuring our National Anthem was heard by every fan in the stadium that afternoon. The district is proud of our students and players who have learned to help one another, to come together in times of need, to have empathy, and to be kind.

Inspired by the National Organization for Rare Diseases, Brentwood’s staff had an incentive to wear jeans if they donated $5 to the organization in honor of the organization’s slogan, “Hope is in our genes.” In one day, Laurel Park raised a total of $200, all of which will be donated to the National Organization for Rare Diseases.

The goal behind the event is to vastly increase knowledge throughout the general public, as well as encourage researchers and decision makers to address the needs of those living with rare diseases. Since its start, thousands of events have taken place in honor of Rare Disease Day, and hundreds of thousands of lives have been touched. #BrentwoodProud #BrentwoodStrong",2019-03-11 18:00:28,,

This is Michael Chimente, I hope that this message finds all of your family and you well. I was holding out hope that we would return to school, which would provide some normalcy for all of us. However, that does not appear to be the case. Based on all of the information that we are hearing/receiving from CDE, it appears that we will be physically closed for the rest of this school year. I appreciate all that you are doing helping us to maintain and continue the education for all of our students. Once the ""shelter-in-place"" ban is lifted, we will schedule Scholarship Night, Graduation, and in conjunction with the Sober Grad Foundation, a celebration for our Seniors.

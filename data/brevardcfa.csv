The long awaited announcement of how schools will re-open was delivered today. Governor Cooper announced that all public schools in North Carolina will re-open this fall under Plan B, which is a combination of in-person and online learning for every student. This plan will allow Brevard Academy, as well as surrounding schools, flexibility to choose more restrictive measures, as necessary.

We have been working diligently on plans for each of the three options laid before us earlier this summer. Now that we have received guidance from the governor, we will begin solidifying plans to safely begin the school year this fall. As always, our top priority is the safety of our staff, students, and families.

We will make an official statement with the processes and procedures once they are approved. Please remember we are holding weekly Q&A’s via Facebook live and will be rolling out info as it is made available. As always, thank you for your time, patience, and support.

Dear Bulldog Parents,

Thank you for all your support throughout the school year and especially since the school closed on March 13. The end of the school year is always bittersweet, but this year it is especially challenging. We all miss seeing your children each day and working with them in our classrooms.

We will be working over the summer in order to prepare for the 2020-2021 school year. We are currently working on several different scenarios based on the information that we have at this time. If this last quarter has taught us anything, it is that information changes regularly and we have to be able to adapt. We are using this lesson as we plan for our re-opening on August 12, 2020.

Ready for National #CharterSchoolsWeek?

National Charter Schools Week has just started!

This year’s theme is Above and Beyond - inspired by the extraordinary work of charter schools, the strength and resilience of school leaders, teachers, students, families and communities during the coronavirus pandemic.

Please share with us how TMSA schools are going above and beyond to serve you and share your selfies with signs why you love your school! Also, do not forget to follow this week’s agenda!

All charter schools are public, tuition-free and open to all students. They provide high-quality instruction from teachers who have the autonomy to design a classroom that fits their students’ needs. Many also provide wrap-around services such as food pantries, adult learning opportunities, and healthcare service to the students and families they serve.

Governor Cooper has issued an executive order to close all NC Public Schools beginning on Monday, March 16 for at least two weeks. As a public charter school, this immediate closure applies to us as well.

Brevard Academy will be closed beginning March 16-March 27.

The BA-CFA Board and I will be meeting tomorrow to discuss our family support plan during this closure. I will have more information for you tomorrow during my regular Sunday Message.

Please know that we have already been discussing how to stay in regular communication with our families in order to support our students and help answer questions.

Your BA team has set up an email address, baclosed@brevardacademy.school, where you can send questions about this closure in order to allow us to help address this unprecedented event.

Again, Brevard Academy is closed beginning March 16. I will have more information for you tomorrow at 4:30.

In a recent address to the state of North Carolina by Governor Roy Cooper, and in light of the declaration of a state of emergency, recommendations have been put forth regarding the gathering of large crowds of people. In Governor Cooper's statement, all events of over 100 people in close proximity should be canceled or postponed.

Following this advice, and after thorough discussion, the board and administration of Brevard Academy have decided to postpone the middle school dance indefinitely. We are still closely monitoring the situation at hand and will keep you informed of any changes or updates. We do hope to reschedule the dance to a later date.

Daddy Daughter Date Night
Friday, February 7th 6:30-7:30 pm in the Rogow Room

Girls ages 4-9 and their dads or grandads (or any father figure), can dress their best and bring their dancing shoes for a special night for Daddy and Daughter.

We’re serving up Daddy-Daughter stories, a craft, and dessert. Don’t forget to stop and have your photo taken as you arrive.

This is a free event, but registration is required and space is limited. Call 884-3151 ext. 3 or come to the Youth Services desk at the Library. Support provided by the Friends of the Library.

We are currently monitoring the weather and will make the best decision in the interest of student safety based on current weather conditions.

Present weather conditions in Brevard and the surrounding areas show that the temperature will remain above freezing until this evening.

If you feel the need to pick up your child due to hazardous road conditions, please use your best judgment.

At this time, we are operating on a regular schedule with all bus routes. If this changes, I will update you according to our inclement weather policy, which can be found on our homepage. Please do not call the office about closures because it clogs the phone lines.

Ms. Susan VandeWeghe brought in her handmade marionettes for a Jazzy Strings show that had the students and staff completely enthralled.

“Jazzy Strings is a wonderful mixture of puppetry and the music of the early 20th century. Each piece of Big Band, Dixieland and Ragtime music seem to have been written just for the puppet that performs to it. Katrina flies on her trapeze to George Gershwin’s brilliant “Rhapsody in Blue” performed by the Glenn Miller Orchestra; a special Hula Dancer teams up with Spike Jones and his “Hawaiian War Chant”, Bone Jangles falls apart when he hears Scott Joplin’s fabulous Ragtime, and many more. “

Americans buy 29 billion water bottles a year. For every six bottles people buy, only one is recycled. That leads to a big problem given the fact that water bottles do not biodegrade, but rather photodegrade. This means that it takes at least up to 1,000 years for every single bottle to decompose, leaking pollutants into our soil and water along the way. Yuck!

Toss your plastic bottled water habit for good! A cultural shift can change the way plastic water bottles affect our environment.

Do you know how Veterans Day came about?

The short version is:

In 1938, Armistice Day was passed, as a day earmarked to honor the end of World War I and the veterans who served, which officially took place on November 11, 1918.

With the end of World War II and the Korean War, it became necessary to amend the Act of 1938 to include American veterans of ALL wars.With that, the name “Armistice” was changed to “Veterans”, as it remains today.

This amazing opportunity allows your children to learn in the extensive outdoor classrooms provided by the Pisgah and Dupont forests. Muddy Sneakers brings an adventurous twist to learning basic life skills, carrying out scientific experiments, and how to work as a team.

Last month, the BA 5th grade class ventured out to DuPont to learn about energy. They participated in experiments from building nests to making tea from pine needles. How cool?!

All students will write reflective entries into journals for each expedition, that they will bring home at the end of the year.

Have a wonderful trip Bulldogs and a big thank you to the leaders of Muddy Sneakers!

It is statutorily set as “the Tuesday next after the first Monday in the month of November” or “the first Tuesday after November 1”.

Ever wonder how dates like this were selected?

Well, for election day in particular, the weather and farming dictated when elections were held. In the 1800s, the agrarian economy was an important factor. In fact, farming was the occupation of 69 percent of working Americans and farmers weren’t able to travel easily until the harvest was over. Also, the onset of winter conditions in some areas made travel a problem, so elections happened in the late fall.

And now you know!

This is a difficult day for our Football Players and Cheerleaders who have worked very hard over the summer to stay in shape and have had a great week/two weeks of practice. We will be receiving further guidelines from MHSAA on Wednesday regarding allowed fall coach-player workouts as well as concepts for the spring football season dates, format and playoffs. The coaching staff and I are committed to helping our young athletes through this time and finding a way to make Spring Football the best experience we can for our athletes. As I receive more information, I will pass it on to the coaches and communicate through the BRH Facebook Page.

Tomorrow evening at 7:00 est, I’ll be doing a live story time on our BRH Library page. Unfortunately due to copyright laws, the video can only be shown while live and I cannot post the video to be played at a later time. I’ve never done this before, so tomorrow will be a trial run. We’ll see how it goes and hopefully, if I have enough viewers, I’ll set up other times during the week.
Reading to the students at BRH is my favorite part of my job and I want to continue reading aloud to the students and any other kids who want to watch! Join me on Facebook tomorrow evening!",2.0,"Bark River Harris Library

I hope everyone enjoyed their Christmas break and are heading into the new year healthy and happy.

Dixie and I want to send out a very big thank you to the PTO and all the BR-H family for helping us with Dixie’s medical bills. The money was greatly appreciated. Dixie is much more careful when she is heading out of the house to ""chase"" things. Her vet Dr. Kurt said she has made pretty much a full recovery from her injury and today when I put her collar on to come to school she pranced out to the car. She was eager to get back into the normal routine. She LOVES her work at school!

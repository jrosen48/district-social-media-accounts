‚ÄúThe performance was the perfect complement to support our new writing program, and a valuable way of helping students brainstorm ideas and spark their imaginations,‚Äù Todd Principal Colleen O‚ÄôNeill-Mangan explained.

The experience, generously funded by the Briarcliff PTA, began in the second-grade classrooms with students assigned to write a story of any length on any topic. These stories - four in total, three by a single author and one collaboration by two classmates! - were then sent to the Story Pirates. The end result, four original performances for all Todd kindergarten through second graders.

‚ÄúThe performance was the perfect complement to support our new writing program, and a valuable way of helping students brainstorm ideas and spark their imaginations,‚Äù Todd Principal Colleen O‚ÄôNeill-Mangan explained.

The experience, generously funded by the Briarcliff PTA, began in the second-grade classrooms with students assigned to write a story of any length on any topic. These stories - four in total, three by a single author and one collaboration by two classmates! - were then sent to the Story Pirates. The end result, four original performances for all Todd kindergarten through second graders.

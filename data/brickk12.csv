Farrell, Superintendent of Schools",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=140174920858700&id=102966661246193,,0.0,"Given the Governor’s message on the inevitability of directed school closings, and after consultation with the Executive County Superintendent as well as the Ocean County Health Department on the increased activity of the Coronavirus; we will be closing schools Monday, March 16th and anticipate being closed through Friday, March 27th.

However, we will evaluate weekly and update all accordingly. We will be implementing our home instruction remote learning preparedness plan in an effort to be proactive in combating the spread of this virus. This plan will go into effect Monday, March 16th and will remain in place until school reopens.

Further information regarding the remote learning plan will be made available to parents via Blackboard and the District website by Monday, March 16th.

A letter from the Brick Township Public Schools Superintendent, Dr. Thomas Farrell has been posted on the district website. The Brick Township Public Schools believes that communication is important to address concerns and cease rumors; this communique provides clarity that we have developed a plan and are in constant contact with the NJDOE and the NJDOH as we monitor and assess the changing conditions. We have clear guidelines from the NJDOE, as well as the CDC, and any updates and advisement will be forthcoming through Blackboard directing you to check the District website. We have been adhering to stringent disinfectant cleaning protocols throughout the District; this weekend we will increase the level of the stringent disinfectant cleaning in each of our schools. Moving forward, if implementation of the home instruction through the remote learning plan is necessary, we will work together to ensure access and equity for continued instruction for all learners.

“As part of Teacher Appreciation Week, I had the honor and privilege of surprising the deserving NOETA Award semifinalists at their homes,” said NOLA-PS Superintendent Dr. Henderson Lewis, Jr. “It was wonderful getting to celebrate their achievement. This is truly an incredible group of teachers who value their profession and have dedicated their lives to educating our students even during this challenging time.”

Orleans Parish School Board",,,0.0,"Congratulations, Ms. Clabeaux!
.
On Tuesday, May 5, NOLA PS honored a total of fifteen 2020 New Orleans Excellence in Teaching Award (NOETA) semifinalists. Terri Clabeaux, Bricolage 4th grade teacher, is one of this year's finalist. NOLA PS surprised her and other finalists with a social distancing visit at their homes that included the dropping off of a special lawn sign to recognize these individuals for their outstanding work as Orleans Parish educators.
.
“As part of Teacher Appreciation Week, I had the honor and privilege of surprising the deserving NOETA Award semifinalists at their homes,” said NOLA-PS Superintendent Dr. Henderson Lewis, Jr. “It was wonderful getting to celebrate their achievement. This is truly an incredible group of teachers who value their profession and have dedicated their lives to educating our students even during this challenging time.”

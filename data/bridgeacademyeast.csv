GEE’s Got Talent

This Spring, any GEE students may compete in weekly competitions. We will have a different competition each week with some prizes up for grabs and bragging rights on the line. Each participant must submit pictures/videos to the following email address; gottalent@gee-edu.com please include your name, academy, and grade level.

Our panel of GEE judges will vote on the submissions and declare the winners on GEE’s Facebook page.

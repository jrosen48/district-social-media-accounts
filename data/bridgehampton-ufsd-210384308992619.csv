For this activity, all you need is a cup of water and something to paint with - a paint brush, Q-tip, or even your finger.
Parents, here are some questions/prompts to ask your child as they water paint:
• What letters and numbers can you make?
• Can you write your name?
• What letters are in your name?
• Can you make the letter V?
• What shapes can you make?
• Can you finish painting your name before the sun starts drying it up?
• Let's paint a picture! Can you tell me about your painting?
• Find an object outside and try water painting a picture of it.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3182425981788422&id=210384308992619,,0.0,"Thanks to Ms. Lemon for this quick video!

The Bristol FFA Officer Team completed an officer development workshop yesterday. Setting norms on a leadership team is important for helping to establish expectations of team members and creating a functional and productive leadership team. They discussed forms of effective communication, organization, and participation.
The final activity was to write instructions on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for another group to follow exactly, simple right? There might have been a few steps left out on some instructions..... give it a try.

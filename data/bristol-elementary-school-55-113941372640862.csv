Re: Reopening of Schools

The Newfound Schools Administrative Team is working diligently to develop a plan to safely reopen our schools. Committee work is being done by our Administrators, Administrative Assistants, School Nurses, Facilities Director, Technology Director and Teachers.

Our work includes developing plans for Technology, Health Management, Social Emotional Learning, Teaching and Learning, Special Education, Logistics, Professional Development and Facilities.

Through the work of these committees we are confident that we will be prepared to open schools safely.

We are planning to present our reopening plan to the NASD school board on August 3rd. The plan will be distributed to all stakeholders after the school board meeting.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=585203725514622&id=113941372640862,,0.0,"A message from our Superintendent

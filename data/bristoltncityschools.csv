Since last week’s communication about prom, the COVID-19 case counts in Sullivan County have risen significantly. According to officials with the Sullivan County Health Department, the case numbers are expected to continue to trend upward. As such, we have made the difficult decision to cancel our 2020 Prom. For students who have already purchased tickets, a full refund will be issued to the card used in the transaction. Please allow up to three days for the refund to be processed.

At this time, graduation is still scheduled as planned. The format and space available for graduation make it easier to put social distancing safety measures in place, although it may be necessary to further limit the number of guests allowed per graduate. In addition, face coverings will be required by attendees as outlined in Sullivan County Executive Order One issued on July 10. We will provide additional updates about graduation as needed. www.tinyurl.com/thsclassof2020.",14.0,"Please see the important announcement below regarding prom.

As we plan for the opening of the 2020-2021 school year on August 3, the leaders of Bristol Tennessee City Schools are committed to two primary goals: protecting the health and safety of students and staff and providing a high-quality education for all students in our district. To best achieve these goals, we are using all available resources, seeking advice, and gathering feedback from a wide variety of stakeholders. While there will be few simple solutions, it is important to us to honor the many viewpoints and opinions surrounding COVID-19 and any impact our plans may have on families and the broader community.

Please follow the link above to respond to a brief survey based on what you know and feel today about your child returning to school. Upon receiving survey results, we will update all stakeholders on the plan moving forward. The deadline to complete the survey is June 21. Thank you for your input!

Children around the globe are putting rainbows in windows to spread cheer and remind us that we’re all in the fight against the coronavirus together. WHY RAINBOWS? Rainbows spread hope and are a sign of good things to come. The U.S. Census also provides HOPE FOR THE FUTURE by ensuring that federal tax dollars flow back to Bristol for such things as new roads, schools, emergency services, and more.

That's why we're inviting kids in our community to enter our COUNTING RAINBOWS COLORING CONTEST. The deadline to enter is 5 p.m. on May 15. Contest guidelines and a rainbow coloring sheet are available at https://www.bristoltn.org/1436/Counting-Rainbows

Let's decorate Bristol with colorful rainbows!",0.0,"Attention BTCS Families! The deadline has been extended until Wednesday, May 20! Get those rainbows in to win!

City of Bristol TN
May 1 at 10:01 AM ·

Children around the globe are putting rainbows in windows to spread cheer and remind us that we’re all in the fight against the coronavirus together. WHY RAINBOWS? Rainbows spread hope and are a sign of good things to come. The U.S. Census also provides HOPE FOR THE FUTURE by ensuring that federal tax dollars flow back to Bristol for such things as new roads, schools, emergency services, and more.

That's why we're inviting kids in our community to enter our COUNTING RAINBOWS COLORING CONTEST. The deadline to enter is 5 p.m. on May 15. Contest guidelines and a rainbow coloring sheet are available at https://www.bristoltn.org/1436/Counting-Rainbows

On Monday & Tuesday, May 11 & 12, THS will have drive-thru dropoff and pickup set up in front of the school. Students can pick up items (yearbooks, Beta tassels, NHS stoles, etc.) & can also drop off items (librarby books, textbooks, uniforms, etc.). NHS members need to bring $22.25 to pay for their stoles. Seniors who no longer need their computers for a class will also return their chargers, laptops, & backpacks. Underclassmen will keep theirs until we return to school in August. Please scroll through the graphics for details and most importantly SCHEDULED HOMEROOM TIMES. Cars should have a homemade tag with student name and teacher homeroom name. Only students from the homerooms scheduled will be permitted to enter the line. There will be a makeup day on Wednesday from 10-2. Yearbooks will be sold on Wednesday on a first-come, first-serve basis, provided there are available copies.",2.0,"Tennessee High School

TEMPORARY TRAFFIC PATTERN CHANGE (8/26-8/30)

Who: Cars in the Tremont Avenue Lane in the AM and Center Lane on Columbia in the PM

What: Due to the installation of our storm water drain, we need to pull our Tremont Lane of traffic (in the AM) and the middle lane of traffic (in the PM) straight across Edgemont.

Where: Intersection of Columbia Road and Edgemont Ave. The front of our building will be under construction and this will include a lane closure closest to our building on Edgemont. This will cause us to only have one lane turning right coming from Columbia Road to Edgemont Ave. Cars in the center lane on Columbia will have to go straight.

When: Monday, the 26th afternoon, through Friday, the 30th afternoon!

FACTS:
Times do not changes.

You will be directed where to go at the intersection of Columbia Road and Edgemont Avenue.

If you normally use the center lane and need to turn right onto Edgemont, make sure you get in the Columbia lane from the beginning.",6.0,"Please note temporary traffic pattern changes at Vance this week.

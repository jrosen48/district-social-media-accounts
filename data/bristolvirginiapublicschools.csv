We have been notified that a staff member at Stonewall Jackson Elementary School has tested positive for COVID-19. The staff member was not present at school while contagious. As a result, the local health department has determined that no student or staff member experienced exposure to COVID-19. An official notification will be mailed sent to parents. Our prayers are with our colleague for a quick recovery.

This is an excellent time time to remind everyone how important it is to follow our Return to School Plan. Please continue to wear your mask with fidelity, maintain appropriate distance, wash your hands often, and stay home if you are sick.

Thank you,

Please be looking for a survey coming this Friday morning that will give you the opportunity to share your thoughts for the opening of our schools. Please take the time (it will only take a few minutes) to share your input with us, as it is a valuable piece to the development of our plan.

After the framework is built and the survey is administered, we will engage with the numerous parent and teacher volunteers who have expressed a willingness to assist us in creating a plan to return to school. Their input will turn our framework into a living document that makes sense for all stakeholders.

Today, we awarded mini-grants to teachers in the Bristol Virginia Public Schools. Because of our community's investment in the BVPS Education Foundation through giving and fundraising events, our board had the pleasure of adding an additional $1,000 grant this year for a total of THREE $1,000 grants! ❤️

We think it's a pretty great way to end the school year!

This morning, Donna Hale, president of the BVPS Education Foundation, announced our 2019 Creative Classroom Mini-Grant winners:

✅ Dana Rasnick at Van Pelt Elementary School for ""Incorporating Exciting Technology into Classroom Literacy Stations.""

✅ Brittany Minnick at Van Pelt Elementary School for ""Early Childhood Special Education Playground. ""

✅ Donna Mumpower and Kathleen Tabor at Virginia Middle School for ""Creative Arts Studio Workshop.""

Congratulations, winners!

We are so thankful to all the amazing teachers who submitted applications this year, and we wish our panel could have awarded all of you. Thank you for going above and beyond to offer interactive, creative learning opportunities for our students.",0.0,"Congratulations to these very deserving teachers!!!

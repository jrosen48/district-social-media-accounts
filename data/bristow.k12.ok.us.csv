Good morning parents. I want to clear up some confusion about class lists and teachers. When we were originally scheduled to start school on August 10th I had told my teachers to start making contact with students the last week in July. Some were sending letters, others making phone calls, some reaching our through Facebook. As the summer progressed more parents were choosing our online platform. Then our School Board voted to delay the start of school until August 31st. At that point I told teachers to wait to reach out to parents as I was having to shuffle class lists around. For example in 2nd grade I currently have one teacher with 16 students and another with 22. I try to balance the classes as much as possible. If you haven't heard anything yet, please don't take this in a negative way. The teachers are excited and ready to see your child. I hope to have a solid list soon and I promise you will hear from your child's teacher. If you still haven't heard anything by August 20th please call me at Edison 918 367 5521.

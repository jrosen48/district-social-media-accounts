On Monday, July 27th at 12 noon, I would like to host a Google Meet for all members of the elementary school community to address any questions or concerns that you may have about elementary instruction in September.

We still have much to learn about guidance from New York State and other agencies on reopening, but many district employees have been working hard to address whatever scenarios may be present when we begin school, and this will give us an opportunity to share what we have been working on - trust me, it is a lot!

Please use the link below to join the meeting. I‚Äôll do my best to share what I know so far, and to the find out answers to the questions that you may have. The link is https://meet.google.com/tfn-pwpv-jkc

If you would care to send me questions in advance, please send them to rpogue@brunswickcsd.org

The external Wifi is now operational and accessible from our parking lot!

Once in the parking lot, users can select Guest from list of available networks to connect. This will allow you to access the internet from your personal devices (very similar to the process you would use to access internet at a cafe or Starbucks!).

The internet range covers the majority of the parking lot between Tamarac Elementary School and the football field.

A few years ago, our local school started a tradition of a 'Next Step Day'. Seniors would let us know what their 'next step' after high school was by wearing an outfit that represented their choice of college, workforce, military etc.

Here is a (7.5 minute) video I made to help them remember their special day!

You may be aware of the concern that the youth vaping epidemic has put young people at greater risk of harm from COVID-19. Specifically, people who use tobacco products (including electronic cigarettes/vapes) may be more susceptible to COVID-19 and may suffer more severe health-related consequences. The health care community‚Äôs message to current smokers and vapers is clear: There is no better time to quit smoking/vaping than right now.

Last week, we asked you to share how you are practicing thoughtfulness and kindness to those around you and to yourselves. Today, we would like to share the following picture of two of our students, Celia and Emme, who worked on letters to send to residents at the ARC of Rensselaer County.

We hope this brightens your day and jumpstarts your week on a positive note - and thank you, Celia and Emme, for sharing your thoughtfulness with us! We are #BengalProud to have such kind students ü•∞

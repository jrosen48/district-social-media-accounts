We apologize for our mistake when responding related to student face coverings. We communicated the wrong age for required face coverings per the current order as 11 years and over. Governor Abbott's current order states, ""face-covering requirement does not apply to any person younger than 10 years of age.""

have set in order to meet this goal is to survey our parents and community.

One of the priorities we have in our school district is “Quality Service -
Provide quality service to all Brock ISD Stakeholders.” An action step we
have set in order to meet this goal is to survey our parents and community.
If we are going to be a district of continuous improvement, and one that
meets the demands of “quality service,” we must hear from the people that
we serve. That’s all of you. Look for that survey to come out early this
spring so that we may capture your voice

The teacher, Christopher Albrecht, begins the pajama social to build curiosity by sharing objects and inviting students to share ideas about what they have been doing before reading the story for the night. The first craft the team made was bird feeders using toilet paper rolls, bird seed and peanut butter. A clip of students working on one of their crafts can be viewed below.

Mr. Albrecht says he began the read alouds and craft nights because he believes the social emotional learning is just as important as the cognitive learning students get through school.

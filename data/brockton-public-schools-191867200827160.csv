It is with deep sadness that we share a member of the Downey School community passed away Sunday after suffering a tragic accident. We are withholding the child’s name out of respect for his family’s privacy.

Our Student Support Services Department worked with Principal Proudler this morning to contact the child’s classmates and provide emotional support and counseling. Any Downey parent or student who needs to speak to a school adjustment counselor following this tragic news should contact the school’s main office.

Our hearts are with the child’s family and loved ones as they face this terrible loss. The entire school district is here to support the student’s classmates, teachers and loved ones during this time of mourning.

Dear BPS Families,

There are a few updates for the week ahead that I’d like to share with you.

To reduce traffic along Oak Street, starting tomorrow we will be moving the North Middle School grab-and-go location across the street to the Raymond School. All 10 food locations will be open from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. tomorrow. Please visit the Food Program page on bpsma.org for a list of locations.

We know this has been a difficult time for many of our students and families and the most important thing we want you to know is that you are not alone. This community stands with you and we will do our best to support you through this.

This week, we will be adding a help line for students and parents so that you can privately discuss your concerns with a member of our team. We’ll share that information with you as soon as we can, but in the meantime please read my March 19 update on bpsma.org for a list of team members that are currently available to help you.

Thank you for sticking together and supporting our students.

Dear BPS families,

Earlier tonight, Governor Baker announced a three-week statewide closure of all Massachusetts schools. In light of the Governor's announcement, we are now scheduled to return to school on Tuesday, April 7.

Our food program will continue for as long as schools are closed. Information about that program, as well as learning resources for BPS families, are now available on bpsma.org. We will also have printed learning resources available at all four food program locations later this week.

Governor Baker issued an important reminder that these closures and restrictions on social gatherings are intended to limit in-person interaction. Please support these social distancing measures and, most importantly, please stay healthy and safe.

❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ It’s a great day to be a Savage! The Broken Bow High School Choir kids sang at District Solo and Ensemble today. We were scheduled to sing between 10:20am and 5 pm. It was a looooooong but successful day! We had 35 entries today and 29 qualified for state! We came away with 61 medals and 6 excellent certificates! The medals and certificates are great. But the positive attitudes and kind and encouraging words that I heard from them towards their fellow classmates, not to mention the growth that they have made in a few short weeks makes me even prouder! It’s a great day to be a SAVAGE!!!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Special thanks to our amazing accompanist Nancy Wallace Bryant and my partner in crime Raegan Thomas!I cant forget our fearless bus drivers Harley Thomas Jr. and Nate C.

We had 10 Broken Bow 7-9th graders travel to compete on the second round all OCDA state choir. They were in the top 120 kids in their voice part from the whole state. The All State Choir audition process is difficult and requires a lot of hard work and dedication. Students that sang today at second round are the best of the best from all over the state of Oklahoma. The fact that 10 Broken Bow kids worked and earned the opportunity to compete today is something for which they should all be extremely proud.

The alarm went off at 3:45 AM. 44 Broken Bow Choir kids climbed onto 1 bus and left Broken Bow around 5:15 AM. They have worked with a clinician all day to perfect 4 different songs and took part in a wonderful concert tonight. They made some beautiful music today. The thing that I want to brag on is their behavior. We had kids that represented Broken Bow in a very positive way. Our kids acted like ladies and gentlemen. When you have 44 kids and 2 sponsors you need kids that are going to listen to directions and kids that are going to do what they are supposed to do even when we are not standing there holding their hand. It has now been almost 19 hours and we are leaving with a bus full of exhausted but pleasant choir kids. I call this day a SUCCESS! ❤️I am a very proud teacher.",0.0,"Kimberley Anne Hajkowski Thomas

It's a great day to be a Savage! I am so very proud of every student who loaded the bus yesterday morning and went to first round All-State Choir auditions. Special thanks to Mr. Bible for driving the bus and helping chaperone our kids today while Mrs.Thomas and I were judging. Remember it is not always the destination or result that matters most. It is what you gain in the process. This long difficult process began back in August and I am super proud of all of you that chose to take the courageous challenge. Congratulations to the 6 Rector Johnson Middle School students who advanced to the second round All State Choir Auditions.

Very, very proud of a group of girls tonight for winning a game against the 1 seed in our regional, Hilldale. A true nail biter that had all the drama you could ask for. The tightest strike zone I’ve ever seen. A late inning over turned call that didn’t go our way. Bases loaded, no outs, up 3-0 and our freshman RF makes a play on a not shallow fly ball and uncorks a seed to cut the girl down at the plate for a double play. A catch and crash into the wall on a ball that I thought was gone. A 2 out 3 run bomb by a freshman. And with 2 outs in the bottom of the 7th and a runner on 1st, a diving play in the outfield to end it.
Carlyssa Crutchfield put on the best defensive performance I’ve seen from a CF in 12 years of coaching, she balled out!
And we only start 1 senior. Super excited for the potential of this group.

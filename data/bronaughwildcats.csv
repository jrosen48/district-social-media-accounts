We gifted Bronaugh High School their üéì Senior gifts! Jordan Heneger-Dickey with Bronaugh was gracious enough to accept gifts for 8 Seniors!
We are so blessed with our Four-State community, this is a small way we can congratulate the 2020 Seniors.
We will continue reaching out to the schools administrators to receive on behalf of the Class of 2020.
We gifted 20 schools, 2,818 Seniors! Please be patient, we will showcase each school!

We love posting weekly schedules of our Broncs' athletic events. Unfortunately, with the current situation, it could be a full-time job keeping up with schedule changes and restrictions in other school districts, and we don't want to misinform anybody. We strongly encourage you to reach out to family members of athletes about their schedules and restrictions. Our coaches will be keeping them informed of changes and developments. We also encourage you to look at events posted on NFHS Network. You will find many frosh/JV/varsity soccer, volleyball and football games will be live streamed. There is an annual or monthly subscription, but just look at it as gas money and admittance fees saved! Some of Frenchtown's local establishments will also be streaming games, so check their Facebook pages as well.

I have created a Google classroom for the Frenchtown Broncs High School Football Program. It will be an easy way for me to communicate with everyone about upcoming practices and potential summer schedules. We will be having open field every Tuesday and Thursday starting next week. The Google classroom will have the personnel groupings and schedule for each day. The code for the classroom is:

Thank you for all you've done for the Frenchtown community & students. ENJOY! 🧡🖤

""I want to inform everyone that I will be retiring from Frenchtown High School after thirty-six years of teaching and coaching. I can’t believe how fast the time has gone by. It has been a great honor to serve the Frenchtown School District, community and students. I have been very lucky to work with so many outstanding staff members, students and athletes over the years. A special thanks for all the athletes who have worked so hard and made it possible for me to look forward to practice every day over the years. Frenchtown has been a very special place to spend my teaching and coaching years. This isn’t how I pictured my last season of coaching and teaching as a Bronc, but I feel honored in walking out the doors of Frenchtown High School for the last time with an exceptional and extraordinary senior class. Thanks Frenchtown!!! GoBroncs

Congrats to Aidan Cyr for signing with Montana Tech to continue his education and football career. They are lucky to get such a high quality student/athlete!

I would also like to take this moment to announce that I have accepted the Defensive Line position at Montana Tech. I have thoroughly enjoyed my 5 years in Frenchtown and wanted to thank everyone for all of their support. Frenchtown is a special community and has great schools. I wish everyone the best of luck in the future!

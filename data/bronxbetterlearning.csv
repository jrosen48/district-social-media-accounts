When it is finally ours, this freedom, this liberty, this beautiful

usable as earth; when it belongs at last to all,
when it is truly instinct, brain matter, diastole, systole,
reflex action; when it is finally won; when it is more
than the gaudy mumbo jumbo of politicians:
this man, this Douglass, this former slave, this Negro
beaten to his knees, exiled, visioning a world
where none is lonely, none hunted, alien,
this man, superb in love and logic, this man

Our SOAR students became scientists, jumping into the world of cells, cell- structure, chromosomes, and DNA. We had the opportunity to extract DNA from wheat by dissolving lipids from within the cell. We also researched genetic mutations and observed how these mutations have led to various transformations in fruit flies. Last, but not least, we visited their museum, which was dedicated to the theory of evolution. The Museum allowed us to venture back almost 5 million years to see the transformation of the human skeleton, as well as view a replica of the very famous 5000-year-old Otzi, the mummified corpse of an iceman who lived in the Otzal Alps on the Italian-Austrian border during the Stone Age.",2018-05-15 10:16:51,,

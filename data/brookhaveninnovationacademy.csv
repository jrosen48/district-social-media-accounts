You are invited to write a kind ‚ÄúLetter of Love and Appreciation‚Äù to an elderly person within our Georgia community. BIA Parent Council Volunteers will distribute the ‚ÄúLetters of Love and Appreciation‚Äù to elderly who may not have family to visit or care for them during this time. We are collecting cards, videos, photography and/or artwork then, mailing/emailing these to elders in neighborhoods and senior communities across Georgia.

Take a few minutes, sit down, and write a letter, make a 2 minute video, photography, and/or artwork to an elder (a stranger). Tell them about yourself, maybe say a joke or a riddle and let them know that they are loved.

It might feel difficult at first to be writing to someone you don‚Äôt know. Our advice: just pretend like it‚Äôs a conversation! What kinds of things would you want to talk about to a stranger?

Our son Wyatt has developed relationships with teachers who put their personal best into preparing him for real-world scenarios, developing his study skills and creativity as well as allowing him to become a more independent learner.

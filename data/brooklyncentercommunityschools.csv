Have a spring scavenger hunt! What can you see in springtime that's different from the rest of the year? Flowers that only bloom in spring? Pine cones newly uncovered by the melting snow? Get together with the kids to compose a list of things nature brings at springtime. Then go out and collect a sample of each. Want to turn it into a competition? Make two lists, split into teams and race to see who is the first to retrieve everything. Have fun! Share your pics at #CentaurNation!",2020-03-27 14:01:02,,

From our founding UPK Coordinator and Compass parent, Sarah: “Pre-k is a time when children are building foundations for their academic journey through school. Children learn how to be in school, to see themselves as learners and explorers, how to work with others towards a shared goal, how to advocate for themselves and the people around them, and how to take care of a friend who needs something."" https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2IQTD5MFYARYW",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2639309616079158&id=541411829202291,"Check out my list on Amazon

We are planning to hold a Climate Strike March on Friday the 15th at 2PM to honor the hard work of young people worldwide to draw attention to this issue. Our Compass Climate Strike March is being created to allow for developmentally appropriate participation for children of all ages. We are called to action to support this worldwide movement as it connects to our vision of educating for sustainability. Social Justice and the Environment are two of the three pillars of sustainability. After lunch and recess on Friday, we will invite our students and staff to join us in a march around the neighborhood. We plan to end in Fort Greene Park with a few songs that celebrate our commitment to taking care of the Earth. If you would like to join us, please meet us in front of our school at 2PM on Friday.

Please take action and tell your elected officials that you support more federal funding for NY students and schools. Your response will make a difference.

This week, Governor Cuomo reiterated the need for $60 billion in federal aid to mitigate the financial impact of the current crisis. Without that aid, public schools like ours will pay a further price. Prospect Schools supports Governor Cuomo’s call for federal aid and urges our community to support a federally funded package that provides the necessary funds to stabilize state budgets.

As a community, we must stand together and tell our elected officials that New York's children cannot, and should not, bear the burden of this crisis. Perhaps now more than ever, our students need the safety and support of fully funded schools.

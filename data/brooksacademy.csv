We would like to send a huge Thank You to Mrs. Arevalo!
My son has been fortunate enough to have Mrs. Arevalo 2 years in a row as his 1st and 2nd grade teacher.
She has helped and pushed my son to be the best student he can be. She knows what he is capable of and helps him reach his goals.
We are so lucky to have a wonderful teacher like her.
All her students are able to accomplish so much because of her continued support!
Thank you for making a difference in their lives!

Newspaper Gives Brookville Schools Lofty Ranking...

School District Report Card outcomes are often very predictable by the level of income in a community. Students in more affluent districts generally score very well and low income districts often struggle producing high marks. So, the Cleveland Plain Dealer gave a shoutout today to districts that “overperform” when you match the Report Card results with the community median income. Districts were recognized for beating the economic trends with their district grades. Under the formula used to match our Report Card results with our median income Brookville’s Report Card ranked 11th out of 608 Ohio school districts! Our students and staff are to be commended for such awesome results.

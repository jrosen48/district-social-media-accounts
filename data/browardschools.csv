Welcome to the first day of the 2020-21 school year!

Families can learn details about the eLearning model, what students should expect the first day of school, how they can stay involved with online classes, and the criteria the District will use to determine when to transition to face-to-face learning by visiting, browardschools.com/schoolreopening.

We look forward to working together toward another successful school year!

Send a census reminder to your neighbors, friends, or work colleagues, and offer to help if they have any questions.

The #2020Census count will impact the allocation of over $1.5 trillion dollars per year, over the next 10 years, in federal funding for schools, healthcare, hospitals, senior centers, public safety, and nearly all of the critical programs and services in our community.

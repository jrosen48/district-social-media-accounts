We hope you are having a great summer! We are looking forward to
starting another amazing school year with your Kindergarten student.
There are a lot of new and exciting things happening on the Kindergarten
side of the building. The new classroom addition which includes 4 new rooms,
3 of them being Kindergarten rooms, is set to be finished in mid-July. We
have added a few new faces to our Kindergarten team too! Our teachers
this year are: Mrs. Angie Reed, Mrs. Lexi King, and Mrs. Tabitha Bartels.
We couldn’t be more excited to have them teaching your Kindergarten kiddo!
Please remember to contact the office (320) 594-2272 if you are in

THANKS for such great memories we ALL make here at BHS! Seniors thank you for your outstanding leadership on and off the field, court, mat, stage, etc. I know it is tough to stay apart and we can’t be this close right now. We are close at HEART and MINDS because that’s what “FAMILIES” do! I can’t wait to get back to scenes like this with all of you. You are in my thoughts every day. See you all soon!

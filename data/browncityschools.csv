There will still be a 2019-20 yearbook, and we are looking for someone to design the cover. Marion's Studios will be completing the year again this year. This year’s theme will be Covid-19. Seems fitting due to the circumstances.
Students are able to submit an entry into for the contest. Here are the guidelines:
1) Use a white sheet of paper.
2) Use a pencil or pen.
3) The cover drawing will be in one color, so there is no need to use different colors in your drawing.
4) Include Brown City Elementary Yearbook 2019-20, or BCES Yearbook 2019-20 somewhere on your drawing.
5) Have fun with this!
We will be asking for pictures to put inside the yearbook of you at home learning as well. Those pictures can be submitted to your teacher. You never know, your picture may make the yearbook.

Contest submissions will be due by May 15th. You may turn those in to a box out in front of the elementary office.

Wanted to share some ideas that parents could be doing with their children during the time that school is postponed. We will be posting throughout the next three weeks with different ideas either online or traditional things. Here are three sites that your child may want to visit:
1) Exact Path https://www.edmentum.com/products/exact-path
2) Khan Academy https://www.khanacademy.org/
3) Mackinvia Library www.mackinvia.com

Students will be very familiar with these sites since they are used K-12.

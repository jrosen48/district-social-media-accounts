Brown City Jr/Sr High School is proud to announce a summer learning opportunity for all Class of 2021, 2022, and 2023 students. We have teamed up with teachers from across Sanilac County to offer SAT SUCCESS a Free 6-week virtual course. Due to Covid-19 students missed the opportunity to take the Spring PSAT or SAT. We want to provide students the opportunity to avoid the summer slide while refining skills so they can be ready for fall assessments. A high SAT score can afford students more college options and scholarship opportunities. Students may sign up by completing the form at https://bit.ly/SATPREPCLASS Funding for this opportunity is made possible by an MCAN COVID-19 Response Grant.",2020-07-07 11:30:51,,

If you could have your students(s) name(s) & locker #(s) on a large piece of paper in the passenger window, then pop your trunk, and stay in your vehicle. Staff will direct you to the correct door and bring out your belongings in a plastic bag and place them in your trunk. Mr. Bennett and the housekeeping staff have worked very hard to collect locker belongings from all lockers including the lockerroom. If the exact locker number is not known the information can be accessed on Skyward and staff will have spreadsheets to assist them.

There will still be a 2019-20 yearbook, and we are looking for someone to design the cover. Marion's Studios will be completing the year again this year. This year’s theme will be Covid-19. Seems fitting due to the circumstances.
Students are able to submit an entry into for the contest. Here are the guidelines:
1) Use a white sheet of paper.
2) Use a pencil or pen.
3) The cover drawing will be in one color, so there is no need to use different colors in your drawing.
4) Include Brown City Elementary Yearbook 2019-20, or BCES Yearbook 2019-20 somewhere on your drawing.
5) Have fun with this!
We will be asking for pictures to put inside the yearbook of you at home learning as well. Those pictures can be submitted to your teacher. You never know, your picture may make the yearbook.

Contest submissions will be due by May 15th. You may turn those in to a box out in front of the elementary office.

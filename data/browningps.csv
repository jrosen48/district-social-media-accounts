On Friday September 4, Virginia had her first cross country meet in Cutbank at the Sunrise RV Park and it was a very rough one as it was canyon etc! Virginia was having a rough run but when she was about a mile to the finish line and young gal named Hayley Redhorn a varsity runner from Browning grabbed Virginia’s hand and ran with her to the finish line after Hayley had ran the trail herself? What a beautiful angel and so thoughtful! It really is about compassion, and team work even if not in the same school! Hayley deserves a shoutout and if anyone knows her or if wants to share this post please do so!",11.0,"Rena Laubach Morrison

Next week will be a busy one as we all prepare to return to school! Take some time this weekend to familiarize yourself with Google Classroom. This is the way your student will be accessing their classes at BHS this first quarter. Having an understanding of how Google Classroom works will help your student succeed and will hopefully make the transition back to school less stressful.

We will be posting more “how to” videos about our online learning initiatives over the next couple of weeks. Be certain to follow and share our BPS Facebook page for the most useful educational links.

Hi Kids!

Even though Glacier National Park is currently closed, the rangers here still want to share the park with you.

Have you ever spent a summer night by a campfire? Roasted marshmallows? For thousands of years, people have used and relied on fire, but it also plays a critical role in the ecosystems of Glacier National Park.

In this virtual field trip for 4th & 5th grade, you'll see how plants, animals, and people in Glacier are affected by wildland fire. Watch all the videos in this YouTube playlist for the full field trip!

Hi Kids!

Even though Glacier National Park is currently closed, the rangers here still want to share the park with you.

How do you use your five senses? Animals that live in Glacier National Park use their super-senses to see, hear, taste, touch, and smell their way around in the wild.

Take a virtual hike for Kindergartners with Ranger Stephanie to learn more about your five senses and how you can use them to explore in your own backyard. Watch the videos in this YouTube playlist for the full field trip!

Good morning runners!!

We, Roy McNabb, Ross DeRoche, & Shaylea Tatsey, would like to volunteer our time this summer to began our running program.
We know with the COVID-19 we cannot make plans like we want too, but we will make adjustments to abide and follow our reservation ordinances.
We are still rolling ideas as the day comes and the changes keep happening. We want whoever is interested to take part, be safe, and also free welcome to come tag along and run.

We will be posting a plan of a “schedule” which will be mostly on your own/individual training until we can all meet. At this time, build up your miles, drink/eat healthy, lots of rest, and STRETCH!!!!!

Right now, we are wanting to build a list of who is interested/willing/motivated/curious!!Please message one of us or the page..so we can combine our list, and we can contact you to see what we can do for you!

Thank you!!

TUESDAY'S assignment from the Library Queen:
The Library Queen LOVES audiobooks. They are my JAM. I do not go anywhere in my car without listening to an Audiobook!

On https://www.getepic.com/app/ find the audiobooks section. Once you click on audiobooks, scroll down to find ""Creepy Carrots"" This book does not have pictures or written words, it is just listening book. Sit someplace quiet, put headphones on (if you have them) and listen to this fun story. If you feel you have listened very carefully, you can take an AR test on it. The AR quiz number is ... 151429... after you have taken the AR test, let me know what your score was. If you get a 100% I will send you a virtual prize :)
Look in the pictures for the class code, in case you have forgotten. If your name doesn't appear in the list, just sign in as ""GUEST""",0.0,"Jimi Champ

Monday Lesson Plan from The Library Queen:
follow the link https://www.storylineonline.net/books/chesters-way/ and watch ""Chester's Way"" on StoryLine Online. This is one of my favorite stories on StoryLine because it is also told in American Sign Language. ASL is an awesome skill to have. Not only will it help you speak to your friends and family who are hearing impaired, BUT you can also use it as a secret code to speak to your friends. When I was a young Library Queen, my best friend and I could talk to each other in class (sshhhh don't tell anyone that I used to talk in class) using AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE!
After watching the audio book, you can take an AR test if you haven't already. THEN, practice using the ASL that I have attached below and send me a message on this link, in my messenger or to my email jimil@bps.k12.mt.us",2.0,"Jimi Champ

Get Epic! is an awesome ereader resource for our BES students. I have attached pictures for logging into the website. I was unable to make a profile for each student in the school, but I made a profile for boys and girls in each class. Students should find their teacher's name and choose that when logging in. I will ""assign"" books that I think students might be interested in, but feel free to read/watch/listen to whatever you like. There are books to read, books to listen to (that have the words shown) and audio books. Not all books are AR book, however, so students will have to ensure they are by looking for a LEXILE MEASURE on the first ""page"" of the book. If there is a lexile measure, it is an AR book. Please let me know if you have any questions.",9.0,"Jimi Champ

Starting Monday: Fit to a T wit Mr. T 💪

OCSU's Physical Education teacher, Mr. T, is offering PE to all students and adults (within or not) the school district through YouTube Live.

Every week day at 10:00am EST you can view Mr. T live on Youtube for a body weight exercise circuit similar to his traditional PE warmup, but longer and with added content! The intensity of the workouts will be up to you as he will be providing modifications for everything. Let's get the whole family involved! 😀

Each live will be saved on his channel, so don't worry if you can't log on at the scheduled time.

At 4:00pm this afternoon, Mr. T will be conducting a test run of the system so you can practice accessing the channel, learn more about the program and see how this will work on Monday.

This is Larry Fliegelman calling with an update on schoolwork packets.

The staff have been hard at work creating packets of graded work for students in every grade level. Students who are here today will be sent home with their packet and any boots or shoes.

If your child is not at school today, you can come to the school between 3:45-5:00pm today to pick up your packet. Please do not come before 3:45 as we are still hard at work and the buses will be here.

If you cannot come today, please call the school on Wednesday morning to schedule a time on Wednesday to pick up the packet. We will be at the school from 8:00am to 4:30pm.

After Wednesday, the building will not be available for anyone.

Please email me, leave a message on extension 101, or my personal number 472-1118.

When we have more information about the closure or re-opening, we will call.

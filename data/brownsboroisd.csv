We are so pumped to extend to the community a generous discount offered by Chandler Nutrition! They are offering $2 off on any combo. That is any size shake or tea bought together. 🥤🥤

We know this year has been so different, but we want to try and offer the best alternatives to some valuable traditions for our Bear Family - like our community-wide Homecoming Pep-Rally.

We simply cannot follow the COVID-19 regulations by allowing all the campuses and our community inside the stadium. BUT, we are still having our Homecoming Pep Rally for our 9-12 grade students and their parents. The rally will start at 9:15am this Friday and parents of participants are welcome to sit in the lower middle section on the home side.

For those that can’t come this year, our Communications Intern team will be live streaming on Facebook. So, come back right here on Friday with your virtual spirit and join the festivities from your home.

We look forward to celebrating with you wherever you are. 💙💛🏈🙌🏻🗣

Did you know that today is #NationalTeddyBEARday? History has it that in 1902, that US President Theodore Roosevelt refused to shoot a bear cub while hunting in Mississippi and the incident made national news. Clifford Berryman published a cartoon of the event in the Washington Post and the caricature became an instant classic.

The cartoon then inspired New York store owner Morris Michtom to create a new toy. Mr. Michtom wrote President Roosevelt to ask permission to name the new toy a “Teddy Bear.” And, the rest is history...

So - today, we want to celebrate by inviting our BEAR community to #ShareaBear with someone you love, or perhaps someone that might need that extra #bearlove 💙💛

Our challenge to you this week is to snag a teddy bear and drop it off on someone's porch or in their mail and let them know the Bear Community loves them. 🐻

She is the educational side of Overdrive used by the majority of public libraries across the United States for eBook and audio books. Not only will we have our own collection of books, we will also be tied to Chandler Public Library so we can check out their books too...without a library card! The different campuses across the district have invited teachers to schedule a time for classes to come and learn more about Sora and how to assist our readers in using the program...but I bet you will even find our teachers and staff searching for a new favorite book to read too! 📚

Bear Families and Friends,
We know this COVID19 crisis has thrown us a lot of curve balls this semester and we’ve tried our best to take them, hit them and run the bases as we would with any other pitch! We appreciate so much YOUR efforts and work that got us to this point. But as we prepare for another milestone, we know this class of 2020 is missing that no more than 4 can attend, but we want to try and help that.

In an effort to help everyone experience the success that got us all here, we are going to live stream the ceremony on Facebook live and want you to prepare now for this. It’s easy:

👉🏼Like our page
👉🏼On June 5, come back and tune it just a tad before 8pm
👉🏼Our communications team is going to be set up to deliver the best feed for you to watch at home (or wherever you are)!
👉🏼So, gather your friends, families and loved ones and let’s celebrate EVERYWHERE for our Bears.

They are going places, I tell ya and we couldn’t be more proud of this class of 2020.

So, PLUG IN, get charged, and find some WiFi!

We know this COVID19 crisis has thrown us a lot of curve balls this semester and we’ve tried our best to take them, hit them and run the bases as we would with any other pitch! We appreciate so much YOUR efforts and work that got us to this point. But as we prepare for another milestone, we know this class of 2020 is missing that no more than 4 can attend, but we want to try and help that.

In an effort to help everyone experience the success that got us all here, we are going to live stream the ceremony on Facebook live and want you to prepare now for this. It’s easy:

👉🏼Like our page
👉🏼On June 5, come back and tune it just a tad before 8pm
👉🏼Our communications team is going to be set up to deliver the best feed for you to watch at home (or wherever you are)!
👉🏼So, gather your friends, families and loved ones and let’s celebrate EVERYWHERE for our Bears.

They are going places, I tell ya and we couldn’t be more proud of this class of 2020.

So, PLUG IN, get charged, and find some WiFi!

Today, BJH students who placed in their Academic Rodeo events were honored at an awards ceremony in Tyler.

Also, 7th grader Jackson Blackmon was awarded a $500 academic scholarship. Jackson was one of only 11 middle and high school students chosen out of 80 applicants. We are so proud of these students and how they represented Brownsboro ISD!

It was a great night of learning all things BHS and what to expect. But, don’t worry. If you missed out - find a HS student or teacher and we can fill you in. There’s SO MANY GOOD THINGS going on here. You don’t want to miss out.

1️⃣ We’re providing free, live and on-demand AP courses

To support AP students affected by school closures due to COVID-19, students and schools will have access to live AP review lessons, delivered by AP teachers from across the country. Lessons will begin March 25.

2️⃣ We’re developing a new at-home testing option

Because of the challenges created by COVID-19, we’re developing a new at-home AP Exam option. Students will be able to test on a computer, tablet, or smartphone.

We will invest so that every AP student impacted by COVID-19 has the tools and connectivity they need to review AP content online and take the exam from home.

During this challenging time, we will work to give every AP student the opportunity to earn the college credit and placement they’ve been working toward all year while maintaining a focus on the health and safety of our AP community.

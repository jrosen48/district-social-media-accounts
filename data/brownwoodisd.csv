Transitioning to off-campus instruction is difficult. In a time when our world is turning upside down, you don‚Äôt need more pressure without support. Parents: do your best. Period. Nothing more is expected or possible. You still have full-time responsibilities that existed before you became an educator as well. Don‚Äôt let the work we are providing become a burden. The material is to help you guide your students through a new chapter. If you struggle, reach out to us; that‚Äôs normal. We struggle‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs our full-time job. If you have a success, share it; we want to celebrate with you. You love your kids and want them to succeed, and so do we. Using the resources at https://www.brownwoodisd.org/oci, we will make this work together. If you only remind your students each day that you love them and that education is important, your day is a success. Communicate how we can help make this process better. #BwdPride #lionpride #brownwoodtough #doyourbest #shareyoursuccess",0.0,"Brownwood Education Foundation

This photo shows the Kumamoto Castle in Kumamoto City. The castle was built by a daimyo named Kato Kiyomasa in the 16th century to defend the nearby regions. The castle was never overrun throughout the feudal period and was left I disturbed until the 19th century when fire overran the castle, burning most of its structures. The castle was reconstructed in 1960 using concrete and remained as a popular tourist attraction until 2016 when the castle was partially collapsed by the Kumamoto earthquake.

The castle was never overrun throughout the feudal period and was left I disturbed until the 19th century when fire overran the castle, burning most of its structures. The castle was reconstructed in 1960 using concrete and remained as a popular tourist attraction until 2016 when the castle was partially collapsed by the Kumamoto earthquake. Renovations to repair the earthquake damage are currently ongoing. #KakehashiAward",2019-06-30 16:41:52,,

We are now a semester into Standards Based Grading and I thought it may be a good time to address what exactly Standards Based Grading is again. At the beginning of the year some of what was shared may have not made as much sense as it may now. So, with very busy school schedules I know it may be short notice, therefore I do apologize, but if you could mark your calendars for Wednesday January 25th at 7:00 pm and meet with me in the multi-purpose room I hope I can provide some clarity.

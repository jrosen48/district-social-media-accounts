This is Heidi Pearson of Rimrock High School, and she’s a name you’ll want to remember. Last year, Heidi was involved in a car accident that left her in a wheelchair and took away her entire senior year of sports competition. Instead of feeling sorry for herself, Heidi responded to this adversity by working harder, lifting those around her, and helping those in need. She rose above and made the best of her circumstance- which is a lesson we can all benefit from in the time of COVID-19. Thank you endlessly, Heidi, for sharing your story with us and for being #IdahoStrong.

Take the time to read her story, we promise you won’t regret it:

I left the office today feeling defeated. I have countless things to get done before school opens and many new challenges to navigate. As I walked home, I heard a noise approaching from my rear. It was a senior student, Elijah.

He stopped in his ATV to visit with me. We talked about summer, returning to school, and his health. Before long with a smile, he offered me a ride in his ATV.

As we rode around town, we made small talk. As he pulled up to my house to drop me off, Elijah thanked me for helping out with his classes. He was appreciative of my efforts to keep him on track.

As I sat there in the ATV, my feeling of defeat had vanished. Instead, I gained a new perspective and vision.

Thank you Elijah for reminding me why I chose to be an educator and how fortunate I am to be a part of this great community.",0.0,"Damen Kugel

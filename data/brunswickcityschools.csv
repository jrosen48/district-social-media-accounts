Hello families of London students...
This is a shared Google Album. All chaperones will be taking pictures. When available, we will be uploading the pictures to the shared album for you to view. (THERE WILL BE TONS OF PICTURES!!) We will do our best to post when we are able. It's a busy and exciting time. Know the students are doing a PHENOMENAL job. Here is the link to the shared album. THANK YOU!

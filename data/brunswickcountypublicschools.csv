Although our custodial staff has always kept Totaro clean, during this pandemic they have stepped up to the challenge of thoroughly disinfecting and cleaning our school throughout the day. They have also posted social distancing markers. Today we celebrated their outstanding performance with a pizza party for lunch.

Even though we are starting school virtually, we are ready and excited for the return of our students. Our office staff, custodians, and administrators collaborated to ensure that Totaro is prepared by increasing safety measures.

Effective, July 28, 2020, with guidance from the VDH, we plan to move forward with the virtual option only for the first 9-weeks of the 2020-21 academic year. As we move forward for the reopening and the start of the academic year, August 10, 2020, we will begin school using a full virtual model for the first 9-weeks. Therefore, if you selected the hybrid model for your student(s), then you will be switched to virtual for at least the first 9-weeks. The School Board and Administration will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on Brunswick County Public Schools and make a determination of delivery model(s) for the 2nd 9-weeks and beyond.

Background: Based on guidance from The Virginia Department of Education, it is anticipated that schools will be allowed to open in August under Phase III, but social distancing guidelines will be required. As a result, we are considering a plan to stagger students in the buildings and limiting the number of students in each classroom. The number of students on each bus will also be limited. This means that some students at the upper grades may attend school only one day a week and participate virtually the remainder of the week.

At the PreK-3 level, it is our hope to allow them to attend school 3 or 4 days a week, as virtual learning is not as successful at these grade levels. High school students will participate virtually in most classes and only attend school for hands-on CTE or lab classes. Please respond to the questions below. Your input and feedback are critical and important as we finalize these plans.

We know life can become a bit overwhelming when trying to handle the demands of distance learning and deadlines. We are pleased to announce that we now have a division subscription to Remind. Remind is a text reminder application that will allow teachers to periodically send out classroom and school reminders via text message to help take the burden of remembering off of you. In addition, they can share photos with the class of the wonderful things that are happening during this time.

What does this mean? You will have to download the free Remind App. You will not receive advertisement texts, and your phone number will remain private. The teacher will not be able to see your phone number, nor can anyone else. You may opt-out at any time. Our hope is that this will help strengthen the distance learning connection.

Please do not hesitate to contact your child's teacher via email or via the BCPS Homework Hotline if you have any questions.

We recognize that the national news coverage of COVID-19 (coronavirus) raises questions and concerns for our community. A coronavirus is typically spread through coughing or sneezing, much like the flu and other respiratory viruses. Symptoms are thought to appear within 2 to 14 days after exposure and consist of fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. If your child or any family member present with any of the symptoms, please consult your primary care physician.

Brunswick County Public Schools, administrators, and staff have been closely monitoring this developing situation. As there are now eight presumptive positive or confirmed cases in Virginia, I wanted to update you on our efforts regarding the health and safety of students and staff.

A comprehensive parent letter regarding COVID-19, Coronavirus is being sent home with students today. This information has been placed on the division website and social media as well.

People often associate office referrals with student misbehavior. At Meherrin-Powellton, we believe office referrals can be written for positive student behavior! So, Positive Behavior Referrals are submitted for students who exhibit positive behaviors such as scholarship, citizenship, and leadership! Students receive a copy of their referral with a personalized note from the principal. The students’ names as well as their positive behaviors are also celebrated over the intercom! Let’s continue to celebrate this week’s outstanding students! More greatness next week....",2.0,"Congratulations!! 💪🏽💙 #BrunswickStrong

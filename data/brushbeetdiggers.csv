Here are the IceBank tanks provided by Calmac Corp. at Brush Beetdiggers (Brush High School and Middle School in Brush, Colorado). These storage tanks mean the chiller can be 40 to 50 percent smaller than other HVAC systems, because the chiller works in conjunction with the IceBank tanks during on-peak daytime hours to manage the building’s cooling load. During off-peak nighttime hours, the chiller charges the IceBank tanks for use during the next day’s cooling. Extending the chiller hours of operation results in the lowest possible average load.

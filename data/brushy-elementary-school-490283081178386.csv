FLU SHOTS

Permission forms are going out this week for student flu shots. The Health and Wellness Clinic will be at Brushy on Wednesday, Oct 23 to give flu shots. I don’t have a definite time, but it should be around 9/9:30.

We are having a community flu clinic for anyone over the age of 18 on the same day from 10-12 in the nurses office. There is no charge for these shots, but they do collect insurance information so that they can try to recoup some of the cost. These shots are being provided by Redbird Smith Health Center.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1281868318686521&id=490283081178386,,0.0,"Edited: Changed from new gym to the nurses office.

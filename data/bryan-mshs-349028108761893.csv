Final score: Bryan 2-3 TCC

Today was a tale of two halves. The girls started strong, dominated possession and controlled the game for the first 40 minutes of play. They continued to apply pressure and push forward creating multiple opportunities. #6 Delilah Taylor put us in the lead after beating a few defenders outside the box and finding the far corner. A few minutes later, #19 Ella Voigt fired a long ball into the box that #12 Allie Zimmerman chased down and poked past the keeper to make it 2-0 at halftime. Unfortunately, we let off the gas at the start of the second half and when they scored their first from a free kick 30 yards out, our heads sank, and we couldn’t recover. A couple defensive mistakes allowed their second goal to be scored off another free kick that ended with a loose ball in the box that TCC cleaned up with a goal. And their 3rd goal was a shot outside the box.
Tough game where we played well in the first half but couldn’t stay consistent through the second.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1272003849797643&id=349028108761893,,0.0,"Bryan vs. TCC

Delta was able to claw a couple goals back in the 60th and 64th minutes of the game making it 4-2. However, the game was put to bed when #12 Allie Zimmerman headed a loose ball home in the 73rd minute of play.

Tonight’s game was certainly one to learn from. The girls started slow and were not able to recover. Shawnee played a good game and outworked us to the ball all around the field. The girls continued to fight through the end of the game but we couldn’t quite find the extra gear we needed to maintain possession and move the ball up the field. Although the scoreline may not reflect well on the team, the game provided us with area’s to improve upon moving forward. I am confident we can bounce back from our first loss of the season.

PLEASE WATCH this video that shows the process vehicles will follow when graduates will make their way to the stage to receive their diploma at the graduation ceremony!!

Please note: The direction the graduate walks across the stage is now opposite than on the maps Seniors received. This change will allow traffic to flow appropriately.

Reminders:

1.) Make sure that graduates are not driving the vehicle. The graduate MUST be a passenger in the vehicle.

2.) Make sure your vehicle has plenty of gas, the radiator fluid levels are appropriate, and your vehicle battery is fully charged!! (we learned from other schools who did a similar ceremony that this is very important!!!)

3.) Please keep vehicles turned off as much as possible throughout the ceremony.

4.) We encourage graduate vehicles to be decorated to celebrate the day

7.) GRADUATES BE SURE TO WEAR YOUR CAP AND GOWN

The 2020 Census is critical. Where there are more people, there are more needs—for new schools, new roads, and services for families, older adults, and children.

To ensure everyone is counted, census takers will begin to visit households that haven’t responded yet to the 2020 Census to collect their responses in person.

These visits will begin August 11. Please see the attached images for more information about the Census Taker Visits.

Let’s make sure that everyone in our community is counted in the 2020 Census. Results of this count will inform how hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funding are distributed for important programs and services every year for the next 10 years.

Lanier Primary, Richmond Hill Primary, Richmond Hill Elementary, Bryan County Elementary, McAllister Elementary, and Richmond Hill Middle received the Five Star School Climate Rating.

PBIS is an evidence-based, data-driven framework proven to reduce disciplinary incidents, increase a school’s sense of safety and support improved academic outcomes. PBIS is a preventative and proactive framework proven to improve school climate by promoting positive relationships between school personnel, students, families, and other stakeholders. The premise of PBIS is that continual teaching, combined with acknowledgement or feedback of positive student behavior will reduce unnecessary discipline and promote a climate of greater productivity, safety and learning.

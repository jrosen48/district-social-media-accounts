Masks are required for grades 3-12 & encouraged for PreK-2. Teachers will help teach younger students how to wear masks properly, but we encourage parents to help. Comfortability with mask-wearing takes practice. Also, face coverings come in different sizes, so please ensure they fit and are washed daily.

Please check your children's temperature daily and don't send them to school if they have a fever or other COVID-19 symptoms. Also, students should stay home if they've been in contact with anyone with COVID-19 or if they are awaiting COVID-19 test results.

Made this schedule to keep myself and my family sane through the unprecedented weeks ahead. Funny how everything works - it’s gotten picked up by behavior groups, doctors, teachers, and has been shared more than 10k times that I know of. I feel like I just got an official mom trophy 😂

Posting here because maybe it will help some of my family clients, too. I made it based off my kids ages and our family, use as-is or as a jumping off point for your own. Whatever we can do to help each other through whatever is coming!

I’d love to hear what you are doing for your kids? How are you planning to manage the inevitable difficulties that come with two weeks away from activities and friends?

We are now able to offer FREE meals thanks to a new USDA waiver. All students (PreK-12) will be able to eat one school breakfast and one school lunch, per day, at no cost beginning Tuesday, September 8.

Extra breakfast, lunch, or à la carte items must purchased separately.

The free meal waiver is effective through December 31, 2020. It is very important for families to fill out the free and reduced lunch application in order to continue receiving free (or reduced) meals after December 31. If you have not already done so, apply online at bit.ly/MealAccounts or pick up an application at any school office. The district receives important funding based on the number of free and reduced lunch applications submitted by October 1.

Additional resources will be made easily accessible to AP students and teachers through mobile phones and other devices. These include free online AP lessons and review sessions from some of the top AP teachers in the country.

The AP program is finalizing streamlined AP exam options that would allow students to test at home, depending on the situation in May. We’re working to give every AP student the opportunity to claim the credit they’ve earned. The AP Program will communicate the details of these additional solutions to educators and students by March 20.

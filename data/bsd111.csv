Burbank School District 111 Luther Burbank School incorporates a high performance geothermal mechanical system as well as three outdoor classrooms set among native gardens that create a bio-swale and visible stormwater drainage system for learning opportunities.

The first Volvo dealership in the nation to achieve LEED Silver Certification - Fields Auto Group Volvo Northfield. The building includes wind turbines, a rain water harvesting system, solar panels and an eco-garden. During construction, ICI implemented a comprehensive construction waste management program that diverted 95% of all construction debris from the waste stream.

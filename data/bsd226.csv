Individuals were: Alex Buseski 3rd, Ally Keefe 4th, Renee Gehrke 18th, and Ryan Bendit 24th. Very impressive, especially since Mr. Tryggestad could not help them prepare. The students really did it all on their own. There are also National competitions for all FFA contests and usually only the State Champion goes on to compete. However our state Horticulture contest actually combines 2 National Contests (Nursery/Landscape and Floriculture).

Mathematical Science and Artistic Achievement Awards

Each year, the BHS mathematics department selects one individual who has not only excelled in the field of mathematics...but has also exhibited a passion for the deep analytical nature of mathematics. To ""figure it out"" is one of the most fundamentally important skills of our species. While we also look for dedication, the ability to challenge oneself, and mathematical ability...it is the sense of wonder when problem solving that we cherish above all others. We are very pleased to announce the 2020 Mathematical Science award goes to Kennedy Turner!

In addition...the recipient of the artistic achievement award is chosen based on creative growth over the course of four years in the art and design program at Byron High School. This award is also going to Kennedy Turner.

Message from Ronald and Rosemarie Edwards:

""This scholarship is being given in honor of our son, Daniel Edwards, who graduated from Byron High School in 2017 and passed away in 2018. From a young age Daniel showed a passion for working with his hands by disassembling and redesigning his skateboards to find the perfect ride. His passion for adventure and curiosity for how things worked was at the center of all his activities.

After graduation Daniel continued his education through the auto mechanic program at Kishwaukee College. That is why this scholarship is geared toward someone pursuing a career in auto/diesel mechanics or another trade.

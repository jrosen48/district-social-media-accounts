The Big Spring School District is launching a ThoughtExchange survey to engage the Big Spring Community in dialogue around creative and meaningful methods to honor the Class of 2020, should a traditional graduation ceremony be deemed unsafe. This survey tool enables participants to submit as many ideas as they’d like, assign a rating to each idea, and to monitor trends as they develop. Ultimately, this exchange will provide for the most valued alternatives for the Big Spring School District to consider when making arrangements to celebrate our graduates.
The exchange will go live on Monday, April 20th and will conclude on Monday, April 27th. To access the ThoughtExchange survey and information page, please go to the district website at www.bigspringsd.org and click the news story titled “2020 Graduation Ideas – Share Your Voice!” During this survey window, please engage with the tool often as an idea contributor and a rater of ideas as well.

The students were excited about having Senator Ward visit their class and even enjoyed explaining to her what they are currently working on!

Below is what Senator Ward had to say about her visit at Big Spring School District, as well as some photos from her visit.

""I was very impressed with my recent visit to Big Spring School District. I enjoyed learning about the innovative classroom design for the students. Flexible seating and flexible academic work schedules were just some of the areas I learned are provided to facilitate student learning. There are great things happening at Big Spring School District and I am proud to have the administration, faculty and students in my legislative district.""

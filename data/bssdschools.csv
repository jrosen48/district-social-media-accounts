If you don't have any shells in the house, you could try using the photo page in the lesson plan attached as a drawing reference.

BSSD has just learned of the recent arrest of Donteh Devoe in Anchorage on Sexual Abuse of a Minor charges. Although everyone is presumed innocent until proven guilty, I have terminated all future contracts with Mr. Devoe and any of his associated organizations immediately. In addition, BSSD will not enter into any further contracts.

If anyone has been personally affected by Mr. Devoe while he has worked with BSSD, please contact myself or Kris Busk in the District Office as soon as possible. Proper authorities can also be contacted at the link provided below.

This week, I met with master Alaska Native Ivory carver Ben Pungowiyi from Savoonga, a community known as the “walrus capital of the world” with a rich history of ivory and bone carvings that has been passed down for thousands of years. Ben began ivory carving at the age of six, and hunting around the same time. Ben was recently in DC to present at the Department of Interior with Indian Arts and Crafts Board specialists Lars Krutak, Ph.D, and Ken Van Wey. Savoonga’s economy is almost entirely dependent on the ability to sell ivory that has come from walrus and fossilized walrus ivory.

The kids were able to learn more about job opportunities today. First stop was a fish hatchery where we explored jobs in the fisheries industry. Next stop, was the radio station. A few kids got to be recorded. Then, we went to Barnacle Foods to learn all about their local food product——kelp salsa and kelp pickles. Delicious! We learned about jobs in small business and entrepreneurship. The kids worked on their future job slide shows.

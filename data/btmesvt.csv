Dear Barre Students, Families and Teachers,

We are glad that the first days of school are going well and everyone is staying safe. As of today, our district ùêùùê®ùêûùê¨ ùêßùê®ùê≠ have a positive case of COVID-19. Our schools continue to take precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and we are ready to act if a positive case is identified in one of our schools. If we are notified by the Vermont Department of Health that an individual at one of our schools has tested positive for COVID-19 we will move the school to 100% remote instruction for seven days or until the Vermont Department of Health has given us different guidance. This will allow time for required contact tracing and quarantining of affected individuals. It will also allow us time to thoroughly clean the affected school building. Thank you all for your understanding as we help keep the Barre community safe.

Sincerely,

David Wells

Dear Barre families,

I am reaching out to you as we get closer to the start of school. You may have heard that the Vermont Agency of Education and Department of Health revised their guidance to schools on August 11th. This new guidance reinforces the need to safely return students to school, especially for children ages 10 and under and changes some of the distancing recommendations. The BUUSD Reopening School Team, composed of teachers, paraprofessionals, principals, a representative from our school nurses, and other administrators reviewed this guidance. We decided to stay with our plan to reopen schools with a Hybrid Model and a Virtual Learning Model. This is necessary during this initial phase of reopening to ensure that our safety procedures and staffing ratios are effective. I recognize that we need to return to full in-person operations as soon as possible. We will be monitoring our situation over the start of school and stand ready to adjust our plans as conditions hopefully improve.

Sincerely,

I also want to use the opportunity provided by National Teacher Appreciation Week to thank everyone else who has taken a role in supporting our students during this time, including our non-teaching staff, as well as parents, guardians, and family members who are working with students at home. I recognize the challenges this has presented in many homes, and we in the school system want to thank you for your hard work.

The stop that has been in front of the Mathewson School on Elm St. will now move to Jefferson St. between the Aldrich Library and Elks Lodge (at the same time). A Robo Call will go out prior to Monday announcing these changes. You can find the flyer with all stops and times on our COVID-19 webpage at the link below.

Power is now back on and we have returned to normal operation at Barre Town School. For original Notice please see below:

This message is to inform you that we had a brief evacuation at Barre Town School this morning. We determined the cause was a roof ventilator which was not functioning properly, causing a smell. The fire department came and determined it was safe to return everyone back into the school. Power remains out in parts of the building for the time being but Green Mountain Power believes they will find and rectify the cause and we will be back to normal operation by 11:45am. All students and staff are safe and comfortable. Please do not come to the school or try to call as this may hinder any efforts to return to normal operation. An update will be provided by 11:45am.

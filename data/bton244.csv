This deadline is crucial for a couple of reasons. First, it orders you a t-shirt for your child. Second, if we have over 60 kids signed up for the camp, we will be performing both Willy Wonka Jr. and Willy Wonka Kids. Without 60, we will only be performing Willy Wonka JR.

We will have hand sanitizer stations, spray disinfectant for every high school helper, a contactless thermometer to take off all children as they come in, and will be weeping all surfaces at the end of each day.

We understand your hesitation to send your child’s to camp, and fully support all parents and children in their decision. We do hope that you choose to let your child participate and get the pre-registered.

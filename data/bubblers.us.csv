We know the coronavirus has created challenges for AP students and teachers. Here’s how the College Board will support you during this time:

1️⃣ We’re providing free, live and on-demand AP courses

To support AP students affected by school closures due to COVID-19, students and schools will have access to live AP review lessons, delivered by AP teachers from across the country. Lessons will begin March 25.

2️⃣ We’re developing a new at-home testing option

Because of the challenges created by COVID-19, we’re developing a new at-home AP Exam option. Students will be able to test on a computer, tablet, or smartphone.

We will invest so that every AP student impacted by COVID-19 has the tools and connectivity they need to review AP content online and take the exam from home.

During this challenging time, we will work to give every AP student the opportunity to earn the college credit and placement they’ve been working toward all year while maintaining a focus on the health and safety of our AP community.

Today, Sunday, February 9th, there was a water main break on South Middleton School District property. Because of the water main break, Yellow Breeches Middle School and Boiling Springs High School will be on a boil water advisory for the next three days. The kitchen staff and food service director have been contacted, and meals will be served. The District has also partnered with Giant Grocery Store to provide skids of bottled water for the duration of the boil water advisory. Water fountains at both schools will be turned off, and Cumberland Analytical will be in each day to test the water. After three days and a clean test from Cumberland Analytical, Yellow Breeches Middle School and Boiling Springs High School will return to normal operation. There is no impact at our elementary buildings, Iron Forge Elementary School or W.G. Rice Elementary School.

Today, Sunday, February 9th, there was a water main break on South Middleton School District property. Because of the water main break, Yellow Breeches Middle School and Boiling Springs High School will be on a boil water advisory for the next three days. The kitchen staff and food service director have been contacted, and meals will be served. The District has also partnered with Giant Grocery Store to provide skids of bottled water for the duration of the boil water advisory. Water fountains at both schools will be turned off, and Cumberland Analytical will be in each day to test the water. After three days and a clean test from Cumberland Analytical, Yellow Breeches Middle School and Boiling Springs High School will return to normal operation. There is no impact at our elementary buildings, Iron Forge Elementary School or W.G. Rice Elementary School.

Thank you and have a good evening.",2020-02-09 18:34:46,,

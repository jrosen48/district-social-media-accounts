As I’m sure you’ve noticed, we do not have fulltime crossing guards this year due to COVID and the strict guidelines we need to follow. We have had some help in the mornings and have just recently put a “state law, yield to pedestrians” sign at the crosswalk on Capital Avenue.

The good news is we will be getting a flashing light installed at the crosswalk (on Capital Avenue) to stop traffic when students are crossing. Students simply push the button and the light will blink rapidly to notify traffic to stop; just like the one on the truck route and Euclid Avenue. The materials for this light are due to arrive this week and we expect this to be installed right away. Thank you for your patience and helping your students cross the street safely in the meantime.

Hello Buchanan Parents!

For our last homework drop off on May 18th, Junior Kindergarten - 2nd grade will drop off items from 9:00-10:00 and 3rd grade-5th grade will drop off their work from 10:00-11:00. If you cannot make your scheduled time work, please drop off anytime between 8:45-11:15. This would also be a great time to turn in any library books that you may still have at home. On behalf of all the staff at Buchanan School, thank you so much for your efforts in educating from home. We know this has been a stressful and difficult time to balance everything, yet you stepped up and worked incredibly hard to ensure that learning took place. Thank you!!!!!

The past 24 hours has been filled with new information in regard to COVID 19. As a district we are taking many cautionary measures to keep our schools clean and safe for kids. Specifically, we have increased our efforts in keeping all touch points clean and disinfected and are finding more opportunities throughout the day to wash hands with soap and water. We are restricting all guests and parents to the office when picking up students, dropping off treats, backpacks, or anything that they would normally take to classrooms. As new information becomes available, I will do my best to keep you all informed.

Teachers-you guys ok?
Parents-hangin’ in there? ￼

Reminder of what’s happening at Buchanan (because let’s face it - we need all the reminders we can get this week 🤪)

👉🏻 Mrs. M has the Christmas store open and cute stuff is coming home already! Thanks Mrs. M!

👉🏻 Christmas sings are happening Thursday and Friday! Scope out the Buchanan newsletter, the PTA newsletter, and/or old old posts on this page to find out when your kiddo sings. So fun! 🤩

👉🏻 Early release on Friday! Bell rings at 12:30 to kick off Christmas break. Break runs through January 6th, with students returning Tuesday, January 7th.

👉🏻 Our teacher wish lists have been posted and updated.

Buchanan Family,

At our first PTA meeting of the year, we heard from teachers who said by Christmas break they are replenishing items in their classrooms to get them through the last half of the year. Our minds quickly thought 'This is definitely something the PTA can help with!' So earlier this week we asked the teachers to compile a list of what they need stocked. Then we thought 'I bet members of our Buchanan family would love to help with this, too!' Below are lists from some of our teachers. PLEASE do not feel obligated to partake. This is only a suggestion put out by the PTA to Buchanan families who may be struggling to find the perfect teacher gift. Of course we know that the best gift our teachers can receive is a hug and a 'Merry Christmas!' from their students.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2713681235344488&id=458455740867060,,0.0,"‼️ UPDATED LISTS ‼️ (Updated as of 12.16)

• Wednesday mornings from 7:40-8:05 and
• Friday afternoons from 2:50-3:10.

If you’re not able to commit to one spot each week, there’s potential to get creative with scheduling. We are also looking for substitutes!

Back to school ALREADY! We are down to 1 month away until Youth Registration starting back up.
We have several updates this year:
1. $2 per ride per child pre-scheduled (only exception is Kidstop). If your ride is over 10 miles in length there will be $.25 charge per mile.
2. RCPT will need everyone to bring in your Youth Transit Fare Cards to get re-stamped.
3. RCPT will have a cutoff for Youth Registration forms on August 12th for those that want to have their child ride the first week of school. The next day to start riding will be August 26th.
4. Those that do not get registered by the time the buses fill up will be put on a wait list.
5. Parents will be able to see in real-time where their child's bus is on the Shah My-ride App.
6. Please see our website for more details about our new updates.",2.0,"Another way to get your household ready for school - setting up transportation!

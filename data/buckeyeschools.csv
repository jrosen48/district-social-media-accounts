I am pleased to announce after a challenging and engaging interview process, Mr. Jeffery Harrison was hired as our new superintendent this evening.

We are very excited to welcome Mr. Harrison to our Buckeye family. The board appreciates the staff and community feedback on the finalists which was received during the town hall meeting with the top candidates last Tuesday.

We feel confident Mr. Harrison is the right person for this very important position. The board was very impressed with him. We feel he has what we were looking for leading us into the future. He is a person with many great attributes. We are very fortunate to have him lead our district into the future.

We know Mr. Harrison is going to work hard for the district and he will make sure that we move the district forward. Mr. Harrison is a people person. It certainly will not take long for him to meet everyone and begin building relationships and trust.

It is important to us to honor our graduates' accomplishments and to wish them well as they leave our campus. As you may know, a survey went out earlier this week for parents and students asking for feedback on a few possibilities. We are also aware of guidance provided yesterday by the Ohio Department of Education. At this time, we are still reviewing and weighing options to determine next steps.

An impromptu safe driving and operation lesson today. I have to say the new air conditioned cab and controls of the Bobcat skid steer make it a very nice machine. Buckholts Ag students agreed and enjoyed the opportunity to learn about equipment operation.

We have had a great first month of school in Buckholts! Students enjoyed the first FFA meeting with soda floats. New equipment continues to roll into the laboratory and a couple of our junior members have been out on the jackpot circuit. It is a great day to be a badger!

SOM - State of Michigan - Page Not Found",7.0,"Buckley schools is OPEN today Friday, March 13th. The governor has ordered a shut down of all Michigan K-12 schools starting Monday March 16th and having us reopen Monday April 6th. Given the sudden nature of the announcement, we are left with many questions. The district will be communicating further with families and staff regarding Buckley schools plan for the school closures later today. I will do my best to get information out to everyone as soon as we know more. Thank you for your support as we work to support students and staff at this time.

209,1.0,,15.0,,2100625966912455,We are excited to introduce our new 5th and 6th grade math teacher Mr. McInerney. He has several years experience teaching elementary school and comes to us most recently from Colorado. We have also experienced an increase in numbers in the 5th and 6th grade. At this time all 6th grade students will have Mr. McInerney as their home room teacher. The fifth grade will have either Mr. Welling or Mrs. Kirkpatrick as their homeroom teachers. All students will still rotate between all three teachers for subject specific subject area content as normal. Class lists will be posted at open house. We will not be accepting any changes to the list at this time.

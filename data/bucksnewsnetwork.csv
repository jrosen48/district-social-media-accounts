What lessons can we learn from the inequities that were in place prior to the shutdown?

How can these lessons help transform education as we know it?

Voices for Vermont's Children is planning a series of conversations with students from around the state to share stories and imagine together how to transform our schools and education—and we want to hear from you!

These conversations will take place over 3 days and will highlight past experiences, current realities, and radical ideas about the future of our public schools in Vermont.

Recognizing students as experts in their own lives, we'll provide space for Vermont youth to share opinions, knowledge, and lived experiences with each other and with decision makers as we think together about what the future of education in our state should look like.

My dear Willow,
You are a bright star in this cluster of luminous classmates. Your trajectory has moved throughout our community, your path marked by creativity, sensitivity and perseverance. I remember so clearly the video game you created in sixth grade, when allowed your own choice for an assignment. That ability to surprise and challenge those around you has continued through the years, as you finish your first year at Northern University. I have always appreciated your openness, your willingness to share your warm and expansive heart. I saw quickly how your fierce love for family and friends shaped your daily life, and how your drive to improve yourself included an invitation for others to rise with you. Whether it was forensics, music, soccer, Tae kwon Do, academics, you offered an open hand. You continue to amaze me, my dear Willow, as you move into a new trajectory of life.
You have my respect and best wishes, and as always, my love.

Kevin,
It took awhile for you to open up and let me get to know you, but when you did I was impressed by your thoughts and the connections you made from the information you learned. Your ability to be a friend to anyone who needs one is what the world needs, so the world is blessed to have you in it. Mr. Emerson told me a tale about you once and it sticks with me because it rings true, but is also not the person I saw when we spoke. It shows that you have grown tremendously over the years to earn an impressive ability for control over yourself, your actions, your thoughts, and your abilities. The tale was of a basketball game in which the opposing team was being unsportsmanlike. He said that your coach had you benched at the time and when it became clear the opposing coach was going to continue the behavior your coach warned, “Hey coach, if you keep this up I’m going to put Ricker in.” And that was all it took. You are a “John Wick” kind of man who will avenge the death of your dog, because it wasn’t “just a dog”.

Dear Davis,

If a good life is one that is characterized by complete absorption in what one does (Nakamura and Csikzentmihalyi), then Davis Parker, you are sure to find great happiness in the years to come (as long as you go easy on the strawberry shortcake). With your easy-going, good-natured ways, you experienced and worked hard at all that BMU had to offer. From 2nd grade bat boy on the DIV championship baseball team, to a lead role in the musical Annie Jr., and from Middle School Scholar and trumpet player to point guard on the varsity basketball team, your humility and friendship were noticed and appreciated by all. But it is your passion for the world of S.T.E.M., your work with Robotics, and CRREL, and your dual enrollment at Vermont Tech that gives us inspiration. Your passion for engineering inspires us to look at life with curiosity and interest. What an amazing role model you have been. George, we’re really going to miss you.

Josh,
You are more self aware than many people twice your age, yet I do not think you realize that about yourself. You know what you want and what you need; more importantly, you know the steps you need to make to earn those things. You plan and you prepare and you have fun. You show determination and perseverance in the projects you take on. Your willingness to help others who are struggling or are in need is inspiring, Casually stating my shift pedal was not compatible with my boot size, you jumped onto your phone to suss out a solution that did not require buying new boots. Your leadership qualities are visible by all. Use that power knowing it comes with great responsibility (as Uncle Ben said to Peter Parker). Use your many strengths to benefit yourself and your community; enjoy your years of independence.
Good luck in the stock market and your get rich quick schemes.

You have thrived at your time in technology classes and shown great aptitude. You can go far in with technology, if you put your mind to it.

Three Corners (TC) Babe Ruth is hopeful we will be able to have a season. We are preparing as if we will have a season.

The season would run later than normal (depending on when we can start, maybe into August), and will end without a statewide or district tournament. A league tournament is planned.

We are excited to announce the addition of softball this year! We believe we will have enough interest this year and into the future to sustain both baseball and softball.

Babe Ruth is for players 13-15 for baseball, and 13-16 for softball.

Baseball age rules:
Any player born prior to May 1, 2007 and on or after May 1, 2004 will be eligible for Babe Ruth 13-15 League competition.

Softball age rules:

Babe Ruth Interest",2.0,"There still is hope for summer baseball and softball This just in from Three Corners (TC) Babe Ruth:
Three Corners (TC) Babe Ruth is hopeful we will be able to have a season. We are preparing as if we will have a season.

The season would run later than normal (depending on when we can start, maybe into August), and will end without a statewide or district tournament. A league tournament is planned.

We are excited to announce the addition of softball this year! We believe we will have enough interest this year and into the future to sustain both baseball and softball.

Babe Ruth is for players 13-15 for baseball, and 13-16 for softball.

Baseball age rules:
Any player born prior to May 1, 2007 and on or after May 1, 2004 will be eligible for Babe Ruth 13-15 League competition.

Softball age rules:
All players born in 2003 or through 2006.

If interested, please fill out the survey.

Dear Kristina,
It has been a joy to witness the complexity of layers that make up “you”: the ethical, inquisitive, thoughtful, hard-working, strong, fragile, empathetic, determined young woman who is still trying to figure out just where she fits in the world. You have brought me to tears during your Forensics tournaments, delighted me with your Shakespeare performances, and intrigued me with your written work. I wish all the best for you -- a safe haven of thought and love, as well as courage and resilience to explore the world. I will think of you in your garden or gazing at the stars from the top of a mountain. Thank you for being my student -- I will miss you!

David,

I will miss seeing you in Mrs. Davie’s office with your crew. I will miss you walking into my classroom to collect your friends for the walk to whatever classes you all had next. You keep your statements real even when talking about comics and movies. The care you have for people is clear, you do what you have to do even when you don’t really want to, eventually you will get it done. I was so happy to see you on my J-Term roster, it was an opportunity to see you enjoy doing something new with cooking and learning new skills without your computer screen between you and the project. You sought out answers by talking to people in class and asking questions. You worked collaboratively with your friends to solve problems and to make yummy food that you shared with others. Look forward to the future, if only to enjoy the movie releases.

Anto,
To my BMU kindred free spirit. 🙂 What will I do without your dramatic entries into my classroom? Or without your poetry to read? How will I make it through my day without hearing your cheery “hello” in the Senior hallway? I will miss you, Anto. I still need to hear you play the piano; I still need to make you waffles one last time. You know that you are an amazing writer, poet, dreamer, musician (yes, I can see you rolling your eyes, even from my house). I anxiously await the day when you share your talents with the world at large, with no apologies -- but with the confidence that your voice is needed and valuable and important. Keep climbing mountains, singing, running through forests! And sometimes think of those of us who shared these formative years with you, and know that we remember and love you!

As a principal with a vision for our school community, I selflessly hope you experience the world and embark on any and all of your chosen journeys. Selfishly, I hope you choose to grow and prosper in our community, as you have done for many years now. You are smart, dedicated, and have the tools to choose your own path.

Dear Zhiwen,

Your trees glow in my classroom and on the walls of BMU. Whenever I am weighed down by the challenges of being inside on one of those gray Vermont days, of which we have so many, I look at your painting and feel transported to a beautiful, glorious world. As the years have gone by, I have watched you grow in confidence and resolve. Because of your natural reserve and calm manner, it is easy to overlook the perseverance and hard work it has taken you to achieve at the highest level. Please know that your successes and strengths are recognized by your fellow classmates and by the teachers and staff here at BMU. We depend on your quiet presence to balance out the normal chaos of high school life 🙂. I will miss seeing you sitting in Senior Hall, always cheerfully answering to my “Good Morning,” but I am grateful that I will still have your trees on my wall to remind me of you.

Logan,

The passion you have for discussion is clear to anyone who crosses your path, you make yourself known in small circles and in large. Your confidence lies in what you dedicate to learn and spend time learning. Keep telling people your truth, always know what you want and go after it. You rarely give yourself enough credit, those who know you see your worth and are glad to be in your presence. I look forward to the dialog you produce on your podcast and to seeing your name in the production line at film festivals. Know you have the skill and the ability to reach for what you desire and have the confidence to do what may seem too difficult.

Your work ethic, sarcastic sense of humor, and creative talents have not only helped you find success in your classes (you know, like winning every single physics challenge!) but have also made getting to know you, and being your teacher a great experience.

Your work ethic, sarcastic sense of humor, and creative talents have not only helped you find success in your classes (you know, like winning every single physics challenge!) but have also made getting to know you, and being your teacher a great experience. I wish you the best of luck with all of your future plans. I know that wherever you choose to go, and whatever you choose to do, your positive attitude and many gifts will carry you far!
Best wishes,

Graigory! Where has the time gone? My very first memories of you are watching you and your sisters wave at Mark and Jon from the driveway of your grandparents’ house. After that, whenever I saw the boys standing at the top of the driveway, I knew you were there. And now here you are ready to graduate from high school. I admire the young man you have become. Your friends lean on you for support and advice and you never fail them...you always tell them like it is. While this might someday get you in trouble with your boss, I believe it to be one of your best qualities and that it will ensure that YOU are someday the boss.
Best of luck!

Codee,

When I think of you, this quote from Theodore Roosevelt comes to mind: “With self-discipline most anything is possible.” You have proven that. You have such strength and determination within you and you have come so far. You are a supportive friend, sibling, and student. I have loved watching you play lunch basketball, seeing you laughing with your friends, and I will certainly look back with humor on our discussions in health class. (I know it wasn’t always easy to have your sister in the same class, but it made for some memorable moments). I am so proud of the young man you have grown into and I am looking forward to seeing how you grab life by the horns and wrestle it into something you love.

Dear Brookelyn,

To an amazing student who often doesn’t realize just how amazing she is:
She is as comfortable comforting a newborn calf as she is managing a rowdy baseball team of teenage boys. When asked to write one villanelle, she returns to class with 17. She agonizes over her own ethics, yet is willing to forgive others their shortcomings. She is often filled with shyness and anxiety, yet gladly takes on leadership roles. Brookelyn, you have taught me much about resilience and compassion (and villanelles). I am excited to watch you find freedom, peace, and acceptance as you move forward into the wider world.

(Hmmm.....I remember this! Mrs. Puffer 😄 ) You have a way of just disappearing from one space to infiltrate another and all with a smile on your face and a hat in your hand. Working with tools and machinery, knowing how things work is more important to you than any online world. You are more than capable of taking care of yourself, even if you do make unfiltered and impulsive choices on occasion… Noah, you have it in you to be a loyal, dedicated, and honest tradesman. Do not let yourself down by expecting anything less of yourself than the highest levels of happiness and comfort. Be good to yourself, be kind to others, and use your brain before you make choices. I am very glad you let me get to know you even in a small way.

I am so happy that I was able to partake in LAM time this school year. Who knew what I'd been missing out on. It has been my absolute pleasure getting to know you over the last two years, especially this year. Having the opportunity to be your soccer coach was an incredible experience. The team as a whole was more than I could have asked for, but what you bought to the team this season was above and beyond expectations. You pushed yourself during practices and in every game. You took my sometimes uncomfortable constructive criticism in stride and became a better player. I have complete confidence that you are going to accomplish great feats in your life as you have a dedication and commitment to excellence that many do not. I wish you well at UNH and please don't hesitate to come visit BMU during your breaks.

You see what needs to be done and choose to step forward and do it, not always because you love it, but because it needs doing. You are loyal to those who you care for, you are genuinely curious about people and confident in asking questions to become closer to people and more knowledgeable from the experience. You were one of the very first to welcome me into the BMU community and the very first to make me feel at home.

You are loyal to those who you care for, you are genuinely curious about people and confident in asking questions to become closer to people and more knowledgeable from the experience. You were one of the very first to welcome me into the BMU community and the very first to make me feel at home. Take every adventure, take every risk, choose to follow what you know is right, choose to take the path others fear to. Consider every choice with your heart, make the choice with your heart, soul, and mind.
You will be remembered with a smile.

Dear Logan,

It has been an honor to watch you mature from the silly freshman I encountered my first day at BMU, to a hardworking young man! All I know about hunting, farming, humor and VT life I have learned from you. I will miss the days of hearing your hunting stories with humorous figurative language thrown in. Being family oriented and friend driven will serve you well in your life. I wish you the best of luck Logan! Most importantly, stay you!

KateLynn,
It has been so wonderful seeing the growth that you have made. You have a fire within you that will get you far, as long as you don’t give up on yourself.. You have shown perseverance when facing some of life’s struggles, you have shown compassion when others have been struggling, and you have shown maturity while helping others who have made academic (and other) mistakes. Every mistake we make makes us stronger. You have so much experience with life and you are officially a world traveler now, with 6 countries under your belt. This world view gives you an edge over so many that never get to leave their local area. You know what it is like to be in a major city, in a rural Central American village, and in buildings that are centuries old. I am so proud of you and can’t wait to hear about the places you will go. As Dr. Seuss says, “You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose.”
You’ve got this!

Dear Shane,
Ever since I was a child, I have always loved books in which people have to survive in the wilderness and live off the land. That is why I have loved having you as a student -- you have taught me outdoor skills, shared old-fashioned woods lore, and recounted fabulous hunting and fishing stories. Your respect for nature and your ability to “read” your surroundings has inspired me to observe more closely and to listen more intently. I hope that you will find ways in the future to spend time in the woods, to teach others, and to keep telling your stories. I also hope to keep sharing books with you!

I know how incredibly difficult closing schools for in person instruction is. Let’s face it, this is tough. It’s disappointing, frustrating and it’s just plain sad for kids, parents, teachers and all school employees.

My heart goes out to each and every one of you. It’s going to be hard. I know that, and I feel your pain.

But from my vantage point, I believe it’s the right decision because it’s for the health and safety of our kids and communities.

That’s why we’re doing all this: to keep people safe, to slow the spread, and to save lives.

I know we’re going to get through this, not because of any one person or any one action, but because of each of us doing our part.
We must stand united.

And we must continue to be Vermont Strong.

Thanks for doing your part.",3.0,"A message from Governor Scott to the people of VT.

I love when students light up as they learn how to play their favorite song for the first time and realize they have music in them too. I love it for the lessons it has given both me and my students about life – its purpose, its beauty, and its rules.

""BMU is a true community school. Our students have strong relationships not only with peers, but also with teachers. Because BMU is a PK-12 school, teachers and staff get to know each student as a whole person. We are so fortunate to have small class sizes. This allows each teacher to tailor instruction to meet the needs of individual students while also encouraging all students to meet high expectations. Our school is unique because we can watch our young preschoolers blossom and grow as citizens, leaders, and productive members of the community as they graduate high school and move into their adult lives.

This is my twentieth year as a teacher at BMU. Students I once had the pleasure of teaching are returning to BMU as teachers, paraprofessionals, receptionists, volunteers, and parents. Over the years I have seen changes in staffing and leadership. One thing that remains consistent is that BMU is a family where all members can find support, encouragement, and a helping hand.""

""My passion for learning began many years ago when I entered BMU as a kindergartener. I loved school and knew that I wanted to be a teacher one day. My journey into the field of education started at the University of Maine. In search of a warmer climate I moved away from this area and taught kindergarten in California and in North Carolina. I loved living and teaching in the South, but felt a strong tug to be back in Vermont with my family. Now, as a reading teacher, I get to share my enthusiasm for books as I work with the younger students in elementary school.

In today’s health class, Sgt Madison French and Lance Corporal Mark Puffer joined the students to talk about the Marines (the good, bad, and ugly). Puffer demonstrated how Marines are *encouraged* in boot camp. Many students in class are doing a career project and several were interested in joining the military. As folks probably know, BMU students visited Castleton last week and explored River Bend Career and Technical Center a few weeks before. We want students to know that there are many options available to them when they graduate high school.",0.0,"Blue Mountain Union Guidance & Counseling

""I feel very fortunate to be able to run a successful business in the area that I grew up in! I have been lucky to get some great advice along the way. Even though Blue Mountain Union was “old school” back in my day ….. I benefited from staff thinking outside the box when dishing out “punishment” for some of my less than perfect behavior. Being sent to the industrial arts room to weld a few chairs after school, instead of making me sit and write what I did wrong over and over, certainly helped direct me.

""Being a senior, and knowing that this is my last chance to win a championship, is nerve wracking. This final game is something I know I have to put it all out on the court for. After losing last year, we knew we had to come back stronger. Getting the chance to play MSJ, who beat us in the championship last season and beating them in the semifinals, was definitely one of the best accomplishments of this season. Now, getting the chance to play West Rutland and win a State championship is absolutely amazing!"" ~ Mika White",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2013531902087798&id=460864264021244,,0.0,"Humans in Buck Territory

A reminder to our families:
If you were getting your meals curbside pickup, but have gone back to work and now need them delivered to your student(s), please call Enderly at 261-6151 or email us at contactus@bvcps.net to request the change.

We are always happy to help and support our school family in any way we can.

Good afternoon.

I am proud to report that our Food Service Team led by Mary Poe has served 1186 meals over the last two days to the children of Buena Vista.

I would also give a shout-out to members of our transportation department, principals, members of our police department, and custodial staff that have helped over the last two days to deliver meals to homes or helped with the Grab-and-Go Meals for Blues.

Times like this make me proud to be associated with our school system and Proud to be a Blue!

We will be back at Enderly on Friday from 11:00 am - 1:00 pm for curbside pickup or you can call 261-6151 if you need delivery.

Good afternoon.

I am proud to report that our Food Service Team led by Mary Poe has served 1186 meals over the last two days to the children of Buena Vista.

I would also give a shout-out to members of our transportation department, principals, members of our police department, and custodial staff that have helped over the last two days to deliver meals to homes or helped with the Grab-and-Go Meals for Blues.

Times like this make me proud to be associated with our school system and Proud to be a Blue!

We will be back at Enderly on Friday from 11:00 am - 1:00 pm for curbside pickup or you can call 261-6151 if you need delivery.

Dr. John Keeler

Along with the medals, 11 seniors who have maintained a 3.5 grade point average of higher throughout their entire high school career received an academic letter jacket, which was also presented to them at this ceremony. Of the 255 students that received medals, 86 of them received gold medals, and 170 students received silver medals.

Contributions from across our PMHS band family made an idea into a reality for this year's show. This year the band has eight front sideline equipment covers and three 8ft tall backdrops. All of these prop frames were handmade by band parent, Jonathan Griffin. The steel was given to the band at cost value by Lee Hi Truck Parts and Service, which made this project affordable. The banners were created by Mariner Media in Buena Vista. Dimensions and style were designed by band parent, Andy Wolfe and the banners were designed by Marching Blues Alumna, Karen Bowen.

The mountain picture was taken by senior drumline member, Nathan LePere, and the fireworks picture was taken by 8th grade trumpet player, Weston Walker.

We are so excited to showcase these props at every band performance this season, and look forward to using these prop frames for many years to come!",3.0,"We are so lucky to have the commitment and support of this community. 💙

CITRS and CHARACTER COUNTS! have partnered to implement a groundbreaking three-year comprehensive character development initiative in 22 Buffalo Public School District (BPSD) schools. The overarching goal of the initiative is to cultivate ethical, respectful, and caring school environments, in which students can thrive and succeed academically, socially, and emotionally. Approximately 14,000 pre-K – 12 students in the City of Buffalo are benefiting from this initiative, as well as teachers, parents, and the surrounding community.

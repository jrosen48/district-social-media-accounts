Our class of 2020 will unfortunately not be able to have the same wonderful experience we all had. No prom, no graduation, no walking across the stage. Though this class may not be able to have this experience, we are asking you to help us make it as special as possible. I ask that you record a 30 second video of you giving this class support and well wishes, as they start their new and exciting journey. You can share what you loved about BuffSci and remind them that we are here even after they're gone. We plan to mash them together and display it for all of them to see as they drive up to get their diplomas. It would mean everything to Mr. Sullivan (Senior Grade Chair) and the entire class of 2020.

Today we distributed 5,000 hand sanitizers to people in need that are able to share with others! Every single person met today was so grateful for BuffSci’s commitment to our community. Many people were familiar and had siblings, relatives, or even themselves who attended BuffSci. We took this opportunity to get out into our community and help others! Everyone knows that finding hand sanitizer is not easy right now, so we thought if we could make it readily available to the public during this time, we could help protect one another! We dropped them off to a few different locations around Buffalo such as Rite Aid's, Family Dollars, Pizzerias, and a few more locations.

Not only does the Northland program lead to careers that are in high demand and pay well, Northland also partners with Alfred State College and SUNY Erie Community College, so students can continue to advance their education and career.

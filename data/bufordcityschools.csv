So many Wolves wanted the opportunity to donate so we have opened up March 30th for blood donations and volunteer opportunities.

** UPDATE **
Wolves, you are amazing! We will up this blood drive in an hour!! We have reached out to the American Red Cross to see if we can add a second day. When we get details we will let you know.

The American Red Cross had 4,000+ blood drives canceled due to COVID-19 resulting in 150,000 fewer donations at a crucial time. We are opening the Buford Arena for the American Red Cross to hold a much-needed blood drive. The Red Cross will have added staff to make sure there is minimal waiting to adhere to social distancing guidelines.

The following added measures have been put into place to keep everyone safe:

* No walk-ups will be taken. This blood drive is BY APPOINTMENT ONLY.

* Temperatures will be taken upon arrival.

* No children will be allowed.

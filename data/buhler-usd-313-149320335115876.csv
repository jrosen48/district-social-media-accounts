We will be showcasing our production of ""Me, Myself, and Hyde."" The show features arrangements from our very own Ethan Wagoner, Ron Zuniga, and drill and choreography from Joey Montes. It has been very therapeutic being around the kids and working with people that are willing to constantly adapt and follow protocol to make our art and activity happen. All we ask is if fans to keep social distancing and have masks in the stands! Looking forward to seeing you all! #radioheadcreep",2.0,"Buhler High School Bands

Beginning on Monday, April 6th, USD 313 will be allowing parents or guardians to pick up a meal permit for their children’s meals.

This meal permit will allow a parent to pick up the number of meals on your permit without your children needing to be in the car. Beginning April 6th, the number given on the permit will be based on the number of children in the vehicle when the permit is issued.

This means in order for all children in your household to receive a meal you must bring all of them on the day you pick up your permit. Once you receive your permit, you will just need to have the permit displayed on the dashboard of your vehicle in order to receive meals.

You are still welcome to bring your children with you as we do enjoy seeing them.

Starting Monday, March 23rd, eight free drive-up WiFi access points will be installed in rural Kansas communities, including: Bentley, Buhler, Inman, Lindsborg, Haven, north of Hutchinson, Moundridge and Yoder. More deployments are expected in the days to come. For an up to date map, check out http://ideatek.com/covid19.

These access points will be installed near parking stalls or lots where users can get online from the comfort of their vehicles and still practice social distancing. Each access point is designed to accommodate up to 50 devices at a time, and has a range of 250 feet line of sight. We request users prioritize school, work, or other important online obligations during busy times before using these spots for entertainment purposes. Those using the access points are asked to stay in their vehicles or practice social distancing by keeping at least six feet between themselves and others.",13.0,"Ideatek has been so great at working with school districts during this time to help us get internet availability to all students.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Buhler Police to conduct enforcement campaign near high schools
Beginning February 24 thru March 6, Buhler police dept. will join other law enforcement agencies in Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma with increased enforcement near high schools to raise awareness on roadway safety. Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for teens (15-18 years old) in the United States – ahead of all other types of injury, disease or violence.
“Even one teen death is unacceptable,” Captain Baldwin said. “Please slow down, put the phone away or turn it off, and always buckle up.”
Officers will issue citations to any individual who refuses to obey the traffic laws, whether it is for speeding, texting or failing to buckle up. Remind teens that driving is a privilege and encourage them to learn about the importance of driving safely.",0.0,"Buhler Police Department

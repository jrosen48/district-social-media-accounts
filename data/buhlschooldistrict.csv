7th and 8th grade students at Buhl Middle School got a little dose of reality recently when they participated in a “Reality Town” put on by GEAR UP. The purpose of Reality Town is to provide students with a hands-on simulation in which they make lifestyle and budget decisions as they take on careers, salaries, families, and the associated responsibilities of the adult world. Each student took on the role of a 30-year-old with family, career and money obligations. They balanced a checking account throughout the activity and learned to pay for child care, insurance, groceries and other necessities.",0.0,"Buhl School District added 31 new photos.

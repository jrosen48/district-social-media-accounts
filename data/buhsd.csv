Your BUHS AFJROTC Air Rifle team battled this past Saturday for the AZ Air Rifle JROTC Championships. We came just bit short in defending the state title we won last year, as Flowing Wells HS from Tucson beat us by several points, but State Runner-Up is not too bad. Individually however, Buckeye has 2 of the top 3 shooters in the State of Arizona with Carlos Villar coming in on top as the Individual State and Air Force shooter. Matthew Jakubowski made a tremendous comeback and finished 3rd in State after starting in 6th position during the final shoot-off. As usual, Dallas Keck and Cynthia Sutterfield shot their consistent scores. Next, we will be leaving for Las Vegas on the 8th of Feb to compete in the JROTC Regional Championships.

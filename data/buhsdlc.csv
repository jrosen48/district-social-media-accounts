It is the goal of the administration, staff and our school police officer to provide a safe learning environment for all students and staff on the Youngker campus.
Today, at 2:00 p.m., YHS received a phone call from the Buckeye police indicating that a potentially dangerous suspect was in the area and advised local schools to go into lock down as a safety precaution.
I am happy to report that all of our students are safe and law enforcement is on site and taking charge of the situation.
We take the safety of our students and staff very seriously and will continue to take every precaution to ensure that our campus is safe and secure at all times.

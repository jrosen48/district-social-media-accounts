There will be two weeks of instruction included.

Elementary--Pick up packet behind the gym. Take the road beside the baseball field. Meals served in pick-up/drop-off line.

JH--If you're picking up packet only, go to car rider line. If you want meals and packets...go to the bus line.

HS--Packets and meals will be served at the student pick-up/drop off area.

Elementary parents--put your child's name, grade, and specials (if they have one) on a piece of paper. We will take those in order to speed up the process.

The fee is to provide an incentive for students to take care of the district devices which they will use regularly, and protect them from excessive costs by accidental damage.

It goes without saying that knowledge and learning is vital to enable us to live our lives. While most of us appreciate the fact, many of us don´t appreciate those who dedicate their lives to the cause: the teachers! Teaching is a profession like no other.

Our teachers go above and beyond for their students!

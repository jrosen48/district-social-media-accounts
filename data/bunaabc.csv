We put in long hours and listen to lots of complaining usually from the people who don't do anything. We volunteer and we don't always post everything but we try to get most of the stuff we attend. Several of us have thought about not coming back to the booster club because of all the negative comments and complaints. Well today I received a letter from a young man who was very thankful for receiving his booster club scholarship. Things like that make it all worth listening to all the negative stuff that comes along with dealing with the booster club. Brock Terry that scholarship was given to you because we know it will be put to good use as will the other 5 scholarships the booster club gave out this year. Being able to help out kids is why we do this. With that being said step up and help out the booster club this year and you will know how good it feels to help out a kid going on to the next chapter in their life. #Cougarnation

We put in long hours and listen to lots of complaining usually from the people who don't do anything. We volunteer and we don't always post everything but we try to get most of the stuff we attend. Several of us have thought about not coming back to the booster club because of all the negative comments and complaints.

I took that plate from the little league park 9 years ago when we replaced the ones at the ball park for allstars when the Seniors were 9 years old. They won the district Chamionship that year. We have used that plate some more over the years but that plate has had many of your former players step up to it. I figured this was a great time to use it and put it in it's final resting place.

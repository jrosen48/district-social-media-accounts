On Monday morning, students returned to Charles C. Bell Elementary School for their first day of in-person ‚Äúon boarding‚Äù per the Plan B - Beyond schedule. Before joining their classmates in socially distanced classrooms operating at less than 50 percent student capacity, temperatures were taken and parents were asked a series of safety questions.

Following their initial on boarding, all students will transition to Remote Learning until September 28. (During this period, in consultation with local health professionals, we will make a decision regarding the remainder of our schedule this semester.)

Avery's Creek Elementary Dual Language Educator, Marina Dona Pozo, continues to engage her students throughout the summer months. Today her students met Spanish educator, author, and magician, XuXo Ruiz over Zoom for some math and magic. Xuxo used simple products such as cards, cardboard, and paper to delight students AND teach math. In addition to learning about math and science, students learned about Spain, the country Xuxo lives in and they shared a little about Asheville with him. Just because it is summer doesn't mean the learning stops...especially in Ms. Dona's Avery's Creek Elementary class.

As reported by the Valley Echo:
""Two things have remained consistent for the Owen Warlassies basketball team since the start of the 2016-17 campaign: each season has opened with a different head coach at the helm of the program and assistant coach Chasity Simpson joined every one of them on the bench, where she‚Äôs been a fixture as an assistant coach for the past seven years.

While the first trend will continue when the Warlassies tip off their 2020-21 season this winter under their fifth coach in as many seasons, Simpson will be returning to the sideline, but in a lead role.""

You can donate to a cause Riley would have loved. You can do a good deed for someone today.

‚ÄúTheir reactions make it so interesting,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe younger kids will try anything. I even had them identifying major and minor chords, because they don‚Äôt know that‚Äôs hard. There‚Äôs excitement and spontaneity.‚Äù

Ms. Anderson, a music teacher at Pisgah Elementary School and W.D. Williams Elementary, said her online classroom has created a space where children discuss music during and even outside of their normal class time.

‚ÄúA lot of the kids that are really fired up about music are on there every day,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going outside and recording the sounds of nature. They‚Äôre making music journals and listening to new songs to draw inspiration. We‚Äôve got this whole community sharing ideas instead of feeling isolated.‚Äù

BCS Autism Specialists Marlou de Vera and Aimee Adams work alongside teachers, sharing best methods and practices for behavioral, academic, and social success. During Virtual Days, they‚Äôre providing individualized virtual instruction and creating professional development materials for teachers and assistants.

‚ÄúWe help students integrate in their school and community,‚Äù Ms. de Vera said. ‚ÄúWe work with teachers to provide structure and encouragement to prepare all of our students for their tomorrow.‚Äù

Even though so many of us are at home, we want to share our love for every student, accommodate their needs, and celebrate their strengths. We are together even when we are apart.

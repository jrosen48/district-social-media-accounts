Dear Parents,

I would like to convey to you and the community that the Wheelersburg Schools continuously monitors our school environment to insure the safety of our students and staff. We strive each day to provide a safe, caring and nurturing learning environment in order that our students may thrive socially, emotionally and academically.

In order to insure students and staff may focus on teaching and learning and to help alleviate any anxiety all of us may be feeling, the Board of Education has authorized me to contract with the Scioto County Sheriff's office for an off-duty deputy to be present during school hours. The deputy will be in uniform and highly visible. The deputy will be present as much as possible for the remainder of the school year.

Please be assured, the Board of Education and administration will continue to evaluate and monitor our current safety and security practices.

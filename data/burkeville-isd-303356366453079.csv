Meals-to-go and new instructional packets will be available for pickup at the New Gym tomorrow, Wednesday April 8th 9am to 1pm. We know you have not had the last instructional packets for very long, so you do not need to return them if the work is not done. You may drop off completed packets at anytime at the Elementary Art room door slot (door next to Nurse's Office). Also, the work you will be receiving this week will contain about a month's worth of work. Make sure to have students work daily and return packets in a timely manner because teachers do need to grade the assignments. If your child needs help, please email your teacher. Any packets not picked up on Wednesday will be mailed.

Also remember that #COVID19 lives on droplets in the lungs of people with the virus, even if they don’t have symptoms. When infected people breathe, the virus enters the air. If you can’t #StayHome, wear a mask/scarf/bandana, stay 6 feet apart, and wash your hands. #DontGoViral

We have received several questions from districts regarding the Governor’s newest Executive Order on schools issued last Friday. For further guidance, please see our statement below.

“Following on Governor Abbott’s Executive Order on schools issued this afternoon, it is important to note that while the Governor’s decision continues the closure of school buildings for in-person classroom attendance for the duration of the 2019-20 school year, it in no way ends at-home instructional support for Texas’s millions of students.

“School districts across Texas have worked diligently to make the transition to virtual learning. Students must continue to receive daily academic support from their teachers and schools for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year.

“Thank you to our superintendents, principals, and teachers for their leadership in ensuring that academic progress continues during this unprecedented public health crisis.

Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, ""Life's most persistent question is, 'What are you doing for others?""

Yesterday, for our MLK Service Project, we were able to take around 35 football players to 7 different residences in our community, and help people do a lot of yard work and manual labor that they have been needing done for a while now.

We mowed, weed eated, trimmed trees and shrubs, raked leaves, raked more leaves, raked more leaves, hauled off branches and brush, cleaned gutters, and picked up trash. It was so awesome to see our student-athletes doing work and not expecting anything in return. I think that is a lost idea on a lot of our youth today.

It was a great show of SPIRIT, PRIDE, AND HONOR, and I couldn't be more proud of our kids and coaches.

Have a great day, and if you find yourself struggling, go and do something for someone else. I think you will find that you get as much out of it as they do.

Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, ""Life's most persistent question is, 'What are you doing for others?""

Yesterday, for our MLK Service Project, we were able to take around 35 football players to 7 different residences in our community, and help people do a lot of yard work and manual labor that they have been needing done for a while now.

We mowed, weed eated, trimmed trees and shrubs, raked leaves, raked more leaves, raked more leaves, hauled off branches and brush, cleaned gutters, and picked up trash. It was so awesome to see our student-athletes doing work and not expecting anything in return. I think that is a lost idea on a lot of our youth today.

It was a great show of SPIRIT, PRIDE, AND HONOR, and I couldn't be more proud of our kids and coaches.

Have a great day, and if you find yourself struggling, go and do something for someone else. I think you will find that you get as much out of it as they do.

Coming back from Christmas Break, the girls have been working hard to get back into rhythm. This past week we have traveled to Buda to the Hays HoopFest Tournament. We started off slow losing by 5 to Barton Middle school, but were able to pull it out the next two games, finishing 3rd.

Yesterday, the girls hosted Marble Falls and they came out ready to battle! They played great team defense and were able to shut down Marble star post player completely in the second half and went on an 11-0 run in the 3rd quarter.

Please congratulate these girls for their hard work. Thank you to everyone who came out and supported the girls' teams. Our next game will be Thursday at Lampasas. We hope to see you all there!

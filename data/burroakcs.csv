ATTENTION:
Middle and high school football players and parents: our parent/meet the coaches meeting will be on Thursday June 18th at 6pm at Boyer Field. By holding the meeting at the game field we will be able to follow social distancing guidelines and leave ample space between each other in the bleachers. We will go over guidelines and procedures regarding covid-19 and how we plan to protect your student-athletes while they participate. There will be a waiver that we will require you to sign before your athlete is allowed to practice. We hope to see you there!

Volleyball Players: Your meeting will take place at a later date once we are able to be in the gym again.

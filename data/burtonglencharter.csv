I’m writing today to share information about year-end report cards, which will include different details for the last marking period. Here’s what you will see and what it means for your child:

1. Your child’s last marking period grade will be either a “P” = participated or “NP” = did not participate in remote learning. You will see these letters under the last marking period column.
2. A “P” or NP” is NOT considered a letter grade. We are not grading remote learning.
3. The last marking period WILL NOT BE included in your child’s overall grade for the year. This will include only the marking periods before we began remote learning.

Please use the attached calendars as a guide to provide some “family fun” while home. We would love to see you in action, so post a picture or video of you and your family engaged in the activity of the day!

Dear Burton Glen Families,

I hope this letter finds your family healthy and safe as we adjust to our new normal. I am so proud of our teachers, who have stepped up during the ongoing closure to suggest learning opportunities for our scholars. They’ve tackled an enormous challenge by creating new ways in which we can keep kids connected, engaged, and learning.

I’m also brimming with pride when I see your efforts and that of our students who are eagerly creating their own ways to find meaningful connections to learning outside of the classroom.

Michigan competed in a six-State Crunch Off against Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio to determine who will be crowned the Great Lakes Region Crunch Champion through having the most crunches into local apples per capita.

This Crunch event encourages healthy eating, supports local agriculture and helps students and community members gain a deeper understanding of the food system.

Regional Macintosh apples from Applewood Farms in Sparta, Michigan were brought in for the students to crunch today while they were educated on fun facts surrounding all things apples.

A big THANK YOU to Mr. Williams and the Burton Glen community for being willing to participate and a SHOUT OUT to the Preferred Meals staff for help with passing out all the apples.

This Crunch event encourages healthy eating, supports local agriculture and helps students and community members gain a deeper understanding of the food system.

Regional Macintosh apples from Applewood Farms in Sparta, Michigan were brought in for the students to crunch today while they were educated on fun facts surrounding all things apples.

A big THANK YOU to Mr. Williams and the Burton Glen community for being willing to participate and a SHOUT OUT to the Preferred Meals staff for help with passing out all the apples.

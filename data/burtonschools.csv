Greetings Oak Grove Students and Families,
We hope you are all safe and sound! We miss you!
We are excited to announce that student iPads can be picked up this week. The schedule for drive thru pickup is below. Teachers are working this week to prepare online lessons and resources for our Stars! They will be in touch with you soon, if not already. If you have students in different grades, you may pick them up at the same time. Please rest assured we are taking all safety precautions as we work on getting devices out.

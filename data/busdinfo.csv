Set in 1946, this murder mystery follows three plucky detectives as they try to solve the crime of who could have murdered famous director, Kenneth Myers. : )

Because he was loathed by nearly everyone, there are many suspects, and we are inviting our viewers to play along in the comments section.

Today, the Burbank Police Department hosted the third and final ""Character Counts"" reward lunch at local Burbank Unified School District middle schools. This program was launched to encourage and reinforce the importance of good behavior and character, while emphasizing and promoting a positive school climate.

Today's final recognition was held at Luther Burbank Middle School, where students from grades 6, 7 and 8 were treated to a pizza and ice cream lunch with Burbank Police Officers. These students were nominated by teachers for living up to the six pillars of character: Trustworthiness, Respect, Responsibility, Fairness, Caring, and Citizenship.

The Burbank Police Department would like to thank Blaze Pizza and Stefan Doomanis - Realtor of Barry Burnett Realty for their generous support for this program and for donating the food, ice cream, and refreshments for the reward lunch.

The Burbank Police Department hopes to continue and expand this program in the future. Congratulations to all!",0.0,"Burbank Police Department

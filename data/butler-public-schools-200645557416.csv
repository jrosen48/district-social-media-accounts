Mrs. Tarr’s 6th grade classes are investigating how to measure speed by measuring the change in distance over time using our Car and Ramp Apparatus. They are also calculating how to not only calculate speed, but to predict changes in speed using formulas.

Students in Mrs. Koptyra’s classes created stories about water molecules traveling through the water cycle. Students chose digital storyboards or traditional comic strips to present their stories. Projects were peer evaluated during a gallery walk!

A big thank you to Butler NJ Pta for providing pizza parties for the 3 homerooms that won the membership drive! The students and teachers definitely enjoyed!

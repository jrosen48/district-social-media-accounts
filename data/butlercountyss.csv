A draft version of a portion of our Back to School plan for 2020-21 is posted below. Please keep in mind that this plan is subject to change as we get new information, guidance, and/or directives from State, County, and/or City leaders. Even though the plan may change, we feel it is necessary to share it now as you face the tough decision of whether to send your children back to a school campus on August 20 or whether to have them join us virtually this year instead. We hope this document answers many of the questions you have regarding how in-person learning will be different from previous years and how our virtual program will function.

It is critical that every student is represented on the Pre-Enrollment Form so that we can make informed decisions regarding adequate staffing and resources for our in-person and virtual programs. If you have already submitted the Pre-Enrollment Form for each of your children, please accept our thanks. If you have not completed the Pre-Enrollment Form for each of your children, please do so by Wednesday, July 29. The Pre-Enrollment Form can be completed online at https://forms.gle/2QKNbxeGFnLtj8V98.

Dear Public School Supporters:
As you may be aware, Greenville High School JROTC has been selected from a host of candidate schools to attend the U.S. Army National Drill Championships. The National Championships will be held on March 20-21, 2020 in Richmond, VA.
Our students on the High School Drill Team and Color Guard under the leadership of Colonel Alan Hester and Sgt. Reginald Williams have worked very hard to achieve this honor. The total cost for travel, lodging and meals for the students is $14,807.88. The U. S. Army has generously agreed to cover the majority of these costs leaving only $2,364.00 for the remainder of the expenses for the trip.
The poverty level (free/reduced lunch status) of students at Greenville High School is 84%. Many of our families cannot afford to bear the cost for their children to attend this event. Therefore, we are seeking contributions from our school community to assist in paying the remainder of the cost. This trip is an opportunity for our students to participate in a national competition and for many of them, their only opportunity to experience life outside of Butler County. Please help us in making this possible for them.
Any contribution will be greatly appreciated. The contributions are also tax deductible. Please join us in this endeavor to help make memories that will last a lifetime for these boys and girls in our school system. Checks should be made payable to Greenville High School – JROTC and mailed to my attention at our address noted above. Thank you for your support of the Butler County School System and our students.

Sincerely,
Joseph Eiland

Dear Thermalito Families:

The challenges just keep on coming - with the area fires, we have friends, family and neighbors evacuated from their homes. The ash fall in our area is substantial and the air quality is poor. Because of the current environmental conditions and the unpredictable nature of this fire we are not going to add any new lessons for students on Thursday and Friday. We are also not requiring students to log into classroom sessions until Monday. Today, Thursday and Friday will not be considered unexcused absences for attendance purposes. We also have to cancel meal distributions for the remainder of this week. Please stay tuned to our social media and website for updates for when it will resume (we hope early next week). Take care of yourselves as you navigate the uncertainty of the next few days. Good bye for now.",0.0,"#ButteCOE #ButteSchoolsStrong

Dear Thermalito Families:

The challenges just keep on coming - with the area fires, we have friends, family and neighbors evacuated from their homes. The ash fall in our area is substantial and the air quality is poor. Because of the current environmental conditions and the unpredictable nature of this fire we are not going to add any new lessons for students on Thursday and Friday. We are also not requiring students to log into classroom sessions until Monday. Today, Thursday and Friday will not be considered unexcused absences for attendance purposes. We also have to cancel meal distributions for the remainder of this week. Please stay tuned to our social media and website for updates for when it will resume (we hope early next week). Take care of yourselves as you navigate the uncertainty of the next few days. Good bye for now.",2020-09-09 20:28:29,,

“I have 15 months of sobriety and I have never felt this good in my life. Having the opportunity to work in the Back 2 Work Program has built my confidence and it is the first time that I’ve had a bank account. My son (14 yrs) and my family’s relationship is stronger than ever. I have had to re-learn about responsibilities, which has allowed me to be happy with myself. I am so grateful for the Back 2 Work Program!"" - Daniel

May is Mental Health Matters Month. Every Friday this month, we will highlight different ways we can focus on our mental health.

This week's tip is all about kindness. Studies show that simple acts of kindness can boost our immune systems by reducing stress and heighten the production of the “feel good” hormones in our brains. During this period of physical distancing, many of us may be experiencing loneliness at much higher levels than ever before. The simple act of kindness is something that can help us stay connected while also reducing the negative effects of loneliness. Just another reason why its cool to be kind!

Follow the #eachmindmatters campaign for more ways we can focus on our mental health.

Senior Families - Although we missed Wood Works Wonder (aka Birdhouse Build), The Rotary Club of Chico and Chico Building have stepped up to make this event come alive. They will provide kits for seniors to make a birdhouse from home, at no cost. Once done, we hope to display and honor our Seniors of the Class of 2020. The Rotary Club will pre-cut the wood and pre-drill for the screws. We will provide the screws. Register via the link in our bio for your free kit and let us know what other supplies you need. We also can supply things such as paint, brushes, wood glue, tile, roofing shingles and a screwdriver. We have a limited supply of these items.
If you can donate any supplies to help we would be so appreciative. Email us at: info@chicohighsobergradnight.com
Please register for a birdhouse kit by May 5th! We will have them available for pick up or delivery between May 11th-13th. The birdhouses need to be completed by May 25th. We will let you know how we will proceed with displaying them based on our community guidelines.

Eric Ayers, Chico State Physics Dept., (daughter/son are recent CHS grads) approached Mr. Stephens to be a part of the effort. The CHS Art Dept. stepped up and has been producing the masks. Each mask takes about 3 hours to complete. NVCF has granted the filament to make them. Great team effort!! ❤️💛

Senior Families - The Class of 2020 is in a unique position during these unprecedented times and our heart goes out to them. They deserve much celebration!! We want to share our love, recognize their achievements and celebrate them with “Class of 2020 Yard Signs.” Let’s put them in yards all over Chico – buy them for your house, grandparents houses, family and friends.

We are selling the signs at below cost ($5) and will have 2 porch delivery pick up sites in Chico when they are available. If you purchase 5 or more, we will deliver them for free! ❤️🎓💛

😻While we can’t predict what the end of the year is going to look like, we are working hard to make alternative plans. So, keep on making those memory boards (see more information on our website). We will come up with a plan to showcase them in some way!

Reports from the Bay Area indicate the stay at home order is working. We can do this Butte County! Thank you for your continued diligence and commitment to each other. Stay home. If you need to go out for essential activities, maintain your space (at least 6 feet from others) and you may choose to cover your face with a cloth face covering. You can use a mask if you already have one, if not, save those for our healthcare workers.

Valued friends, and fans of Butte High School Athletics and Activities:

We appreciate all of your enthusiastic help and financial support, and we thank you.

Out-of-state and internet businesses solicit the Butte community for advertisements in their publications. They use the Butte High name and Butte High athletic schedules making it appear that you are supporting your Bulldogs. This is not true. Butte High School activities do not receive one cent of the monies paid to out-of-state vendors.

Please be aware of scams. Be sure that your contribution will support genuine Butte Montana Bulldogs. When our coaches or kids knock on you door or stop at your business, they will have Butte High School identification. These letter jackets, activity cards, letterheads, promotional fliers, will clearly state that these are your Butte High Bulldogs, or Butte Athletic Council.

We want you to know how much we appreciate your support. Just make sure your contribution goes where you want it to go.

Thank you.

A dinner event supporting the Butte Emergency Food Bank's Backpack Program. Enjoy a bowl of soup donated by local businesses with family and friends. When you take home a ceramic bowl, you are reminded that you help fill someone's empty bowl.

The Backpack Program provides meals and snacks for students every weekend. With these meals, students are more attentive in classes, retain more information, and have better moods to welcome classroom activities and homework.

The more money we raise for the program, the greater number of Backpacks we can fill. Our goal is to fuel the youth of our Butte community so they can use the best of their education to make good life decisions.

This is the fifth year of the dinner. We thank you for your support and look forward to seeing you.

For tickets you can email Mike Kujawa at kujawama@bsd1.org or tickets are sold at the Butte Food Bank between 8 am-12:00 pm M-F.

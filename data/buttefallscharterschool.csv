Thank you to all of our teachers, full-time and part-time, including Sarah, Ashley, Danielle, Maggie, Trina, Jill, Skylar, Sarti, Ben, Terri, Cy, Natalie, Shayna, Sean, Harry, Chris, Betsy, Rini, Catherine and Dianne.
Two weeks ago the Board passed the attached Resolution acknowledging the important role our teachers play in making learning work for students. I am pleased to attach that resolution as acknowledgement from our School Board.

I know that some of you are struggling with making sure your students have insurance coverage. Unfortunately, we cannot take your child on field trips unless they have insurance coverage.

Here is an option through Oregon Health Plan that may work for you and it's free.

Tonight we crowned our 2019 Pear Blossom Senior Scholarship Pageant Queen, Claryssa Oswald (Butte Falls Charter School). When we started this a few months backs she said, ‚ÄúI want to be Pear Blossom Queen because I want my family to be proud of me. My sister was Pear Blossom Queen in 2013 and ever since then, I knew I also wanted to do it. I want to make myself and my family proud of whom I have grown up to be. ‚Äú

Our 1st runner up is Alyson Scheffler (Eagle Point High School) and our 2nd runner up is Hannah VonHolle (Logos Public Charter School).

Also pictured with the lovely young ladies is the amazing Pear Blossom President Darcey Mann-Self and our emcee for the evening Brian O‚ÄôConnor.

Each of our 8 princesses will soon graduate high school and go on to do great things and leave a memorable legacy - that we are certain.

As the pageants for 2019 now come to a close, we would like to thank our presenting sponsor Rogue Credit Union for their continual support. As well as KOGAP Enterprises and all of the sponsors and contributors for helping to make every pageant a success! Also to a big shout out and thank you to all of our volunteers for their hard work.

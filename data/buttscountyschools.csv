Butts County School System is committed to improving literacy for our students and reading aloud is a very important step in the process. Children begin to understand proper sentence structure and build vocabulary while listening to stories. So today, we ask you to set aside some time to read aloud to your child. We’re sharing Stark Elementary School's Bedtime Stories Series to get you started! Happy Reading!

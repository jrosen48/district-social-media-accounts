9/9/20

Dear Bureau Valley Junior High Parents and Students,

In March 2020 the Bureau Valley School Board approved the addition of a BVJH JFL Program for the 2020/21 school year. We have been looking forward to a successful 2020 first season and a lot of hard work went into planning and preparing for our first year. However, according to the IDPH Sports Safety Guidance, football is placed into the highest risk category and teams are not allowed to participate in any contact practices, scrimmages or competitive play at this time. For the safety of our students, and in alignment with IESA, IHSA and the IDPH guidance, we regret to inform you that we are cancelling the BVJH JFL 2020 season. We will now turn our vision and attention to our 2021/22 season and look forward to building a successful program that will grow each year and enhance the high school football program for years to come.",0.0,"Bureau Valley Junior High / Elementary

We would like to thank everyone for their patience as the foundation board has tried to determine how to move forward with the draw down. We are so disappointed that we have not been able to host an in-person event.

We especially thank all of those who already purchased tickets, and those who donated items and money towards our cause. Continuing to provide classroom grants to teachers this year is very important to us. We plan to use those donations towards the 20-21 classroom grants.

Stay tuned: in the next couple of weeks if you purchased a ticket you will still have a chance to win the money. We will be drawing the tickets for the top five money winners from $50-$750 on Facebook Live. Winners will be notified. We will also be hosting a Facebook auction for the wonderful auction items that had been donated and we had collected.

Three students from Bureau Valley High School's Interact Club and Mrs. Nichols, sponsor of the German Club, traveled to Kewanee High School on February 26th to teach interested staff and students about school food-waste solutions. Jacob Benavidez, Ethen Webb, Brooklynn Cade and Mrs. Nichols hauled seven working worm bins to the school so that the twenty participants could dig in and see the worm farm in action. The German Club donated 4,000 worms to get KHS started with their own worm composting project and supplied them with shredded newspapers and sawdust captured from the school's waste stream.

The composting program at BVHS involves both the Jr. High and High School Interact Clubs, the Life Skills Class, the German Club, and Botany and Food Science classes. Grants from the Bureau Valley School Foundation have funded most of the compost system expenses. To date, the initiative has processed over three tons of food waste from the school.",2.0,"BVHS Interact Club does demonstration of Composting Program for Kewanee High School!

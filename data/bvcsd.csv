I want you to know that we have set two dates for all school items except for chrome books, unless you are not returning to school at Boyer Valley next year, to be returned and if you have any personal items here to be picked up along with report cards. The two dates are May 21 and 22 from 8:00AM to 3:00PM. If these two dates do not work for you, I ask that you call the school to make other arrangements.",2020-05-08 16:48:18,,

We are halfway through the school closure to the end of the scheduled school year. I would again like to express the importance OF doing as much of the assigned work/activities you possibly can. Even though it is voluntary and not graded, the staff is sharing it with you to help keep your mind sharp & your brain engaged in your education and on-going learning.

This time is very unfortunate for everyone and I want you to know that all the employees at school miss you and want you to know that we are thinking about you and want what is best for you.

Troy had a great night! If his only complaint is a headache and a bigger bed I’m happy. He answered all of the doctors questions and commands throughout the night. He’s still complaining of his right shoulder hurting but X-ray shows it’s not broke. He’s still in ICU but improving every day. They are talking about starting him on a liquid diet, he’s not thrilled, as he really wants a Burger King whopper and to be back on the court. As a mom and all the fans at the game, watching this unfold was not easy. Jeremy and I are thrilled with where he’s at already. I want all the students to know he’s going to be ok. While a fractured skull with a brain bleed is serious, things could have been much worse. The doctors and nurses have been great and are also happy with where he is. You expect to see a sprained ankle or knee at a basketball game not this. We truly feel like the power of prayer has helped all of us through this.

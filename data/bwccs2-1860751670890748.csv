Today, Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered schools to be closed in New York City through April 20.
.
**BwCCS2 will be closed**
.
Work packets were sent home with students last week, and all students should begin their work packet(s) on Monday, March 16.
.
Teachers will be calling in the next few days with more information on remote learning as well as to provide feedback to students and the work they have completed at home.
.
Until those calls happen, Dojo is a good way to stay in touch with teachers as well as to send questions or completed work.
.
We know these times are uncertain, but we know our community will be strong and support one another. We will continue to put our students and their education and well-being first.
.
More information on the steps we are taking will come from teachers and school leaders, soon.

🧥 Thursday, December 19 is Ugly Sweater/Holiday Sweater Day.
.
🎶 And Friday, December 20 at 1:30PM is BwCCS2 Lower School's Winter Concert! Families are invited to watch and listen to a variety of uplifting songs that students have been working hard to perfect! Students are invited to wear dressy, festive attire on this day.

.
That's why B2 partnered with City Growers this year! Through our partnership, 4th grade took part in an Urban Ecology series where they had science lessons at the Naval Cemetery and Commodore Barry Park.
.
Over the three-part series, students left the classroom to learn firsthand about: 1) Urban ecosystems and habitats 2) Native plant restoration and pollinators 3) and Niches and adaptations.

Thanks City Growers for a great year of learning outside the classroom! 🌳🐝🌸

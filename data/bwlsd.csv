“Hello! My name is Cailyn Sutliff and I am on the kindergarten team at General Rosecrans Elementary. I grew up in Granville, Ohio and now live in New Albany with my husband, Nick. We are both teachers, and love to travel and explore our national parks! I graduated from Ohio State University in December of 2018, and soon after became a reading tutor at GRE. Over the summer, I had the opportunity to join the kindergarten team and have loved every minute of it! To me, #InspireandGuide means providing my students the tools to be successful problem solvers. I want to teach my kids to ask questions and help them become lifelong learners!”

Our BWE Student Council completed two successful service projects during the first semester. In October, they organized an initiative called “PJ’s for Preemies” where they raised $650 for Grant Hospital NICU by encouraging students to donate $1 to wear pajamas to school for the day. This program was in honor of one of our BWE teachers, whose premature son spent the fall in the Grant NICU.

This group also organized the food drive efforts to “FILL THE BUS” in November.

We just wanted to get some information out to our families as we prepare for the new school year. As of right now we are in desperate need of volunteers to fill board seats. We are seeking someone to step in and take over as president, as our current president has filled that seat for the allocated number of consecutive year, per our bylaws. We also need at least 2 more people to step in and fill the other seats, be that as secretary, treasurer or vice president.
We will be working out the details of how meetings will look in the coming weeks.
The PTA has done some great work over the last couple of years, with the help of our fantastic parent volunteers! Please help keep this organization moving forward by volunteering your time. Together we can continue to make great progress!

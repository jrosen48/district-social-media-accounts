This Wednesday, Oct. 31st, will be our annual Halloween Parade and Party. We will be having a regular day of school up until it is time to change into costumes, so no need to come early. If you aren't helping your child change, you can head straight down to the big gym to find a seat to view the parade.

2:00-2:15 Time to change into costumes for the parade
2:15ish We will announce one class at a time to walk down to the gym for the parade.
2:35ish Classes and party parents will return to classrooms for parties. Everyone else is free to go. (Please just PARTY PARENTS at the parties. We need room to play games and there will only be enough snacks for the students. Thanks!)

PLEASE NOTE: If your child is doing something different at the end of the day (i.e. going with a friend, riding a different bus, etc.), we will need a note.

Thanks for helping us keep our kids safe!!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=550018828756447&id=405520556539609,,0.0,"Dear Elementary Parents,

Way to go, Byron! 75% of families have enrolled in the available learning options!!!

But, we don't have enrollment information for 587 students, so we have a ways to go. We'll keep sending reminders as we are depending on this information for our planning. Please encourage your friends and neighbors to enroll.

ALL families will need to enroll their child(ren) into a learning model by August 16. You may also come to the District Office to complete a form. Please note a separate enrollment form must be completed for each student.

At a Special Board meeting today, the Byron School Board unanimously approved our Return To School Plan.

Byron's base learning model calls for in-person learning for elementary students, hybrid learning for secondary students.

In addition, we are also offering a distance learning model to all families who choose not to attend in-person learning due to medical risks or other safety concerns. This is called the Family Flex Option.

The base learning model determination may not be the same for all grades. The research has shown much more limited transmission of COVID-19 in younger children.

When will we know what the 2020-21 school year might look like for public and charter schools?

Here’s what we know right now.

Q: When will a decision be made about the 2020-21 school year?

A: By the week of July 27, according to the Minnesota Department of Education. Whether it’s the last week of July or earlier, a specific date has not yet been scheduled for an announcement. But planning for the possibilities is already underway.

Q: What could the 2020-21 school year look like in Minnesota?

A: We have been asked to develop three contingency plans for the 2020-21 school year:
Scenario 1: In-person learning for all students.
Scenario 2: Hybrid model with strict social distancing and capacity limits.
Scenario 3: Distance learning only.

Depending on the virus, we might need to transition quickly within these scenarios during the year — with guidance from health officials. More information will be coming soon. #ByronBears",5.0,"Byron Superintendent

The sale will be held for one day on Saturday, May 9th, from 9 am - 2 pm. Due to public health restrictions, our greenhouse sale will be run a little differently this year. Our goal is safety while providing beautiful flowers, hanging baskets, vegetables, and herbs. All plants will be moved out of the greenhouse and placed on the lawn next to the high school. This will allow for the social distancing of all our patrons. While prices will be posted as in years past. We ask that you pay what you can in donation to our program. We will be unable to make change as we will be asking you to put your cash or check into a locked payment/donation dropbox.

The Byron High School Greenhouse is located on the north side of the high school. We encourage individuals to practice all safety measures that have been recommended by the CDC.

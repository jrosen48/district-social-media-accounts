The Byron Center Chamber of Commerce has come up with this event as a way for area businesses to promote themselves.
There is a friendly competition for Instagram also.
All the details can be read here:
http://www.byroncenterchamber.org/byron-rules-the-roost

The Idea of the Game
People will take pictures of themselves with the chickens and post them to Instagram using 2 hashtags:

#ByronRulesTheRoost (to identify the game)
#Chicken7 (to identify the chicken)

The chicken number is the number that is associated with the flyer and map that will be distributed, posted on our website, and is attached to this email.

We will be randomly selecting participants that have posted pictures to award them with gift certificates provided by Chamber Members.

Also, feel free to post your pictures to our facebook page and tag Byron Center Chamber of commerce.",3.0,"Byron Center Charter School

December is a busy time for student activities so I just wanted to send out a reminder for a few events that the student council is putting on. Candy Grams are currently being sold at lunch and in the office. They are sold for $1 each and will be delivered on 12/20.

The student council is also busy getting ready for the gingerbread house competition after school on 12/20. This event is free and open to students in grades 6-12. Please consider donating supplies for the kids to build and decorate their houses with! You can see the items needed in the sign up genius link below:

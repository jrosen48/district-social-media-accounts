I have formed many special bonds with teachers and students. Although I have not participated in school sports, I do enjoy playing football and basketball in my spare time.

After college, I plan to travel the world and one day live and work in another country. My favorite memory of #CCA is meeting my best friend.

As the 2018 National American Miss North Carolina Jr. PreTeen Queen, Elyse’s future goals include being crowned as a national title holder of National American Miss Pageant System and attending Harvard or Yale University. Be sure to lookout for her name in the spotlight as she also aspires to be an actress and model. As a 5th grader one of her biggest accomplishments thus far has been making her national TV debut on ABC’a ‘Kids Say The Darnedest Things!’ She also enjoys singing, dancing, volunteering, and hanging out with family and friends. #CSUSAproud #CabarrusCharter #ConcordNC #SchoolChoice #Huskies",2020-05-08 14:00:46,,

Hi! My name is Millea Eaton. I joined Cabarrus Charter Academy in my 4th-grade year. I am currently a 5th grader. My favorite subject is Science & Math. I am the daughter of Brandon & Carrie Byrum and Aaron Eaton. I have one step-sister, Grace Byrum and two half-sisters, Jaylene and Maylene Eaton.
I have two cats named Zeb and Rosa, one dog named Oreo, one fish named Moon, one rabbit named Lucille.
I enjoy playing basketball for Upward and attending church. 2020 was a BIG YEAR for me, I was baptized on January 26th! In my free time I like to paint and participate in 5k's with my mom.
My favorite vacation spot is the beach. Swimming is my favorite summer sport.
When I graduate, I want to go to college to be a chef.
My favorite memory of #CCA was meeting new friends.
Best Wishes to my 5th Grade Class!

I've attended Cabarrus Charter Academy since Kindergarten and I was selected for their Cambridge program every year since 1st grade. I enjoyed learning math, science, technology, the running club and going to field trips. My favorite memory from school is receiving the High Honor Roll award at the end of 4th grade.
When I'm not in school I'm a competitive swimmer and hope to continue swimming for my middle school team and then all the way thru college.

Boosterthon is off to a great start thanks to your support. Fundraisers are critical for us to provide improvements to our school to enhance the overall experience for our students. With proceeds gained from this fundraiser we are looking to purchase some additional playground equipment and support teacher/student appreciation events. Previous Boostherthon events have empowered us to gain resources for bleachers in the gym. We anticipate the bleacher installation in December and/or January. Two incentives have been added:

- The student who brings in the most donations will get to be principal for the day with Ms. Miracle!!!
- If 75% of students are registered online by Wednesday, November 13th we will let students silly string the admin team!

We are excited to introduce our Before & After School Director, Mrs. Tonya Simpson!

My name is Tonya Simpson and I am the new Before & After School (BAC) Director for Cabarrus Charter Academy (Upper and Lower). I was the BAC Director at my last school within the CSUSA family. I am very excited to start the new school year with all of you! We will have Full & Part-Time care again this year, but at much lower rates. The price sheets, registration form, and BAC Parent Handbook are all posted on our website (link found below) for you to reference. Please feel free to email me at tsim2008@icloud.com temporarily until my Cabarrus Charter email is up and running. I will update as soon as it is working. My summer hours vary and are limited, so if you have a question or need assistance, please send an email and I will respond as soon as I'm able.

I look forward to meeting all of my new families at Open House on August 15th!

The price sheets, registration form, and BAC Parent Handbook are all posted on our website (link found below) for you to reference. Please feel free to email me at tsim2008@icloud.com temporarily until my Cabarrus Charter email is up and running. I will update as soon as it is working.

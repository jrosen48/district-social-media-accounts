For Immediate Release: We are very excited for the Fall and can’t wait to see our students’ beautiful faces. We have missed them. We will open in August and look forward to welcoming our families back to school. Whether families send their student(s) to school or keep them at home, we are prepared. Rest assured we will follow CDC, state, and local safe-school guidelines in all situations. We are ready even if your needs change throughout the school year. Please see our summary of learning options to help you understand our plans moving forward.

More details will be forthcoming.

For Immediate Release: We are very excited for the Fall and can’t wait to see our students’ beautiful faces. We have missed them. We will open in August and look forward to welcoming our families back to school. Whether families send their student(s) to school or keep them at home, we are prepared. Rest assured we will follow CDC, state, and local safe-school guidelines in all situations. We are ready even if your needs change throughout the school year. Please see our summary of learning options to help you understand our plans moving forward.

More details will be forthcoming.

I came to NC by way of New York City in 2016. Although being a city girl at heart, I adjusted well to the country life. I Iove to sing, dance, write, cheer, run track and socialize.

I started attending CCA in the 6th grade. I have been an honor role student my entire time here and this past year was awarded the opportunity to be Cheer captain.

In the fall, I will be attending Cabarrus Kannapolis Early college. I am excited for this next chapter in my life. After High school, I plan to attend college where I will start my journey to becoming a Defense Attorney. Did I tell you I LOVE to argue my point? It's been real CCA!

Push the snooze button and you'll end up working for someone who didn't - Eric Thomas

Keep working hard Graduates!

My name is D'Omarion Ja-Micah Smalls affectionately known as DJ. I am the son of Demond and Niki Smalls. I am 14 years old and a rising 9th grader. I have 2 brothers, 1 sister, and a nephew. I have attended CCA for the past three years and have played basketball and baseball all three years. I plan to attend a public school for high school next year but not sure which one yet. After high school my goal and dream is to attend Auburn University where I will play sports and study Ethology but will thank God for any creditable secondary school offer.

Hi! My name is Nick Thompson and I am a senior at Cabarrus Charter Upper school. I have been a student at Cabarrus Charter Upper since it opened back in 2016. I was born and raised in Concord, NC and am the only child of Jim and Tracy Thompson. I have learned a lot in my time at CCA and enjoyed the smaller class sizes and one on one teacher connections. I also enjoyed playing baseball in my Junior and Senior years. After graduation I plan on attending CPCC for Culinary Arts. My career goal is to someday to be my own boss and own a food truck.

During his senior year he worked 2 jobs for most of the year. He plans to go into a trade after high school.

Harvey began his school career in Cabarrus County Schools when it was discovered that their school system was not a good fit so we changed to Cabarrus Charter Academy in his 5th grade year.

He looks forward to graduating but loves the Charter School for giving him the first of his many new beginnings.

CCA is a great school of choice!! Mrs. Miracle is an amazing principal. She truly cares about the staff and students. The staff seem very happy and they treat the students with respect. They truly care about the students academically and personally. If I have ever had an issue or question it has been addressed right away. My son is in 9th grade and has been at CCA since 5th grade. He plans on graduating from CCA.

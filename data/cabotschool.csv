Cabot and Twinfield High School Athletics would like to officially welcome back Peter to the coaching line up, coaching the varsity boys soccer team! Varsity soccer officially begins on Thursday, August 15th for practices. We would like to make sure everyone who has a child that is interested in playing soccer receive any information that is sent out about practices and other important information. Please make sure the school office has the best email contact information for you and your family, if it has changed since last school year.

If your child will be playing fall soccer, please send me a quick email at Llehoe@cabotschool.org and I will make sure to have your information sent over to the coach.

Please check in with your child’s physician to see if your child needs a new physical. All physical clearances have to be less than 2 years old. Athletic paperwork will need to have an up-to-date sports clearance form in the file for grades 7-12.

Congratulations to the team from Cabot School on a great showing at the NAQT Small-School National Championship outside Chicago today!

The Vermont small-school champions finished with a 5-5 record and had a shot at the six wins needed to make the playoffs before falling in their last game. Junior Luca Socks was the tournament's #14 individual scorer.

What's more impressive? That a team from a school with 32 high school students had such a good showing or that they did so after driving nearly a thousands miles to Chicago? Either way, great job team!

Lynn Rockwell, who went to Alabama in the late 1960's, gathered survey answers that helped win a lawsuit against food and housing discrimination.

With windchill warnings of -25 for the morning, Twinfield and Cabot School will have a two-hour delay Thursday, January 31, 2019.

This has been a horribly difficult winter season already, and I was hoping not to have to do this because tomorrow is also a scheduled early release day, but I don't want your children waiting for a bus at 7:00am. We are still planning to do an early release tomorrow, but if the combination of a late start and an early release is problematic for your family, and you find it easier to keep your children home or at daycare tomorrow, we will be counting tomorrow as an excused absence.

Because staff will be delayed in their arrival, please do not drop your children at school before 10:00 am. There will be no morning preschool session, but afternoon preschool will still be held.

Tomorrow, Dec. 18th from 1:30-2:30 our 3rd and 4th graders will present their learning about Natural Disasters in the United Sates and how we can protect ourselves from them.

On Wednesday, Dec. 19th at 5:30 PM middle school students will share an interactive gallery of their Blue Planet Projects.

Family, friends, and community members are encouraged to chat with students about their research and artifacts—and the successes and challenges of creating them. Presenting work at a public exhibition makes the project more meaningful.

We have been getting almost daily updates from the health department regarding COVID-19. They have asked that we thank our school community for your efforts to follow Governor Herbert’s directive to “Stay Safe, Stay Home.” These efforts are working to curb the spread of the virus and “flatten the curve,” a term we have all become familiar with during the last few weeks.

Please remember to continue to practice good hygiene and social distancing. For those of you picking up lunches at the schools or bus stops, we ask that you limit the number of your family members who come to pick up lunches and that you remain vigilant in staying the recommended six feet away from your friends and neighbors. (In Utah, this means six pans of green jello, 18 cans of diet coke laid end to end, or for you downhill skiers, a 180cm ski.) Also, we know it can be challenging, but please remind your children to keep their distance from other children and avoid playing on school playground equipment.

Thank you for helping to prevent the spread of COVID-19!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2828904543823557&id=420677654646270,,0.0,"Hello CCSD families,

Standing for Something: Spring Creek students create and gain awareness through art",3.0,"Combining art with activism, students at Spring Creek Middle School are hoping to create change. Each year, teaching artist Meg Erekson provides students with a unique opportunity to create art based around a central theme--and this year's theme is “Stand for Something.” So far, student artwork has addressed bullying, pollution, world hunger, alcoholism, drug abuse, and much more. This artwork provides insight into subjects that students are passionate about changing.

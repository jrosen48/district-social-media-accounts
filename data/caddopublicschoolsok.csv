Attention Tribal Members: SSAF Applications will NOT open July 1.

Please note that there are changes to the Student School and Activity Fund (SSAF) application and distribution process this year. The COVID-19 Student Assistance Program (SAP), provided through the Cares Act relief fund, will serve as a temporary replacement for SSAF. Applications for this one-time funding occurrence will open July 6, 2020, at 8:00 a.m. CST. SSAF will be reinstated on October 1, 2020, for families that do not qualify for SAP funding.

I want to take this opportunity to let you know that the school district now has the capability to send out District notifications through text messaging. We are going to try to start the text notification system on Monday. We will still post notifications on our Facebook site and Twitter site. If you have a cell phone # listed under your child‚Äôs enrollment, you will not need to do anything to sign up for messaging. If not, you will need to go to caddoisd.org and scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the section labeled CONNECT and follow the directions. If you have any issues in signing up, you can email me at lnorthcutt@caddoisd.org and I can help you with the process.

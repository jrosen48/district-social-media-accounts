Mrs. Schaefer and Mrs. Powell want to thank all the 6th graders that showed up for our live class meeting today (video chat)! We saw 21 smiling 6th graders and got the latest updates on how they’re keeping busy. Almost everyone brought their pet to class, so that was a fun surprise and made for a lot of laughs! We will try to remember the names of all the pets 🐶 for the next class.

*UPDATE*: 5th Graders from Mrs. Freeland/Ms.Williams/Mrs. Koenig's Team also met up for a live class meeting with about the same number of students present as 6th grade! WOW! Students were asking questions about assignments, asking for MORE to do, and enjoyed each other's company. They recorded their class meeting and it is posted on Google Classroom for their team in case anyone was not able to make it.

Everyone had a great time with friends today, and it made us miss you all so much more!! There was a high demand to do this again, so we will schedule another one!! Stay tuned! #MTMSrocks #Vikings 💙💛",3.0,"#VikingPride #MTMSInspiresUs #CadillacExcellence

The Harlem Renaissance was the development of the Harlem neighborhood in New York City as a black cultural mecca in the early 20th Century and the subsequent social and artistic explosion that resulted. Lasting roughly from the 1910’s through the mid 1930’s, the period is considered a golden age in African American culture, manifesting in literature, music, stage performance and art. #cr #goriders #netde #edude",2020-03-02 19:55:47,,

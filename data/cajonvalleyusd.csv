While life as we know it continues its slow re-opening, let's face it, things are still weird and will take some adjustment. But your Panda fix doesn't have change!

It's another Panda Express fundraiser for Hillsdale Music on WEDNESDAY, MAY 27, ALL DAY.

Don't worry about your meal prep--go to Panda Express in Rancho San Diego! Your family will love it, you won't have to cook, and the Hillsdale Music Department will get a portion of the proceeds (we need this now more than ever!).

Just show this flyer on your phone when checking out and mention you're here for the fundraiser. Or order online and enter 310144 in the promo code box.

Thank you!

Today is May the 4th. If we were at school, we would all have our favorite Star Wars gear on. Here’s a picture of my friends and I while we were running the Star Wars challenge. We stopped and waited almost 30 minutes in line to take a picture with Chewbacca right in the middle of our race. It took a long time, but you can tell from our smiles, we were so happy to get a photo.

I’ve been waiting a long time to see all of the students, staff members and families of Vista Grande. I can only imagine that when that day comes, that smiles will be accompanied with tears of joy. Be safe, and stay apart, so we can be together again.

Hello Future Hillsdale Families,

I hope everyone is doing well during this unprecedented time. We are beginning to work on our schedule for the 2020/2021 school year. A key piece to building the schedule is understanding the electives that our students want to take. We are asking that future Hillsdale students complete a Google Form to help us place students correctly for the 2020/2021 school year. You child will be receiving the survey from their current teacher. Please look to their Google Classroom and/or the 5th grade playlist for the survey. Thank you for your time and stay safe.

We felt Mrs. Loether deserves her own special day to be recognized and appreciated. She has worked countless hours everyday, never taking weekends off, to assure distance learning was the best it could possibly be for her students and staff. Her dedication, and devotion, deserves to be acknowledged. Please join us May 1st, from 11:00-1:00 at Rios, to help make this day extra special. Just a wave, or a big THANK YOU, would be a nice touch. While you’re there don’t forget to pick up lunch. Also, videos expressing appreciation to our awesome principal can be sent to:

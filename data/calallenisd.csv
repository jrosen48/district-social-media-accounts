Calallen ISD will be hosting summer school July 7-23, 2020 for students who are required to attend due to failure. Students must be registered online at https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QRTZ9MY no later than July 2nd.

For students who need to make up hours in order to earn credit, but passed all classes, families will be contacted regarding the method of delivery for each student. Students requiring make up hours will not report to the summer school campus on July 7th, and are not required to register online.

All campuses are currently closed, causing phone message delivery to be delayed.

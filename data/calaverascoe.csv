The Calaveras County Health Officer has issued a heat advisory as high temperatures have been forecast for the county in the coming days. Temperatures of 100 degrees or more are forecasted from Saturday, September 5 through Tuesday, September 8. While heat-related deaths and illness are preventable, more than 600 people in the United States are killed by extreme heat every year. The warning signs of heat illness include heavy sweating, cramps, headache, nausea or vomiting, tiredness, weakness, dizziness and fainting.

“It’s important that you don’t overestimate what you can do when there are high temperatures. Take precautions to avoid heat-related illness, especially older adults, young children, people who work outdoors, and those with chronic medical conditions who are more impacted by extreme heat. Play it safe and avoid heat-related illness,” said Dr. Dean Kelaita, Calaveras County Health Officer.

Temperatures of 100 degrees or more will continue over the next several days. While heat-related deaths and illness are preventable, more than 600 people in the United States are killed by extreme heat every year. The warning signs of heat illness include heavy sweating, cramps, headache, nausea or vomiting, tiredness, weakness, dizziness and fainting.

“Don’t overestimate what you can do during a heat wave, assume it’s less than your normal level of activity,” stated Dr. Dean Kelaita, Calaveras County Health Officer. “Play it safe and avoid heat related illness. Common sense measures can prevent the possibility of heat-related illness. Some health conditions such as obesity, heart disease, poor circulation, sunburn and drug/alcohol use can make it harder for the body to stay cool in hot weather.”

Due to construction in the area, an unmarked water line broke in the City of Angels today, which caused a disruption in water service for customers who live on the North end of Angels Camp.
Public Works crews were able to quickly isolate the break, however, the City has issued a boil water notice for all customers out of an abundance of caution.
Once the City has conducted state-mandated bacterialogical testing and the results are negative the notice will be lifted. This usually occurs within 2-3 days.

Please note: Discolored water is a common occurrence after pipeline work. Opening and closing valves to isolate the area of repair can cause the water flow in the pipes to speed up and slow down, which dislodges minerals from the inside walls of the pipe. These minerals can cause the water to become discolored. If customers experience discolored water, they can open an outside faucet at the lowest point on their properties and run it until the water runs clear.

Calaveras Public Health Issues Extreme Heat Advisory:
Temperatures of 90 degrees or more will continue over the next several days. During extreme heat your body works extra hard to maintain its normal temperature, which can lead to several heat related problems, including heat stroke and death.
“Taking action now can prevent the possibility of heat-related illness,” said Dr. Dean Kelaita, Calaveras County Health Officer. “Older adults, children and sick or overweight individuals at greater risk from extreme heat.”

This latest move results from Governor Gavin Newsom’s May 7, 2020 announcement that the State will be entering Stage 2 of the re-opening plan beginning on May 8, 2020. Stage 2 authorizes some low risk business activities as long as they comply with the state-mandated conditions. “Low-risk” businesses such as clothing stores, florists, bookstores, sporting goods retailers, etc. will be allowed to re-open for curbside pick-up only starting today. These businesses will need to operate under specific adaptations to allow for increased social distancing, safeguards for their employees, and increased sanitation. While the Health Officer Order is rescinded and certain businesses are allowed to reopen in a modified way, the Stay-At-Home Order by the State of California will remain in place.

We'll be distributing dog and cat food (contact-free, directly into the trunk or back seat of your car) to anyone who needs it. No paperwork or proof of income required. Calaveras County residents only, please. Please bring I.D. or proof of residency.

We know that some of us are experiencing food insecurity for the first time, and we don't want anybody worrying about whether they can afford to feed their pets.

They were part of a state investigation in March that stemmed from the Grand Princess cruise ship that departed San Francisco on February 21 with a planned return on March 7. As of today, Calaveras Public Health has taken over the cases for follow-up. They include two older adult females and one older adult male from Copperopolis.

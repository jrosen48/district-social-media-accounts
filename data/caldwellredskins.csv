Nora Ephron once joked that whenever you went to a dinner party in New York in the 80s, Chicken Marbella was on the menu. Originally published in the Silver Palate Cookbook, it was chicken roasted with prunes, brown sugar, olives, capers, and garlic. I decided to update the classic recipe with even more garlic and a little less brown sugar, and now happily it's one of my favorite make-ahead recipes for a dinner party. I assemble the whole thing the night before and just pop it in the oven before dinner! That's my kind of recipe!

Dr. Ben was principal of the elementary school from 1990 – 1997. He was beloved by his students, parents, staff and the community for his warm personality, bright smile and infectious laugh. Dr. Ben loved children and was deeply committed to educating the whole child, including their social and emotional wellness.

Following his retirement from Caledonia-Mumford CSD, he spent 19 years as principal of St. Agnes Catholic Elementary School in Avon, NY.

Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of Dr. Benjamin at this sad time.

We are very proud to say that the Caledonia downtown artwork includes several pieces from our students as well as some from Adventures and Art.
The Inspirations Trail was put on hold until the summer of 2021due to Covid-19, however, the artwork that was already finished is on exhibit this summer until July 31, so don't delay - get out and take a walk around Caledonia's business district to see our students' artwork and take a ride to our neighboring villages to see others.

2019-2020 Co-Winner Slingshot Elite - Male Wrestler of the Year - Jakob Bishop

Back-to-back for Jakob! Team leader in wins this year with 44, he had 24 pins & won a whopping 6 tournaments. He finished 2nd at the NYWAY Western Regional, but only because the state champ happens to be in our region. Jakob went toe to toe with him in a 6-3 loss. NY Youth Wrestling ranked Jakob #2 in NY in the final rankings. Though we’re disappointed we couldn’t see him at States, he had an amazing year. Jakob is the model of diligence, working hard in practice both in Caledonia & at our club. He also puts in lots of work in the offseason. It’ll be fun to see what he becomes when he enters the varsity scene in a few years. Congrats Jakob! A well-deserved award!

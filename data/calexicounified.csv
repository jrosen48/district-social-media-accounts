La prioridad de CUSD es la salud, el bienestar social y emocional y el éxito académico de nuestros estudiantes. Debido a las preocupaciones actuales de seguridad y las necesidades de distanciamiento social continuo, no está claro cuándo nuestros estudiantes podrán regresar a los planteles escolares. Con el fin de permitirnos planificar en consecuencia, y para garantizar que el aprendizaje todavía se produzca durante el verano, ofreceremos la Escuela de Verano de Aprendizaje a Distancia. A continuación, se muestra un enlace a nuestra Solicitud de la Escuela de Verano de Aprendizaje a Distancia para nuestros estudiantes actuales de kínder a octavo grado. Por favor complete una solicitud por cada estudiante que vaya a participar.

CUSD Distance Learning Summer School Application/ Aplicación para CUSD Escuela de Verano de Aprendizaje a Distancia",12.0,"Estimados Padres/Tutores
La prioridad de CUSD es la salud, el bienestar social y emocional y el éxito académico de nuestros estudiantes. Debido a las preocupaciones actuales de seguridad y las necesidades de distanciamiento social continuo, no está claro cuándo nuestros estudiantes podrán regresar a los planteles escolares. Con el fin de permitirnos planificar en consecuencia, y para garantizar que el aprendizaje todavía se produzca durante el verano, ofreceremos la Escuela de Verano de Aprendizaje a Distancia. A continuación, se muestra un enlace a nuestra Solicitud de la Escuela de Verano de Aprendizaje a Distancia para nuestros estudiantes actuales de kínder a octavo grado. Por favor complete una solicitud por cada estudiante que vaya a participar.

CUSD’s priority is the health, social-emotional well-being, and academic success of our students. Due to the current safety concerns and needs for ongoing social distancing, it is uncertain when our students will be able to return to school campuses. In order to allow us to plan accordingly, and to ensure that learning still occurs during the summer, we will be offering Distance Learning Summer School. Below is a link to our Distance Learning Summer School Application for our current Kinder through eighth grade students. Please submit one application for each student participating.

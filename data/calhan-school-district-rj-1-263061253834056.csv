A new 4-year course of education started recently at Calhan High School. It is the brainchild of Heidi Sellers who is the school’s agriculture instructor and FFA advisor. The program, called Agricultural Education, has three pathways, including horticulture science, animal production and ag power structure and technical systems. The last track is a rapidly growing segment of agriculture, says Sellers. It includes advocating for agriculture.

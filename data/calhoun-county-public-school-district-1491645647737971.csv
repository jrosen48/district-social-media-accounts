The Governor and State Superintendent's order for school closure for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year has forced the District to alter graduation plans.

The District is currently exploring two options to recognize and honor our seniors.

Option 1

If safe and lawfully allowable, a traditional ceremony will be held on the football field on June 6, 2020. This ceremony will include social distancing for our students and social distancing for a limited number of their guests. Graduates will receive 4 tickets each.

This year in our Teacher Cadet class, through the Chick-fil-A Leadership Academy, we have contributed to “Do Good December” through a few different community service projects. We started off the month by making Christmas ornaments for the staff of our school to show our appreciation for their hard work. Next, we adopted a family in need and bought toys, clothes, hygiene products, and other household items for two young children and the family as a whole. After wrapping and sending off our gifts, we donated the duplicate toys to Toys for Tots and began work on collecting the favorite snacks, hygiene products, and other items on a military wish list for Calhoun County High School alumni serving in Afghanistan. We have had a December filled with helping others and giving back to our community.

Good morning Beautiful people I pray that you all are having a wonderful day. I'm so Thankful and Proud of Calhoun County High School JROTC Program. They all put on a Beautiful Ceremony Honoring Veterans and it did my Heart well to see the outpouring love these young men and women showed us this morning. It was also great to even have breakfast with them and to share some of our experiences when we served! Thank you to Mr. Barry Charley for allowing this to be a continuous event every Year! A big shout out to Major O'Neal and 1SG Jackson. After the program was over I came back to my classroom and there was a knock at the door and all I saw was Major O'Neal come in with a group of Cadets to Present me with a Quilt of Valor I fought so hard to hold back the tears.. It was definitely a surprise and it means a lot that there are people who still are grateful for those who have Served! Again Thank you Calhoun County High School JROTC... I'm forever grateful to you all.. FBF I pray that you all have a wonderful weekend... To my Fellow Veterans I say Hooah!",0.0,"Joyce Watson is feeling blessed with Serena Davis and 5 others at Calhoun County High School.

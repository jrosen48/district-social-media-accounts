DOES ""EARLY SCREENING"" MEAN EARLY TREATMENT?
Only a few orthodontic problems need correction at an early age, but the 7 yr. old screening is important in the event that a problem is detected. In most cases, your child's growth and development will be monitored (free of charge) every 6 months for the doctor to determine when and if the time is right. Our ""Growth & Development"" program helps Dr. Vargo stay on top of any problems that might occur.

SHOULDN'T I WAIT UNTIL MY CHILD HAS LOST OFF OF HIS or HER BABY TEETH FOR A SCREENING?
Actually, waiting until all of the permanent teeth have come in, or until facial growth is nearly complete, makes correction of some problems more difficult. Some corrections cannot be accomplished once the face and jaw are no longer growing. We want to create a healthy environment for the permanent teeth that are trying to come in! So early screening is very important!

Calhoun City Schools Reopened Its Schools Today and Focused on What Matters Most!

The first day of school for Calhoun City Schools’ students was an exciting day. Buses were at roughly 30% capacity due to several students (roughly 18%) choosing the online option and some parents choosing to transport their children to school. The first week of school is always flanked with traffic issues and the support of Chief Pyle and the Calhoun Police Department was a huge help! The increased volume of cars for drop off was noticeable but everyone was patient and understanding. Some adjustments will be made in procedures to assist with drop off and pick up in the afternoons moving forward.

Campers had a great time at Jacket Jamboree last week! They enjoyed visiting with Angie Gravitt as she shared her talents, ideas and recipes. Mrs. Gravitt allowed campers to pick blueberries, squash, zucchini, banana peppers and tomatoes from the school garden. After picking everything from the garden they learned how to make “salad on a stick”. To wrap up the week, campers made homemade zucchini bread with Mrs.Gravitt. She talked to campers about kitchen safety, recipes, dry ingredients, wet ingredients, mixing and cleaning up.

With the Georgia Department of Public Health, we are releasing guidance for a safe return to in-person instruction in fall 2020.

The guidelines are intended to ensure the safety of students, staff, and families while remaining flexible, responsive, and achievable in the K-12 setting. They are guidelines, not mandates, and are adaptive to multiple scenarios. School districts should review the guidance in consultation with their local public health departments and choose which methods to adopt.

Georgia's K-12 Restart Working Groups will meet through the summer and fall to build out resources for school district planning and implementation.

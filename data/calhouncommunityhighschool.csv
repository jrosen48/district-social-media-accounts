Here is a breakdown of what is required per the Governor's Executive Order:

Outdoor social gatherings (including graduations) of up to 100 people are permitted with proper six-foot social distancing.
Indoor social gatherings are still limited to no more than 10 people.
Students and other community members are permitted on school property. Per legal counsel, students, parents, staff, etc. will only be allowed to enter schools for the purposes of a social gathering after the school year ends.
Example of allowable graduation ceremony: outdoor ceremony (e.g. on the front lawn) with no more than 100 total people (students, parents, guests and staff) in attendance. For example, a small district with a class of 30 graduates limited to 2 guests each and a handful of staff in attendance, potentially with a small camera crew for live streaming or recording.

Please try to limit your guests to two people. More information to come.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3030134773689389&id=411851818851044,,0.0,"Graduation is scheduled for Tuesday, June 23rd at 7pm.

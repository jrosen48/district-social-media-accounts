Safety is always our first priority in Calhoun County Schools. During this time we are urging everyone to practice social distancing and all other suggested methods to prevent the spreading of COVID-19. Please know that beginning Monday, April 6, 2020 teachers will begin contacting their students weekly checking in on them and advising them of learning opportunities being offered through online options as well as packets that can be picked up at their school.

During this time it is important to continue the learning process so as to decrease the slippage that sometimes occurs during the summer months. In Calhoun County Schools we are maintaining the calendar that we have been following this school year ending on May 21,2020. Please be listening for messages from your local principals and teachers informing you of learning opportunities. The easiest of course is to promote reading. Parents can read with their children to help maintain and increase learning. In addition to the lessons your child will be getting from their teachers remember to utilize opportunities at home each day. We will also be offering meal pick ups at each of our 7 Elementary Schools each Tuesday from 10-1. Please take advantage of this service.

Seniors, please know that we are working on plans for your Prom , Sr Night recognitions and of course Graduation. We will schedule these important Senior experiences for you, they may be different than normal but they will occur.
If you have any questions please contact your school office from 9-1 Monday through Thursday. We will
have staff monitoring phones during those times.
Thanks goes to all our faculty and staff members in all departments across our system for their dedication to our students during these difficult unprecedented times.

Please feel free to share this post.

Stay safe,

During this time it is important to continue the learning process so as to decrease the slippage that sometimes occurs during the summer months. In Calhoun County Schools we are maintaining the calendar that we have been following this school year ending on May 21,2020. Please be listening for messages from your local principals and teachers informing you of learning opportunities. The easiest of course is to promote reading. Parents can read with their children to help maintain and increase learning. In addition to the lessons your child will be getting from their teachers remember to utilize opportunities at home each day. We will also be offering meal pick ups at each of our 7 Elementary Schools each Tuesday from 10-1. Please take advantage of this service.

Seniors, please know that we are working on plans for your Prom , Sr Night recognitions and of course Graduation. We will schedule these important Senior experiences for you, they may be different than normal but they will occur.
If you have any questions please contact your school office from 9-1 Monday through Thursday. We will
have staff monitoring phones during those times.
Thanks goes to all our faculty and staff members in all departments across our system for their dedication to our students during these difficult unprecedented times.

Please feel free to share this post.

Stay safe,

Please know that the State Superintendent, our good friend, Dr. Eric Mackey will hold a teleconference tomorrow morning with all Superintendents across the State. After that we will be working on a plan to put into place ASAP but no later than April 6,2020.

Please be patient as we work through these uncharted and unprecedented waters. At this time, all activities including ballgames, proms, field trips, etc. are to remain cancelled.
I would ask that you pray for discernment for your local administrators, my central office team, your elected board members and myself as we plan for the end of this school year. There is no doubt in my mind will get through this. Please take the suggested precautions and stay healthy.

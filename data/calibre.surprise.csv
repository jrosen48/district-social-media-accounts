I hope this finds you and your family doing well.

We wanted to reach out to provide an update with the status of our 2019-2020 yearbook. Due to COVID-19 this year's yearbook is unique from previous years and it is our top priority to ensure yearbooks are delivered to all families that placed an order.

Lifetouch, our yearbook partner, is in uncharted waters with the COVID-19 virus. They have had government-mandated shut-downs in some of their production facilities and social distancing protocols in others that have reduced capacity for printing yearbooks. Be assured that everyone who ordered a yearbook will receive one. However, the delivery of your yearbook may be delayed, resulting in arrival after school is out for the summer.

I hope this finds you and your family doing well.

We wanted to reach out to provide an update with the status of our 2019-2020 yearbook. Due to COVID-19 this year's yearbook is unique from previous years and it is our top priority to ensure yearbooks are delivered to all families that placed an order.

There seems to be some confusion with morning drop off. We ask that if you are driving up to drop off your student you drive all the way up to the South back parking lot gate. There is no drop off along the fire lane curb near the office.

Also, if your student is late you may NOT just send your student into the office. You must park and come in to sign them in. If a late student is just dropped off you will be called to come back and sign them in.

At dismissal, students may NOT be picked up in front of the office. They need to be picked up in the back parking lot or you can park and come in. We will not send students outside the office.

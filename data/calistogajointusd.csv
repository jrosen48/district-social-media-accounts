February 14 at 6:31 PM ·

On February 12, 80 high school juniors and seniors interested in exploring a career in health care, computer science or robotic technology attended a Robotics Career Day at Queen of the Valley Medical Center.

Students from all 8 Napa County high schools, including Napa County Office of Education, Napa Valley Unified School District, St. Helena High School, Calistoga Junior-Senior High and Justin Sienna Catholic College Preparatory had hands-on experience with the latest robotics technology available. They also had the chance to learn firsthand from surgical team members who use these robots to perform less invasive surgeries.

It was an amazing day and thanks to everyone who participated!

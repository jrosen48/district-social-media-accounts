CLINTON - Camanche senior LJ Henderson is one of 16 high school students competing this week in the 2020 American Family Insurance Slam Dunk fan voting competition. That gives him a chance to compete in Atlanta in April, but he needs the fan votes to do it.

Henderson will be a part of this week's competition. The #DreamFearlessly fan-portion includes 16 players from across the country who caught the attention of the committee. Each player is pitted against another in a bracket style, and the one who garners the most votes will move on to the next week's competition.

Voting begins on Tuesday, and fans can vote at highschoolslam.com. There will also be a link on the Clinton Herald Website, and information about the event's social media.

The winner of the fan-portion will compete on April 7 (during College Basketball Championship Week) on CBS in the 2020 American Family Slam Dunk and 3-Point Contest.

Rich does a great job every year, and this year recruited two new teams (one of which won and gave away their winnings). We’re very proud to see the turnout to support our student athletes. You all are amazing and we appreciate every one of you! And to the school district team that included Rox, Justin and Taryn....Travis gave you a hard time, but please know that we wouldn’t be where we are without all of you going above and beyond to support all of the kids in our school district. Thank you for being you.
Until next year!

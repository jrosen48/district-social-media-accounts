Congratulations to Brian Andrade who is a capable, hardworking young man with a tremendous work ethic! He comes to work each day at the district office Liberty Middle School, and Helen Baller Elementary ready to dig in and get things done.

Richard Magruder, Brian’s aid in our life skills program, accompanies Brian every day at work. Whether it’s sorting books in the library, restocking paper in the district Copy Center, or picking up the recycling around the office areas, Brian does a fantastic job and Richard is an incredible support to Brian’s learning.

Brian has created great friendships with his colleagues around the Zellerbach Administration Center. Anyone who has spent time with him can see that he is dependable, dedicated, and is delightful to be around. He is a Rock Star!

CAMAS THEATRE IS PROUD TO PRESENT OUR 2019-20 SEASON OF SHOWS!

Starting off the season this November with...
“NOISES OFF!”
This critically acclaimed farce follows a theatre company of characters on their hilariously troubled journey through their final dress rehearsal, opening night, and closing night of their show Nothing On.
A show consistently leaving its audiences in stitches since its award-winning Broadway debut in 1984.

In March our stage will feature...
“HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING”
With a thrilling score from Frank Loesser (Guys and Dolls) comes the satire of big business and all it holds sacred. The audience follows J. Pierrepont Finch as he climbs the corporate ladder from window washer to high-powered executive (without really trying). Winner of the 1962 Tony Award for Best Musical and Pulitzer Prize for Drama comes this irresistible story performed by your favorite singers, actors, and dancers of Camas High.",0.0,"Great shows from Camas Theatre headed your way!

To All,

We are eagerly awaiting the startup of our new school year. As we move forward, and new information is coming out we are altering a few things we have previously shared.

New scientific studies and local events have prompted us to revisit our mask policy here at CCS. When we reopen, the expectation for our children is to keep their masks on at all times unless otherwise instructed by the teacher. The scientific evidence shows that this is one of the best practices to prevent the spread of COVID, and other illnesses. We are asking the teachers to provide regular mask breaks for the children each period of the day.

Also, In order to help prepare our teachers better for a new mode of instruction, we have added a superintendent’s conference day on September 9 for professional development purposes. This means that the first day for students will be Thursday, September 10. We are excited to reengage with our children.

Please enjoy the remainder of your summer and keep yourselves safe.

Sincerely,

The Albany Business Review ranked Cambridge Central School #14 (out of the 84 schools in the region that were ranked). Seven of the schools in the top 14 are ""low"" needs while Cambridge is ""average"" needs. Needs are defined as a district's ability to meet the needs of its students with local resources. In terms of expenditures per student, CCS is ranked at #37 (out of 90) So, 36 schools spend more per student. The highest being Edinburg at $51,197 and lowest being Hudson Falls at $18,160 per student. Cambridge is ranked within a clump of 10 schools that expend between 25 and 26K per student.

So far, our amazing team has provided 692 meals per day, 7 days per week for a total. of 4,844 meals; serving 346 students and 148 families. Though the numbers are impressive, it's about the people; and without people we wouldn't be able to reach these numbers of people.

Also, if you've enjoyed any of the lettuce served this week, then you've consumed part of the first cop grown in the school. A few weeks ago the school obtained a Farmshelf indoor growing system as part of a farm to table initiative. Please watch for a future story about this.

Our tech team did an incredible job working out a process to distribute Chromebooks to our students twill be available for distribution on Monday (3/30) and Tuesday (3/31) from 9am-12 noon at the auditorium entrance.

On Monday, December 16, our elementary students learned about snow and winter safety. They were visited by Phil Spiezio, Greg Toleman, Tom Gray, and Drew Shaw of the Washington County Department of Public Works. They discussed snow and winter safety which included NOT digging tunnels or making snow forts, wearing bright colors, letting an adult know when playing outside and using the buddy system, staying away from the road, being mindful of flying debris from snow plows, the limited sight lines of snow plow drivers, and more.

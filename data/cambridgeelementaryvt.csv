Dear Summer Nutrition Team,
On March 16th, we were called into action as essential workers to face the Covid -19 crisis that was closing our school buildings, businesses and economy.
Our mission was to make sure that the children in our community did not go hungry. YOU stepped up, YOU faced fear, YOU kept our kids fed and eased the anguish of Lamoille families.
We have kept the connection between school and home with nourishing meals and smiling eyes above our masks. We went above and beyond by continuing the fresh fruit and veggie program, handing out donations of produce and milk and checking in on some of our most vulnerable families.
I am honored to be a part of this team of professionals.

Thank you for giving up your vacation time and your summer days, for your dedication and passion for helping kids.
Please know how appreciated you are!

Lamoille Broadband Survey

Representative Lucy Rogers
August 5 at 7:34 PM ¬∑

Lamoille County folks: please fill out this quick (3 minute max) survey on Internet availability at your address. This survey is being conducted with funding from a Broadband Innovation Grant and will be used to help develop a plan for improving broadband infrastructure in underserved regions of Lamoille County. Please share with your friends and neighbors!

Six Lamoille County towns (Waterville, Cambridge, Johnson, Hyde Park, Morristown, and Eden, with Belvidere hopefully joining soon) banded together in July to form a brand new Communications Union District, called Lamoille FiberNet. The Communications Union District is a municipal entity that allows small towns to work together to build communications infrastructure and/or deliver broadband Internet to the people who live in the district. I am very excited about this development and will share more updates on Lamoille FiberNet in the future, but in the meantime please take a few minutes to fill out the survey! Thank you!

Lamoille County folks: please fill out this quick (3 minute max) survey on Internet availability at your address. This survey is being conducted with funding from a Broadband Innovation Grant and will be used to help develop a plan for improving broadband infrastructure in underserved regions of Lamoille County. Please share with your friends and neighbors!

Six Lamoille County towns (Waterville, Cambridge, Johnson, Hyde Park, Morristown, and Eden, with Belvidere hopefully joining soon) banded together in July to form a brand new Communications Union District, called Lamoille FiberNet. The Communications Union District is a municipal entity that allows small towns to work together to build communications infrastructure and/or deliver broadband Internet to the people who live in the district. I am very excited about this development and will share more updates on Lamoille FiberNet in the future, but in the meantime please take a few minutes to fill out the survey! Thank you!

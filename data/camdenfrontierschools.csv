As an elementary teacher, Mrs. Moore created a warm and nurturing classroom environment with high expectations for kindness and achievement. Her first students, now in their mid-40's, and her last all benefited greatly from her dedication, hard work and professionalism. Although she will be greatly missed at C-F by colleagues and students alike, we wish Mrs. Moore the happiest of retirements. It is well deserved!

Working in our Food Service Department, Donna Shaneour has demonstrated how every member of the C-F staff contributes to our children's education. Anyone who knows Donna knows that few people work harder. She has been an outstanding example of dedication and hard work to all of our students for over two decades.

All C-F students are eligible to pick up one bag of breakfast and lunch foods. Each bag will contain approximately 5 meals. We will be distributing food from these locations:

School (follow the signs to the cafeteria)
Camden Missionary Church (look for the bus)
Montgomery & Steamburg in Frontier (look for the bus)

We will offer the same service on Tuesday and Thursday of next week, March 24 and 26.

If the school closure is extended beyond April 5, we plan to continue and expand food service to our students.

If you would like to donate to this food program - either whole foods like fruits and vegetables or pre-packaged foods like granola bars, cheese, sticks, etc. - please message us. Cash donations of any/all sizes are also welcome. Our community is in need and we need your help.

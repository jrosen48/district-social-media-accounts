Today marks 19 years since the tragic 9/11 terrorist attacks, a day now known as Patriot Day.

Former President George W. Bush declared the first Patriot Day just before Sept. 11 in 2002.

On Sept. 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked four planes. Two of them crashed into both World Trade Center towers in New York, causing them to collapse.

Another crashed into the Pentagon while a fourth went down in a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania after passengers struggled with hijackers.

This Patriot Day, we commemorate the lives of those who perished on September 11, 2001, we honor the families who carry on their legacies, and we thank the unmatched bravery of our Nation’s first responders.

Read Across America is a day held annually on March 2nd that encourages children in every community to read and also encourages parents and teachers to celebrate the joy of reading. It’s a holiday that has been celebrated since 1998 and falls on the same day as children’s book author Dr. Seuss.

March 2 is the birthday of Theodore Seuss Geisel, an American author who, under the pen name Dr. Seuss, wrote and illustrated some of the world’s most iconic children’s books. His rhymes and characters are beloved by generations of fans.

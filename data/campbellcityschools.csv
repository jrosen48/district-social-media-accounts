The second speaker in our IMPACT Speaker Series was Judge Baldwin. She had a powerful message for the students about working hard, not giving up, making good choices, treating people with respect, and the power you have to determine your life. Judge Baldwin is a true inspiration and we thoroughly enjoyed listening and learning from her. #whatsyourIMPACT #whatsyourdream Campbell City Schools

The students have been exploring solutions, solutes, and solvents in class. Part of this topic was freezing point depression, how the addition of a solute to a solvent (in this case salt being added to the ice) lowers the freezing point of the solvent.

In order to better understand this phenomenon and see it in action, they made ice cream in bags. Lots of heat has to be removed for the water in cream to solidify. Because of all the particles it contains, the temperature must drop below zero degrees Celsius. In order for this to occur we need the heat to go somewhere else.

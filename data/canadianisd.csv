We are working hard to finalize our Home Football ticketing plans and we need your help. Because of COVID requirements, we will have a reduced stadium capacity. One of the groups we want to accommodate is our senior citizens. Because we must track our ticket sales in order to comply with the capacity restrictions, we are unable to do a blanket Senior Citizen pass. We would like to offer a reduced Senior Citizen rate, but we need those community members to contact the CISD Administration at (806) 323-5393 to be added to our list. Please share this post to help us get the word out to our over 65 community members. We need this information by this Friday (8/21) to be included for the first home game next week.

On Tuesday, August 25, at 7:30 we will try out our new Wildcat Stadium Seating Plan with the reduced capacity and required safety measures. CISD and the Wildcat Booster Club is hosting a combined Meet the Wildcats/Pep Rally at Wildcat Stadium. For our Meet the Wildcats this year, we will only introduce high school participants in Band, Cheerleading, Cross Country, and Football – this will minimize the size of groups and number of kids we have to manage on the field. Food will not be served at this event, but the Booster Club will have tables spread out selling their various spirit items starting at 6:20pm. We will post our Stadium Seating Guidelines later this week.

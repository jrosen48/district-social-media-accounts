Montgomery County employees recently held a Jeans Day to assist the Canajoharie Central School District's Student Teacher Activity Rally.

STAR consists of faculty, staff and a committee of students who work to boost morale throughout the school through yearly themes and activities. This year’s theme, “Right Here. Right Now” conveys that instead of being focused on what happened yesterday or what could happen tomorrow, you are simply here, now.

The mission of the committee is to not only teach students academically, but to instill an aspiration to be good people, citizens, advocates and future adults. Funds will assist with the upcoming Canajoharie Game Show.

“We are building bonds and lasting memories,” STAR Committee Advisor/ Business Education/CEIP, Co-Op Coordinator Tracy E. Evans said.

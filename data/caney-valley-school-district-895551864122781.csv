Hello Caney Valley,

I just wanted to give our parents an update of our virtual start. At the High School we had 40% of our students not check in with their teachers yesterday. The Middle School had 50%. Those students have been counted absent. Those absences will add up and turn into NC's (no credit) if they are not addressed. It will also turn into eligibility issues as well. It's not too late to get those absences turned into present. All you need to do is contact your teacher or turn in your assignments. Some teachers are hosting virtual meetings and recording them. If you can't participate live they are posting the records for you to view at a later time.

We know some students don't have access to the internet. If this is the case for you please contact the MS or HS so we can get a packet prepared for you.

Sincerely,

Things are changing daily, as expected. This week we made the decision to switch to remote instruction. It was definitely not an easy decision, but after discussing the situation with the Washington County Health Department, and one of the state epidemiologists, we determined it was a prudent move to help keep our kids safe. In addition, Washington County was moved into the Orange-1 category on the OSSBA COVID – 19 Map.

After 52 years at Caney Valley Public Schools (12 years attending 1st-12th grades and 40 years as a teacher and coach) Coach Taylor is driving away from Caney Valley one last time. I am retiring with him after 21 years at CVE and a total of 30 years teaching. Our hearts are filled with great memories, funny moments, difficult dilemmas (all teachers have them), and most of all an abundance of friends and acquaintances. Thanks for letting us be a part of your family’s life. As Coach Taylor says “We will see you at Walmart!”
I am always proud when a voice says “There’s Coach Taylor!” or a past student comes and shakes his hand.

We, his family, would love to give Coach Taylor a box of memories. If you would like to share a memory, a favorite game, pictures of then and now, or any special words please comment here or email kirktaylor87@gmail.com

CVE Parents:

We have been working to get everything ready for tomorrow’s final pickup from 4-6pm. We will be handing out awards for all students. If you were unable to retrieve your child’s personal belongings, we have those ready to go as well! Please park in the parking lot and make your way to the gym entrance. The awards will be given out in the lobby. We have also set out all items that were in our Lost & Found to be claimed, and we will allow one parent to walk through to check it out!

MAKING MAIN STREET THEIR MAIN STAGE: Y’all have to watch these two tear up the streets of Ramona! 12-year-old Kale Evans and 10-year-old Speck Gann have spent their time during the pandemic dancing putting on shows on the streets of their small town. They don’t need a big stage or crowd, they just need some Michael Jackson music, a speaker and some space. Folks driving by are even giving the boys tips for the entertainment
💵 because they are so fun to watch.

The two have been dancing for years, dance addicts, they say! They’ve taught themselves the moonwalk and all the moves Michael Jackson made famous. They put on a great show. You can find them dancing most afternoons and on Saturday nights in the heart of Ramona. But you can also catch them tonight at 7 on KOTV - News On 6 during our hourlong “Oklahoma Together” special!

That’s photojournalist extraordinaire Michael Blair working the camera... he and I had a blast working on this story and we think you’re gonna love it!!",3.0,"Turn on channel 6 right now and watch for 2 of CV’s own do what they love right here on Main Street. Great job boys!!!

We have had some delays with shipments and updating but, we are working very hard on our end to get devices out to all our families. Thank you for your patience with that.

DEVICES: If you still in need of a device, we are waiting on a few updates on our end. As soon as they are ready, we will post that info right here.

EMAIL: Students who had an email last year, will use the same email address this year to log into their lessons. You should be familiar with the process. If you have any issue with an email or your device, you may visit our Caniff Weebly page www.caniff2020.weebly.com and complete a Tech Help Ticket.

If you are a new student, or a student who is checking out a device for the first time, we will get your emails to you soon.

Look for all updates on Class Dojo and Facebook.

Tip #2: Find a great book and read.

Here are a couple great apps to find books:

Epic Books (For levels all the way to 7th grade)
Storyline Online

Reading is fun to do by yourself, student to parent, and parent to student. My son and I read a book every night when he goes to bed. One of his favorites is Dragons Love Tacos.

At Caniff Liberty Academy, like other schools, we are data driven to help our students. However, we believe that we must go beyond the data to truly help young people reach their full potential. When we look at our students, we don't just see data and test scores...We see a developing child. We see great potential. We see big dreams.

If you are looking for a school that goes beyond the data and test scores and truly sees your student, then perhaps Caniff Liberty Academy is the place for you and your student.

One way that we want to do this is by providing helpful learning tips that can be done at home to keep students sharp educationally. We will provide these each week for different grade levels and ages.

This weeks tip is something that can be fun and done at any level.

Tip #1: Find a fun game that makes you think.

Examples: Connect Four, Chess, Scrabble, Trivial Pursuit, Checkers...the list could go on and on.

Enjoy the weekend and maybe find a fun game for the whole family. My son and I will be playing Connect Four. Its his new favorite game.

At Caniff Liberty Academy, like other schools, we are data driven to help our students. However, we believe that we must go beyond the data to truly help young people reach their full potential. When we look at our students, we don't just see data and test scores...We see a developing child. We see great potential. We see big dreams.

If you are looking for a school that goes beyond the data and test scores and truly sees your student, then perhaps Caniff Liberty Academy is the place for you and your student.

So if you are looking for a school that will challenge your student academically to reach their full potential, then Caniff Liberty Academy should be your new school home.

As you may know, Governor Whitmer announced that school buildings are not to be opened this year for face to face teaching. However, at the same time, she has encouraged us (educators and students) to keep learning.

Caniff Liberty Academy will continue to provide education for our students. This coming week, the staff is working hard preparing to get more educational materials for the students to go out the week of April 13. At the same time, please make sure your student is connected to their teacher through Class Dojo and/or email so that they can continue to get assignments.

We are also continuing to explore new ways to help educate our students off-campus. Please stay tuned for more updates to come.

We are in this together because your student's future...is our goal.

Today, I was checking out the school building. As I walked through the halls and checked the classrooms, I was taken back by how quiet it was. A school building just isn't the same without the students and staff. On behalf of the CLA staff, I wanted to let all of you know that we miss your smiling faces.

However, remember...we do not need a building to stay connected and keep teaching and learning. Education conquers all obstacles...when we work together.

Learning is a life long task. We must continue to seek opportunity even in challenging times. The Caniff Liberty Staff will continue to use all our resources to help our students to learn. Currently, teachers continue to reach out to students via Class Dojo, Youtube, Zoom, Google Classroom, Facebook, and more to communicate and teach lessons to their students. If you have not participated yet, the best place to start is by joining your teacher's Class Dojo or reaching out to them via email.

The state and federal leaders will make the decisions that they feel are best for us (The People). We are not always in control of those decisions. However, we can work together to continue to help our students grow and learn. Your student's future...is our goal.

We will continue to keep you up to date on any new educational plans we have.

Stay healthy and Happy Friday to you all.

Sincerely,

Mr. Henwood, Principal
Caniff Liberty Academy

At 11 pm last night, the Governor of Michigan ordered all school buildings to be closed, starting Monday, for the next three weeks. Schools are to reopen on April 6.

Remember breakfast is served at 8:20 am, and school starts at 8:45 am. Tomorrow is a full day so students get out at 3:45 pm.

To keep traffic moving in the morning and afternoon, it is important for parents to drop-off and to pick-up at the main entrance. Our staff will help guide your student to the cafeteria and their teacher in the morning and to the main entrance for pick-up in the afternoon. Thank you for your help.

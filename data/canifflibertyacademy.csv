DEVICES: If you still in need of a device, we are waiting on a few updates on our end. As soon as they are ready, we will post that info right here.

EMAIL: Students who had an email last year, will use the same email address this year to log into their lessons. You should be familiar with the process. If you have any issue with an email or your device, you may visit our Caniff Weebly page www.caniff2020.weebly.com and complete a Tech Help Ticket.

If you are a new student, or a student who is checking out a device for the first time, we will get your emails to you soon.

As you may know, Governor Whitmer announced that school buildings are not to be opened this year for face to face teaching. However, at the same time, she has encouraged us (educators and students) to keep learning.

Caniff Liberty Academy will continue to provide education for our students. This coming week, the staff is working hard preparing to get more educational materials for the students to go out the week of April 13. At the same time, please make sure your student is connected to their teacher through Class Dojo and/or email so that they can continue to get assignments.

We are also continuing to explore new ways to help educate our students off-campus. Please stay tuned for more updates to come.

Today, I was checking out the school building. As I walked through the halls and checked the classrooms, I was taken back by how quiet it was. A school building just isn't the same without the students and staff. On behalf of the CLA staff, I wanted to let all of you know that we miss your smiling faces.

However, remember...we do not need a building to stay connected and keep teaching and learning. Education conquers all obstacles...when we work together.

When I was a little Mr. Henwood, I always got up every Saturday morning and could not wait to watch Saturday morning cartoons...we didn't have the cartoon networks back then. During the cartoons, one of my all time favorite mini-cartoons was shown, called School House Rock. These cartoons provided fun little lessons through songs that helped my generation to learn all kinds of information.

Remember breakfast is served at 8:20 am, and school starts at 8:45 am. Tomorrow is a full day so students get out at 3:45 pm.

To keep traffic moving in the morning and afternoon, it is important for parents to drop-off and to pick-up at the main entrance. Our staff will help guide your student to the cafeteria and their teacher in the morning and to the main entrance for pick-up in the afternoon. Thank you for your help.

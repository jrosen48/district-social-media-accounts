This message is to notify you that we are working in partnership with our county's Child Care Resource & Referral (CCR&R) agency, which has updated information about available healthcare during school closures related to COVID-19. The CCR&Rs will provide information on childcare providers to any parents seeking it and will provide enhanced referrals for all ""essential employees"". Enhanced referrals will include facilitating the process of finding an available slot so that parents in these crucial service professions have less legwork to do.

Canisteo Living Sign: Early traces of autumn color begin to emerge around the iconic “Canisteo Sign” in the Southern Tier. There since 1933, the sign would serve as a navigational visual back in the day (still does, I imagine). The sign is made from 260 pine trees spelling the name of the village. It’s about 90 feet long, 300 feet wide. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Thanks to one of my followers, John Babbitt, for the heads up on this, I never knew it existed—I’ll be back soon to get the complete fall shot.",11.0,"Thank you John Kucko for the awesome picture of our Living Sign.

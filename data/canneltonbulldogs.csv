Some of our CHS staff members are looking for information on this set of real silverware found in our cafeteria! Each piece of silverware has CHS engraved on the handle.

We have reached out to many CHS alumni, and no one has ever seen this before. Please check out the article below for more details.

We would love to find out when this was used, what exactly it was used for, and any other details!

Since we were unable to have our annual induction ceremony, we definitely want to take the time to honor our NHS members. National Honor Society is one of the highest honors that a high school student can receive. Students must display exemplary character, service, leadership, and scholarship both in school and out of school. These students are doing just that.

We are so, so proud of all of you! Thank you for representing our school and community so well!

To our NHS seniors: We look forward to seeing you all continue to excel and grow. We know that you all are going to continue to accomplish amazing things in this next season of life! Thank you all!

To our new inductees: You all have big shoes to fill, but you were selected by our teachers for a reason. We know that you can do it! Continue our CHS traditions, but don't be afraid to dream big and blaze new trails for your younger peers to follow and look up to.

It gives me great pleasure to announce that Assistant Superintendent of Schools Adam Hartman and I are recommending Jamie Davis to be our next Director of Human Resources.

Based on preliminary discussion with our Board of Education, I suspect this will be approved at their September 14th meeting.

Jamie is one of Cañon City's own. She is a CCHS graduate, a University of Northern Colorado Alumni, has earned Masters Degrees in Reading and Education Leadership, had a stellar career as an elementary teacher, and has been serving the district as our full-time New Teacher Induction Coordinator for the past four years.

I know Jamie to be a visionary instructional leader who also happens to have an exceptional sense of fairness. Both of these qualities will serve her well in this new role.

Jamie will officially begin her duties on an interim basis on Tuesday, September 8th, and with Board approval, will continue into the future as our full-time Director of Human Resources.

Congratulations Jamie!

We wanted to take a minute to thank the community and sponsors of Fun Fest 2020. As 2020 would have it, Fun Fest was unique. We were able to hold drawings during each of three graduation practices to honor our graduates and wish them well. Thank you to each and every one who helped make this happen. You are appreciated!!!

This video features Harrison School Principal Marne Autobee and Cañon City Assistant Superintendent of Schools Adam Hartman, who has been guiding the creation of the K-5 digital instruction program during the COVID-19 crisis.

As you'll notice when you view this video, sometimes the technology doesn't cooperate. Thus, you'll find a few sections of the interview where the sound is fine but the video is not working properly.

Topics addressed include what staff has been doing to gear up for K-5 instruction, what will a typical day look like for a K-5 student, what responsibilities students and parents will have, how important the device we sent home is to this learning, and what can parents do if they have a connectivity or mechanical problem? We also touch on how a child can get access to the tools they’ll need to learn, and how grade-level promotion will be determined?

The Governor signed an executive order suspending in-person learning in public and private schools across the state from March 23 to April 17.

The executive order directs Colorado school districts and the Charter School Institute to make every effort to provide alternative learning opportunities during this time while taking into account the needs of local communities.

This order also directs the Commissioner of Education to issue guidance to support P-12 school systems in developing and implementing plans to assist families and students in accessing alternative learning, providing free and reduced lunch and breakfast, and offering waivers for instructional time as appropriate.

This means the earliest students will come back to school is April 20th.

In 1996, Steven attended Ft. Gordon, Signal School for Information Systems Analyst’s where he graduated top of his class as Distinguished Honor Graduate. He was assigned to 1st Special Forces Group(Airborne) where he worked as a Network / Systems Administrator in support of the “Green Berets,” on numerous deployments around the world, both in training, and on mission. His duties at 1st Group also included, from time to time, jumping out of perfectly good airplanes.

This award, created in 2016, is named after Eliza Pickrell Routt, the first woman registered to vote in Colorado after the state's passage of women's suffrage in 1893. Eliza dedicated herself to equal rights for women and the passage of women's suffrage, eventually helping Colorado become only the second state to allow women to vote, and the first by popular vote was the first woman registered to vote in Colorado.

The award is given to Colorado high schools that have 85% or more of eligible seniors registered to vote. Ashlee Nix was key to Cañon City High School earning this award because of her capstone project voter registration drive.

If we get significant accumulation and plows don't get on the road early, we'll call a delay or an eLearning/cancellation day.

If it looks much like it does now, we'll go ahead and hold classes.

The district will make a decision one way or another by 5:30 AM. If you see or receive no cancellation announcement, please assume we have school.

Exciting news just came in from Pueblo as the Centennial Bulldogs won the City Championship Meet just a bit ago! And our Tiger swimmers Neva and Kodee each played a big role in the win! Neva showed her versatility by swimming in the 500 Free and the 100 Breast while Kodee did great work in the 100 Free and 50 Free. And both of them were involved on two different relay teams and helped score valuable points there. Great work done tonight from the Tigers in red and black!

TOP students complete a comprehensive capstone that includes the following themes: Practical Skill, Career Awareness and Exploration, Creativity, Logical Inquiry, Global Awareness, and Adventure. Alex embarked on her practical skill passage with the following essential question: Without sounding terrible, how can I learn the basics of the violin by matching fingerings to notes? She spent this semester dedicated to learning how to transcribe the song, Oceans Where Feet May Fail, into sheet music while also learning how to play it on the violin (she didn't previously know how to play the violin).

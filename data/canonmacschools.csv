After 31 years of coaching high school basketball, the past 18 years at Canon-McMillan, Rick Bell has decided to retire.

Bell, who led the Big Macs to their first appearance in the WPIAL semifinals this past season, compiled a career record of 428-316 (.575 winning percentage) – which included 13 seasons at Peters Township.

Under Bell, Canon-McMillan set a single-season record of 21 wins in the 2017-2018 season.

In the past five seasons, the Big Macs compiled a 74-45 record and qualified for the WPIAL and PIAA playoffs three times.

“Rick runs one of the best programs, from top to bottom, that I have been around,” said Frank Vulcano, Jr., Canon-McMillan’s athletic director. In my five years at Canon-McMillan, Rick has taken this program to heights that have never been seen in school history.

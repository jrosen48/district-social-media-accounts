August 17, 2020
Community:

In a continued effort to the health and safety of our staff and students for a safe and healthy reopening of schools, it was announced at last Thursday’s School Board meeting that the Canton Area School District will not be allowing groups who are not directly connected to the school district to use the facilities and buildings of the Canton Area School District until further notice. While we know this will impact many groups who have used our facilities in the past, we felt it was in the best interest of our students and staff to ensure we control those individuals who will have access to our campus. We will provide you with an official announcement when we again reopen our buildings for those groups who have typically used our buildings and facilities. We apologize in advance for any inconvenience this may cause for your group or organization.

Not something any of us look forward to, but the CASD Real Estate and Occupation/Per Capital bills will soon be in mailboxes. Due to covid-19, as with lots of other things, there are changes in the payment/collection of these bills.

The Tax Office at Canton Area School District Administrative Offices, will not be taking payments in person this year. ALL payments should be mailed to the PO box in Mansfield, OR dropped off at any branch of First Citizens Community Bank. As always, you should include a coupon with your payment, and pay by check or money order. If you pay in person at the bank, the teller at FCCB will give you a ""receipt"" for the amount you leave there, but if you need an official receipt, you should leave them a self addressed stamped envelope for it to be returned to you. You may also email your request to the Tax Office at casdtax@canton.k12.pa.us and a receipt will be returned to you.

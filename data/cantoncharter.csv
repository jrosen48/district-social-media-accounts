A CCA Tradition is being altered, but it's definitely not lost! In August we usually have Popsicles on the Playground coupled with Open House. This year, our plans have changed just a bit. Our teachers are super excited to meet their new students and get them pumped up about the school year! We hope you join us for this special event. Here's how it will work:
● Drive through the serpentine, single file, on August 28 between 2:00 PM-3:00 PM.
● All of our CCA teachers will be lined up, by grade level with a posterboard introducing themselves. They will be waving ""hello"" as you drive past!
● As you prepare to exit the lot, our fabulous Administrative Team will be distributing popsicles to each vehicle.

We hope you join us for the Popsicles Driveby so you can meet your child’s teachers and enjoy a cool treat.",,,0.0,"Popsicles DRIVEBY: August 28, 2020 between 2:00 PM-3:00 PM.

After earning $100 for jumping in a pool of icy water, Amaya decided to use half of her money to buy school supplies for children who may not have them at home. She and her sister, Arya, both attendees of Plymouth Scholars, made academic “goodie bags”. These bags were filled with pencils, erasers, paper, and more. These bags are at Canton Charter Academy, under the awning, on the wooden bench. The girls want each family to know, “If you need materials, come and get them.”

We are thankful to have students like Amaya and Arya who are showing compassion for others during this difficult time.

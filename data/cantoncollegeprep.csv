Happy National #CharterSchoolsWeek!
Today we're highlighting some of the amazing teachers in our schools.
Emily Simon is a third grade teacher at Canton College Preparatory School. Ms. Simon was a founding teacher when the school first opened in 2013 and is now in her 6th year.
During those six years, Ms. Simon has been a phenomenal teacher! In the 2017-2018 school year, 93.1% of her scholars met the 3rd Grade Reading Guarantee requirements for promotion to the 4th Grade!
Not only is she a wonderful teacher, but she also serves in a leadership capacity. Ms. Simon is also Canton College Preparatory School's school-based RESA mentor for teachers progressing through the Resident Educator program.

Thank you Ms. Simon for all you do for the students at Canton College Preparatory School!",3.0,"Sending a HUGE shout out to Ms. Simon for being recognized by the Ohio Council of Community Schools for her accomplishments!

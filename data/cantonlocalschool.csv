TEMPORARY PANDEMIC CHILD CARE CENTERS
The closure of Ohio's school districts has caused a significant impact on the families of critical employees throughout our community. While others are able to self-isolate, these employees are working long shifts, isolated from family, in order to provide critical care to the community.

Child care will be only be provided for parents providing health, safety and other essential services at no cost.

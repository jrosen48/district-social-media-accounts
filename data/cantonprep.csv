Well, the worst is over for AP Studio. If you don’t have exceptional work to show at this point, you have two options, but really only one option because the second option is for wimps and I don’t teach wimps.

1. Participate in an event that has been a GVSU art school tradition since the world began (Laker for a Lifetime!) called “The ultimate, all night, coffee death match”;. Basically, stay up all night and make the best artwork of your life due to a combination of pressure, camaraderie in procrastination and caffeine.

2. Give up and turn in crappy work that you find on pinterest or tumblr and recreate.

I recommend a light roast- it has more caffeine.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3144988848901997&id=502369629830612,,0.0,"Today is the AP Art Studio day to turn in their work and Ms. Haapala has some words of encouragement for her students!

Hopefully your answer to the question in the picture is…
Hard work pays off
I am strong, driven, and intelligent
That the world is much smaller than it may seem
Mr. Mac is extremely proud of me

At the end of the day, if you are unable to determine why Martin Luther's Reformation was an amalgamation of the Renaissance, that doesn't matter. What matters is that you became a better person by understanding how and why the world operates and how history can tell us a heck of a lot about the future. Good luck on the exam guys, I'm proud of you no matter what!

Mr. Mac AND Mrs. Sheehan are extremely proud of me

Good luck on the exam guys, I'm proud of you no matter what!

AP Government students,

Today is the day! Carpe Diem! Remember to count the points and to address each verb in the FRQ! And for goodness sake, DON'T GIVE OPINIONS! You must use the historical documents and SCOTUS cases as evidence of your positions. I'll be praying for you to have clear thoughts and calm nerves as you write today. You've got this!

Thanks for being great students! :)

As a friendly reminder, Canton Prep will be open today Monday March 16th until 12:00pm so that students can head to their locker to get any notebooks, laptops, chargers, binders, musical instruments, medication, or any other materials from their locker that they feel they need to prepare for virtual learning at home as we continue to figure out how to move forward based on what the State tells us. We are awaiting additional guidance and will update you with information as this situation evolves. Thank you for your patience and be safe.",2020-03-16 10:14:02,,

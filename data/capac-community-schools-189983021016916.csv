For over 50 years I have been coaching sports from intramural basketball and baseball to High school sports here in Capac. I have met and coached so many great young men and women during that time and Met so many great parents of these young people. I have had the privilege of coaching and working with many good people here in Capac. We’ve had many, many good years and some not so good, but for me they were always rewarding. So with a sad face and many memories I say thank you to all the young men and women I have had the pleasure of working with and say thank you for letting me a part of your lives. I LOVE YOU ALL!",2.0,"We'd like to ask you to join us in recognizing and thanking Coach Mike Rosas for his many, many years of supporting and coaching our Capac youth. We are so glad that so many generations of athletes have benefitted from his wisdom and guidance. We thank you for your dedication and wish you the very best.

Graduation is a rite of passage.

During this pandemic, 34 Detroit Symphony Orchestra musicians came together to create a special, inspired recording of Edward Elgar’s “Pomp and Circumstance.” Unable to gather at Orchestra Hall, we performed and recorded the music in our homes.

This year, five orchestra members have graduating high school seniors:

Ethan Kennedy⁠—son of Kim Kennedy (Acting Concertmaster) and Bryan Kennedy (horn)
Caleb Zheng⁠—son of Han Zheng (viola)
Robin Goldman⁠—daughter of Laurie Goldman (violin)
Nicholas Thompkins⁠—son of Ken Thompkins (Principal Trombone)

Graduates: we are inspired by your dreams, your courage, and your tenacity.

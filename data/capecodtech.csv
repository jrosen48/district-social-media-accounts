As you undoubtedly have already heard, our beloved, long-time volunteer Eddie Kirker passed away Friday. I first want to thank Brian Leger who kept us all up to date about Eddie's condition during the last several weeks. Brian you were a special friend to the family and our community during this time. Our athletics programs and our Automotive Technology program as well as our entire school community mourn the loss of Eddie. In addition to serving our school, Eddie was WWII naval veteran, long time basketball referee and a member of the Chatham VFW. Eddie's burial will be on Thursday July 16, 2020 at 2 pm at Massachusetts National Cemetery in Bourne.

This past Wednesday, several officers from the Cape Elizabeth Police Department were invited to serve lunch to students and staff at the high school. The occasion was School Resource Officer Galvan’s Mexican Fiesta. The menu included chicken, beef, veggies for a vegetarian option, rice, beans, taco shells, flour tortillas, and cookies that were prepared by Officer Galvan and John Holdridge’s advisory students. The event was so well received that the officers will be doing something similar at the middle school at the end of February!

We wanted to make sure everyone saw this important information from the Cape Girardeau County Public Health Center. Please make note, per the order, students who are 10 years of age and older will need to wear a face covering (if medical conditions allow) in our buildings. If your child has medical needs that prohibit them from wearing a mask, please be sure to share that with your building principal. We greatly appreciate everyone working together to help protect the health and safety of our entire community. Take care and have a great rest of your weekend!

There are a few ""musts"": You must come alone. You must be healthy. Finally, you must be able to commit to staying the entire shift. This decreases the risk of food contamination by decreasing the number of people handling the food.

Clippard students and teachers celebrated their Imagine Learning Literacy Bowl 2nd place finish in style! We enjoyed a pajama day with popcorn and a movie in the gym. Mr. Bob from Imagine Learning stopped by to present our school with a plaque and $200 gift card. Ms. Tinnin's class won a pizza party for logging the most minutes and Kindergartener Lucas was recognized for having the most individual minutes logged (1,625 minutes!).

Since September, over 13,600 schools; 85,000 classrooms, and nearly 1 million students participated in the competition. We are so proud of our students! A big thanks also goes out to our sponsors for providing popcorn for the whole school! #clippardstrong #clippardcares #weareCT #imaginelearning",0.0,"We are so proud of our Charles C.

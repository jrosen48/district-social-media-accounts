We had a great first day of delivering books for the #keepcapereading initiative at H O Brittingham Elementary School! Saw so many smiles as we handed books into car windows at meal distribution. Thank you to Browseabout Books for partnering with us on purchasing, and to Cape Henlopen School District for logistical and emotional support!

Most of all— THANK YOU, to this community, which has stepped up and helped us raise thousands of dollars for the cause! You constantly amaze us! Our goal is to get every kid receiving meals (there’s well over 1000 of them) a new, age appropriate book. And if we have enough money, we’ll get them more! We’ll be out next week following some of the buses. And we’ll keep on going as long as we can. If you want to contribute to purchasing books, hit the Browseabout website here: https://www.browseaboutbooks.com/

Cape Families:

We know how important graduation is to our seniors and their parents and it is equally important to us. We are doing everything we can to make sure that this year’s graduation, although different, is equally as special as it has been in previous years. As mentioned in our letter, we plan to recognize our seniors on June 9 virtually, which was the original graduation date but are also looking at the possibility of having a more traditional, in-person ceremony at a later date if we are able. We feel it is necessary to officially graduate our seniors in June and celebrate them again later. There will also be some personal touches added to ensure our seniors know just how special they are! Ms. Miller has been in discussion with the class officers and a survey will be created to determine when the in-person ceremony should be held and how that will look. Thank you for your continued support, understanding, and patience with us as we navigate through these challenges.

We know how important graduation is to our seniors and their parents and it is equally important to us. We are doing everything we can to make sure that this year’s graduation, although different, is equally as special as it has been in previous years. As mentioned in our letter, we plan to recognize our seniors on June 9 virtually, which was the original graduation date but are also looking at the possibility of having a more traditional, in-person ceremony at a later date if we are able. We feel it is necessary to officially graduate our seniors in June and celebrate them again later. There will also be some personal touches added to ensure our seniors know just how special they are! Ms. Miller has been in discussion with the class officers and a survey will be created to determine when the in-person ceremony should be held and how that will look. Thank you for your continued support, understanding, and patience with us as we navigate through these challenges.

Sincerely,
Bob Fulton

Today we'd like to recognize Ms. Maria Gaito as the Rehoboth Elementary GEM nominee for the month of February! Ms. Gaito’s compassionate and nurturing spirit has touched the lives of hundreds of students for the past 29 years. The bonds that she and her kindergarten students form stretch beyond the students’ first year of learning.

She is truly a devoted educator who seeks to understand the whole child and does not hesitate to seek assistance to meet a child’s every need. Her proactive efforts to connect daily with parents are genuine and reflective.

Interim Virtual Learning / Parent & Guardian Support",28.0,"Many of you have inquired about school work being sent home for students.

At this point, we will not be sending additional work home. However, we have launched a webpage, capehenlopenschools.com/virtual to share learning resources that families can use.

We encourage our students to spend time reading and working on basic skills that will enhance previously learned material. Please know that we will not be teaching any new curricular material during this time of closure. These resources are self-paced and can be accessed at any time and participation is considered voluntary.

This will not count as graded work and no tests are planned on the material.

Finally, only assignments that were given on or prior to the students' last day, March 12, 2020, will be eligible to grade. Teachers may connect with students through Schoology if there are outstanding items needed from students.

To review the letter from Mr. Fulton covering this topic, among others, please visit the homepage of our website. Updates have been posted below the ""Cape Henlopen School District In the News"" section.

She eats lunch with our students on request, guest reads to our Little Vikings program and is available to meet with students and their families at a moment’s notice. She works closely with the administration to work through concerns and communicates with her partners to ensure a safe learning environment for staff and students.

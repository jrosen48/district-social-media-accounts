May 1 at 11:53 PM ·

Some know the story and some don't but really long story short, 17 years ago I had to make a decision to finish college right after Cierra was born( 14 days). I was in NC and she was here in CT. I was only able to see her once a month or when her and her mother could visit me, which was only once. You see ....I had to finish school, for this piece of me I just created to have a chance!
At 1 year of age Cierra attended my graduation and watched me recieve my degree from North Carolina A&T SU and God knew that was the beginning of a legacy.

I am almost in tears to announce that my princess committed to my Alma mater .............

#CollegeDecisionDay

Calvin M Jones II is feeling pumped.
May 1 at 11:53 PM ·

Some know the story and some don't but really long story short, 17 years ago I had to make a decision to finish college right after Cierra was born( 14 days). I was in NC and she was here in CT. I was only able to see her once a month or when her and her mother could visit me, which was only once. You see ....I had to finish school, for this piece of me I just created to have a chance!
At 1 year of age Cierra attended my graduation and watched me recieve my degree from North Carolina A&T SU and God knew that was the beginning of a legacy.

I am almost in tears to announce that my princess committed to my Alma mater .............
North Carolina A&T State University!!! AGGIE PRIDE !!! #aggieclassof2003

Cierra Monét I am so proud of your hard work and effort. Continue to grow and learn baby Girl. You are a Queen ....ALWAYS!!

(Shout out to Teshena Best Debrew inbetween me and cierra... she was my leader in admissions when I went to A&T ...full circle back to aggieland)

#TeacherAppreciationWeek and today we shout out Ms. Dukes! She was Nadia’s 3rd & 4th grade Illuminator, who pushed her the hardest ever! She never let her slip thru the cracks, never let Nadia get lazy 😂🤣(Nadia’s Fave) 🤣 Even though she is no longer her Illuminator she still continues to check in on Nadia EVERY SINGLE WEEK!! Before distance learning took place she took extra time at the end of the day and stood after school with her 1-2x a week for extra help! WE can’t ever express how greatful and appreciative we are of this Superwoman here! We thank you Ms. Dukes and we appreciate you‼️ We are blessed to have you! I’m sure anyone who crosses her path feels the same way!",0.0,"#TEACHERAPPRECIATIONWEEK! LETS GOOOOOOOOO!

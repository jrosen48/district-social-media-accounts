#TeacherAppreciationWeek and today we shout out Ms. Dukes! She was Nadia’s 3rd & 4th grade Illuminator, who pushed her the hardest ever! She never let her slip thru the cracks, never let Nadia get lazy 😂🤣(Nadia’s Fave) 🤣 Even though she is no longer her Illuminator she still continues to check in on Nadia EVERY SINGLE WEEK!! Before distance learning took place she took extra time at the end of the day and stood after school with her 1-2x a week for extra help! WE can’t ever express how greatful and appreciative we are of this Superwoman here! We thank you Ms. Dukes and we appreciate you‼️ We are blessed to have you!

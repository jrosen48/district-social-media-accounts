Amanda serves diverse roles, integrating the ten domains of professional practice in the context of a team-based approach to meet the needs of the whole child holistically.

From Kent County Community School: “Amanda is definitely part of the “heart” of KCCS and we would not be able to do what we do without her. As a master of collaboration, she consistently goes above and beyond to build teams to serve the needs of our students and to create groups that work together frequently and well. Amanda believes in the ideas and expertise of others and exemplifies ""team” with how she walks, talks, acts, and carries herself.”

I wish you the very best next year in high school. Remember that you are capable of being anything you want to be. You are special and will offer the world great things!

While the world outside is in chaos, remember that behind the walls of CMS are people who care for you, love you, and are proud of you! In the hard times, remember that you can make it! In the easy times, remember to have fun.

CMS family,

All current 6th and 7th graders will have one last opportunity to request Related Arts Courses for the 2020-21 school year. All forms to do this were mailed out in April but I am including them again here. If you need to get your Home Access Center login info, please call the school in which your student is currently enrolled.

The window to do this will close at 5:00 on June 15. There will not be another opportunity so please make sure you get the info you need to complete this process now.

After this, we will schedule students into Related Arts courses randomly and based on availability.

Please don’t miss out on the chance to select the classes you take for middle school!

We offer more options than any other middle school around!! Middle School is your time to explore all career options and make decisions about what you like and don’t like.

We look forward to working with each of you next year!!

If you have questions, please contact me at Shan.green@capital.k12.de.us
Or leave me a message here on the CMS FB page.

Thank you!!

Hello CMS family! I hope you’re all staying safe and healthy during this trying time.

On Monday, you should receive the mail with the choice board activities in them. These are activities that can keep your student busy while we are off this week. They’re concepts that will provide a review for your students so they don’t forget all the important stuff they know:)

Please know that while your students are home and in a situation none of us can control, they continue to be the main focus for my team and our district.

As I am given additional I formation from Dr. Shelton, I will be sure to convey that I do to you!

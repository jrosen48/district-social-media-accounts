We hope you enjoyed it!

Before the week comes to a close, we have one more special message to share that deserves its own shoutout! Tijeras Creek Elementary School student Anthony Anticona created this message for his teacher Mrs. Cutkomp.

We are incredibly thankful for teachers like Mrs. Cutkomp, who always make a difference in the lives of our 47,000 students, no matter where they are. Now, more than ever, you are their cheerleaders, their inspiration, and their role models. Thank you for all that you do!

In this Fred Rogers Productions A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood inspired video, Mrs. Jindra of Las Flores Middle School reminds us that although we are faced with this time of uncertainty, we are all in this together. Our neighborhood is just going to be a little different for a while, but we will get through it.

Fred Rogers always encouraged us to #LookForTheHelpers when faced with a tough situation. Thank you Mrs. Jindra for being a helper for our students, our families, and our community as we navigate these challenging times! #CUSDAllTogether

Suicide rates among teens continue to rise across the country at an alarming rate, and depression and anxiety are skyrocketing as well. It’s more important than ever to raise awareness about this crisis and work together to prevent suicide in our community.

Join mental health expert Dr. David Sack to learn how to approach these topics with your child, warning signs to look for, and resources available to help you and your family.

A panel of teen mental health experts from ASPIRE at Hoag, including child and adolescent psychiatrist Dr. Sina Safahieh and licensed marriage and family therapist Stacelyn Caervantes will also be present to answer questions.

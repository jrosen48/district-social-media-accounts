I would like to remind you that there will be no school this Monday (May 27th, 2019) in remembrance of Memorial Day.

I know this holiday is associated with the beginning of the summer season and I am sure many of us will take advantage of the extended weekend to enjoy the beautiful weather, perhaps travel a bit, or have a cookout to welcome the long awaited warmer temperatures.

I would like to take a moment and honor those brave men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for us to enjoy the freedom’s that this wonderful country has to offer. As I walk through our buildings and drive through our city, I am reminded that our community has lost some of our own residences while serving on active duty.

To our local families who have lost loved ones, I wish you comfort and peace and thank you for reminding us what the true meaning of Memorial Day is about.

Have a wonderful weekend and I look forward to welcoming our students back on Tuesday.

A short while ago both our elementary and secondary buildings participated in a restrictive movement and lock down drill.

This drill was a part of our requirements under the safe schools act as well as our desire to make sure our staff and students are well prepared in the event of an actual emergency.

I want to assure you that there was no threat in any of our buildings or on our campus and it was merely an exercise in school safety management.

We will continue to hold such drills and the school will follow up with you upon completion of the drill.

In an effort to keep our elementary students who are on ""parent pick-up"" safe at dismissal, we are asking anyone who is picking up their child at the end of the day to please park in an open parking space. There are spaces available, especially in the lower part of the parking lot. We cannot have cars double-parked and blocking in cars that are legally parked. This practice creates a dangerous situation for students and family members who are walking back to their vehicle.

Our police officers will be visible in the parking lot at dismissal and will be available to assist you if you should have any questions regarding where you can park.

I appreciate your cooperation and understanding in the reason for implementing this change.

I would like to announce two exciting incentive programs that we will be initiating for our students.

1. All students in grades (K-12) who have perfect attendance during the 45 day marking period will be treated to a special breakfast meal prepared by our food service vendor. We will offer this incentive beginning with this marking period which ends on November 1st.

For any student who receives perfect attendance for all four marking periods, they will be treated to a breakfast at one of our local restaurants.

It is imperative that our students are attending school regularly and that we instill in them the importance of being responsible to their academics.

2. Our second incentive program will be for our secondary students in grades 9-12th. Any student who has 93% or higher in any subject area which requires a final examination, will have the option of being exempt from their final examination. The exemption will be at the discretion of the student, so if a student attains a 93% or higher and wish to take the final, they can.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1971951613105405&id=1772266963073872,,0.0,"Dear Parents and Students,

The Carbondale Area Administration would like to inform you that we have been investigating reports of threats to our school. These threats have been investigated thoroughly by the Carbondale Police as well as our Director of School Safety and Security, Officer Michael Golay.

At this time, our investigation has determined the threats are not credible and that our students were not in any danger at any time.

We met with the entire secondary student body this morning and stressed to them that if they hear or see anything that causes them concern to immediately report the activity to a member of our staff.

We will continue to monitor and investigate any threats to the well-being of our school community, and want to ensure you that the safety and security of your child is our top priority.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you should have any concerns.

This afternoon we were informed that a group of our students were planning a walk-out tomorrow to get their message of school safety out to the public.
I want to first assure you that myself and our entire administration team, support our student’s rights to be heard. We are however, asking our students, to hold off their demonstration until the national walk-out day, so we can have police onsite to also ensure that those who are demonstrating are safe.
As Superintendent, I am proud that our students feel the desire to be heard and speak out about this very important topic. I also want to ensure you that school safety is out top priority.
I ask you to please encourage your child to stay inside the building and their opportunity to demonstrate will be granted on National Walk-out day if they choose to be a part.

Thank you for your support of our district.

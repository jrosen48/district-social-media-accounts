Because of the COVID 19 crisis this spring the dinner was not held in May like it usually is and that meant that many of the honorees could not attend. The district had 14 people retire this year and seven of them were honored at the event. Superintendent Lance Hatch presided over the dinner and appears in each photo with the retirees.",5.0,"Pictures from the 2020 Retirement Banquet. Thank you to all of our retirees in attendance and those who could not make it. Retirement is a blank sheet of paper. It is a chance to redesign your life into something new and different. Congratulations!

Volunteers put up privacy slats
Volunteers from around the community came to Castle Heights Elementary on Monday morning to put slats in the fence that faces the Cliffview Cemetery.

The volunteer effort was made because there are some students at the school who have lost relatives and they are buried in Cliffview. This creates some emotional situations for them that has been distracting.

So recently the decision was made to separate the school from the cemetery by more than just a chain link fence, but one that could not be seen through.

Many of the volunteers were students from Carbon High as well as some from Utah State University Eastern. There were also many Castle Heights students and adults from various organizations as well. At the height of the effort just under 70 people were there working at one time.

Lieutenant Governor Spencer Cox was also in the area and he came and talked with people and worked on placing slats in the fence as well.

Schools release fish into local ponds

Students and staff from Helper Middle School and Creekview Elementary have been working hard this year to raise small fish to plant in fishing ponds in Helper and at the Carbon County Fair Grounds this school year. On Monday morning both schools released their fish, with the HMS fish going to the Gigliotti Pond and the Creekview fish to the fairgrounds. While it was a wet and cool morning all went well and it was a great learning experience both raising the fish and setting them free into open water for everyone involved.",0.0,"Reddog Communications

Nick St. George, Ethan Ulewicz, Jacob Rayl, Gaven Dibble, Loagine Frazee and Collen Dibble have not missed an assignment in my World History google classroom. They have had phenomenal participation.

Shout out to my 7th hour athletic training class that checks in weekly with their favorite physical activities. They have been busy playing basketball, going for walks, chopping wood, completing their football workouts sent out by Mr. Jones, and doing lawn work. Great job helping out mom and dad around the house, keep it up!

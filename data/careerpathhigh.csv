We are super thrilled to introduce our new art teacher Ms. Wagner!

Ms. Wagner was born and raised in West Valley City, Utah. She attended Westminster College, where she studied music and art. She completed her Master's in Secondary Education through Grand Canyon University. She has teaching experience both in Utah and in the state of Virginia as both a music and art instructor. This will be Ms. Wagner's first year with Career Path High as the fine arts instructor and is excited to be part of the team!

In her spare time, she enjoys hiking, skydiving, painting, drawing, and improv comedy clubs.

Thank you Ms. Wagner for being an amazing teacher and for being a part of Team CPH!

Jesse has successfully completed the Cyber Security program at Davis Technical College. He chose this program because computers and networking are some of his passions.

He really enjoyed his program. His favorite parts of the program were “learning how computers work and how they talk to other computers.” He also loved the hands-on labs.

Jesse already had a great job in IT and plans on continue to work his way to the top.

Thank you, Jesse for being a great representative of our school! We are so proud of your success and look forward to seeing where your career will take you.

She loves how hands on her program is. She says, “The first day I started I was learning how to weld, and the second day we were going out to a job site.”

Priscilla dreams of becoming a master plumber and one day opening her own business.

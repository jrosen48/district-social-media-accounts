In his civilian capacity, LTC Jackson serves as a school administrator for the Holmes County Consolidated School District, located in Lexington, MS and holds the rank of Lieutenant with the Hinds County Sheriff’s Office Reserve Division in Jackson, MS.

The message LTC Jackson delivered to the students was powerful. He spoke to the students on the 5 C’s – Courage, Competence, Confidence, Candor, and Commitment. As the character traits were presented he interacted with the students, which allowed the students to gain a better understanding.

CHS appreciated the opportunity to host LTC Jackson and the message which was delivered to approximately 425 students.",2019-12-20 08:24:06,,

Are you confused about current trends in adolescents’ lives with chemical use such as vaping, e-cigarettes, edibles, and gummies? Does the difference between THC oil and CBD oil puzzle you? Do you know what to look for in your preteen or teenagers’ rooms to see if your student is using any of these chemicals? Are you worried about the chemical use continuum (experimentation leading toward addiction)?

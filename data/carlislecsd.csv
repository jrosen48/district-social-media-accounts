The Governor recommended tonight that all Iowa schools will be closed for four weeks until April 13, 2020. In the short term that means our schools are inaccessible except for designated staff. All athletic practices, and activities are canceled effective immediately. Please know we are working through all options for our staff, students, and families and will have more information soon.

In addition, the Governor plans to announce more information tomorrow and we will communicate with you once we know more in regards to the next steps.

We will continue to work with the Governor and Department of Education on a plan for students and staff. As this situation changes rapidly, please know we will communicate information with you as soon as we can that more clearly defines school closure expectations.

✌️There are two ways you as a parent, family member, or community member can join in on the fun!

1. Each week, one of our favorite community locations will be hiding a Golden Ticket. To find it, watch for clues to be posted here on Facebook, in the Carlisle Citizen newspaper, and the Wildcat Weekly. Once you have found the Golden Ticket, snap a picture and post it to your social media platform of choice (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) and use the hashtag #igottagoldenticket

2. Read Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and share a picture of you and/or your children reading it on any one of your social media platforms with the hashtag #ireadcharlie

We can't wait to see your posts, encouraging our students over the next several weeks while they are reading it in their classrooms. 🥰",0.0,"Carlisle Elementary Libraries

Be sure to share this if you know someone who is interested in an easy fall race where they might ring the PR bell. The Half Marathon is flat and downhill from Indianola to Carlisle. Certified course on well protected rail trail, chip timing, the 10k and 5k are flat and fast too. Free photos, medals, shirts, biscuits & gravy, pie, chocolate milk, and lots more to celebrate when you reach the finish line in Carlisle which is one of the friendliest small towns in Iowa. Our Hillbilly volunteers will show you a good time. All for a good cause, see the link below for more info. Only $55 for the Half & $35 for the 10k or 5k. We also offer a virtual race in case the date doesn’t work for you. Use ""Ibilly"" to get $5 discount. Don't delay, price goes up in a few days.

To All Our Teachers......

Thanks for ALL that you did today and everyday in your classrooms.
For making a million little split second DECISIONS for the benefits of your students.
For putting your own needs on hold and keeping them the FOCUS of your days.
For PLANNING for them long before the days ever get rolling.
For CHANGING those plans because they didn't fit someone who needed a little extra
For smiling, LAUGHING WITH THEM and reassuring their efforts, trials and mistakes.
For placing your hand on a shoulder that was EXACTLY what your students needed.
For getting down on the physical level of your students because IT MATTERS.
For thinking of a new way to reach a student who wasn't getting it.
You matter.
YES YOU ALL MATTER!!

Again, we want to thank our elementary, upper elementary, middle and high school teachers for all that you do for our students on a daily basis! Pictured our elementary and upper elementary students.",0.0,"Carlisle Schools PTO

Today, Governor Gavin Newsom commented in his daily press conference that all school facilities in the state of California should be closed for the rest of the school year, and all districts should fully commit to distance learning for the remainder of the school year.

He did not, however, issue an Executive Order closing all schools for the year.

As such, we are in the same situation as we were yesterday:
1. Our school facilities are closed for the moment;
2. Our teachers will continue to engage students in Remote Online Learning for as long as we’re closed; and
3. We are waiting to hear from the San Diego County public health officer about when we can safely reopen.

Read the full statement here:

Clarification about School Closures in California - April 1, 2020.pdf",14.0,"Clarification about School Closures in California - April 1, 2020

Today, Governor Gavin Newsom commented in his daily press conference that all school facilities in the state of California should be closed for the rest of the school year, and all districts should fully commit to distance learning for the remainder of the school year.

He did not, however, issue an Executive Order closing all schools for the year.

As such, we are in the same situation as we were yesterday:
1. Our school facilities are closed for the moment;
2. Our teachers will continue to engage students in Remote Online Learning for as long as we’re closed; and
3. We are waiting to hear from the San Diego County public health officer about when we can safely reopen.

The mental health effects of COVID-19 are as important to address as the physical health effects. This is especially true for the one in five who already have mental health conditions – or the one in two who are at risk of developing them.

Be sure to take time this weekend to take care of yourself - take a break from the news, get some fresh air, talk to a friend - so you can help your child through this time. Here are some ways you can create a safe emotional and physical environment for your student.

Hi KE kids! Happy Tuesday. Today is a yucky day. Make sure to get extra reading in, it’s a good day for it. (And no, I’m not just here to tell you to read!) it’s supposed to rain again on Thursday so I thought I’d do another principal in pajamas read aloud! And YOU get to choose the book. Two of my favorites are below. In the comments put a P to vote for If You Give a Pig a Pancake or a D for Dragons love Tacos 2. I’ll be announcing the winner tomorrow night at 6 so get voting! I can’t wait- reading will be Thursday at 4 here using Facebook Live. XO love you and miss you!",2020-03-17 10:26:29,,

Dear CCSD community:
Every year for at least 28 years (amazing) the Carmel-Kent Chamber of Commerce has sponsored Youth Art Month awards and we are extremely appreciative of their support of our students. In light of the public health crisis and after consultation with Bill Nulk of the Chamber, this year’s awards night on April 1, 2020 has been canceled. The Chamber will work with our Art Faculty to get the awards to the students.

We certainly look forward to resuming this fantastic event in the 2020-2021 school year.

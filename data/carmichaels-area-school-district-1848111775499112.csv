With that, an allotment of tickets have been distributed to each player. Also, an allotment of tickets have been provided to Charleroi.

Maria states high school has always been something that she dreaded would end to soon. She has used every minute that she could to make new friends and learn new things. High school showed what it was to have a passion and have something she was good at. She found that in the band and in the music program. Band helped her become who she is and showed her that she could stand up, help out, and be a leader. Those are qualities she never saw in herself but that Mrs. Walker always saw in her. She was lucky enough to have a good group of people that surrounded her and made sure to push her past her comfort zones. If it was not for them she would not have become involved with the musicals.

Here in Minnesota, we are doing a statewide, all-ages read of Because of Winn-Dixie.
I cannot even begin to tell you how happy and proud this makes me.
I moved to Minnesota from Florida when I was thirty years old.
I wanted to be a writer, but I hadn‚Äôt written anything.
And then, during a very hard winter--a winter when I was homesick for the warmth of Florida, and feeling very keenly the lack of a dog in my life--I wrote Because of Winn-Dixie.
It was my first book, and the way I see it, everything that has happened to me as a writer has happened because of Winn-Dixie.
So: thank you, Minnesota.
And thank you, teachers, booksellers, librarians, parents, grandparents, kids and readers everywhere.
There is going to be a virtual gathering and discussion around Because of Winn-Dixie on May 20th.

The Department of Education (PDE) announced today all schools in the commonwealth will remain closed through at least April 6 as a result of the COVID-19 response efforts. The closure order could be extended beyond April 6 if necessary to save lives and stop the spread of COVID-19.

Under the new timeline, school buildings would reopen on April 7 for two days to allow school administrators, teachers and other staff time to prepare classrooms, set up cafeterias, schedule transportation and arrange other business operations. Students would return to school on April 9, unless extending the closure is needed in response to the situation with the virus at that time.

Thank you for your flexibility in this matter.

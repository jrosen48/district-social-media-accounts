As we mentioned on Friday, we want to offer a more granular look at a few of our new policies and procedures relating to our implementation of the State's ""MI Safe Return to School"" plan's many regulations and requirements. On Friday, we looked at busing, and today we're going to more closely examine the protocols for breakfast, lunch, and recess. We absolutely understand that students need time during the school day to socialize, relax, and have some fun and we were able to preserve all of that while also limiting the number of grade levels that are in any one locale at any one time. Breakfast posed the greatest challenge, as we have all grade levels eating at the same time (as opposed to lunch, where students eat on a staggered schedule according to grade level) but we feel we have reached a workable solution. There are of course no perfect answers that keep everything exactly the same as in years past, but we do feel our plans allow time for kids to be kids without compromising their safety.

Our new schedules are attached below.

This is just a friendly reminder that our graduation ceremony for this year's seniors is scheduled for Thursday, June 18, at 6:30 pm at the Carney Rodeo Arena. Right now, the forecast for Thursday is calling for sunny skies with no chance of rain, so it should be a beautiful evening. There are actually 17 different sections of bleachers at the arena, with seating for up to 1,000 people, so we ask that groups that arrive together may sit next to one another by six feet of distance be maintained between groups. We typically have 350-400 people at our ceremony, so there should be plenty of room for spectators to comfortably spread out. This event is open to the public.

Also, since it's going to be a bit too bright out to play the senior slideshow during the ceremony, we wanted to post it here for all to see. They did a wonderful job with this!

The safety and security of our students, their families, friends, and all attendees is of the utmost concern to us, and in the coming weeks we will be posting an itinerary as to how the evening will unfold as well as several guidelines we'll all need to follow as a means to maintain safe social distancing.

Adam",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2988239264567720&id=221750321216642,,0.0,"Hello,

We've continued to work very closely with our seniors on planning their graduation ceremony, and we've really taken pains to ensure that their achievements can be publicly celebrated. In turn, we're very pleased to announce that this year's ceremony will be held at the Carney Rodeo arena at 6:30 pm on Thursday, June 18th.

The safety and security of our students, their families, friends, and all attendees is of the utmost concern to us, and in the coming weeks we will be posting an itinerary as to how the evening will unfold as well as several guidelines we'll all need to follow as a means to maintain safe social distancing. It's going to be a very special evening for them, though, and we truly appreciate the patience, good humor, and flexibility they've all shown us throughout this entire process.

Thanks, everyone, and have a wonderful holiday weekend!

A foot of new snow on the ground isn't exactly a welcome sight in the middle of April, but we're going to run a contest today to help your kids make the best of the rather unusual weather conditions we're experiencing today. If you send us a picture of your children playing in the snow, we'll put your name in a drawing we'll do at the end of the week, and the winner will receive a $25 Visa gift card. I believe you have to send us the picture via private message to the school, but we'll post a few of our favorites throughout the week.

Thanks to a very generous donation of new, tegular ceiling tiles from Mr. Bob Cooper, owner of Integrity Interiors, a construction company based in Lansing, we are in the process of updating our ceiling in the ""horseshoe hallway"" portion of our building that starts at our main entrance and wraps around past our cafeteria.. Ken Linder, our chief of maintenance here at CNPS, has been busy this week replacing the old tiles with the new ones Mr. Cooper so generously gave us. These new tiles have beveled edges which make them less prone to warping and also allow their surface to hang slightly below the metal gridwork in which they sit. You can see what a difference they make in the photo below. The tiles closest to the wall are the old style and the two rows to their left are brand-new.

In light of the many changes brought about by the COVID-19 outbreak, our district is looking to be proactive as we plan to move forward. We are currently exploring all options, but we want to ensure the needs of all students are met if we need to switch to an online instructional platform.

This same information is being sent via mass call-out later today, and those without internet access will be able to call the school to give their responses.

We want to wrap up our posts for the day with a bit of good news. Carney-Nadeau Public School recently learned that we are a 2019-20 recipient of a SetSeg Education Excellence Award for a grant request we submitted on behalf of our Robotics program. This honor is only given to ten schools in the state each year, and we're told there were hundreds of applicants. In addition to receiving $2,500 for our Robotics program, we also have a representative coming from SetSeg to present us with a trophy in person (though this visit has been temporarily postponed) and we received this really nice metal sign to put on permanent display. This award is given in conjunction with the Michigan Association of School Boards (MASB) and if you check out their Facebook page, they've actually produced a few videos that make mention of CNPS.

That's all for now, but we'll close by saying again that we truly miss having our students and their families in the building and we hope to see you all back here very soon.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2836904343034547&id=221750321216642,,0.0,"Hello Again,

Here are two excellent websites for free educational resources. Both break down the learning by grade level and even include daily schedules. Scholastic normally charges a fee for access to its online content but that fee has been waived for the duration of the 2019-20 school year. They are more geared toward learning for students in grades K-6, but they do offer some materials for older students as well.

The next resource is Kahn Academy. It has a wealth of educational materials for students in grades Y4-12 and is particularly strong at the junior-high and high-school levels. Sign-up is (and has always been) free, and you can receive grade-specific instruction in any number of classes within a matter of minutes.

We will be pushing out more links such as these in the days to come, but for now these are definitely two of the best.

We have been in contact with the Menominee County Road Commission today, and it sounds like only 50% of the side roads will be cleared by tomorrow.

I know there's sunny skies out right now and the highways are fine but the sheer volume of snow we received just takes substantially more time than normal to clear.

In light of recent news events both local and national it is indeed understandable and wise for parents to again wonder/inquire about our school’s preparedness for an emergency of one type or another. Know that we have a comprehensive and detailed Emergency Response and Crisis Plan in place covering a multitude of potentialities, along with a posting inside each classroom door of Emergency Response Flip Charts which provide quick access to procedures for varied emergencies (though for reasons of security/safety we cannot share the details of either document as we do not want those details to fall into the wrong hands).

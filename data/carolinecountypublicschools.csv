Over the past few years, I have been blown away by the Chesapeake Culinary Center and how in the Caroline Schoolhouse, they can bring together everything from career training through Caroline County Public Schools; house and run Shore Gourmet Denton Market; work with farmers and innovators; process local food to go into the schools; and feed students and senior citizens during a pandemic. They are a blueprint for something every county in the state would do well to replicate. So I was excited when Tidewater Times asked me to write about them, and I might have already known some folks there and a bit of the back story :) I caught up with Beth Brewster and David Murray to talk about all things culinary arts in Caroline County. You can find copies of the August issue around the Shore, and/or read the article here: https://issuu.com/tidewatertimes/docs/august_2020_tidewater_times_web_magazine/43",6.0,"Check it out!

After a record 28,899 COVID-19 tests reported in the past 24 hours, Maryland’s daily positivity is 3.83% with a seven-day average of 4.46%. There are 449 current total hospitalizations.

Nearly half of new cases belong to Marylanders in their 20s and 30s, and the positivity rate for Marylanders under 35 is over 85% higher than Marylanders 35 and older. We are urging younger Marylanders to take these statistics seriously: this pandemic is by no means behind us.

Our recovery depends on each and every Marylander exercising personal responsibility. Wear a mask in indoor public areas, practice physical distancing, and avoid large gatherings.

A group of 23 artists, who live or work in Easton, will have an art show along the fence at 11 South Aurora Street on July 4. Each artist will portray a chosen African American who has unjustly lost his or her life because of systemic racism in the U.S. The show will hang on the fence from 10 a.m.-4 p.m. and all are invited to respectfully view from the sidewalk during those hours. The works are not for sale, but the artists hope that the impact from the display will serve to send a collective message that we, as a nation, still have much to do to improve our democracy for all of its citizens.",4.0,"Caroline County Public Library

Another tribute to Fred Spence from Food for Learning board member and CCPS Director of Student Services Derek Simmons: ""Fred was passionate about the issue of food insufficiency in Caroline. When he learned about the high number of children in need, he felt called to bring together a team to fundraise. It was this calling and his faith that built the Food for Learning organization.""

I stopped by the school today to pick something up. As I walked up the hallway I noticed the tulips that bloom in the courtyard every year at this time. I chose to look at it in a positive way. I've seen flowers bloom in the courtyard for the last 21 years and they'll continue to bloom. The flowers will be there and the school will be there and when it's our time to go back, we'll be there with our children.

Today I enacted an executive order which will require the wearing of masks or face coverings when inside any retail establishments, including grocery stores, pharmacies, and convenience stores, or when riding any form of public transportation in Maryland.

It also requires all essential retail locations to require their staff to wear face coverings, and requires those businesses to put appropriate social distancing measures in place in order to keep customers and their staff safe.

To give these retailers time to make these adjustments, the order will go into effect beginning Saturday, April 18, at 7 a.m.

While this order is an important step in our immediate efforts to protect public health and safety, the wearing of masks is also something that we may all have to become more accustomed to in order to safely reopen our state.

Caroline County recognizes and acknowledges the 9-1-1 dispatchers and support staff who work tirelessly behind the scenes to help you during emergencies.

Public safety dispatchers may not be out in public, but they are the first line of defense for first responders each and every day, including in the battle against COVID-19. They have been tasked with a tremendous responsibility and they remain ready to answer the call help our Caroline County families through this uncertain time.

We can't say enough about our Dispatchers and the job that they do. Please join us in recognizing their dedication and efforts.

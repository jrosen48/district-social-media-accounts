The families that indicated on the parent survey that they have no access to Broadband will be primary recipients with those with limited or unreliable access being served in a secondary capacity.

We ask that if your 3rd grade or higher student has access to personal computers, laptops, and broadband Internet, please utilize them during this time. This will help ensure that all CCPS students are equipped to start this unprecedented school year. #OneCaroline",2020-08-05 20:17:40,https://video-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/116767880_298580974785156_6217954849727776584_n.mp4?_nc_cat=106&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=YDkOgdPMAVYAX9aCujP&_nc_ht=video-iad3-1.xx&oh=5a994777207b90d6416d9e56172af1b0&oe=5F65254C,

On National School Nurse Day, we take special time to celebrate and recognize the contributions that NurseCox, Nurse Ryan, Nurse Tinder, Nurse Divelbliss, and Nurse Pettigrew are making to the health and learning of our children. These amazing health professionals lead the way to advance health and support education by ensuring that our students are safe, healthy & ready to learn.

Thank you! Thank you for nurturing our students with complex physical and mental health conditions, those at risk for health concerns, and students who are affected by societal issues. Your daily use of critical thinking and highly skilled, evidence-based practices help CCPS meet the needs of our students, families and school communities.

Fondly,

CCPS school nurses play an integral role in the health of our students and staff! On National School Nurse Day, we take special time to celebrate and recognize the contributions that NurseCox, Nurse Ryan, Nurse Tinder, Nurse Divelbliss, and Nurse Pettigrew are making to the health and learning of our children. These amazing health professionals lead the way to advance health and support education by ensuring that our students are safe, healthy & ready to learn.

Thank you! Thank you for nurturing our students with complex physical and mental health conditions, those at risk for health concerns, and students who are affected by societal issues.

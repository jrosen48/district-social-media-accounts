Overall, I thought today was a great success! A special thank you to Barb Burns, the cafeteria staff, bus drivers, and principals. We had many district volunteers that helped as well. We served approximately 400 lunches and breakfasts today. I anticipate that this number will grow.

During these uncertain times, we must remain calm and patient. Carrollton Schools will do everything possible to ensure all students have the opportunity to receive nutritious meals.

There is an adjustment to our schedule starting tomorrow. We are going to add one more stop at Kensington Greene from 10:50-11:00 am (edit: at the entrance area ). We also need to adjust a few times: Augusta 11:15-11:30 am and Mechanicstown stop from 11:40-Noon.

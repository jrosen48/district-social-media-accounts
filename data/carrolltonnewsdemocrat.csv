The lights like helmets represent something much deeper than equipment. The helmet is an individual who has feelings, plays with emotions, endures pain, and embraces the physical fight every play. The LIGHTS are a symbol of goodness, vision, and ultimate success only possible through struggle, challenge, discipline, and hard work. So come to the lights tomorrow night knowing it will cost you something, your time, energy, gas, your favorite show or the evening stroll around the block.

School closure extended, April 20 new return date

Carrollton, Ky. - March 20, 2020 - Schools in the Carroll County School District will remain closed for a week beyond April 13, making April 20 the first day for students to return to school. In a March 20 conference call with superintendents, Gov. Beshear requested that schools remain closed until April 20 as a result of the spread of COVID-19, also known as “the coronavirus.”

“I am disappointed that we will remain out of school for another week, but this is the right thing to do,” said Superintendent Danny Osborne. “Safety is and always will be our first priority. Our teachers, staff members and parents are working hard each day to ensure that our students continue to learn during this closure. I am proud of the work that everyone is doing, and we will continue to deliver meals to our students as we are doing now.”

Hello Champions for a Drug Free Carroll County-

After much consideration and thought, we have decided as an Executive Committee to cancel next week’s Coalition Meeting. Our normally scheduled guest speaker for this month was Leslie Yocum from Empowered Living (Mental Health Resources) and she has agreed to come to next month’s meeting- which is still on as of now. April’s meeting will be on Thursday, April 23 at 11:30am at The Carroll County Public Library, lunch provided.

If anything changes from now to then, we will keep everyone posted. We have our community member’s health and well-being at the forefront and hope you all understand our decision and concern at this point in time.

It is just extremely difficult to practice and monitor social distancing in a place meant to facilitate social interaction.

Recreational users of the Kentucky River are cautioned!
Due to the July 2 fire at the Jim Beam bourbon warehouse in Woodford County, and the anticipated impact to the Kentucky River, recreational users are encouraged to be aware of conditions and use caution while on the river.

Runoff from the bourbon fire will create conditions that include water discoloration, foaming, and an odor, as well as low dissolved oxygen levels, which could have a serious impact on the aquatic life in the river, including substantial fish kills. We are working with all parties to limit this impact.

Recreational activity along the river is not prohibited at this time, but users are encouraged to be aware of conditions before utilizing the waterway.",2019-07-03 13:56:53,,

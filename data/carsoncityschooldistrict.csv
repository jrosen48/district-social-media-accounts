1. Your child's teacher will be using phone calls to take attendance for your child. It is important that they are able to speak to your child 1-2 times each week.
2. We realize this can be a lot of phone calls if you have multiple children who attend the same school. If this is the case, tell your child's teacher and they will make each phone call short and sweet.
3. Some teachers may be calling from an unknown number. If you are unable to receive unknown numbers on your phone, please communicate this to your child's teacher.
4. Zoom video and or Google Meet sessions also count for student attendance. If your child is attending these sessions, they may not receive as many phone calls from their teacher.

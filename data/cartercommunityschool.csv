This fall Carter Community Charter School plans on opening under the “Moderate Social Distancing” plan which will decrease the total number of people in the school daily by 50%. Students that opt into the in-school option will be assigned either A week or B week. This means that when students assigned to A week are physically in the building, students on B week will be learning remotely. The next week the 2 groups will flip-flop. The school is preparing the building to be COVID ready and will be communicating the safety procedures and protocols.

We understand that many parents are very concerned and would rather opt into 100% remote learning to keep their child home. If you choose that option for your child please apply to our ""Falcon Virtual Academy.’ Further details will be discussed at our July 22nd Zoom parent meeting.

IXL is aligned with state standards. Teachers can easily find unlimited practice questions specifically tailored to each required standard. This allows teachers to tailor lessons for individual students as remediation, intervention or acceleration. Mr. Lyons finds the key to the success of the program on student outcomes is CONSISTENCY!! Teachers must include usage in their daily schedule, teachers must monitor student usages, and teachers must motivate students to use it.

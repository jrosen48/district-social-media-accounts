While our school is mourning the loss of an exceptional teacher and person, our students are mourning the loss of a person no less than their mother. The death of Mrs. Nola Manis has had a sad impact upon administrators, faculty members, staff, students, and the school as a whole. She was of the Baptist faith and served in the ministry with her husband Jerry for 39 years. She enjoyed spending time with her grandchildren, being a school teacher for over twenty-eight years, watching movies, influencing and touching people’s lives. Nola was caring, compassionate, thoughtful and loving.

Goodbye is the hardest thing to say to someone who meant the world to us, especially when goodbye isn’t what we want to say.
Mrs. Manis, we will miss you.

Yesterday evening we lost a true warrior for Christ, beloved friend, teacher and Carthage ISD great, Nola Manis. Mrs. Manis has mentored many students as well as staff members during her time in Carthage ISD. She was known most for her loving spirit, her kind nature and uncanny ability to help students understand science. It is with a heavy heart this morning that we share this news of such a great loss to our school, community and body of believers. Details of arrangements and celebration of life will come in the following days. In the mean time, please pray for the bereaved family.

My deepest condolences to her many friends, colleagues, and family members.

Sherry Parker is the Government and Economics teacher at Carthage High School and has been with the district for seven years. Mrs. Parker attended advanced Google Training to attain Level 2 Google certification this summer.

“Going remote after spring break taught me that I needed to improve the quality of my online curriculum to better reach my students,” Mrs. Parker shared. “This summer I have built my Google site to host all of my coursework, created multiple virtual classrooms, and have recorded several of my Government lectures. I’ve also been reading my book for our upcoming UIL Social Studies competition and preparing for those contests.”

These training sessions and professional development are an asset to our faculty and ultimately benefit our students in a number of ways.

Thank you Mrs. Parker for your hard work this summer and for all you do for our students!",2020-07-07 10:00:01,,

Our food distribution starts tomorrow 10:00 to 11:30. You can pick up food on the east side of three building sites – Columbian, junior high, and high school. Kids or adults can pick up food. We prefer kids be with the adults but we understand it might not be possible. The volunteers will ask the adults for the kids’ names to verify our lunch counts. Please contact Central Office at 359-7000 if you have questions or problems regarding food distribution.

Teachers are finalizing third quarter grades. You might receive contact from your teachers regarding your grades. However, all grades should soon be posted on the parent portal.

We are still working through a lot of what ifs. Unfortunately, there are too many scenarios, too many options, and not enough time to work through everything. We will continue addressing situations as answers are available.

The investigation regarding two guns found on the high school campus has led to the discovery the guns had been thrown out of a vehicle by a suspect several days ago. Video footage confirmed the suspect threw the guns from his vehicle and left school property. This incident is completely unrelated to Carthage High School or any student. At this time, Carthage Police Department personnel believe the firearms were stolen from other jurisdictions and the investigation is ongoing.

I hope everyone understands how much work and effort our local agencies and school personnel used during this investigation. Carthage Police, Carthage Fire, and Jasper County Sheriff departments all contributed to solving this incident in a timely manner. District administrators and IT personnel viewed hours of security videos to assist local law enforcement.

Thank you to the community for trusting the district to do what is in our children’s best interest.

There were a few spin-offs early when the freezing drizzle and dropping temperatures occurred. However, since that time, there have been very few issues regarding slick road conditions. I did receive a report regarding a few roads in eastern Jasper County and a few bridges were a little slick. City workers are salting the roads, especially around school areas.

As you head home, you will be surprised if you have not been outside lately as you will have to scrape ice off your windows!

I will drive the roads in the morning determining whether the road conditions warrant school cancellation. However, as of right now, WE WILL HAVE school tomorrow.

One thing I do know is it will be cold. Please bundle up and dress warm. Please contact us if you know someone needing winter clothing. We have partnerships with many generous community members willing to help our children.

Please remember if I must cancel school due to inclement weather, I will do so in multiple formats: Facebook post, robo call to specific phone numbers listed in our student information system, announcement on our district website (www.carthagetigers.org), and on local television and radio stations.

Caruthersville High School and the American Red Cross are hosting an upcoming blood drive.

Please join our lifesaving mission and schedule an appointment today!

Drive Details:
Site: Caruthersville High School
Address: 1708 South Ward Avenue, Caruthersville, MO, 63830
Room Name: gym
Date: Wed Jan 22, 2020
Time: 11:00 AM - 5:00: PM
Blood Program Leader Name: Michelle Johnson

The American Red Cross has a critical need for blood donors. Please come out and donate blood if you are able. We need to meet the needs of our hospitals. Donating Blood at this drive will help fund a scholarship for a Caruthersville High Senior. Thank you Michelle Johnson 573-382-3901

The need for blood is constant and only volunteer donors can fulfill that need for patients in our community. Nationwide, someone needs a unit of blood every 2 to 3 seconds and most of us will need blood in our lifetime.

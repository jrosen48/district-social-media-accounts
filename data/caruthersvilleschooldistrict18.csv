Caruthersville Middle School Rainbows students participated in a Zoom meeting with Christine Nobbe on Tuesday, September 1, 2020. Ms. Nobbe, who is the Director of Gifted Education, for Missouri’s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, will be sponsoring Gifted and Talented Tuesdays throughout the fall semester of 2020.
On the first Tuesday of each month, Ms. Nobbe will be guiding students through Space Exploration Talks. September’s topic was Travel the Universe. Rainbows students, along with other gifted students and educators from all across Missouri, engaged in a comprehensive overview of our solar system during the thirty-minute program. The opening activity was “If you were a space object, what would you be and why?” Our class chatted the following: “We would be Mars because we are marvelous!” “We would be Earth because we are full of life!” “We would be the Sun because we are stars!”
Ms. Nobbe sent links to several videos for students to watch as a follow-up to the program. October’s program will be “Return to the Moon…to stay!”",0.0,"Caruthersville Middle School

If you requested your student's work to be printed, they are ready for pick up! We will be outside and will hand to you so there will be no need to park or get out of your vehicle. You will just drive through the bus drop off lane and we will hand to you. We have copied weeks 1 & 2. Inside the folder you will find a letter with your student's SORA login and password. If you have not requested your student's work, it has NOT been printed and means it cannot be picked up tomorrow. Message us if you would like to request work printed and we will do our best to get it done as soon as possible! This takes hours to complete as students have different schedules and classes. We are wishing everyone a safe and healthy spring and hope to see you all soon!",0.0,"Caruthersville Middle School is with House Carrie.

Try to stay at least two shopping carts away from other customers as much as you can. Wipe down handles of cart with disinfection wipes (most stores offer these). Stay safe.

It’s always our hope that even if the kids don’t fully understand everything that we or their teachers try to teach them that at the very least they walk away knowing that the guys in gear and the big red truck are super cool and that we’re their friends and we’ll be there any time they need us. It’s always a joy getting to mingle with the little ones. Thanks again to everyone that was involved!",2019-10-17 00:35:09,,

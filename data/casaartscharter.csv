Seemed an appropriate song to share this Memorial Day weekend. A song about war and sacrifice from a beautiful place in Eastern Tennessee/Western N.C, not too far from our birthplace.

Pyxus Music covers the Kruger Brothers song Harder Than Steel, one of the many songs of theirs that we love. Recorded from our own little spot on the mountain at the northern tip of the Blue Ridge Mountain range in Pennsylvania.

Thank you to those military members who ensure our freedom. Especially thinking of our special family member, Captain Mark Garner In loving memory of a true American hero, US Army Capt Mark Garner, who gave all.

Greta is a theatre student who has been attending CASA since 9th grade. She comes to CASA from Central Dauphin School District.

At CASA, Greta has been a cast member of the fall play, the spring musical, and the spring play. Outside of CASA, she takes dance classes and spends time with her family and friends.

Greta’s favorite CASA memory is when the art classes go on the CASA Walk in the fall, because she loves to see the leaves changing all around the Capitol building and finds it very peaceful. Her favorite artistic piece she created at CASA was the theatre’s mid-year performance during her junior year.

In the future, Greta will be attending HACC to major in Psychology and minor in Criminal Justice.

Greta says that CASA has taught her to be herself and to always be creative, no matter what. She would like to thank everyone at CASA and says, “Every year I grew and you all helped me. I really appreciate that, and am going to miss CASA so much!”

It’s tough to walk through the halls of our school right now. Some of the art that our students have created is still there, but it’s the ARTISTS who are the spirit that brings our school to life. We are already missing that spirit and we hope that everyone is remaining safe at home. Over the next two weeks, we would love to feature our students sharing their talents from home.

Please feel free to tag us on social media if you have created something that you’d like us to share! We are always proud to show off your work whether it is created in our studios, academic classrooms, or somewhere else!

Take care and be safe!

Azzlynn is a visual art student who has been attending CASA since 9th grade. She comes to CASA from Cumberland Valley SD.

At CASA, Azzlynn was an active member of our technical crew for last year’s spring musical, Hair, and the fall plays, The Crucible and The Complete Works of Shakespeare. Outside of CASA, she is a member of the Student Conservation Association, shows her work at various local art galleries, and works part-time at Michael’s Crafts and in the summer for the DCNR’s PA Outdoor Corps.

Azzlynn’s favorite CASA memories are her daily trips to visit Mrs. Chambers. Her favorite artistic piece she created at CASA is titled, “Mom Made Banana Pancakes.”

In the future, Azzlynn plans on pursuing a career in Art Therapy.

Azzlynn says that CASA has impacted her life by giving her confidence to “become a leader amongst my peers and an advocate for my education.”

November 7th, 2019
Opening Reception: 6:00 - 7:30 PM

The 11th-12th Grade Visual Art Class at Capital Area School for the Arts Charter School (CASA) is proud to present, Garden of Earthly Delights:

Hieronymus Bosch's, The Garden of Earthly Delights, stands as one of the greatest masterpieces of the Renaissance. The triptych is thought to be a warning, but has been subject to scrutiny by critics and historians. In our exhibition, Garden of Earthly Delights, twenty artists have collaborated to create a cohesive body of work that simultaneously borrows and builds on Bosch’s vivid imagery and complexity of symbolic meaning. The works in this exhibition testify to the continuing relevance of Bosch’s appetite for discovery and the fall of man. Join us from 6:00 to 7:30 PM on November 7th for the opening reception.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10156357961261104&id=242864631103,,0.0,"Garden of Earthly Delights

She is a visual art student who has been attending CASA since 9th grade.

At CASA, Helen is an active member of Student Council, National Honor Society, and French Club. She also submits her work to Scholastic’s Art and Writing Competitions. Outside of CASA, she tutors individuals in math, works part-time at Hanna’s Ice Cream Shoppe, and participates in the Vickie’s Angel Walk.

Her favorite artistic piece she created at CASA is the oil pastel entitled, Trash.

In the future, Helen would like to attend a research school to major in Biochemistry and minor in Public Health or Epidemiology. She hopes to someday pursue a career as a researcher of large-scale epidemics and diseases.

Helen says that CASA has impacted her life by providing her with collaborative and artistic skills. She would like to thank her friend, Nadia El-Mourli, who has inspired her to do her best and who makes her day better every morning during Miss Flood’s first period.

TONIGHT @ Whitaker Center Lobby
Beginning at 5:30 prior to CASALive!

In addition to the CASALive! theme of 'Revolutions,' the Upperclassmen Visual Art class created a gallery show in the lobby of The Whitaker Center entitled, 'Visions.' This gallery focuses on the idea of change and how change comes about. Many of the pieces in 'Visions' center around storytelling and the constant strive for utopia, while others focus on dreams and more literal visions. In all, it expresses the lighter side of revolution which can often be overlooked.

The gallery explores a variety of different mediums, including fabric and cotton, paper cut-outs, and sculpture, as a way to express personal and artistic values. At the same time, the group made the show visually consistent by using similar colors and patterns that are representative of a vision.

'Visions' acts as an introduction for 'Revolutions,' but displays the outcome of one; in a way, we come full circle.

At CASA, Nathan participates in the Music Theory Club. Outside of CASA, he participates in guitar lessons at the Pollock Center.

In the future, Nathan will be interning at Rock Lititz Studio and plans to attend Berklee College of Music.

Nathan says that CASA has impacted his life by helping him find his family and become happy with himself and his life. He says, “You’ve all helped me spread love through my music and that love has spread more love like a domino effect. For that, I am grateful.”

At CASA, Grace takes a variety of courses, and has created art pieces for various scenes for CASA’s Integrated Arts. Outside of CASA, Grace actively participates in dance classes.

Grace said two of her favorite memories at CASA were participating in CASALive! and travelling to Europe with our school. Her favorite artistic piece she created at CASA was the six people she painted with mylar over them. That piece is currently featured in the front staircase at CASA.

In the future, Grace would like to attend Penn State University to pursue a Bachelor’s Degree, and possibly a Master’s Degree.

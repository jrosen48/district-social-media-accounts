**SANTIAM FIRE UPDATE Thursday AM (9/10)**

No changes have been made to evacuation levels in Marion County.

We recognize there has been some confusion with alerts received on cell phones and evacuation level information.

Cascade Families,

This week, we welcomed the staff back into our school buildings. They have spent the week learning and developing our new online curriculum, creating lessons, and planning for a virtual classroom experience. I have been so inspired by the way our staff is leaning on one another and working hard to make sure distance learning works for every student. I can not wait to see their creativity in action when the school year begins.

There have been a number of questions surrounding students coming into the school buildings during distance learning. The Oregon Department of Education’s Ready Schools, Safe Learners guidance outlines the details of how and when schools can provide limited in-person instruction. The district is currently working on a plan to offer limited in-person instruction and we are hopeful that we will begin that instruction on October 5. Between now and then, we will evaluate every student. Based on the evaluation, some students may come in regularly and other students may come in less often. Limited in-person instruction will be optional and students who do not feel comfortable coming into school buildings will not be required to do so. We will share more information about how this will work as we get farther into September. Our goal at Cascade will be to bring in as many students as we can as often as we can while still following the guidelines.

Our meal service will begin at the start of the school year, on September 8. Cascade School District is offering meal pickup from 12:00-1:15 at Turner, Aumsville, and Cloverdale Elementary schools. Students on free or reduced lunch can pick up a free lunch with a grab-and-go breakfast included. This is limited to one meal per student per day. Students who are not on free or reduced lunch can still purchase a meal at any elementary school location if they would like to. Students do not need to be present to receive a meal. The state has updated the requirements to qualify for free or reduced lunch. Any household up to 300% above the poverty line qualifies for free or reduced lunch. We encourage you to complete the meal application form and return it to your students’ school office. If you are unsure if you qualify, please visit the Oregon Department of Education website.

We are continuing to get questions about technology resources. Due to high demand, we temporarily disabled our Access to Technology survey so that our technology department can process requests. We will open that survey back up as soon as possible. If you have already completed the survey, you will hear from your students’ school early next week. We will only be able to provide a maximum of two Chromebooks per household at this time. Unfortunately, the shipment of Chromebooks we ordered in early June is now on backorder until October. We plan to distribute these Chromebooks as soon as they arrive. We are working on a solution to this issue right now.

I encourage you to visit our Return to School 2020-21 webpage (https://bit.ly/32wwJ6w) for more information about the upcoming school year. If you have not done so already, please log in to the Parent Portal (https://bit.ly/TylerSIS) and register your student for school. Registering your student as soon as possible will assist our staff with planning for the year. If you are still unsure if you want to register here at Cascade School District, please contact your building administrator and talk with them about any concerns you have. I believe that the education we provide this fall will be the best option because our staff from Kindergarten to 12th grade is outstanding and will connect with your student in a meaningful way.

Thank you for your patience and flexibility. We want the entire transition to online learning to go as smoothly as possible, but we also know that there may be glitches along the way. Please keep an open line of communication and reach out to me or your students’ school if you run into an issue. We will work hard to find a solution and we are going to make this school year the best we possibly can.

Sincerely,

Cascade Families,

I want to share more information about Comprehensive Distance Learning (CDL) and what it will look like for our students.

CDL is an educational model with consistent teacher connections. Teachers will be teaching live lessons every day. At the elementary level, these lessons will include math, reading, writing, science, social and emotional learning, art, music, and physical education. You can check out a sample elementary attached to this post.

At the secondary level, students will have multiple classes every day with a live lesson in each one. Sample secondary schedules are attached.

Students will be expected to log in to lessons every day. On the rare occasion that students can not join a daily lesson, the content will be recorded. Please plan on discussing this with your students’ teachers and administrators.

Attendance will be taken every day during CDL. A student is marked present for the day if he/she attends a live lesson, communicates with the teacher or staff via phone or email, or a student turns in a completed assignment. At the secondary level, attendance will be taken every day in every class.

With CDL, there will be opportunities to bring small groups of students into the school buildings for extra help. The details of this limited in-person education are still being finalized by the state and we will make a plan once we receive more guidance.

Earlier this week, I shared some information about the differences between CDL and Cascade’s Online model. If you’ve registered for the 2020-21 school year, you will be receiving an email asking if you would like your student to start the year with CDL or our online model. We recommend enrolling in our CDL plan at the start of the school year to have access to all of our teachers and staff. When the time comes to transition to in-person learning, CDL students who do not feel comfortable returning to school can switch to our online school.

Paper packets will not be an option for primary learning. Teachers may use paper materials to supplement their lessons. Technology resources will be available for students in both CDL and Cascade’s Online model. Our technology staff is reaching out to families who have responded to our Access to Technology survey. We plan on providing Chromebooks and assistance with internet access to every family who needs help.

Please visit the Return to School 2020-21 Section (https://bit.ly/3g1rn7M) on our website for more information about CDL, Cascade’s Online Model, and our Operational Plans for the upcoming school year. Next week, your students’ principals will share more information about the start of the school year and provide opportunities for questions.

Thank you for your patience and flexibility.

Sincerely,

Darin Drill, Superintendent Cascade School District",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3419709631427047&id=151729158225127,,0.0,"Información en español: https://bit.ly/2E7TchK

Dear Cascade Families,

At the August 10 School Board meeting, we shared our Operational Blueprint for the 2020-21 school year. Our plan will start with all students in Comprehensive Distance Learning (CDL) and will move to in-person education should state and county metrics allow our schools to re-open. Our hope is that we can meet these metrics by the middle of October. We will also be providing an online learning option throughout the entire school year for those families who are considering keeping their children home.

The first step is registering your students for the 2020-21 school year. Please do so as soon as possible. If you have registered, you will receive an email next week asking if you would like to enroll your student in our CDL model or our online school. We know our teachers and staff are what makes our district work so well. We recommend enrolling in our CDL plan at the start of the school year to have access to all of our teachers and staff. When the time comes to transition to in-person learning, CDL students who do not feel comfortable returning to school can switch to our online school.

The attached graphic explains the differences between CDL and Cascade’s Online School.

To sum things up, CDL is an online educational program focused on teachers consistently connecting with students and families. This will be different from what we experienced this spring. CDL will include live instruction and access to teachers. There will be opportunities for small groups of students to come to school buildings for extra help. This option is likely the best choice for families who plan to send their students to schools when they open to in-person education.

Meanwhile, our Cascade Online option is a curriculum designed for online education where students can work at their own pace or on their own schedule. This option is likely the best choice for families who are sure they are going to educate your student online the entire school year.

When we meet the state and county health metrics and students return to our school buildings, all students in the CDL model will have the option to transition to Cascade Online if families are uncomfortable sending their student to in-person schooling. Students who start the school year in Cascade Online will only be able to transition to CDL or in-person schooling at the end of a trimester.

We will have technology resources available for students who enroll in CDL and our online model. If you have not done so, please make sure to take our Access to Technology survey (https://bit.ly/3gE32pZ).

Instruction for both CDL and our online school begins on September 8, 2020. The School Board approved the updated school-year calendar at their August 10 meeting. The updated school calendar can be found here. (https://bit.ly/newcal202021) Cascade School District and your child's school will provide more details as we get closer to the beginning of the school year.

We will continue to actively work on addressing concerns, assessing the health and safety status, and providing any necessary training for our teachers, staff, and administrators. We are compiling a list of “Frequently Asked Questions” and we will share it when it is finalized. Please regularly check the COVID-19 Hub on our website for updates and if you have any questions.

Thank you again for all you do to support your student(s) and our school district!

Cascade Families,

Our students, families, and staff deserve as much certainty and stability as possible in an uncertain time. We also know that both Marion County and the state of Oregon are currently not meeting the lower rate of new coronavirus infections to safely return students to buildings under the updated state guidelines. This leads to an important update for the return to learning this fall. Our plan for the upcoming school year is, to begin with, Comprehensive Distance Learning (CDL).

Comprehensive Distance Learning

This version of CDL will look a lot different than what we experienced this previous spring. This is a completely virtual school experience with a curriculum designed for online learning. Cascade staff members and teachers will help facilitate this online program and will be available to students who need help. This online option will be more robust than what we experienced in the spring with a consistent connection to instructors and more training for our staff members. To help us finalize our plan for CDL, please take a moment to fill our Access to Technology Survey so we can ensure every student gets the resources they need to be successful.

We will share our official CDL plan on our website by August 15. Please make sure to check out the COVID-19 Hub on our website for information about the start of the school year and other resources.

We are also planning to push the start of the school year for students to Tuesday, September 8, 2020. The Cascade School District Board will need to approve this change on August 10. This extra week will give us time to train staff on our CDL plan and ensure they can provide the best possible education for our students.

Assuming that we can meet the state and county health metrics at some point, the first possible dates that we could return to an in-person learning model would be the week of October 19 - 23, 2020. This will be approximately at the halfway point of our trimester calendar. We will provide all families with information about transitioning to in-person schooling as we get closer to those dates.

Our students receiving special education services or English language development support will be taught by our specialists using virtual tools where possible. We are looking at multiple means of supporting our students with differing learning needs, and updated information will be available by the end of August.

Online Learning

We will be providing an online learning option throughout the entire school year for those families who are considering keeping their children home. There are many options out there, however, we believe that the program we will be offering will deliver the excellent education our district is known for. This curriculum is specifically designed for online learning with access to Cascade teachers and staff to help facilitate the program. Any students that choose Cascade’s online model will still be able to be a part of activities and athletics when they become available during the school year.

Registration

Returning students in all grade levels can register online for the new school year. Please register your students by August 21. We encourage all families to register online if possible.

Parents, simply login to the Parent Portal and complete your student’s registration. If you are unsure of how to register your student online, please take a moment to watch the following video.

We will have in-person registration available for new students or families without internet access. New students will need to bring their immunization records and proof of age. If you are new to the district and do not feel comfortable registering in person, please call your student’s school to make alternate arrangements.

In-person registration for our elementary schools is August 11 and 12. COVID guidelines will apply. Listed below are the available times.

Cloverdale Elementary: Appointment only, please call the school office (503-749-8050) to schedule an appointment
Turner Elementary: August 11 from 11 AM - 7 PM and August 12 from 7:30 AM - 3 PM
Aumsville Elementary: 7:30 AM - 3:30 PM on both days

In-person registration for junior high and high school students is the week of August 17th. Families must make an appointment to register in-person. COVID guidelines will apply. To register, please call the following number:

Junior High: 503-749-8030
High School: 503-749-8020

Please note that staff will not be in the office until August 10th.

Students at the Cascade Opportunity Center will also register the week of August 17th. Staff will be reaching out to students and families to schedule appointments.

Athletics Updates

On August 5, the Oregon School Activities Association (OSAA) announced an update to the athletics and activities calendar for the 2020-21 school year. The full release by OSAA can be found here.

The OSAA’s new calendar includes three distinct seasons: traditional Winter activities will take place in January and February, followed by Fall activities in March and April, with Spring activities occurring in May and June. Each season will feature a 7-week regular season, with adjusted contest limitations, followed by an OSAA Culminating Week. Specific plans for culminating week events will be developed in the coming months.

This also means that fall youth camps and sports will be postponed. Youth football plans are set and can be found here. Please check the Cascade Athletics website for any athletics updates.

Thank you for your understanding and grace as we navigate the challenges of returning to learning in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. We continue to plan and prepare for the day that we will be able to welcome students safely back to school buildings. Online or on-site, Cascade School District will continue to provide the best education and care we can for all of our students.

Sincerely,

The OSAA’s new calendar includes three distinct seasons: traditional Winter activities will take place in January and February, followed by Fall activities in March and April, with Spring activities occurring in May and June. Each season will feature a 7-week regular season, with adjusted contest limitations, followed by an OSAA Culminating Week. Specific plans for culminating week events will be developed in the coming months.

This also means that fall youth camps and sports will be postponed. Youth football plans are set and can be found here. Please check the Cascade Athletics website for any athletics updates.

Thank you for your understanding and grace as we navigate the challenges of returning to learning in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. We continue to plan and prepare for the day that we will be able to welcome students safely back to school buildings. Online or on-site, Cascade School District will continue to provide the best education and care we can for all of our students.

Sincerely,

Darin Drill, Superintendent Cascade School District",2020-08-07 19:45:52,,

Cascade Families,

Yesterday, Oregon Governor Kate Brown announced a new set of metrics (https://bit.ly/2ExtuDq) that will determine when schools can safely reopen their buildings to return to in-person learning. These metrics apply to both everyday schooling as well as hybrid education.

This is not the news we were hoping to share today. We recognize the important role schools play in the lives of our students, families, and our community. Our staff had been looking forward to solving the unique challenges we’re facing to work directly with students in our classrooms. We are hopeful that the opportunity will still happen this fall. The safety and wellbeing of our students and staff is our priority. We know we can provide high-quality education to every student through the learning models we can provide at this time.

What I can share with you today is the following:

1) As of today, July 29, 2020, it is likely that we will start all grades and all classes in a Comprehensive Distance Learning model. Almost every public and private school in the state will have to start school this way based on the Governor and Oregon Health Authority’s health metrics.

2) Cascade School District will review updated state and county health metrics early next week and will provide you with a final decision on August 7, 2020, about how schools will open. Between now and then, I would begin making arrangements for students to be learning from home for the first part of the school year.

3) Regardless of how we start the school year, the first day of classes will likely begin on Tuesday, September 8, 2020, the day after Labor Day. The Cascade School District Board will need to approve this change at their August meeting. This extra week will give all staff time to receive additional training.

4) While it seems likely that we will start this school year online, Cascade School District will monitor the state and county health metrics weekly and move to in-person instruction as soon as we can.

5) Assuming that we can meet the state and county health metrics at some point, the first possible dates that we could return to an in-person learning model would be the week of October 19 - 23, 2020. This will be approximately at the halfway point of our trimester calendar. We will provide all families with information about this possible transition as we get closer to those dates.

6) If you have a student that will be in Kindergarten through 3rd grade this year, the state and county health metrics are less strict for these students to attend classes in person. When Marion County meets these metrics, we will be able to bring K-3rd grade students in as soon as it is feasible. This may mean that we could get these students into in-person classes before October 19- 23, 2020. Please keep checking your email, our website, and our social media sites for updates on this.

7) Cascade School District will continue to provide a comprehensive online school model for the entire 2020-21 school year for any families that feel safer learning from home. For students that choose Cascade’s online model, they will be able to be a part of activities and athletics when they become available during the school year.

Please check back frequently over the next few weeks. Plans can be changed right away due to updates we receive from the state agencies. We will do our best to review state-level changes and get you updated changes as soon as we can.

Thank you for your patience as we get started with a very unusual year. I am asking every family to please give grace and flexibility to each other, the teachers and educators in every school building, and to all staff here at Cascade as we work together to make the best of this difficult situation.

Sincerely,

Dear Parents and Guardians,

Thank you for your quick reply to the Parent Survey! It was helpful to get a sense of the general trends in family preferences as we continue to plan and prepare. We completely understand that some parents are not yet able to decide or may change their thinking as things are evolving so quickly.

The district is developing a comprehensive plan to support students’ well-being and academic progress while protecting students and staff from the spread of COVID-19. While the detailed plan is not final, and there are still many unknowns, we want to share the overall framework to help families start planning for the year ahead.

We will have in-person instruction Monday-Friday for all K-8 students. Our high school students will attend school on an A/B schedule. Again, the details of these plans are not final yet, but our survey (https://bit.ly/305wIGx) showed overwhelming support for in-person instruction, and we feel this is the best way to provide quality education for all our students at this time. Our in-person instruction will follow the guidance set by the Oregon Department of Education and will look different than prior school years. We appreciate your grace and patience as we work to support every student and family.

For our families who are unsure or uncertain about sending students to school in-person, we will be rolling out our Cascade School District Online Program. This is a completely virtual school experience with a curriculum designed for online learning. Cascade staff members and teachers will help facilitate this online program and will be available to students who need help. This online option will be more robust than what we experienced in the spring with a consistent connection to instructors and more training for our staff members.

We hope that by having both an in-person and an online option, we will be able to meet the needs of all of our students and families.

Please also note that at any point, the Governor or the Oregon Department of Education can determine that in-person schooling is no longer safe. At that point, we will transition all of our students to our Cascade School District Online Program. We are working on putting a transition plan together in the event of a shutdown from state officials.

With all these potential changes, our staff will need additional training to prepare for the fall. It is likely that we will push the start of the school year back to September 8 in order to properly prepare our staff. We can not make this decision official until it is reviewed by our staff and approved by our school board. After the August 10 board meeting, we will immediately announce a change to the calendar if the school board agrees.

The Oregon Department of Education requires an Operational Blueprint to reopen schools. It will provide specifics about how we at Cascade will reopen while keeping our students and staff safe. Again this needs to go through our school board, but it will be available for public viewing on our website after the August 10 board meeting.

I know you have questions. We will do our best to answer every question, so keep an eye out for upcoming Q&A sessions and other forums after we unveil our Operational Blueprint.

Thank you for your patience and understanding. We look forward to sharing more with you as we finalize our plan for Fall 2020.

Cascade Families,

Last week the Oregon Department of Education released this guidance (https://bit.ly/37C1TeT) outlining how to open our schools in the fall in the safest manner possible. Please keep in mind, this is just the first set of guidance. We are expecting updated guidance on June 30th as well as more clarity as the summer continues. We will revise our plans as necessary.

There is so much information in this initial guidance and we are currently analyzing and assessing what this means for the Cascade School District right now. One thing is certain, we will keep you updated as plans develop and provide opportunities for feedback as we progress. Please keep checking your email as we will be sending out a survey in the next couple of weeks.

A few important highlights of the guidance (though this is far from all of it!):

Face coverings are required for some of our staff who come into close contact with students and are recommended for all staff.

Face coverings are not recommended or required for students younger than 6th grade.

Face coverings are recommended for students in 6th - 12th grade, but not required.

Physical distancing of up to 6 ft or 35 square feet per student in space is required. (We will need to calculate what this means for our class sizes and the number of students we can have in a building at one time.)

We will need to stagger where students enter and exit the building and keep track of who’s coming in and out.

Playgrounds will be open to students during the school day (limited groups at a time) and sanitized between use.

We will need to keep student groups together (such as classes) to the extent possible.

We will need to work with our health department in the event of a case or an outbreak.

Our main goal is and will continue to be getting every student into the classroom. If you are uncomfortable with the plans we create, we will do everything in our power to meet you at your level and find a solution that works best for you and your student(s).

Just like we did in the spring, we will get through this together! Please know that, throughout our planning, we will always keep in mind that our schools must continue to be warm, caring communities, even with these new rules.

Thank you for your continued patience and grace as we work through this together with our students’ best interests in our hearts.

Cascade Families,

Last week the Oregon Department of Education released this guidance (https://bit.ly/37C1TeT) outlining how to open our schools in the fall in the safest manner possible. Please keep in mind, this is just the first set of guidance. We are expecting updated guidance on June 30th as well as more clarity as the summer continues. We will revise our plans as necessary.

There is so much information in this initial guidance and we are currently analyzing and assessing what this means for the Cascade School District right now. One thing is certain, we will keep you updated as plans develop and provide opportunities for feedback as we progress. Please keep checking your email as we will be sending out a survey in the next couple of weeks.

A few important highlights of the guidance (though this is far from all of it!):

Face coverings are required for some of our staff who come into close contact with students and are recommended for all staff.

Face coverings are not recommended or required for students younger than 6th grade.

Face coverings are recommended for students in 6th - 12th grade, but not required.

Physical distancing of up to 6 ft or 35 square feet per student in space is required. (We will need to calculate what this means for our class sizes and the number of students we can have in a building at one time.)

We will need to stagger where students enter and exit the building and keep track of who’s coming in and out.

Playgrounds will be open to students during the school day (limited groups at a time) and sanitized between use.

We will need to keep student groups together (such as classes) to the extent possible.

We will need to work with our health department in the event of a case or an outbreak.

Our main goal is and will continue to be getting every student into the classroom. If you are uncomfortable with the plans we create, we will do everything in our power to meet you at your level and find a solution that works best for you and your student(s).

Just like we did in the spring, we will get through this together! Please know that, throughout our planning, we will always keep in mind that our schools must continue to be warm, caring communities, even with these new rules.

Thank you for your continued patience and grace as we work through this together with our students’ best interests in our hearts.

GOOD-BYES ARE NEVER FUN NOR EASY!

This year we say good-bye to a staff member who has been around for a very long time. John Schmotzer has been with the Cascade School District for 39 years and has decided to retire. He spent his first couple years at North Santiam Elementary then moved to Aumsville Elementary when it closed. When Aumsville moved its 5th graders to Turner Elementary, Mr. Schmotzer moved with them. He returned to Aumsville when the primary building was opened to continue teaching 5th grade. Finally, Mr. Schmotzer has spent the last 9 years teaching 6th grade at the junior high. He has spent 41 total years in education. He jokingly says that this coming fall will be the first time he has not started a school year, as a student or teacher, since first grade. That's a lot of school starts.

We wish him all the best in the new chapter in his life! We will miss you around here, John!!!",0.0,"Thank you Mr. Schmotzer for your years at Cascade. You've touched the lives of so many. Enjoy your retirement!

Cascade Families,

Congratulations on reaching the end of the school year. I am so proud of each and every one of you for your flexibility and resilience during this crazy time. Our teachers and staff members have shown a tremendous amount of the creativity these last few months. I am especially proud of our students for adapting and adjusting to this situation and working hard to finish the school year.

Today, June 9, is our last day serving meals at our elementary school locations. Thank you to our lunch staff for serving our families these last few months. I am so grateful for your hard work and I know our community appreciated the time you put in.

The state has started a new program called the Pandemic-EBT (P-EBT). This gives extra grocery money to families with children on free or reduced meals. For each month that school is closed and you are eligible, you will get $5.70 per day for each of your children at a K-12 school. There are three ways your family can receive the benefit. One, if you already get SNAP, the extra money will be automatically loaded on your Oregon Trail EBT card. Two, if you do not have SNAP, but already qualify for free or reduced school meals, a new EBT card will be automatically mailed to you with instructions. Three, you can apply for free or reduced meals on the Oregon Department of Education Website. You will automatically be given Pandemic EBT benefits starting the month you’re approved for either free school meals or SNAP. Immigration status does not matter for Pandemic EBT. Many families will automatically get Pandemic EBT. You can learn more about eligibility or how to receive the benefit at oregonhunger.org/covid-19 or by calling 2-1-1.

With this school year coming to a close, we are planning for the transition into 2020-2021. We are preparing for several possible scenarios for returning to school, including heading back to schools and classrooms with moderate social distancing requirements; a hybrid of classroom and remote learning instruction; or fully remote learning. We expect initial guidance from the Oregon Department of Education within the next week. Keep an eye out as we will connect with families to solicit feedback about distance learning and what we may be able to do to improve education in the fall in order to come up with a plan that works best for our community. No matter what the next school year looks like, we will deliver excellent education because that is what we do in this district.

Again, thank you for sticking with us. Have a wonderful and relaxing summer. Stay safe and stay healthy.

Cascade Families,

I want to communicate some final updates as we wrap up this school year.

We will celebrate the Class of 2020 on June 5 and 6. The celebration includes a parade through Aumsville and Turner beginning at 4 pm on Saturday. The parade will begin and end at Cascade High School. Turn by turn directions can be found here (https://bit.ly/2MnjpK3). We hope to see you along the parade route but remember to please adhere to social distancing guidelines.

We will begin summer school next week at the secondary level. Staff will be reaching out to students and families to make a plan for summer school education. We are still determining if and when we will be able to safely have summer school for our elementary students. We will relay that information to you as soon as possible. Our outdoor athletic facilities will be closed until at least June 15. Coaches will be reaching out to athletes to make a plan for summer training.

Please return your Chromebooks to our schools on June 5, June 8, and June 9. Elementary Chromebooks can be returned to the schools from 11-1 on June 5 and 8 or by appointment on June 9. Secondary staff will be reaching out to families regarding the times for Chromebook returns. We need all Chromebooks to be returned even if your student is participating in summer school. Chromebooks will be cleaned and re-checked out to students who need the technology to access summer school.

We will not be serving meals tomorrow, June 3, at our elementary school locations. Students received additional meals for tomorrow during today’s lunch pick-up. Our meal distribution will resume on Thursday, June 4. We apologize for the inconvenience. Remember, the final day for meal distribution is June 9.

As we wind down this school year, we are already preparing for the transition into 2020-2021.

Possible scenarios include heading back to schools and classrooms with moderate social distancing requirements; a hybrid of classroom and remote learning instruction; or fully remote learning. While we do not know what the year will look like, I can guarantee we will have the best plan in place for every scenario. I can also guarantee you that no matter what next school year looks like, we will deliver excellent education because that is what we do in this district.

We are also working on a plan for summer programs and activities. In the past, our facilities have been used for summer school, summer camps, and summer workouts for athletics. We are working with staff to determine a way to still have some of these summer programs while keeping everyone safe and adhering to Oregon Health Authority guidelines. We will have that information for you as soon as possible.

With the end of the school year approaching, there are a few dates to keep in mind. Our final packet pickup will be June 1. Those packets will need to be returned Friday, June 5. This will allow materials to sit the required 48 hours over the weekend and give our staff time to grade materials before the final day of school on June 9. On Monday, June 8, we will have fun summer activities and supplemental materials available at packet pickup. These will be optional activities for your students.

We will collect Chromebooks on June 5, June 8, and June 9. Elementary Chromebooks can be returned to the schools from 11-1 on June 5 and 8 or by appointment on June 9. Secondary staff will be reaching out to families regarding the times for Chromebook returns.

We will be celebrating our senior class on Friday and Saturday, June 5 and 6. Seniors will get a chance to walk across the stage with select family members and friends present. Late Saturday afternoon there will be a graduate parade through Aumsville and Turner where our whole community can celebrate the senior class. Our junior high staff will celebrate the eighth-grade class on June 8. Our elementary schools have planned celebrations for their fifth-grade and kindergarten classes. Please contact your students’ schools or teachers for more information.

Again, thank you for your patience as we navigate this ever-changing situation. Let’s finish the year strong.

One is to introduce and train staff in the most effective teaching strategies available; and the other is the AVID elective, where students apply to be part of a program that seeks to prepare students for college and career readiness. Integral to the class is writing, inquiry, collaboration, organization, and reading skills, known as WICOR. Central to Cascade's program is community service and experiential education. Cascade just graduated its first AVID class. Collectively the class completed over 4,500 hours of community service and thus far, earned $486,000 in scholarships.

Cascade Families,

We are in the final stretch of the school year with just three weeks left until summer. While we are still awaiting further guidance from the Oregon Department of Education, the district is already thinking about what the start of the next school year will look like. We don’t yet know if the start of the school year will be face-to-face, online, or a combination of both, but we will have the best plan in place for every scenario. I can also guarantee you that no matter what next school year looks like, we will deliver excellent education because that is what we do in this district. We will continue to do what is best for students and families and we will share information about the return to school as it becomes available.

As we head into these final weeks, there are some dates I’d like you to keep in mind. Next Monday, May 25, is Memorial Day, so we will have packet-handout and distance learning materials available on Tuesday, May 26. Packet pickup times and locations will remain the same. Our final packet pickup will be June 1. Those packets will need to be returned Friday, June 5. This will allow materials to sit the required 48 hours over the weekend and give our staff time to grade materials before the final day of school on June 9. On Monday, June 8, we will have fun summer activities and supplemental materials available at packet pickup. These will be optional activities for your students.

We will collect Chromebooks on June 5, June 8, and June 9. Elementary Chromebooks can be returned to the schools from 11-1 on June 5 and 8 or by appointment on June 9. Secondary staff will be reaching out to families regarding the times for Chromebook returns.

We will continue serving meals through June 9. The state has also started a new program called the Pandemic-EBT (P-EBT). This gives extra grocery money to families with children on free or reduced meals. For each month that school is closed and you are eligible, you will get $5.70 per day for each of your children at a K-12 school. There are three ways your family can receive the benefit. One, if you already get SNAP, the extra money will be automatically loaded on your Oregon Trail EBT card. Two, If you do not have SNAP, but already qualify for free or reduced school meals, a new EBT card will be automatically mailed to you with instructions. Three, you can apply for free or reduced meals on the Oregon Department of Education Website. You will automatically be given Pandemic EBT benefits starting the month you’re approved for either free school meals or SNAP. Immigration status does not matter for Pandemic EBT. Many families will automatically get Pandemic EBT. You can learn more about eligibility or how to receive the benefit at oregonhunger.org/covid-19 or by calling 2-1-1.

We will be celebrating our senior class on Friday and Saturday, June 5 and 6. Seniors will sign up for a time-slot to walk across the stage on June 5 or 6. This will be a chance for them to take pictures and celebrate with family and friends. Saturday afternoon there will be a graduate parade through Aumsville and Turner where our whole community can celebrate the senior class. I would like to thank Matt Thatcher and his staff for finding a creative way to honor the class of 2020.

Again, I have been so impressed with our parents, students, and staff for the resiliency and creativity they have shown during this time. Thank you for your patience. Let’s finish the year strong.

Cascade Families,

I want to start by acknowledging the resiliency of our students. It has been almost two months since things have drastically shifted. For students, that was an immediate change in their routine, their relationships, and their education. I have heard stories from parents and seen photos of students of all ages adapting to this new environment. I am so proud of every student for working hard to adjust to the unknown and to the parents, thank you for working hard for your students to help this transition go as smooth as possible.

I’d also like to recognize our staff. I’ve been so impressed with the creativity they’ve shown to deliver education and help families through this time. From Star Wars themed packet handouts to parades through town to simply calling students to check-in, their hard work has not gone unnoticed and I am truly grateful for our incredible staff.

This week, our high school staff will begin forecasting for next year. Students should receive a Google form from a staff member regarding signing up for next year’s classes. Please have your student contact his/her counselor if you do not receive a form by next week. Junior high students will begin forecasting in the next few weeks, so stay tuned for information from the junior high staff.

We are beginning to register incoming kindergarten students for the next school year. If you have a student who will be five on or before September 1, 2020, your child is eligible to start kindergarten in the fall. A staff member from your child’s school will be reaching out with specific kindergarten registration information. If you do not hear from your child’s school, please contact Shelly Baughman at Cloverdale Elementary, Molly Hunsaker at Turner Elementary or Jill Johnson at Aumsville Elementary.

We are waiting for guidance from the Oregon Department of Education (ODE) regarding summer school and summer camps. We expect to have these regulations in the next few days and will relay this information to you as soon as we can. We have also started planning for a return to our classrooms in the fall and we have begun developing alternative plans in case the start of school looks different. We will make decisions for our district based on what ODE mandates and what we feel works best to meet the needs of our students and staff. We will share this information with you as soon as we can.

I’d like to reiterate that we are here to help. ODE and our district have acknowledged that students must have their basic needs met first in order to be able to access their potential to learn. These needs include food, housing, safety, a sense of belonging, and relationships. We have resources to help you and your family, so please do not hesitate to reach out to our staff or visit our website (https://bit.ly/CSDHealthWellness).

Again, thank you, families, for your patience and support. We are in this together, so please reach out if you need anything. Stay safe and stay healthy.

Sincerely,

We are beginning to register incoming kindergarten students for the next school year. If you have a student who will be five on or before September 1, 2020, your child is eligible to start kindergarten in the fall. A staff member from your child’s school will be reaching out with specific kindergarten registration information. If you do not hear from your child’s school, please contact Shelly Baughman at Cloverdale Elementary, Molly Hunsaker at Turner Elementary or Jill Johnson at Aumsville Elementary.

We are waiting for guidance from the Oregon Department of Education (ODE) regarding summer school and summer camps. We expect to have these regulations in the next few days and will relay this information to you as soon as we can. We have also started planning for a return to our classrooms in the fall and we have begun developing alternative plans in case the start of school looks different. We will make decisions for our district based on what ODE mandates and what we feel works best to meet the needs of our students and staff. We will share this information with you as soon as we can.

I’d like to reiterate that we are here to help. ODE and our district have acknowledged that students must have their basic needs met first in order to be able to access their potential to learn. These needs include food, housing, safety, a sense of belonging, and relationships. We have resources to help you and your family, so please do not hesitate to reach out to our staff or visit our website (https://bit.ly/CSDHealthWellness).

Again, thank you, families, for your patience and support. We are in this together, so please reach out if you need anything. Stay safe and stay healthy.

Sincerely,

More Census Information for those who use a PO BOX!

Everyone who lives in a place where there is no mail delivery and they must go to the post office to collect their mail should not go online and fill out the census until they receive the census packet. They will start delivering to those homes Monday morning. We call this Update Leave (UL). We had started UL before the state shut down over COVID-19 and we've just been given permission to start it up again.

In keeping with COVID-19 social distancing best practices, Census employees will be provided face masks, gloves and hand sanitizer for use while dropping off packets in Update Leave areas. Employees have also been instructed to not knock or ring the doorbell, but instead will simply leave the packet on the doorstep of the residence. Each packet contains:

Cascade Families,

I’d like to start by thanking our teachers and nurses. May 4-8 is Teacher and Nurse Appreciation Week. Whether serving in person or remotely, I know these staff members care deeply about every student. Thank you, staff, for everything you do for your students and families.

As of now, Oregon Governor Kate Brown has mandated that Oregon schools remain closed until June 30. We are waiting for guidance from the Oregon Department of Education (ODE) regarding summer school and re-opening in the fall. We have started planning for a return to our classrooms and we’ve also begun developing alternative plans in case the start of school looks different. We will make decisions for our district based on what ODE mandates and what we feel works best to meet the needs of our students and staff. We will share this information with you as soon as we can.

ODE and our district have acknowledged that students must have their basic needs met first in order to be able to access their potential to learn. These needs include food, housing, safety, a sense of belonging, and relationships. We have resources to help you and your family, so please do not hesitate to reach out to our staff or visit our website (https://bit.ly/CSDHealthWellness).

We had another record-breaking day of meal distribution on Monday. We served 2,046 meals at our elementary locations. Thank you, everyone, for making this possible. We are serving meals Monday-Friday from 12-1 at Aumsville Elementary and 12-12:45 at Turner and Cloverdale Elementaries. Anyone 1-18 can receive lunch and a grab-and-go breakfast for the following morning. Students do not need to be present to receive their meals.

Again, thank you, families, for your patience and support. We are in this together, so please reach out if you need anything. Stay safe and stay healthy.

Thank you for your continued engagement with your student’s learning in this challenging environment. We are still adjusting our distance learning plan to fit what works best for our students. Please do not hesitate to reach out to our staff with feedback and let teachers know if your student needs resources for learning.

We are here to support you whether its food, learning support, or mental health resources. We have had gracious community members donate items for food baskets and our staff is willing and able to help. If there is anything we can do to help you and your family during this time, please do not hesitate to reach out to our staff or visit our website (https://bit.ly/CSDHealthWellness).

We have made an adjustment to the school-year calendar. You may remember that this Thursday and Friday, April 30 and May 1, were scheduled to be non-school days for students. Our plan was to have professional development for teachers and hold the annual AVID showcase. After meeting with our associations, we have decided that distance learning will continue on Thursday and Friday. These will be school days for students and workdays for our employees. This means we will end the school year two days earlier. The final day for students is June 9 and the final day for teachers is June 10. Please adjust your family calendars to reflect this change. The updated calendar can be found here (https://bit.ly/3aKiGvW).

We had another record-high day of meal distribution on Monday. We served 2,034 meals curbside. Thank you again to our staff for making this possible and feeding our community. Families, we will continue this service through the end of the school year, so please continue to utilize it.

Cascade Families,

Yesterday, I had the chance to stop by each elementary school packet pick-up location. I am so impressed with the way our staff has stepped up to make this part of distance learning a positive experience for our students and families. Each school had a fun atmosphere with music, dancing, and camaraderie. Remember, packet pick-up is every Monday from 11-1:30 at each elementary school. You can drop off the previous week’s packets at this time as well. If you have not received this week’s materials yet, they are available on the website (https://bit.ly/CSDDistanceLearning) or you can contact your student’s teachers and they will work something out for you.

We served a record 1,946 meals yesterday and every day our meal service is growing. I am so grateful for our staff that has gone above and beyond to serve our community. Families, I hope you will continue utilizing this service. We are serving meals Monday-Friday from 12-1 at Aumsville Elementary and 12-12:45 at Turner and Cloverdale Elementaries. Anyone 1-18 can receive lunch and a grab-and-go breakfast for the following morning. Students do not need to be present to receive their meals.

I want to remind you that our district facilities are closed to the public at this time. This includes playgrounds, the football stadium, the track and other fields around our schools. Please refrain from using these facilities until we are given guidance that it is safe to do so.

To our seniors and families, you should have already heard from Mr. Thatcher regarding the official postponement of graduation. The good news is the high school staff are working hard to ensure that there will eventually be a great celebration. Whether this celebration is in July, August or even later, we will find a way to celebrate the Class of 2020.

A reminder that this will be my only email this week barring any unforeseen circumstances. In the meantime, feel free to reach out to the district or any school offices with questions. We have staff available to answer phones Monday-Friday from 9-3. To adhere to social distancing guidelines, we are limiting staffing in school offices. Please have patience with our staff and leave a message if you do not get through directly to a staff member. Someone will return your call in a timely fashion. You can also email your questions or concerns to communications@cascade.k12.or.us.

Finally, I am deeply grateful for the grace, empathy, and compassion that has been on display in our district as we work together to support each other through this public health crisis.

Stay safe and stay healthy.

Cascade Families,

Yesterday, I had the chance to stop by each elementary school packet pick-up location. I am so impressed with the way our staff has stepped up to make this part of distance learning a positive experience for our students and families. Each school had a fun atmosphere with music, dancing, and camaraderie. Remember, packet pick-up is every Monday from 11-1:30 at each elementary school. You can drop off the previous week’s packets at this time as well. If you have not received this week’s materials yet, they are available on the website (https://bit.ly/CSDDistanceLearning) or you can contact your student’s teachers and they will work something out for you.

Cascade Families,

We are wrapping up our first week of Distance Learning. Elementary materials can be dropped off on Monday from 11-1:30 at either Cloverdale, Turner or Aumsville Elementary. New packets will be available for pick-up at that time. Junior High packets can be returned at any elementary location from 11-1:30 and new materials will be available. If you have junior high students that need materials in packet form, please contact the school as those packets are put together for individual students depending on their schedule. High school teachers and staff will be reaching out with distance learning materials.

This week, the Oregon Department of Education put out guidance regarding special education. Our district is prioritizing health and wellness and our goal is to provide an equitable education for all students. For more information on distance learning as it pertains to special education, please visit our website (https://bit.ly/COVIDSped).

I want to remind you that our district facilities are closed to the public at this time. This includes playgrounds, the football stadium, the track and other fields around our schools. Please refrain from using these facilities until we are given guidance that it is safe to do so.

We served 6,694 meals this week including a record-high 1,776 meals on Monday. We are serving about 95% of what we would serve during a normal school day. Thank you for utilizing this service. Also, a huge thank you to our staff for preparing and distributing these meals to our families. I am grateful for their hard work and I know our community appreciates it as well.

Cascade Families,

This week we started our Distance Learning for All plan. If you have not received materials for this first week, please reach out to your student’s teacher(s) or school. As we continue with distance learning, I am asking students and families to please have patience as you work to connect and engage with your students’ teachers. Our staff is coming up with new creative ways to educate and it’s a learning process for everyone. Please know we are in this together.

My heart goes out to the senior class. I know this is not how you expected to spend your final year of high school. By now, you should have heard from Mr. Thatcher and Ms. Williams about graduation requirements. They are doing everything in their power to get seniors to the finish line. Please reach out if you have any questions or concerns about graduation requirements.

In honor of the class of 2020, stadium lights across America are being turned on at 8:20 pm, that’s 20:20 military time. Our stadium lights will be on for 20 minutes every Wednesday night until June 3rd. Hopefully, this beacon of light will help our community reflect on the amazing accomplishments of the senior class.

Our meal service has grown week by week. Yesterday, April 13, we served a record 1,776 meals. This is 95% of what we do on a normal school day across our district. Thank you for utilizing this service. Also, a huge thank you to our staff for preparing and distributing these meals to our families. I am grateful for their hard work and I know our community appreciates it as well. Meals are available for pickup from 12-1 at Aumsville Elementary and 12-12:45 at Turner and Cloverdale Elementaries. Anyone 1-18 can receive lunch and a grab-and-go breakfast for the following morning. Students do not need to be present to receive their meals.

As we continue to provide meals and learning materials, we are in need of face masks for our staff to help ensure the safety of our staff, students and families. If you have face masks or can make face masks that you would be willing to donate, we would greatly appreciate it. Masks can be dropped off at the elementary schools during meal pickup times. Drop off is also available from 9-3 at the district office on the secondary campus. Many of you have already donated masks and we are so grateful for your willingness to help out.

As we move forward, we will continue to update our website (https://bit.ly/2WPFCXm) with information and resources. I encourage you to check it out. Stay safe and healthy and please reach out with any questions or concerns.

Cascade Families,

As you know we are moving forward with Distance Learning through the remainder of the school year. We will have new materials available each Monday. Your student’s teacher(s) will be reaching out with more information on distance learning. You can pick up elementary materials on Mondays from 11-1:30 at Turner, Aumsville or Cloverdale Elementary. Junior High materials will be available at each elementary school. High School teachers will be in touch with students to distribute materials. Packets can then be returned to teachers via email or there will be a packet drop-off box each Monday as well. As we move forward with distance learning, we will be regularly evaluating our education plans and will adjust as necessary. We appreciate your partnership and support in promoting your student’s well-being and continued learning.

When it comes to technology, our administrative staff is in the process of identifying the needs of our students. Due to our limited resources, we will be prioritizing the need for a computer in this order:

Seniors
High School Students Receiving Special Services
Kindergarten – 8th Grade Students Receiving Special Services
9th – 11th Grade Students
Kindergarten – 8th Grade Students

If a computer is checked out, families will need to have access to an internet connection. Unfortunately, the district is unable to provide connectivity. If your family already has a device, the district is asking you to help others by allowing families that do not have a device to have this accessibility. Regrettably, the district is only able to provide one device per family based on the criteria above. As per the Department of Education, students can also do paper packets and both ways of learning are acceptable. If you have additional questions, please contact your building principal.

We served 5,064 meals just this week. Our meal distribution is growing every week. I can not thank the staff enough for helping with meals and keeping our students fed. Remember, we are offering meals at all three elementary schools. You can pick up breakfast and lunch Monday-Friday from 12-1 at Aumsville Elementary and from 12-12:45 at Turner and Cloverdale Elementaries. Anyone 1-18 can receive lunch and a grab-and-go breakfast for the following morning. Students do not need to be present to receive their meals.

While we continue to provide meals and learning materials, the CDC has put out new guidance regarding face masks and we are asking for some help from the community. We are in need of face masks for our staff to help ensure the safety of our staff, students and families. If you have face masks or can make face masks that you would be willing to donate, we would greatly appreciate it. Masks can be dropped off at the elementary schools during meal pickup times. Drop off is also available from 9-3 at the district office on the secondary campus. Many of you have already donated masks and we are so grateful for your willingness to help out.

Our district and schools will continue to communicate and engage with you as we move forward. We will get through this together, as a community. Thank you for your continued grace and support.

Cascade Families,

As you know we are moving forward with Distance Learning through the remainder of the school year. We will have new materials available each Monday. Your student’s teacher(s) will be reaching out with more information on distance learning. You can pick up elementary materials on Mondays from 11-1:30 at Turner, Aumsville or Cloverdale Elementary. Junior High materials will be available at each elementary school. High School teachers will be in touch with students to distribute materials. Packets can then be returned to teachers via email or there will be a packet drop-off box each Monday as well. As we move forward with distance learning, we will be regularly evaluating our education plans and will adjust as necessary. We appreciate your partnership and support in promoting your student’s well-being and continued learning.

When it comes to technology, our administrative staff is in the process of identifying the needs of our students. Due to our limited resources, we will be prioritizing the need for a computer in this order:

Seniors
High School Students Receiving Special Services
Kindergarten – 8th Grade Students Receiving Special Services
9th – 11th Grade Students
Kindergarten – 8th Grade Students

If a computer is checked out, families will need to have access to an internet connection. Unfortunately, the district is unable to provide connectivity. If your family already has a device, the district is asking you to help others by allowing families that do not have a device to have this accessibility. Regrettably, the district is only able to provide one device per family based on the criteria above. As per the Department of Education, students can also do paper packets and both ways of learning are acceptable. If you have additional questions, please contact your building principal.

We served 5,064 meals just this week. Our meal distribution is growing every week. I can not thank the staff enough for helping with meals and keeping our students fed. Remember, we are offering meals at all three elementary schools. You can pick up breakfast and lunch Monday-Friday from 12-1 at Aumsville Elementary and from 12-12:45 at Turner and Cloverdale Elementaries. Anyone 1-18 can receive lunch and a grab-and-go breakfast for the following morning. Students do not need to be present to receive their meals.

Cascade Families,

I’m writing to share some important news. Today, Governor Kate Brown made the decision to close schools for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year. The extended closure is an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 and keep our community safe and healthy. During this closure extension, all school facilities will remain closed, however, student learning will continue, albeit in the new remote learning world.

I hoped that we would be able to welcome students back to school this year. Our staff members love seeing and serving your children at school! Instead, we will be focusing all of our effort on making remote learning the best it can be whether through packet or online format.

We understand that the continued closure of schools presents many challenges for students and families. It also raises many questions. We will continue to share further guidance as decisions are made and as information becomes available.

We will continue serving meals throughout the rest of the school year. Students can pick up a meal Monday-Friday at Cloverdale, Turner, and Aumsville Elementary. Due to a high volume, we are extending Aumsville’s meal pick-up time to 12-1. Cloverdale and Turner are also extending their meal pick-up time to 12-12:45. Anyone 1-18 can receive lunch and a grab-and-go breakfast for the following morning. Students do not need to be present to receive their meals.

To our seniors, Gov. Brown also announced a plan surrounding graduation requirements. We are still digging into her recommendations but wanted to let you know that this will not impact seniors’ ability to graduate on time. Mr. Thatcher will be reaching out to you with more specifics on the plan for seniors for the rest of the school year. We expect to receive guidance from the Oregon Department of Education regarding credits for freshmen through juniors within the next week. We will relay that information to you as soon as we can.

We know that we are dealing with a never-seen-before health crisis that challenges us all--as parents, educators, and caregivers--to lead in the face of uncertainty and deliver education in new ways. I believe that if families, community partners, and schools work together, we will emerge as a stronger public school system. We will continue to be stronger together.

Cascade Families,

First of all, I want to thank you for your patience and support over these last few weeks. We are continuing to roll with the punches and trying to make the best possible decisions for the information we have at the time.

On April 6, we shared our supplemental education materials. These resources are available on the district website (https://bit.ly/CSDSupplemental). Packets were also available during Monday’s meal pickup. If you still need to pick up a packet, please call your student’s school to make arrangements.

Beginning April 13, we will be shifting gears to our Distance Learning for All plan. Our staff is working to deliver leveled curriculum, track and monitor student progress, assess student work, support student mental health and continue a personal relationship with every student. All of these education materials will be provided in online and packet format. Those materials will be emailed to families, available on the website and accessible during meal pickup. We will have more specific dates and times of packet distribution in the next few days.

We will continue serving meals at Cloverdale, Turner, and Aumsville Elementary. Due to a high volume, we are extending Aumsville’s meal pick-up time to 12-1. Cloverdale and Turner are also extending their meal pick-up time to 12-12:45. Anyone 1-18 can receive lunch and a grab-and-go breakfast for the following morning. Students do not need to be present to receive their meals.

If you need additional assistance, the Cascade Service Integration Team (SIT) has created a Mobile SIT. They can assist anyone with their basic needs or who has compromised immunity. The team can deliver food, household items, and pick up prescriptions all free of charge. You can contact them for services via email (sitmobile@santiamhospital.org) or by phone at 503-409-3652.

While we continue to provide meals and learning materials, the CDC has put out new guidance regarding face masks and we are asking for some help from the community. We are in need of face masks for our staff to help ensure the safety of our staff, students and families. If you have face masks or can make face masks that you would be willing to donate, we would greatly appreciate it. Masks can be dropped off at the elementary schools during meal pickup times. Drop off will also be available from 9-3 at the district office on the secondary campus.

Finally, I want to thank our teachers and staff members for the hard work they have put in to come up with lesson plans, distribute meals and check-in with families. This is not easy and I am proud of the creativity they have shown as we adjust to this new way of teaching and learning.

Stay safe and stay healthy.

Cascade Families,

We are excited to begin offering supplemental education tools on Monday, April 6. Supplemental education is resources to help your students retain skills they have already learned and to prevent regression. Supplemental materials will be available on our website (https://bit.ly/2WPFCXm). Elementary supplemental materials can also be picked up during that school’s meal pick-up. Junior High supplemental materials will be available at all of our meal pick-up locations. The high school has opted to focus directly on Distance Learning which will start April 13. Teachers may also be contacting you with supplemental resources.

After our supplemental education rolls out, we will quickly pivot to our Distance Learning for All plan beginning April 13. The Oregon Department of Education rolled out Distance Learning for All guidance this past Monday. Districts will now be required to deliver leveled curriculum, track and monitor student progress, assess student work, support student mental health and continue a personal relationship with every student. While this task provides a new challenge, our staff is already working on creative ways to provide this education to your student(s) and I have no doubt they will rise to the occasion. Some of our staff members have already reached out to students and families, and you should expect to hear from the rest of your student’s teachers within the next week. All of the educational materials will be available online and in packet form. More information will follow regarding the distribution of these materials.

In my opinion, one of the most significant disruptions is for our seniors. I know kids look forward to all of the experiences, competitions, and celebrations of senior year. It is hard for all of us to think about the impact COVID-19 is having on our students and families and the loss of the defining moments of senior year.

The Oregon Department of Education has stated that hopefully by April 10 they will provide updated graduation requirements that take into account input from a number of organizations to ensure that stakeholders, including higher education and the business community, recognize the value of high school diplomas earned during this time of unparalleled challenge.

We are continuing to serve meals at Cloverdale, Turner and Aumsville Elementaries, Monday-Friday from 12-12:30. Anyone 1-18 can receive lunch and a grab-and-go breakfast for the following morning. Students do not need to be present to receive their meals. Over the last three weeks, the district has served 8,955 meals. Many thanks to all of our food service employees and those helping with meals during this tough time. Today we witnessed how much our community cares with signs and cards in the meal line. We appreciate all of your support.

Thank you for your patience and understanding as we move into this new way of teaching and learning.

Cascade Families,

Last night, the Oregon Department of Education issued new guidance for schools that include shifting from supplemental education to distance learning for all. Oregon Schools are now required to provide more substantive, graded, potentially credit-bearing distance education for all students. We expect more details from the state on credit delivery over the next few days.

This shift by the state from ‘supplemental education’ to ‘graded’ is what our students deserve. It gives us a pathway that we did not previously have to provide credit for the work they do now, and through the current school year. This plan will give our youngest learners the skills and encouragement they need to advance and supports all learners with the teaching and learning they need to be successful. We are still waiting on the Department of Education’s guidelines around graduating seniors and we will share that guidance with you as soon as it is available.

Now, with new state direction, our teachers have the ability to do what they do best—connect with every student; be allowed to report on progress and provide official grades.

Oregon’s Distance Learning for All effort, while it will present challenges, allows us flexibility from the state to continue teaching and learning during this closure. It also draws on our core value to know every student by name, strength, and needs – no matter the challenge at hand.

As of now, our administration team and the teaching staff at each school will be working to figure out a “distance learning for all” plan that works for our district, our students and the resources we have available. Our “distance learning for all” plan will include online resources and packet material that will advance the grade-level curriculum and be required for a grade. It will also include check-ins from our staff. We will follow up with more guidance for you in the next few days.

As for the supplemental material, we still plan on having those resources available to you and your student on April 6. Those are optional activities for your student(s) to do in the meantime. Our “distance learning for all” materials will be available on April 13.

We will be here to support you, and your student(s), as we embark on this journey, together. Thank you for your strength, your compassion, and your ongoing efforts on behalf of our students.

Cascade Families,

Last night, the Oregon Department of Education issued new guidance for schools that include shifting from supplemental education to distance learning for all. Oregon Schools are now required to provide more substantive, graded, potentially credit-bearing distance education for all students. We expect more details from the state on credit delivery over the next few days.

This shift by the state from ‘supplemental education’ to ‘graded’ is what our students deserve. It gives us a pathway that we did not previously have to provide credit for the work they do now, and through the current school year. This plan will give our youngest learners the skills and encouragement they need to advance and supports all learners with the teaching and learning they need to be successful. We are still waiting on the Department of Education’s guidelines around graduating seniors and we will share that guidance with you as soon as it is available.

Now, with new state direction, our teachers have the ability to do what they do best—connect with every student; be allowed to report on progress and provide official grades.

It has been two weeks since Governor Brown’s order to cancel large gatherings to limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Since that time, we have experienced a school cancelation through March 31, and last week the cancelation was extended through April 28.

Our staff will be returning to work beginning on March 30. Most of our staff will be working remotely and the few employees who do come in the buildings will follow strict social distancing guidelines. Our staff will be putting together supplemental learning materials for students. These materials will be available to families beginning April 6. The goal is to provide students and families with some easy-to-implement activities to prevent regression and learning loss during an extended break. If you haven’t already, please take the time to fill our Home Technology Survey. This survey will help the district determine how best to provide educational support resources to our families.

In the coming days, we expect to receive information from the Oregon Department of Education about graduation requirements for seniors and we will relay this information to our seniors and families as soon as we can.

We will continue serving breakfast and lunch. Over the last two weeks, we’ve served 1,097 meals at Turner Elementary and 2,259 meals at Aumsville Elementary. Beginning March 30, we will be adding Cloverdale Elementary as a meal pickup location. Anyone ages 1-18 can pick up breakfast and lunch at any elementary school location from 12-12:30. Look for the orange tents outside of those schools, and there, you will find our staff handing out meals. Students no longer need to be present to receive a meal.

Finally, I want to encourage you to check our website where we’ve created a COVID-19 section (https://bit.ly/2WPFCXm). Here you will find resources for you and your student as well as regular updates from the district.

As the spread of COVID-19 continues, it is more important than ever to stay vigilant with social distancing and good hygiene. Please continue to do your part to keep our community safe. The following are some updates for Cascade families.

Governor Kate Brown issued Executive Order 20-12, directing everyone in Oregon to stay at home to the maximum extent possible and adding to the list of businesses that will be temporarily closed to stem the spread of COVID-19 in Oregon. The order is effective immediately and remains in effect until ended by the governor.

What does this mean for Cascade families? Essential services that are still allowed include our curbside, meal pickup at Turner and Aumsville Elementary. We are serving breakfast and lunch to anyone ages 1-18 from 12-12:30 at both locations. Look for the orange tents outside of those schools, and there, you will find our staff handing out meals. Please remember that the Oregon Department of Education does require the child to be present to receive a meal.

We will be sending out a survey to our families by Wednesday afternoon to find out more about your home technology resources. Please check your email for this survey. We will use this information to assess options and evaluate how to provide supplemental educational resources to our students. Turner families, this survey was already sent home to you, so you will not receive that email this week. This survey will also be available on our website.

Next week, our staff will be putting together supplemental education plans for students which will be available beginning April 6. Supplemental plans may include both packet and online resources for students. The goal is to provide students and families with some easy-to-implement activities to prevent regression and learning loss during an extended break.

To our senior class, we recognize that this global pandemic is disrupting your final months of high school. We are so sorry—it feels sad and unfair that events and milestones you have worked so hard for and were looking forward to are being postponed, canceled, or not celebrated in a group setting. We are actively working with the Oregon Department of Education to determine what needs to be done to help you complete your diploma requirements and they are very close to providing us with guidelines. We will keep you informed as we learn more. Our priority is helping you reach your goals for graduation, and we will get through this together.

Yesterday, Cascade High School held its first Veterans Appreciation luncheon. Current and former military members spent first, second and third period with our students.

Students were divided into mall groups giving our students and visitors a chance for conversation.

After third period, the veterans and high school staff enjoyed a meal together in the cafeteria. Our manufacturing classes made beautiful metal flags to give to each of our guests.

Thank you to everyone who made this even possible including: Ursula Bischoff, Mike Sowles, Lisa Iverson, John Iverson, Dawn Brandtjen, Alexandria Greenwell, Justin Lowde, Tom Ptacek, Tim Ganfield, Tyler Woodrall, Matt Thatcher, David Schletty, David Medlock, Matt McBeth, Deb Bellmore, Tina and Robin and all our students for being so respectful towards our visitors.

Allie Greenwell ('12), DOB for Cascade School District is this week's #MusicEducatorMonday Feature!

Favorite OMB memory
My favorite memory (though it didn’t seem great at the time) will always be Dr. Wiltshire sitting me down my freshman year when I wanted to quit and convincing me to stay in the band. I wanted to be a member of the Oregon Marching Band from the time I was a freshman in high school, and it was my dream to be drum major someday, but I was miserable and homesick during that first month. The moral I took from our discussion was that if I leave, I close the door to any future adventures, friendships, and leadership positions in the band. Quitting just means the end, while staying would only mean possibilities.

What lesson did you take from OMB that still applies to your life?
I think the lesson that has influenced me in my life and career the most is that leadership is service. As drum major, a teacher, etc. - it’s not about you. Being a leader isn’t about the glory or credit or receiving thanks. It’s about giving back to your band members (students) and being there for them when they need help, teaching, setting the example, and doing whatever you can behind the scenes so that anyone “under” you has a good time, learns things, and is comfortable. As a teacher,

What 2 pieces of advice would you give to a current student interested in pursuing a similar career?
You are going to be a great teacher. I didn’t hear those words enough as a student and I doubted myself well into starting my career, but if you believe it, you will be it. I’m telling you now that if you want this and you know that you will be great, you can do it. Take all of those lessons and values that you were taught which inspired you to be a part of this profession and wear them as a cape like the superhero that you WILL be.

Also... it gets better. Whenever you feel down, exhausted, not good enough, whatever - just repeat after me: It. Gets. Better.",0.0,"Congratulations Ms. Greenwell!!!

Last night in coordination with the Cascade School District, Aumsville and Turner Police Departments, deputies identified a 13 year old juvenile as the person responsible for making a threat directed at Cascade Middle School via social media. The juvenile was determined to have no access to any weapons and stated the post was a ""joke"".

Deputies are working closely with the parents of the child to include referring the charge of disorderly conduct to the Marion County Juvenile Department. The Sheriff's Office understands how stressful these types of incidents can be to our community. To help ease this stress deputies and officers from Aumsville and Turner will have a presence on the Cascade campus throughout the day.

The Sheriff's Office would like to thank all of our community partners for helping us identify the person responsible quickly. This incident is an example that can be used by parents to educate their children that, no threat is a joke. The Sheriff's Office encourages all parents to monitor your child's social media accounts closely to ensure they are not engaging in behavior that could have life altering effects.",6.0,"From Marion County Sheriff's Office

Late Tuesday afternoon, we received notice that due to algae blooms in the Detroit reservoir the City of Salem’s water should not be consumed by children ages 5 and under. At the direction of the Oregon Health Authority, this applies to children age 5 and under as well as anyone who is pregnant, nursing, receiving dialysis, or immunocompromised.

In an effort to be overly cautious, we will not be allowing any students or staff to drink the water at Turner Elementary until the city verifies our water is clean again. Additionally, school meals will be prepared with bottled water.

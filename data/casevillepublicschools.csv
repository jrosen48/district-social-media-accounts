A couple of days ago, I said I had a big announcement. Well here it is. Over the span of two days on July 28-29, Bad Axe High School will be hosting a showcase for senior spring sports athletes from Bad Axe, Caseville, Cass City, Harbor Beach, Lakers, North Huron, Owen-Gage, Ubly and USA. This will include baseball, softball, soccer, tennis and track. It is very important to note that this is for seniors only mostly due to eligibility issues.

🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 We have great news!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩

Caseville Community Food Pantry will be partnering with Caseville United Methodist Church and many private donors to sponsor a POP UP PANTRY in CASEVILLE!!

DATE: Wednesday May 13, 2020
LOCATION: Caseville Public School
TIME: Starting no later than 11:00 a.m.

Here are some useful tips to make food delivery easy and to adhere to physical distancing protocols.
➡️ Line up Northbound on VINE Street
➡️Arrive at least 1 or 2 hours before start time
➡️Have your trunk or hatch cleaned out and with container or boxes for food to be put in.

Please share this information with anyone in need of food assistance.

Keep in mind there is also a POP UP PANTRY every Saturday at Laker's Elementary and Monday's in Port Austin. We hope that ours in Caseville helps fill the gap for anyone who can't make it to either of these other PANTRY events.

🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 We have great news!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩

Caseville Community Food Pantry will be partnering with Caseville United Methodist Church and many private donors to sponsor a POP UP PANTRY in CASEVILLE!!

DATE: Wednesday May 13, 2020
LOCATION: Caseville Public School
TIME: Starting no later than 11:00 a.m.

Here are some useful tips to make food delivery easy and to adhere to physical distancing protocols.
➡️ Line up Northbound on VINE Street
➡️Arrive at least 1 or 2 hours before start time
➡️Have your trunk or hatch cleaned out and with container or boxes for food to be put in.

Please share this information with anyone in need of food assistance.

Keep in mind there is also a POP UP PANTRY every Saturday at Laker's Elementary and Monday's in Port Austin. We hope that ours in Caseville helps fill the gap for anyone who can't make it to either of these other PANTRY events.

We have it on very good authority that THE EASTER BUNNY 🐰 is coming to CASEVILLE!!

Thursday April 16 around 6 pm!
The Easter Bunny will be coming through the streets of Caseville sharing joy and happiness (and I hear he has a lot of treats too)!

The Easter Bunny and his wonderful helpers will be dropping of goodies to the kids in their yards!

Because The Easter Bunny wants us all to be safe during this health crisis, he wants you to stay on your porch or by your house and let his helpers do the work !

You won’t want to miss this - and you probably won’t because The Easter Bunny will be riding on a Fire Truck 🚒!! How cool is that?!

Thank you Easter Bunny for coming to Caseville and bringing some happiness into our lives!",14.0,"Caseville Community Food Pantry

The weather was less than favorable too! Sun, clouds, wind, snow and sleet all made an appearance today. 🌞☁️🌬❄️🌨🌤 #PureMichigan

Our volunteers were amazing and they worked so hard to make sure the line moved at a good pace. 🦸🏻‍♀️🦸🏼

We made several deliveries to home bound individuals too and they were very happy for our help. 🚗🚚

Special thanks to Kurt E Damrow, Braun Builders, Caseville Public School and their amazing teachers and staff, our pantry volunteers, Caseville Police and Fire Department, DJ’s Portable Toilets and the many folks that showed up to lend a hand.

We want to make sure that the Caseville student families that didn’t get served last week come out tomorrow.

And that those that did get served last week return on April 3.

We want to make sure all families have an opportunity to get served and if we rotate them we should be getting everyone covered.

The words are hard to find at this moment because Thank You just seems too simple to express how we feel right now.

With the help of school teachers, Superintendent Ken Ewald and local citizens, we served more than 170 individuals from 70 households within Caseville, Caseville Township, Lake township and Caseville School families!

We plan to follow this format for the coming weeks.

If you know of someone that needs home delivery, please contact the Caseville United Methodist Church at 989-856-4009.

The words are hard to find at this moment because Thank You just seems too simple to express how we feel right now.

With the help of school teachers, Superintendent Ken Ewald and local citizens, we served more than 170 individuals from 70 households within Caseville, Caseville Township, Lake township and Caseville School families!

We plan to follow this format for the coming weeks.

If you know of someone that needs home delivery, please contact the Caseville United Methodist Church at 989-856-4009.

Again, thank you.",2020-03-26 13:51:16,,

Delivery service can be arranged for those who are home bound or do not have transportation to the pantry.

As a reminder, we serve residents of Caseville, Caseville Township and Lake Township. Proof of residency in the form of a Driver's License or State issued ID is required as well as information regarding family income.

Middle School students will still need funds to cover a meal the day of their field trip so permission slip money turned in will be given to the student to cover their meal. If you would prefer a refund instead, please call the school and we will refund what you have paid.

Elementary students will be refunded any payments made.

We have it on very good authority that THE EASTER BUNNY 🐰 is coming to CASEVILLE!!

Thursday April 16 around 6 pm!
The Easter Bunny will be coming through the streets of Caseville sharing joy and happiness (and I hear he has a lot of treats too)!

The Easter Bunny and his wonderful helpers will be dropping of goodies to the kids in their yards!

Because The Easter Bunny wants us all to be safe during this health crisis, he wants you to stay on your porch or by your house and let his helpers do the work !

You won’t want to miss this - and you probably won’t because The Easter Bunny will be riding on a Fire Truck 🚒!! How cool is that?!

Thank you Easter Bunny for coming to Caseville and bringing some happiness into our lives!",14.0,"Caseville Community Food Pantry

We got off to a late start but quickly made up time with the help of Braun Builders and their SkyTrak!

The weather was less than favorable too! Sun, clouds, wind, snow and sleet all made an appearance today. 🌞☁️🌬❄️🌨🌤 #PureMichigan

Our volunteers were amazing and they worked so hard to make sure the line moved at a good pace. 🦸🏻‍♀️🦸🏼

We made several deliveries to home bound individuals too and they were very happy for our help. 🚗🚚

Special thanks to Kurt E Damrow, Braun Builders, Caseville Public School and their amazing teachers and staff, our pantry volunteers, Caseville Police and Fire Department, DJ’s Portable Toilets and the many folks that showed up to lend a hand. This couldn’t have happened without you. 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕

The words are hard to find at this moment because Thank You just seems too simple to express how we feel right now.

With the help of school teachers, Superintendent Ken Ewald and local citizens, we served more than 170 individuals from 70 households within Caseville, Caseville Township, Lake township and Caseville School families!

We plan to follow this format for the coming weeks.

If you know of someone that needs home delivery, please contact the Caseville United Methodist Church at 989-856-4009.

Again, thank you.",2020-03-20 18:44:02,,

We are working closely with Caseville Public School to bring in those families that need food and meal assistance while school is closed as well as acquiring food from them that would otherwise go unused.

Quick Quarantine Class | Mindful Sounds Dance| Cleveland Arts and Social Sciences Academy",0.0,"Hi families,
This exercise is to teach and encourage students to think intentionally about sounds and how they can influence emotion, or help them remain present while completing tasks. It is also great to practice choreographing short movement phrases. Message me on Dojo or tag me on TikTok @ms.smith.from.cassa with photos/videos of your mindful sound dance!

Mandalas can be found in nature:
Snowflakes, Flowers, Cobwebs, and in Tree Rings.
Look outside for natural materials.
Make Sure To Look For a Variety of Objects.
Group Them by Object.

Color with Mrs. Thomas Today! You can use coloring book pages or draw your own pictures on a black sheet of paper and color.

The benefits of coloring pages: 1) Self expression - coloring on a blank ""canvas"" (piece of paper), is a way for children and adults alike to express themselves. You can tell a lot about the way a person is feeling by the images that they draw, the colors that they use, etc.

The humming bird illustration is one of my personal artworks that I used a blank canvas to draw and color using ink and color pencils.

It's funny when things come full circle, isn't it? Underneath the new play equipment at Clisbee Park, which was picked out by our Sam Adam's Elementary students, is the old Cassoplis Union School (1878-1951). It seems as if they dug a huge hole and buried as much of the building as they could. Our DPW crew even dug up an old stove! Many thanks to our wonderful DPW crew for battling the bricks and our awesome students and school staff for working with the Village on this special project, we are so excited to see it come to life!!

My plans after high school are to attend SMC to major in computer science and then transfer to a university to complete my bachelor's degree, or masters if i decide to go longer. Along with computer science, I plan on taking a second major in Art.

I am most proud of attaining high grades throughout my high school career.

My favorite school moment(s) was spending time with the friends that I made throughout the years.

In 10 years, I see myself financially well and have a good career in a field like cyber security or programming, along with having a hobby for drawing/painting and doing a side career where I work for different businesses from time to time doing artwork .",,,0.0,"Senior Spotlight: Christopher Harding

My plans after high school are to attend a four year university with the hope of receiving a degree in Kinesiology.

The accomplishment I'm most proud of is keeping my GPA above a 3.7 for my whole high-school career.

I plan on moving to Grand Rapids, MI to attend Kendall College of Art and design where I will major in illustration.

The accomplishment I'm most proud of is being the senior drum major of our marching band for the season of 2019-2020. It was an honor to lead such a talented marching band.

I can't simply choose a favorite school moment, as there are so many to remember and appreciate. My favorite moments are only made to be my favorites because of the people I spent them with. I will never forget the lunches spent with friends, all of the crazy things that happen at band camp, or the interesting conversations and lessons I've had with teachers.

I usually don't like to look too far ahead into the future, but if I have to picture myself anywhere in ten years, I'd picture myself happy. I hope my career as an illustrator fulfills me and is truly enjoyable. I'd love to hopefully own a home and be able to work as a freelance illustrator if I choose to. Most importantly I hope to have fun and spend time with the people I love and care about.",,,0.0,"Senior Spotlight: Megan Evans

A simple game in which players ask, “Captain, may I….” to take a certain number and type of steps towards the “Captain”.

To Play:

Identify one person to be the “Captain”. This person will call out the commands to the group.

The Captain stands facing away from the line of players and selects a player at random. The Captain calls out a direction with a specific number of steps.

The player then responds with “Captain, may I?” The Captain then respond with yes or no, to which the player obeys and takes the directed action. If the player forgets to ask, “Captain, may I?” then the player must go back to the beginning of the line.

Examples of commands: Take 8 steps forward and…
Hop like a bunny, kangaroo or frog
Move like a giant
Only use your right or left foot
Hop using both feet

The first player to reach the Captain wins and becomes the new Captain.",,,0.0,"Fun game to play: Captain, May I?

Active involvement in the growing and harvesting of their food can help kids develop more positive attitudes towards fresh fruits and vegetables, allowing them to better recognize preferences and increase their willingness to try new foods.

Hey Ranger Band fans!

In case you haven't heard the super great news, your Cassopolis 8th Grade and Senior High Bands both scored straight Division I (Superior) ratings at District VI MSBOA Festival!

*This means they received Ones from all three stage judges, AND the sight-reading judge!

Of course, this moment marks the incredible progress of our instrumental music program, and a killer year! We're incredibly proud of our students!

Furthermore, I believe very firmly these results reflect the culture we've built here---chiefly our willingness to look critically within, confront a problem, and move forward with a plan. The real work begins and continues with our students!

As promised (Mr.Keck lost a bet), the 2020 show announcement is IMMINENT, and the 8th grade band will be receiving rather silly t-shirts in the near future!

Our 36th Annual Teacher Tribute was scheduled for today, April 23rd. Just because the event had been postponed, doesn't mean we can't recognize the honorees who were scheduled to be celebrated:

Congratulations to the honorees from the Castaic School District:

Castaic Elementary - Kim Potter
Castaic Middle - Karla de Lemos
Live Oak Elementary - Jolie McDonald
Northlake Hills - Jennifer Cohen

We look forward to celebrating with you later this year!

We also thought it was fitting that we are halfway done with this journey on National Stand-Up To Bullying Day! During our stop in Castaic we were able to visit Castaic Middle School PAC. The students were so attentive and asked great questions. We also ate lunch at a local taco truck with one of the coolest principals we have been able to meet. In our 48 hours here we were also able to make it out to a local beach, drive pacific coast highway, stop at an amazing fruit stand, eat in-n-out burger, go to our first pottery class, and of course visit the happiest place on earth - DISNEYLAND!

Today was our “Team Up to Clean Up” event at the Castaic Lake. We’d like to thank our wonderful CES PTA, and especially Jill Amanda Federman, for working so hard to make this event a huge success. Over 120 people from the community came out to pick up trash around the lake! What a great way to demonstrate kindness towards this special recreational area. We had support from Castaic Lake, Friends of Castaic Lake, Starbucks (on Castaic Rd.), Ralphs, and the crew from One Piece at a Time. Thank you! Thanks to everyone who came out to help!

We want to express our deepest condolences to the victims, their families and all those affected by today's tragic events at Saugus High School. We want to assure you that out of an abundance of caution and after consultation with Law Enforcement, we decided to place all of our campuses on lock down. We sincerely appreciate all of your cooperation and support during this challenging time. We know that you want to keep your children safe and that is our top priority as well.

All of our schools will be open tomorrow as regularly scheduled. We will have our school psychologists and counselors available for any students that need support. I have attached a document with some brief talking points and information for parents to assist in talking with your children about violence.

Warm regards,

Steve Doyle

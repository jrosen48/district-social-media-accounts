Home School Supplies Now, Backpacks Later:

Thanks to generous funds raised and matched by Red Canoe, and of course our amazing community of PTO supporters, we've been able to assemble a few take-home school supplies for students in need. The primary and intermediate school offices have these in pencil boxes. Middle school has them stored in the back of the office, and the High School has them in the school counselor's office.

If you supplies, please stop by your school during normal office hours to pick them up. If you need to make arrangements to pick them up outside of office hours, please contact us at castlerockpto@yahoo.com or on our facebook page or call/text Jessica Lakey at (253) 678-1452.

(FYI, Backpacks will be available in school offices when hybrid in-person attendance starts. The supplies you pick up now should be able to stay at home.)",0.0,"Castle Rock PTO

Overall we are very encouraged by the high voter turnout - looks like the best in the county!

Our thanks to everyone that supported our teachers and staff and the quality of education we can offer through the Levy. Seriously, it makes every difference in the everyday experience of our students.

Looks like we need to go back to the drawing board for a way to get our buildings in the same condition to meet the needs of our students.

The levy funds things and staff members that the state doesn’t cover. The money from the state only pays for 3 teachers per grade level at the Primary School.

Dear Parents and Guardians,
We are serious about our students' safety at Castle Rock High School. As a principal, I wanted to make you aware of a situation that occurred today.

We moved quickly to investigate and during our search we did find that a student had a firearm in the student's vehicle. At no time was there any immediate danger to students or staff.

• Students should miss no more than 9 days of school each year to stay engaged, successful and on track to graduation.
• Absences can be a sign that a student is losing interest in school, struggling with school work, dealing with a peer issue or facing some other potentially serious difficulty.
• By 6th grade, absenteeism is one of three signs that a student may drop out of high school.
• By 9th grade, regular and high attendance is a better predictor of graduation rates than 8th grade test scores.

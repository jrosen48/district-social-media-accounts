The Idaho State Board of Education has mandated that schools do a “soft close” until April 20, 2020. This “soft close” means that there are to be no people in school buildings other than essential staff. Castleford School District's Food Service and Transportation Departments will be combining efforts during this time to provide food to our students. There will be two meals delivered via bus route for our students outside of the city limits, while students in town may come to the parking lot kitchen entrance to receive their food.

Busses will leave the school at 9:00 a.m. and should be at your stop sometime between 9:05 and 10:15 a.m. Please have someone at the stop to receive the food. In-town students may pick up their food at the school beginning at 9:15 a.m. These services will begin on Monday, March 30.

Hello Cato-Meridian Friends and Family!

This school closure can bring on lots of different emotions: some of us might be getting bored and stir crazy, some of us might be worried and have questions that no one has the answers to. Others might be grateful for the extra time home with our families while some of us might be ready for a change in scenery!

There is not a right or wrong way to feel while we are self-quarantined and social distancing. Here's some things you and your family can practice to manage your emotional health while you're home.

Also, we have developed ""Care Baskets"" for every student at Cato-Meridian. I want you to know we have taken extreme safety measures to make sure the Care Baskets are safe.

The safety measures include:

*Care Baskets prepared by adults who wore masks and gloves
*Care Baskets populated with candy straight out of the plastic package
*Care Baskets sprayed in a room with hospital grade disinfectant
*Care Baskets (paper bag) made by homeroom teachers two days prior to delivery
*Deliveries made with adults wearing masks
*Practicing six-foot social distancing during delivery

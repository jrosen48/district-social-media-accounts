Hey everyone,
We are excited to announce our weekly challenges!
This week, we are asking families and/or individuals to create a small Fairy or Gnome House! These houses are special to our tiny friends and are made from household natural materials such as twigs, moss, Popsicle sticks, rocks, and etc. In addition to creating these magical homes, we will be featuring your creations at Elsie Holmes during our Enchanted Trail! Take pictures throughout the upcoming weeks of you building your masterpieces and send them to our Facebook to be featured. We will be accepting finished houses during the last week of June and stay updated on Facebook for the date of our future Enchanted Trail!",5.0,"Catoosa County Recreation Department

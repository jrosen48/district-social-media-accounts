Dear Catskill CSD Parent / Guardian,

It was recently brought to my attention that a slanderous hoax was transmitted to students via a social media platform. The post was portrayed to be from the Superintendent of Schools and fictitiously stated that a Special Meeting was scheduled for tomorrow, Thursday, November 14, 2019 to take action on a staff member who was alleged to have acted in a racist manner.

I want our community to know that this post is indeed a hoax and that no such incident took place nor is a Special Meeting scheduled for tomorrow.

In closing, the prankster has been identified and will be held accountable in accordance with the District’s Code of Conduct. Please remind your child to be responsible when using social media. Any threats and / or slanderous material will not be tolerated and individuals who engage in such behavior can face serious consequences. As always, please contact me directly with any additional questions or concerns at (518) 943-4696.

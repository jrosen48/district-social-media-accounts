As the school year comes to an end and our focus moves to summer we regret to inform you that we have decided not to run our Explorers Summer Camp program. We worry about the impact this may have on our families, however the safety of our students and teachers is our top priority. Please know that we did not make this decision lightly and we hope to welcome everyone back to camp the summer of 2021.

Next week (March 30th-April 3rd) we are going to be doing a Virtual Spirit Week. This is a fun way for students and teachers to show their Husky Spirit while being at home.

The process is simple: First dress up according to each day, then take a picture of your child and post it online by tagging Caurus Academy on Facebook or @caurusacademy01 on Instagram. You can also direct message to either account to have your photo posted directly on our pages throughout the day.

Keep this schedule handy so you know what to dress up as or follow our pages to see a daily post on what to dress up as.

We are so excited to see your smiling faces showing us your Husky Spirit from home.

Caurus Academy High School had the pleasure of hosting Flat Kambelle for a day! She went to a bunch of classes like: Speech & Debate, Dual Enrollment English and even Geometry! The best part was going to watch the Huskies in action at the Varsity Boy’s Basketball game!

After her adventures at Caurus, Flat Kambelle was mailed back home to Indiana with a few souvenirs to show her friends in Mrs. Bruch’s class. Thank you Mrs. Bruch for this opportunity!!",2020-02-18 06:53:27,,

I have an update to our opening of in person learning for Tuesday. At this time, we do not have enough staff to safely open and will need to revert to our distance learning model. I understand that this is not what was expected. However, we determined that with the need for safety to be our utmost concern it would be impossible to reach those parameters with the current projected staffing. Teachers that required substitutes will be providing communication about how students will access their work for that day. Teachers that did not require a sub will be holding their regular Zoom classes as they did this week. We will continue to update on Tuesday the situation for the rest of the week with our goal to open safely for our students and staff as soon as possible.

I wanted to let you know that last night, our Governing Board voted to affirm the return date of September 8th to in-person school for the families that had chosen Distance Learning for their students. We are so excited to welcome back our students. This does not change anything for the families who have chosen online learning at the Cave Creek Academy of Excellence or the online learning options at Cactus Shadows High School--those will remain online.

Remember that students will be wearing a cloth mask in their classrooms and to check students daily before school for the list of symptoms in the Logistics Plan on the front of our CCUSD website. If you have any specific questions, please call your school principal. Have a safe and restful Labor Day weekend and thank you for listening.

It is with deep regret that we must pull the option of the voluntary COVID-19 testing by Spector Labs. It has come to our attention that while there is no upfront charge to individuals, Spector Labs would be charging insurance companies. This was not made clear during our discussion with the Lab.

The safety of the community is our foremost concern but we will not place anyone in a position where they must then “negotiate or appeal” the test with their healthcare insurance provider. We cannot guarantee a no cost option.

We are truly sorry for this and will continue to seek out opportunities for the entire CCUSD community to have as much information as possible during time.

All questions and feedback should be made to Caroline Lynch, Director of Human Resources 480-575-2022 or clynch@ccusd93.net.

Hello CCUSD Families. This is Debbi Burdick, Superintendent. What a great first week of school we had! Thank you for all your positive praise for our teachers, patience as some minor glitches were resolved and for assisting your students with our new formats.

As you have probably heard, the AZ Department of Health Services presented their Safely Returning to In-Person Instruction Metrics yesterday.

I wish I had a crystal ball to predict the future metrics, but at this time, we are hoping and planning for returning physically to our classrooms on Sept. 8th. We are all hearing that the metrics are improving. However, if they are still not as they should be in 3 weeks, there is the chance that this date could be moved back further.

Dear CCUSD Families,
It has been a busy week as we are ready to roll out our two learning options for the upcoming school year. Next week, you will receive a communication about the two learning options and how to go about making a choice. For the families that want their children to return to school ""Face to Face"", your students will start on August 5th in Distance Learning and then transition to ""Face to Face"" School currently set to start on August 17th. For those families that want their children to remain online, you will be asked to register for the Cave Creek Academy of Excellence, also to begin on August 5th. Please watch for the communication. If you have questions, please contact your current principal. We continue to add questions and answers to the FAQs on our CCUSD website .(https://www.ccusd93.org/Page/10589)

Dear CCUSD Families,

I know that many of you have had more questions than we have been able to answer. Once again, new information came out today from the Governor. The new Executive Order says that in-person, face-to-face school will be delayed until August 17th. If you heard the press conference, it was also said that that date could possibly be extended depending on the pandemic circumstances.

At this time, we are still considering starting on August 5th with online school to begin learning for our students. As we get more information, we will continue to update you. Thank you for understanding as we try to digest and figure out this latest news and situation.

Our three committees are meeting multiple times per week and with the Governor's Executive Order announced yesterday, we are able to finally announce some decisions. We will have two academic options: a Face to Face option in our schools and an online option as well. We will send out additional details on our academic plans in July. We will also send out a shorter survey for parents to choose the option they prefer for their student(s).

LETS CELEBRATE KIDS CLUB!

Afterschool Professionals Appreciation Week is a time to recognize and appreciate those who work with youth during out-of-school hours.

Afterschool Professionals are skilled individuals who work with children and youth in diverse school and community-based settings to provide a wide variety of positive developmental relationships and experiences during out-of-school hours. Currently in the U.S., an estimated 850,000 individuals are practicing members of the afterschool profession.

An estimated 10.2 million children participate in afterschool programs each year, and for every child in an afterschool program there are two more waiting to get in. Every young person deserves quality afterschool experiences that positively impact their development. It takes skilled professionals to create these experiences.

Because of the important role afterschool professionals play in the lives of kids, they deserve recognition and support!

ATTENTION SENIORS
Your CS PTO has purchased a yard sign for each senior as a little gift to let them know we are thinking of them.

Signs can be picked up Wednesday, April 22nd between 10am-3pm at the drop-off/pick-up area near the Staff Parking lot. Each senior will be given one yard sign.

A huge THANK YOU to Bertram Signs & Graphics (Cactus Shadows Alum) in Cave Creek for printing these signs and giving us an amazing discount.

Please check with your HOA before putting your sign on your lawn. Dove Valley HOA and Tatum Ranch HOA have approved the signs be up until May 31st but ask that the signs be closer to your home, not towards the curb like where a realtor sign would go. Lone Mountain HOA Rules are noted below in the comments.

Good morning, CCUSD Families –

This is Debbi Burdick, superintendent. As you may have heard, this morning, Governor Ducey has announced that Arizona's schools will remain physically closed through the end of the school year.

This does not change the plans that CCUSD has put in place for remote learning that begin this week. Due to the community spread of COVID-19, we had anticipated that an extended closure would be a possibility. We know that this news will bring additional questions and as we work through the challenges, we will keep you updated.

By now you may have heard that Governor Ducey and AZ Superintendent Hoffman have closed AZ schools through April 10th. With CCUSD's Spring Break next week, we hope you and your family enjoy the break despite the challenging times we are experiencing as a community and a nation.

During Spring Break, our schools will be closed and the District Office will be open for internal operations only.

Throughout the past week, we have had staff earnestly working to prepare next steps for our students. Please refer to the schedule for student instruction that is posted on the CCUSD website on the COVID-19 page and the supplemental learning resources page. After Spring Break, our teachers will first receive training and then communicate with their students on or before April 1st, with instruction beginning on April 2nd.

Stay well and thank you as we navigate these unique situations together.

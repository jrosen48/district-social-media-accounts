We will be passing out packets of fun activities and books to our students throughout the month of June using our normal school bus routes.

We will have the enrollment forms for summer school on Monday with our school lunch deliveries at our regular lunch delivery stops. Please make sure you fill one out so that we know who wants to be involved and then we will start running regular school bus routes so that each child may receive a packet at their home.

So keep an eye out for your bus drivers and you might also see a teacher or two on the bus!

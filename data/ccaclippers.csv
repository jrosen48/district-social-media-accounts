There were over 350 contestants from 7 states that participated.

The students judged 10 classes of cattle ranging from bred heifers, bred cows, performance bulls and prospect steers.

“The Iowa Beef Expo Judging Contest is an event for young people from all over the country to improve their decision making and communication skills. It is a time for students to be exposed to high quality Iowa cattle. The best part is it gives producers a chance to showcase their genetics while the students are improving their skills at the same time.”

The team placed 8th overall out of 30 teams from 7 different states. This is only the beginning of the Clear Creek Amana FFA Livestock judging season. The next contest will be the Black Hawk Community College Contest.

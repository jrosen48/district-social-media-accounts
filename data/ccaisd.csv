The Varsity team came out in full swing! We made a few changes on the defensive side as Amaya continues to heal. This team has really had to step it up and come together. They are now showing some tremendous resiliency, something we have lacked all season. We played back to back matches today and defeated the Kermit Yellow Jackets and the Pecos Eagles!

They played outstanding during their pool play on Friday and earned their spot in the Championship Bracket. During pool play, they played tough and their passing and communication was great. They have been working extremely hard on learning the new rotations and their defense came through.

They faced Kermit and Midland Classical on day two of the tournament, but fell short in both matches. Unfortunately, frustration set in a bit along with some lack of confidence. However, the JV girls continue to work hard and work well together. We will continue to build their confidence and work on their mental toughness. As coaches, we will continue to raise the bar.

Coach K continues to set high standards for her girls as she works on getting them ready for the next level. Coach K coached her team up this weekend and did a great job with her team. We look ahead to Tuesday as we go on the road to take on the Tornillo Lady Coyotes. #eagleprideneverdies

After a quarter of a century in education, Ms. Bates has retired. We are beyond grateful for the service and dedication Ms. Bates has had to the Cheatham County community. Not only over here, but her service across the river was so impactful, too. She has influenced more students and their own kids than we can keep up with! She ALWAYS cares, and ALWAYS goes the extra mile to make sure everyone feels loved and supported. She is the first to jump in, offer a Diet Dr. Pepper, or even teach a class. She has a passion for Math that cannot be matched. Thank you, Ms. Bates for all of the lessons you have taught us in and out of the classroom. We love you dearly and you will always be a part of the HMS family, but truly, a part of the Cheatham County family.

As we have been communicating with our families, those who have chosen virtual learning will need to have adequate access to the Internet and a computing device to complete the required instruction.

Students will be logging into their devices throughout the school day as they participate in some of the real-time instruction. Our schools are communicating the daily class schedules with our families.

The Cheatham County School District is beyond grateful to the individuals who ensure our students receive nutritious meals.

In recent weeks, these folks have been on the frontline ensuring children in our community are fed during the extended COVID-19 closure. To date, we have served more than 53,000 meals.

On Friday, 877 children received 7,016 meals.

As part of National School Lunch Hero Day, some of our families dropped off gifts for our School Nutrition staff to thank them for their hard work and dedication.

Specifically, Cheatham Middle School organized an effort to gift Origami Owl jewelry to our workers.

Our next food distribution is Tuesday, May 5 from 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.

We want to thank School Nutrition supervisor Tracy Hopkins and her dedicated staff who regularly work to meet the needs of our students and especially during our extended COVID-19 closure.

Due to the Good Friday holiday, we will continue handing out meals this week on Thursday, April 9 from 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. via a “drive-through” system at Pegram Elementary Fine Arts Magnet School, Ashland City Elementary School and East Cheatham Elementary School.

We will resume our regular Tuesday and Friday schedule the following week.

The meals are for any child through 18 years old whether they are a student of the Cheatham County School District or not.

We’re so proud of the work that Team Cheatham is doing!",2020-04-07 18:20:57,,

Liz Austin, Art teacher in her 21st year at HMS, is right next to all of the construction that’s being conducted out back for drainage issues. Instead of hearing the noise as an annoyance, she & her students saw an opportunity for kindness. It has now turned cold and those guys are out there until 9pm some nights! Mrs. Austin and her students invited them in for breakfast and coffee today. This made my day and I’m sure the workers enjoyed it, too. So proud to be in the HMS family!

Please don‚Äôt skip your child‚Äôs wellness check-up!! Vaccinations are extremely important for your child‚Äôs health and the health of our community. No extensions or waivers are anticipated for next year‚Äôs immunization requirements so PLEASE do not put this off until the last minute. Students entering preschool, kindergarten, 8th grade, and 12th grade typically need immunizations.

If your child has a chronic condition (asthma, food allergy, diabetes, etc) you will be receiving school action plans in the mail that need to be filled out by the healthcare provider before school starts. The forms will go out next week so be on the look-out.

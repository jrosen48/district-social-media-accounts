Your body is 60% water, so it makes sense that maintaining healthy hydration keeps your body systems working like they should. Remember caffeine has reverse effects on your body’s function. By the time you feel thirsty your body is already dehydrated; our thirst mechanism lags behind our actual level of hydration. Research shows that as little as 1 percent dehydration negatively affects your mood, attention, memory and motor coordination. Therefore, make sure your child has a tall glass of water during the instructional day or is taking regular hydration breaks to keep their brain healthy and functioning at its very best!

When deep breathing is focused and slow, it can help reduce anxiety. You can do this technique by sitting or lying down in a quiet, comfortable location. Then:
1. Notice how it feels when you inhale and exhale normally. Mentally scan your body. You might feel tension in your body that you never noticed.
2. Take a slow, deep breath through your nose.
3. Notice your belly and upper body expanding.
4. Exhale in whatever way is most comfortable for you, sighing if you wish.
5. Do this for several minutes, paying attention to the rise and fall of your belly.
6. Choose a word to focus on and vocalize during your exhale. Words like “safe” and “calm” can be effective.
7. Imagine your inhale washing over you like a gentle wave.
8. Imagine your exhale carrying negative and upsetting thoughts and energy away from you.
9. When you get distracted, gently bring your attention back to your breath and your words.

Let your children's questions guide you.
Answer their questions truthfully, but don't offer unnecessary details or facts. Don't avoid giving them the information that experts indicate as crucial to your children's well-being. Often, children and youth do not talk about their concerns because they are confused or don't want to worry loved ones. Younger children absorb scary information in waves. They ask questions, listen, play, and then repeat the cycle. Children always feel empowered if they can control some aspects of their life. A sense of control reduces fear.

The Safari exercise is a great way to help kids learn mindfulness. This activity turns an average, everyday walk into an exciting new adventure.

Tell your kids that you will be going on a safari: their goal is to notice as many birds, bugs, creepy-crawlies, and any other animals as they can. Anything that walks, crawls, swims, or flies is of interest, and they’ll need to focus all of their senses to find them, especially the little ones (Karen Young, 2017).

A similar exercise for adults is the mindfulness walk. This exercise provokes the same response in children that a mindful walk elicits in adults: a state of awareness and grounding in the present.

STUFFED ANIMAL - DEEP BREATHING
Have your child lay down on their back and put a stuffed animal on their belly. Have them breathe in and move the stuffed animal up, then breathe out and bring the stuffed animal back down. This helps teach kids to use their belly to take big deep breaths. A small pillow or other soft object will work just as well.

And so it continues around the table until it gets to the person to the host’s left. That person then announces what they heard to everyone. If someone didn’t hear what was said in their ear, typically one “redial” is allowed. It’s always fun to hear how the original phrase changed!

My child is worried about going back to school in person.

How can I help?
Keep an open line of communication about what is worrying your child. It is important to reassure children that we all feel anxious sometimes.

Children may feel nervous or reluctant to return to school, especially if they have been learning at home for months. Discuss some of the changes they may expect at school, such as needing to wear a face covering. Children may also find it difficult being physically distanced from friends and teachers while at school. Encourage them to think about other ways to bond and stay connected.

Reassure children about safety measures in place to keep people healthy. Remind children that they can also help prevent germs spreading by washing their hands with soap and coughing or sneezing into their elbow.

Talk about the positives – seeing people they know at their school and continuing to learn.

Once children can notice and name their emotions, it is time to explore the reasons why they might be feeling a certain way. Interpreting emotions means understanding how emotions can help us.

It is important to communicate that all feelings are helpful, even the ones that cause us to be uncomfortable! In order for students to manage their emotions in positive ways, they need to have words to describe them.

-Have your kids lie down on their back on a comfortable surface and close their eyes;
-Then tell them to squeeze every muscle in their body as tight as they can. Tell them to squish their toes and feet, squeeze their hands into fists, and make their legs and arms as hard as stone;
-After a few seconds, have them release all their muscles and relax for a few minutes;
-Encourage them to think about how their body is feeling throughout the activity (Roman, 2015).

This simple exercise gets kids to be more aware of their bodies and helps them find a way to be present in the moment.

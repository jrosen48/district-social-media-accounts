I wanted to take a moment to commend every single student, teacher, staff member, custodian, cafeteria worker, bus driver, and maintenance worker.

We have been in school for one month now. Because everyone on our campuses have followed the COVID-19 protocols we developed, we have only had three individuals test positive for COVID-19 since the start of the school year. None of these three cases originated from the school. All three cases originated at home.

I am so proud of our Corrigan-Camden ISD family for working hard to ensure that our facilities are a safe place for students to learn and participate in extracurricular activities.

Thank you to each and every one of you for all that you do for the students of our district! Have a great Labor Day weekend, stay safe, social distance, wear your mask, and I will see you all back on Tuesday, September 8th.

Tickets for Friday night's Varsity Football game are on sale in the High School Office. Seating is limited to one half of the stadium's capacity, which is 1,357 seats. They will be sold first-come, first-served. We will sell tickets until Thursday afternoon. We will also sell tickets at the gate Friday night as well.

We will still honor UIL and Senior Citizen passes. However, you will need to use your pass to get a ticket. We recommend that everyone using one of these passes get their tickets early.

Just remember that if we sell out of tickets, we will be forced to limit access to the game. It is important to buy your tickets in advance if you want to guarantee yourself a seat at Friday's game.

I want to say publicly how proud I am of my children and their teachers!! No one was given a warning, they all just jumped into action and started trying to figure out ways to continue teaching and learning. Our teacher’s did not get to continue with their lessons plans and introduce new concepts. They didn’t send a bunch of junk that would frustrate parents and students alike. I have seen packets, zoom meetings, projects and FaceTime calls with friends. I mean seriously they even zoomed work out for athletics lol My High school kids jumped into action and started meeting expectations!! Not a single time have they come crying to me about how stupid or hard their work is. My Zeke the same and He is loving reading the Hatchet. My Bradley has felt a little overwhelmed at times but only because that’s just who he is. He loves learning and this ‘homeschool’ just isn’t for him lol With a little reassurance and me showing him this isn’t something new he gets it done.

Hang in there kiddos! Your teachers have worked hard to plan some activities to bridge the gap of the days we are away from school. We are concerned about your health and well-being. Most of all, we want you to know you are missed, and we look forward to seeing you all again soon! Stay safe and enjoy your family time!

To my social studies students: you guys are making history right now. This nation is experiencing something that we’ve never really seen before. 5th graders in social studies classrooms years from now will be studying what our nation and others have learned from this experience! You will tell your children and grandchildren about all of this one day. Make good choices, you will leave your mark. Make it a positive one!

Attention High School students!

All students who are in Edgenuity classes have access! You always have access, whether it is on your phone or on a computer. You should continue working on your classes in order to not feel stressed when we do come back to school.

Many have been calling to ask if they are able to keep working and the answer is Yes!

We have a print out of where students stood as of Spring Break and we will alter the online plan to get you back to that point when we come back to school. If you were behind, now is the time to catch up! But, if you keep working you might even be ahead :)

Mrs. Rabano is monitoring so that any work that needs to be released for you can be done quickly. Send her an email if you need anything even faster.",2.0,"Corrigan-Camden ISD

“Our children are our only hope for the future, but we are their only hope for their present and their future!”

With illness after illness presenting itself all around us, we felt a little tugging at our hearts to donate some of our time. We wanted to make some of the pleasurable things for children in our community safe to play on and ease parents minds!

Today we donated FIVE playground washes which went to the city, and to the school districts! We SANITIZED and CLEANED every inch of these playgrounds with care and precision! Thank you to CCISD and the City of Corrigan for allowing us to give back!

Freshman Nikki Mochman, Freshman Kalyn Smith, and 8th grader Heath Davis will be competing in the 2020 Ft. Worth Calf Scramble on February 4th at 7:30 pm.

These students have the opportunity to receive a donation to purchase a show animal for the following year. All they have to do is catch their calf to be a winner. Catching a calf is not easy! Best of luck!

We apologize for leaving Heath out on our first post.",2020-02-03 11:56:29,,

That number has increased dramatically since 2016.

Parents: We are continuing this program which benefits our community and our school. If you would like to order a Verizon Hotspot, please read and follow the attached directions. If you need additional help or have questions, please email technology@ccisdtx.com and leave your name and phone number. We will call you as soon as possible.

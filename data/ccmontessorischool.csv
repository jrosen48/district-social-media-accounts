Parents,

Charter schools are under attack.

In an unprecedented move, President Trump recently proposed eliminating funding for the Charter Schools Program in favor of a new education block grant—all while cutting funding for education by nearly $5 billion.

HB 2108, the Cottage Food Freedom Bill, has just been voted out of House committee by a 9-1 vote! Next step: Calendars! Everybody get your calling fingers warmed up!

This bill:

- Removes the location restriction. It allows the sale of cottage foods directly to consumers anywhere in the state.
- Allows internet sales as long as one portion of the sale takes place in person.
- Allows ANY non-potentially hazardous food (in other words, it gets rid of the specific list that we are currently operating with).
- Adds pickled fruits and vegetables including pickled beets and carrots.
- Adds canned goods that are acidified
- Adds fermented vegetables
- Adds frozen fruits and vegetables
- DOES NOT ADD any new regulatory burdens for cottage food producers.

In order to boost children literacy levels here in the Corpus Christi area, By The Book Bookstore wants to giveaway ONE FREE BOOK-A-DAY so that parents, teachers, and most importantly children can have access to a book when they want to read.

Children and adults need access to books in their neighborhood or school to inspire reading. It is through ""adult support"" and ""access to books"" combined that will encourage parents and teachers to read to children.

Research has found that by providing greater access through close proximity to books and adult support for book reading enhanced children's opportunity to learn.

Beginning tomorrow, January 15, 2019 @ 12PM, By The Book Bookstore will give away one book through our social media page everyday.

Please give us a LIKE on our page and SHARE this post to give everyone a chance to get a book. It will be on a first come, first serve basis. Let's boost those literacy levels starting right now!!!

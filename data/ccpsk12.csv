Ms. Toombs had this to say, ""I am sharing a video to help some students with their Algebra skills. In Algebra, we work on the distributive property to multiply monomials to polynomials and polynomials to polynomials. In another unit, we learn to undo the distributive property which we call factoring. In this video, I take a monomial (1 term) and multiply it to a binomial (2 terms), then I factor by taking out the GCF (monomial). This example shows the multiplication and then the opposite which is like division by taking out the monomial the two terms have in common.

She started off the assembly with getting students into groups and having them work together to complete a puzzle. Then she spoke about abolitionist and political activist Harriet Tubman and her efforts to free as many people from slavery as possible. Students were eager to answer trivia questions about Harriet Tubman and learn more about her. People who attended the assembly learned that Harriet Tubman had led over 70 people to freedom through the Underground Railroad. Ms. Angela Cook then explained the purpose of the puzzle activity that the students participated in. She wanted us to think about ourselves as puzzle pieces. She said that we are unique, and we should always be ourselves, because someone needs our skills and qualities to fit into their puzzle. “The whole world is a puzzle. Someone in this world needs you. You are someone’s puzzle piece,” said Cook.

They hosted guest speaker William McCargo. He spoke about the difficult journey that African-Americans have had to endure throughout history from slavery, to segregation in schools. McCargo showed a video mentioning the different schools in Virginia that started the Massive Resistance to the desegregation laws passed in the 20th century, and explaining how it was resolved by Supreme Court cases such as Brown vs. Board of Education. He encouraged the students to do more research about Black History Month and other cases that contributed to these equal rights movements. “If you won’t fix the problem, you are part of the problem,” said McCargo. The assembly was ended with a Black History Month trivia game. Three different questions were asked, and the students in the audience who answered correctly received a prize from McCargo himself.

The Randolph Henry Carpentry Department took on various projects this semester. One of which, was a dog house project. The skills used on this small project are similar to skills used for building larger structures. Students worked in cooperative teams to construct and paint each dog house, which are now on sale.

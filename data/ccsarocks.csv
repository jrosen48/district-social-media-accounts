A huge thank you to The Links (www.linksinc.org), which supported this opportunity. With fitting words in what was a difficult election week for our community, Ms. Hunter-Gault talked about the arts as a civil rights tool. She reiterated the importance of children discovering and sharing their voices, taking risks, celebrating their history, and letting their true selves shine. She left our children with the uplifting words: ""Dreams propel ambition: your dreams are going to propel you to be the best you can be.

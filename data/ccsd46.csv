If you have not done so yet, please complete it by 4:00 pm today. We need your information to continue our planning for the start of the 20-21 school year.

Please visit www.d46.org for links to the surveys, important steps for completing the registration process, and our updated FAQ.

The FAQ has been updated, based on the hundreds of questions that have come in through email and through Public Comment at last week’s Board of Education meeting.

We will continue to update the FAQ, but may not send out an email each time. Please check back to the FAQ often. You’ll know that it has been updated again by the UPDATE date at the top.

Thank you for sending your excellent questions. Although we do our best to anticipate questions, hearing from you is extremely helpful. We are able to communicate best when we know what our community is wondering.

Sincerely,

Dr. Lynn Glickman
Superintendent

November 26, 2019, was the inaugural Team Day at Briar Glen Elementary! Students used the half-day to build a foundation of connections and community across grade levels. The goal was to break down barriers, foster collaboration, and discover individual strengths by working with their teams. The students wrote letters and designed cards for soldiers and senior citizens. Then, they completed an art communication activity. Finally, the students participated in a number of teamwork challenges! Briar Glen Principal Mitch Dubinsky said he hopes the day will help all students feel a sense of belonging because they are seen, known and valued at their school.

Using the ""sports-ed"" model, Casmer's eight-week basketball unit has become one of the highlights of the year for students.

Students learn the basics of basketball, but they don't just play scrimmages. The students are also referees, scorekeepers, fans, and coaches. Casmer leads the students through lessons on how to run a practice and they learn how to call fouls and track rebounds. The students work on fair play and good sportsmanship.

Students played music at halftime of the championship game. They also created their own team logos and introduction videos using library software.

In the end, Casmer creates a unit that engages all students, builds leadership - and teaches basketball basics.

Glen Crest students in Paul Wilson's science class recently learned about dilution. Students in Wilson’s science class added an indicator to pool water, tap water, and distilled water, then compared the results to a serial dilution scale they had created.
Glen Crest students watched the chemicals change color after they added the indicator drop, which helped their team determine how much chlorine was in their solution.

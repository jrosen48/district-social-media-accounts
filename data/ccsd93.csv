The four classrooms along the school's east side have been renovated, and a 5,000 square foot addition has been built off of that, which will result in:
- Six STEM labs
- A domed virtual reality room
- A dedicated research and design space
- A collaboration area for staff

Built for flexibility with embedded technology and modern and future STEM concepts in mind, the space will fit the needs of any learning opportunities our students will be challenged to take on. Students will be able to seamlessly work on independent or collaborative projects that require them to design and build, interact with robotics, apply computer coding skills, and more.

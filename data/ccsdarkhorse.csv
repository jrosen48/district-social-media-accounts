Here's to help while activating the Pandemic Electronics Benefits Transfer Program card:

If you have received a P-EBT card for one or more school-aged child and have difficulty activating a card, despite any automated message you may hear regarding the date of birth (DOB) to enter, you should first try entering the DOB of your youngest school-aged child and if that does not work, try the birth dates of other school-aged children.

It is not the caretaker’s DOB that should be entered.

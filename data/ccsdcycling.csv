The Great Western Training Program (GWTP) 2018-2019

The Great Western Training Program has been going on for more than 30 years and it welcomes any rider in the San Diego cycling community or from above.

The program follows the same guideline that has been a tradition during all these years and any new participant will have the opportunity to chat with many of the experienced riders that have been participating in this program over the years.

We will also have the support of friends of the Great Western Training Program like Adam‚Äôs Avenue Bicycle store, Todd Boussom, SPOT and other volunteers that will help with neutral support during the ride to assist athletes mechanically to achieve their training goals.

The program promotes cooperation over competition, although we can be competitive with each other at times. Safety is the key word for the program and every rider will be participating at his own risk.

This year, the GWTP will have the support and presence of qualified and accomplished coaches at the start of every ride to describe the recommended workout for each Sunday.",0.0,"The Great Western Training Program

Below is a letter sharing our plans to continue remote learning through the rest of the 19-20 school year. While this is one of the most difficult decisions we've had to make, I know it's the right decision to ensure we are prioritizing the health and safety of our community.

Most of our students brought home needed materials yesterday. However, if you or your child needs to pick up anything from the school, we will have staff on site until 3pm today.

Look for information from your child's teachers early next week regarding distance learning. Most will share this information via an email. This will look different across grade levels.

We are currently developing a plan to provide food for those in need. In addition, Mountain Backpacks is working on a plan to distribute as well.

The purpose of closing schools is to limit interactions among people. As you consider plans for child care, please keep in mind that smaller groups are better.

We will post more information on our Clear Creek website as well as on Facebook.

Thank you for your support as we work together through this situation!
Warmly,

Today we had conversations with the Governor’s office, other school district leaders, and public health experts. Based on this, school districts are formulating plans for possible break extensions and closures over the next two weeks.

Currently we plan to hold school next week, however that could change. We have additional calls scheduled tomorrow with public health experts. We will message our families and educators again tomorrow.

While currently there are no cases identified in Clear Creek, we understand the widespread concern. Most of the districts who are announcing closures this evening do have confirmed cases.

Know that our district team is monitoring and will message our families tomorrow.

As part of the Reopening Schools process, all schools in the state are required to provide a plan that covers numerous areas including, but not limited to, topics such as Health and Safety, Teaching and Learning, Special Education, Social Emotional Learning, Transportation and more.

Due to these new circumstances, it is also important to provide clarity and support as we communicate with each other. On that note, the District will soon be providing parents, students and staff additional information in the coming weeks to assist you in planning for school re-opening.

This information shared in the robocall communication is inaccurate.

Instead, the correct average annual Tax Levy Increase has been 1.6% over the past 6 years:

I attended the Strawtown Elementary School DARE graduation yesterday - and the kids did a great job MC’ing their own ceremony and sharing what they learned. Thanks to Officer Norm Peters, our kids will be heading to middle school better equipped to make healthier choices and avoid drugs, alcohol and tobacco. Superintendent Martin Cox, Clarkstown Town Supervisor George Hoehmann, Clarkstown Ward 4 Councilman Patrick Carroll and Clarkstown Police Department Chief Ray McCullough were all there to support the kids with encouraging words as they graduated.

The DARE program is a great example of the strong partnership between the Clarkstown Central School District, the Town of Clarkstown and the Clarkstown Police Department. Thanks to all involved, including our principals, teachers and staff, for making this program possible.",2020-01-23 16:12:32,,

I am writing to thank the students and staff at FFMS for their response to the Lockdown today on the Festa Campus. The staff and students routinely practice emergency response procedures and they responded perfectly.

We understand how upsetting the false threat and needed emergency response was for everyone involved. To assist anyone who may need support or to talk with someone about the day’s event, we will have counselors available at Felix Festa Middle School throughout the day tomorrow.

Though the Clarkstown Police Department has determined the threats made to the school were not credible, they will be maintaining an enhanced presence on the Festa Campus. They are continuing their investigation of the false threat.

I want to also express my appreciation to the Festa parents for your partnership as well to the Clarkstown Police Department and all of the first responders for their important work.

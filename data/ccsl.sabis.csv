During this time, we hope that all are healthy and are practicing social distancing. As Commissioner Reilly shared “it is critical that students and their families, as well as school staff, stay home as much as possible. If you leave your home, it is essential to strictly follow social distancing guidelines by avoiding crowds, canceling social gatherings, and maintaining a safe separation of at least 6 feet from others. Restricting access to school buildings will have little impact on public health if these best practices are not followed in good faith.”

We want our kids to take this seriously, not going over to friends’ houses, or gathering for play dates. We understand that this is a difficult time for everyone. We also strongly encourage you to maintain your students’ school schedule as much as possible.

We will continue to keep you updated as we learn more.

It has been brought to our attention that there is a very dangerous and undesirable “challenge” circulating among young people around the world at the moment called the Skull Breaker Challenge.

Essentially, this “game” involves three people who begin to jump up and down and then two of them kick the legs away from the other, thus causing the middle person to fall on his/her back, neck, or head. I am sure you can understand how extremely dangerous and reckless this is. To make matters worse, the children use their telephones to take a video of it and then post it on social media.

There have been a growing number of serious injuries caused by this activity and two deaths.

I encourage all parents to engage their children in a discussion about this dangerous activity. We will be doing the same in classes at school. If any students are found to be participating in this “challenge” during school hours, their choice will result in serious consequences.

As our school continues to grow, so too will our involvement in competitive sports. In order to keep up with the increasing needs of a vibrant athletics program, we would like to explore the possibility of establishing a sports booster club at Collegiate. In order to be successful, a booster club needs active engagement from parents in the school community.

We are asking Collegiate parents to complete this brief, 2-question survey to gauge the level of parent interest in participating in a Collegiate Sports Booster Club.

Please click on the link below to access the survey:

I hope that you all enjoyed your Thanksgiving holiday with family and friends. I know that I did, but I am rested and ready for the next three weeks that will bring us to the December break.

The next three weeks will be busy with activity: a final week of Term 1 learning, a week of revision and a week of exams. Please note: We will be sending an exam schedule in the next few days. If you have questions/concerns, please do not hesitate to contact.

A few reminders:
-Please send your student(s) to school dressed warmly and prepared to be outside (hat, gloves and boots). It is always our goal to get our students outside for fresh air and activity.
-As you all know, we close school if Lowell Public closes. Be sure to check our social media sites for the official announcement. We will also email and call all of you.

Stay warm!

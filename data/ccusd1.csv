The students used liquid watercolors and added salt, rice, alcohol and saran wrap. They also did crayon resist. Students got their own watercolor palette to design a picture frame, which they filled with their own photo. The kids learned so much! In fact we spent so much time painting we did not get group pictures by grade like usual, but we got some pictures of the students in action!

Attention CEL Families:

We are working on our return to school plan and hope to share it with our families when it is ready. Currently, we are planning for in-person instruction Monday-Friday from 8:05 to 1:30. In addition, we are investigating an online curriculum for families who feel a remote learning option is a better fit for their student(s). As a reminder, in-person instruction does require students to wear a face mask. With either option, please register your student.

Registration packets may be picked up in the foyer (Monday - Friday from 8:30 - 3:00) or printed from our website (www.cel61.com). In-person registration for new students and anyone needing assistance is July 20th (12:00 - 7:00) and July 21st (8:30 - 3:30).

We are receiving updates on a regular basis and will continue to provide information as it changes. We appreciate your continued support and patience. We are excited to kick off the new school year with your student(s)!

Last Sunday Jenelle Scott (center) and her parents Jan and Mike Brosamer were on hand to assist sister and daughter Marci Eads of Mama's Arcade in putting together a truckload of food for the OACF Sunday lunch.

While waiting to help out, the trio was working on another project. Scott is a teacher at Chester-East Lincoln School. With school not in session right now, Scott, like many other teachers, is working to find creative ways to stay in touch with her students. On Sunday, the three were putting bags of microwave popcorn into envelopes to be sent to each of Scott's students.

Scott invited her kids to pop the corn and settle in to watch a movie with her. While they were all in different locations, they would still be able to do something together. Scott uses Zoom to meet with her students, and the movie they are going to watch together will be played during the class Zoom meeting today.

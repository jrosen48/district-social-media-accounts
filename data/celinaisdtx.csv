Good Morning Bobcats!
Today is the North Texas Giving Day! This day is set aside as a one day online giving extravaganza for non-profits. Celina Education Foundation pours into our students and our campuses each year, supplying programs, applications, and scholarships. With COVID still active, the Celina Education Foundation cannot hold their usual fundraisers they have in the past. Their goal today is to raise $5,000, which will directly benefit Celina ISD students! Giving is open now until midnight!

This winter guard has brought home a trophy every time they’ve competed for the past two years. They bumped to a higher class before today’s competition, and they still won SECOND place. We are so proud of them, and their fantastic coach, Michaela, who continually pushes and challenges them to improve and grow— both in their skills and in their character. Celina is seriously blessed to have such an experienced guard coach. We can’t wait til next week to see what more they can accomplish together!

Congratulations to our Special Olympics' athletes for their competition finishes in Basketball at Lovejoy this week. We competed against individuals in the surrounding and local areas (including but not limited to: Sherman, Lovejoy, Anna, Blueridge, Denison, Prosper), in a variety of basketball skills for dribbling, shooting and passing. We were so blessed to receive so many compliments from Lovejoy for our return this year, as well as from parents and friends in attendance today. We are so proud of the young men and women that compete with us each event!

ONLY 2 DAYS LEFT!
Don't miss out on sending your kiddo and/or a friend or teacher a sweet treat on Valentine's Day!!!

The kids LOVE THIS! I promise you! It's something they do every year. They are only $3 each and the money benefits Project Graduation which happens the night of graduation for CELINA SENIORS that encourages a drug and alcohol free celebration! So the money stays right here and benefits our kiddos and goes toward a GREAT cause!

My younger kids LOVE sending one to their friends and neighbors. I like sending them to teachers and office staff as well! You can send them to ANYONE! (Don't forget the Admin building, too!!!)

Just print this form (you can print as many as you need) and return to your child's school with a check or exact cash for the total. It's super easy and your kids will be SO EXCITED on Valentine's Day!

Thanks so much for supporting Project Graduation!

Congratulations to our Special Olympics' athletes for their competition finishes in Basketball last Wednesday located at Austin College in Sherman. We competed against individuals and teams in the surrounding and local areas, in a variety of basketball skills for dribbling, shooting and passing. A huge thank you to everyone for their help and assistance with the blessings of that day!
After a round of skills competition, our athletes had the following finishing places:
Barrett Bohall- 1st place in his division

Congratulations to our Special Olympics' athletes for their competition finishes in Basketball last Wednesday located at Austin College in Sherman.

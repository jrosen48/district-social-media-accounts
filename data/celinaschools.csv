CIS FAMILIES,
If any of you are out and about this TAX FREE weekend and are purchasing your school supplies, Mrs. Sudhoff would be forever grateful if you picked up an extra plastic pencil box (5x8‚Äù size). Due to the changes with reopening schools, our art supplies will be kept in individual boxes for each student. This means each student will need an extra 5x8‚Äù PLASTIC pencil box for art class, which will hold their own individual supplies. This was not on the supply list, as no one knew what the guidelines would be for schools reopening.

If you would like to donate extra pencil boxes, they would be accepted with open arms, as well.

We would also be extremely thankful if anyone would like to donate 18-gallon storage totes to keep the pencil boxes for each homeroom separated!

Please email Mrs. Sudhoff with any questions at amanda.sudhoff@celinaschools.org

A huge thanks to Gentlemen's Quarters owner (and former Tri Star student) Brian Moeller for speaking to Tri Star CBI students in Celina today about the barber industry! According to Brian, there is a real need for barbers in Ohio, with about 1 barber for every 668 men in the state according to the lastest census.

Jaden‚Äôs first opponent in this weekend‚Äôs tournament was a young man with Down‚Äôs Syndrome. Once he saw who he was wrestling he knew what to do.

They exchanged takedowns and wrestled for 3 minutes. The smiles on the face of his opponent says it all! Everyone cheered for this young man so loudly...it was great!

When he came to shake my hand after the match I told him, ‚ÄúYou did great on those takedowns you got!‚Äù
With an ear to ear grin on his face he beamed with joy and said ‚ÄúTHANKS!!‚Äù

I know any one of our Celina Wrestlers would have done the same. Jaden was the fortunate one that got to represent his team and prove that a Champion is more than just a person who wins a match!

I love this sport!!!

Check out this FANTASTIC project Mrs. Guggenbiller and Mr. Gudorf's students recently completed! Below you will find a description of the project.
THANK YOU WALMART!!!

Students began the project by taking measurements of the varsity soccer dugouts using tape measures donated by Walmart (they donated $85 worth of tape measures). Students were then placed into groups and assigned a section of the dugout. Next, students scaled their measurements down and began sketching their models using a program called SketchUp on their Chromebooks. Once students made a 3D model of their structure, they were grouped again so that each student had a different piece of the dugout. Next, students compiled each structure of the dugout and then sent them on to the 3D printer. Models are roughly 5 inches and each takes roughly 2 hours to print on CMS's 3D printer. Once printed, students build them like model airplanes.

The students learned how to make butter in a jar, comparing the process to churning butter like many people did in the past. Next, they wrote How-To stories, detailing step-by-step on what to do. They discovered the cream went from a liquid to a solid as it formed into butter.

They were the overall Mercer County winner of the Red Ribbon Week Photo Contest! See the picture for them with their new items for the classroom!

The theme this year was...""SEND A MESSAGE. STAY DRUG FREE!!!""

Prizes are sponsored by the Mercer County Prevention Coalition and Mercer County Elks Golf Club

The Red Ribbon Campaign¬Æ was started when drug traffickers in Mexico City murdered DEA agent Kiki Camarena in 1985. This began the continuing tradition of displaying Red Ribbons as a symbol of intolerance towards the use of drugs.

CPS Families! It's getting cold outside!!!! A couple of reminders from our staff. Please make sure your kids are dressed warmly (and appropriately) for the weather.

We do go outside for recess, so they will need coats, hats, mittens, scarves, etc.

Please make sure your child's coat has a zipper that works. (We found a couple today that did not work.)

Make sure your child's coat has their name inside it. Many times, kids have matching coats and they sometimes get confused.

IF YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING A COAT, HAT, GLOVES, ETC. FOR YOUR CHILD AND WOULD LIKE ASSISTANCE. PLEASE PM US ON THIS PAGE OR EMAIL MRS. DUNCAN AND SHE WILL HELP YOU OUT! michelle.duncan@celinaschools.org

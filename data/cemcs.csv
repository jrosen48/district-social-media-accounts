We are experiencing some technical difficulties with our primary communication platform- SwiftK12. We recognize that all families are not receiving messages as they normally do although the data in the platform says they are. In the interim, we are working on another solution to ensure consistent, timely communication. You can also continue to monitor the school webpage and social media pages as well as check this link for all updates: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mkRhspth08ozddOk2HQRJaY-rHTOhHYUwecOCRjCr5Y.

We are experiencing some technical difficulties with our primary communication platform- SwiftK12. We recognize that all families are not receiving messages as they normally do although the data in the platform says they are. In the interim, we are working on another solution to ensure consistent, timely communication. You can also continue to monitor the school webpage and social media pages as well as check this link for all updates: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mkRhspth08ozddOk2HQRJaY-rHTOhHYUwecOCRjCr5Y.

ANSWER: Curiosity!

Learning materials that spark curiosity are crucial, so we have a variety of traditional Montessori materials in our classrooms and we incorporate technology, too. BrainPOP is an online tool similar to an animated encyclopedia. It offers short lessons and comprehension quizzes on science, social studies, English, math, arts, music, health, and engineering. It’s also available in Spanish! The PFA is dedicated to purchasing a BrainPOP subscription for the 2019 - 2020 school year.

Studies show that students increase their ability to learn and retain information when their curiosity is ignited! The limbic reward system of the brain actually illuminates when students are curious. Our teachers know that it is important to spark curiosity in the classroom as well as use curiosity as a teaching method.

ANSWER: 12 Million!

Building proficiency in reading takes practice! RAZ Kids is a library of online, interactive eBooks at 29 levels of difficulty. It is a favorite tool for students and teachers that makes reading accessible and enjoyable. The PFA is dedicated to purchasing a RAZ Kids subscription for the 2019 - 2020 school year.

Studies show that students who read 30 minutes a day, between kindergarten and twelfth grade, are projected to encounter 13.7 million words before graduation. Students who average less than 15 minutes of reading per day are likely to be exposed to only 1.5 million words. The difference is more than 12 million words!

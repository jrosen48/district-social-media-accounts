Hello all. During this crazy time, one thing has continued, we still buy groceries! Collection of Box Tops has changed quite a bit over the last year or so. The majority of them are now counted electronically with an app. You load the app on your phone at BTFE.com and take a picture of your receipt within 14 days. The app explains the process quite well. You can select Centennial School as your school and the .10 per box top will go into our box top account at Centennial! It‚Äôs that simple. I have tried this out over the last couple weeks and it works fairly well. There were a few glitches, but I was able to work through them. Long receipts prove to be quite tricky. If there are grandmas of others out there that want to contribute to more than one school, you are able to donate to more than one school. If you come across a few of the old style clip Box Tops, you can still send those to the school. We would appreciate your help in continuing the collection of Box Tops electronically! Thank you!

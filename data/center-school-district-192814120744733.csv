What does racial healing look like for me? In part, it looks like this amazing team of diverse friends who are fighting to break the cycle of poverty for homeless families in the Center School District.

I am humbled to share that today Impact Center Schools / Serve the World Charities was officially approved for a $103,384 grant by the KCMO City Council. Thank you, God!

Martin Luther King Jr. said, ‚ÄúI believe we ought to do all we can to lift ourselves by our own bootstraps, but it‚Äôs a cruel jest to say to a bootless man that he ought to lift himself by his own bootstraps.‚Äù

This money will help provide boots to those who were once bootless. It will also give us the ability to pay for upfront housing costs required for stable, dignified housing. Finally, it will afford us the privilege of continuing to walk with our families until their youngest child graduates from high school.

Center School District is in the planning stages for what a Fall 2020 return to school could look like for both students and staff. While current federal and state guidance is not prescriptive at this time, the District anticipates guidance in mid-July. However, we must begin to prepare by exploring options and contingencies. We fully expect plans to evolve and adapt over the summer as further guidance becomes available. Your responses will help guide our planning in the age of COVID-19.

One of our 6th grade students, Niveah Bell, started her own charitable organization when she was 8 years old. Niveah wanted to make the world a little better by donating items to the homeless around the holidays. This year marks the 5th year she will be collecting and delivering items to individuals in need. Niveah has a goal of collecting enough for 150 care packages to be delivered. The Student Leaders of CMS heard about Niveah's mission and wanted to help her reach her goal. Therefore, we will be having a penny war next week (November 18-22) to support this cause!

Center Middle School will welcome 28 teams from across the Kansas City region to the FIRST Lego Robotics regional Qualifier.

The Center Alternative Robotics team will also compete in the afternoon meet at Center High School. The Center High School Robotics teams and Center Middle School FIRST Tech Challenge team will actually help run the meets and serve as queuers, referees and score keepers.

A big thank you to Derrick Prewitt who will serve as Tournament Director for the FIRST Lego Robotics event at Center Middle School. He has put a lot of hard work into recruiting volunteers, planning and coordinating this event for the over 250 students across the Kansas City Area.

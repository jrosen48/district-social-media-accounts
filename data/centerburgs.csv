I am a quiet guy that likes to draw, watch funny videos, hang out with my family, and kick footballs. My favorite foods are chicken, yogurt, and anything sweet.

I currently live in Centerburg with my parents, Lisa and Joe Grizenko, and my older brother Nathan. My mom is currently a kindergarten teacher's aide at Centerburg Elementary School. My dad is a controls engineer in Lewis Center. My older brother, Nathan, is graduating from Ohio Northern University this year and moving on to Ohio State for grad school. I also love my grey cat Stormy.

I did marching band for 1 year in 8th grade. For the past four years I played on the football team. This year I was First Team all Conference Kicker. I have been working at the Sunbury Tim Hortons for the last two years. I love visitors so come by and see me.

After graduation I plan on attending Hocking College majoring in Fire and Emergency Services. This will give certifications for fire fighting, EMS, and paramedic. I also plan on trying out to be the kicker for the Hocking Hawlks football team.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3060542800700506&id=487643661323779,,0.0,"Senior Spotlight - Ellis Grizinko

I moved down to the Centerburg area when I was 8 but did not actually go to Centerburg until my freshman year. I joined the Cross Country team where I made my first friends which ultimately introduced me to the community. Since then, I made many new friends, went to state in both cross and track with my team, went to my first football game, went to my first dance, and learned many new things about myself.

My dad is a youth minister at the Milford Church of Christ. My mom is a kindergarten teacher at Northridge and my sister is 11 years old and in the 5th grade.

I’ve played football and basketball the last four year and was in choir the last 4 years as well. I joined student council this year and have been apart of OSA the last two years

I enjoy reading, shopping, and spending time with my friends. I also love succulent plants, ice cream, and the color pink!

I am the daughter of Angie and Bill Webb and I am an only child. I love spending time with my family and my dog, Bubba.

I serve as the senior class president and as the president of the Ohio Scholars Association. I am also a member of the Youth Philanthropy Initiative and concert choir at Centerburg. I participated in cheerleading at Centerburg all 4 years of high school, and I am a dancer at Infusion Dance. I am also currently earning my certification to become a yoga instructor at Yoga on High.

I plan to attend Ashland University in the fall. I am very excited to step out of my comfort zone and learn to stunt while being a flyer on the cheer squad, while I will also be a member of the dance team. I hope to double major in exercise science and nutrition, and eventually earn my doctorate of physical therapy.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2995422667212520&id=487643661323779,,0.0,"Senior Spotlight - Zoe Webb

I am a senior at Centerburg High School. In my free time, I like to color and hang out with friends. I am a big sweets person, and ice cream is definitely my favorite. Also, I’m a HUGE Netflix binger, so if you need a good show hook up, let me know!

I have three brothers, Jacob, Nathan, and Luke. Jacob and Nathan both graduated from Centerburg, and Luke is in the 10th grade. My parents, Brenda and Brad, both graduated from Centerburg as well. So Centerburg really is my hometown. I also have two dogs, Vise and my new puppy, Sadie!

I am involved in Centerburg’s Ohio Scholar Association (OSA) where I was head of our carnation committee. I ran cross country and played basketball all 4 years of high school. I have participated in track just these past 2 year (junior and senior year). Within my church, I volunteer with the younger kids as well as teaching the middle/high schoolers.

After graduating, I am attending Walsh University to major in Nursing.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2990884190999701&id=487643661323779,,0.0,"Senior Spotlight - Lydia Grandstaff

I find that my school hobbies and my personal hobbies—photography, sustainability, music, politics—are very much aligned. Lately, my friends and I have been doing a lot of hiking outside: I hope we can have a few last midnight Meijer trips before we all disperse.

I have a little sister, Layke, who is an incredible artist and is following my footsteps in the percussion section. My family and I live on what we call a “sanctuary farm” and have a constantly growing amount of animals.

I am Editor-in-Chief of the school newspaper, the Trojan Crier, and anchor for Prior Crier, the school broadcast. I have also been a member of the jazz band for six years and the marching band for five.

I will be attending Denison University for narrative journalism with a pre-graduate track in law. I believe it is valuable for people to have reliable, non-biased news, especially in times of chaos and nepotism. Although that sounds serious, my real plans are to keep things interesting and meet people with whom I feel connected.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2963940443694076&id=487643661323779,,0.0,"Senior Spotlight - Lula Burke

I am a quiet, athletic, and artistic person. Playing volleyball and creating art are two of my passions. This year I was the speaking captain of the varsity volleyball team, and I currently volunteer with the youth volleyball camps. I believe in living a minimalist life; not taking more than you need and putting God and family first. I love nature, spending as much time as I can outdoors being active.

My parents have been married for 30 years. I have two older siblings that graduated from Centerburg. I also have two nephews that I adore.

I am a member of the Centerburg Art Club. I was also on a Club Volleyball team for three years, and played school volleyball for six years. I was a band member for six years until volleyball took all my interest and time.

I am attending Columbus State Community College after graduation. I will be pursuing a career as a Paramedic and Firefighter.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2959073217514132&id=487643661323779,,0.0,"Senior Spotlight - Natalie Coffing

The representatives at this number can guide consumers on qualifications and process.

The Governor announced today that schools will remain closed through May 1. All scheduled activities for the district are cancelled. We will have spring break from April 6-13 as normal. There will be no online classes during that week.

Unfortunately, because of the inability to reschedule the venue, DJ and other supports needed, the Prom this year is cancelled.

If your financial picture has changed you may qualify for free meals for school students. Please contact Autumn.Pauley@centerburgschools.org",2020-03-30 14:43:40,,

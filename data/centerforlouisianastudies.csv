The goose is loose! Sylvaine Sancton's latest story for children, The Adventures of Jeremy Goose, follows young Jeremy Goose, who lives in New Orleans' Audubon Park. After he hatches from an egg, Jeremy learns to walk, eat grass, swim, cross the road, and get along with other animals, all under the watchful eyes of his Mom and Dad. On the banks of the park’s lagoon, Jeremy and his family live with their neighbors, including a squirrel, a snake, and a bad-mannered nutria. Jeremy is a thoughtful and sensitive little goose who sometimes gets into trouble but always feels the love of his family. Through Jeremy’s voice, young readers learn about family, responsibility, having fun, and growing up.

The goose is loose! Sylvaine Sancton's latest story for children, The Adventures of Jeremy Goose, follows young Jeremy Goose, who lives in New Orleans' Audubon Park. After he hatches from an egg, Jeremy learns to walk, eat grass, swim, cross the road, and get along with other animals, all under the watchful eyes of his Mom and Dad. On the banks of the park’s lagoon, Jeremy and his family live with their neighbors, including a squirrel, a snake, and a bad-mannered nutria. Jeremy is a thoughtful and sensitive little goose who sometimes gets into trouble but always feels the love of his family. Through Jeremy’s voice, young readers learn about family, responsibility, having fun, and growing up.

Hey all you Harry Trahan music fans! Renee and I are in the process of gathering, documenting and preserving dad’s music at the Center for Louisiana Studies at UL. Renee is actually working there and documenting her own family’s music! She couldn’t be happier!❤️
I am reaching out to all of you because I know there are some recordings out there we have not heard. We are interested in all recordings and videos of dad.
Also, in particular, we believe there are some dancehall recordings made by Huey Meaux in Texas. Dad played there from 1956-1962. He played dancehalls 4 nights a week. If anyone has access to this, and could share it, it would be priceless to our family and it could be preserved for everyone studying our heritage. I’m crossing my fingers...

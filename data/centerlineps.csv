Detroit Public Television (DPTV) is responding to the learning needs of families with children at home as a result of Michigan schools being closed because of the COVID-19 crisis by adjusting its entire daytime programming schedule.

From 7 a.m. until 6 p.m., Monday through Friday, DPTV will offer blocks of programming geared to specific age groups – early childhood, middle school, and high school – on its main broadcast channel (56.1), as part of a collaboration with Michigan’s public television stations and the national PBS system.

While Michigan schools are closed this school year, weekday programming will be as follows:

• Current PBS KIDS programming (Ages 2-8 years old) – 7 a.m. to 9 a.m.
• Grades 4th-8th – 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
• Grades 9th-12th – 1 p.m. to 6 p.m.

The Governor has required the closure of all schools in Michigan beginning on Monday, March 16.

I know that this is very difficult for our parents who depend on us to provide a safe and rich learning environment for their children during their working hours. I know that families depend on us to provide two nutritional meals every day and most importantly to expose their children to rich opportunities and learning that will allow them to be successful after high school. We all appreciate these opportunities because in Center Line Public Schools, our students’ success is our first priority.

Happy last day of school!

This is with out a doubt the strangest end to a school year I have ever experienced. I miss the smiles and excitement from students and staff as we looked back on memories from the year and look forward to summer fun. Sitting in an empty parking lot feeling a bit lost today. The unknown is scary but I know our North Country Family will pull together and make the best out of whatever comes our way.

I didn't get to play our end of year song so here you go! https://youtu.be/CXFsWAkLoXQ

Have a great summer and please stay safe. Can't hardly wait to see you next year!

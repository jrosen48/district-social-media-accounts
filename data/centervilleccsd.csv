As promised, here is the video featuring 7th graders using ASL to sign The Pledge of Allegiance. Mrs. Durham worked with us for several days, teaching us the proper signs and deepening our understanding of the Pledge itself. Miss Mekca shot the videos with us on the green screen in the HILL, and showed us how to use the DoInk app on the iPads to edit and publish our own videos. I know you’ll be impressed with what these kiddos created. A huge thank you to both Mrs. Durham and Miss Mekca for all they do to help support learning for our students.

Blair Wright, first time freshman contestant, placed 85th with 354 points. Blair scored a terrific score of 45 out of 50 points for the Maine-Angus Heifers class.

Junior, Aubreyonna McGill placed 68th out of 89 contestants with a total of 455 points. Aubreyonna got a 48 out of 50 for the Charolais Bred Heifer, Maine- Angus heifers, and the Performance Charolais Bulls classes.

Due to a lack of school days these kids did a great job with very little to no formal practice! Most importantly I think they had a great time and we got there and back safely! Please give them each a high five when you see them!

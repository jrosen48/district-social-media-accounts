For the past couple of weeks, seventh graders in Mrs. Stanley’s English language arts class at Tower Heights Middle School have been hard at work on STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) projects related to the novel “Phoenix Rising” by Karen Hesse. Each student could use a variety of tools, such as Ozobot robot, Makey-Makey invention kits, 3D printer, Legos, websites and more, to create three projects focused on a setting, character and the novel itself, with at least one being interactive. This week, they presented their completed work to their classmates.

These Makey-Makey invention kits were part of a Centerville Education Foundation grant that Mrs. Stanley received this year. These versatile tech tools were used by some students with Scratch.com to create interactive plot lines and posters. Students recorded required information on Scratch, built a circuit board with copper tape, brads and cardboard, and assembled the Makey-Makey kits so that when touched, the posters would say information automatically.

Students wrote their own speeches on the topic, “What Freedom Means to Me,” considering questions such as how freedom is defined, what freedoms we have and how they affect our everyday lives, and how freedom is gained or lost.

They delivered the speeches in their classrooms with the Centerville High School Speech and Debate Team and community leaders acting as judges. Nine finalists were selected, and they participated in the final competition, which took place in the gym. Community leaders and members of Toastmasters acted as judges for the final contest, and three winners were selected: Coleman, first place; Spencer, second place; and Carson, third place.

The nine finalists are pictured here: (front) Coleman, Stella and Carson; (middle) Graham and Katherine; (back) AJ, Spencer, Logan and Morgan.

Families worked together for almost an hour during the painting competition, choosing from the themes “Under the Sea” or “Up in the Air.” Art teacher Ms. Tavani, who planned the event, chose four winners and gave them each an art trophy. Congratulations to the Greanya family (Most Creative); the Miller family (Fun Idea); the Rindler family (Art Technique); and the Meeds family (Most Artsy)!

The family art night was funded through a grant from the Centerville Education Foundation. Each year, the CEF awards grants to teachers in Centerville City Schools for creative classroom activities.

The Penguin Bowl, which was hosted by the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium and co-hosted by Youngstown State University, is part of a nationwide competition that tests students’ knowledge of ocean science disciplines through buzzer-style, multiple-choice questions and open-ended team challenge questions. The CHS team will join winners from 22 other regional bowls April 16-19 in Mississippi for the NOSB Finals.

“Winning this tournament is a really incredible feat, given that we are a landlocked area and our high school does not offer advanced courses in oceanography nor marine biology,” said Mrs. Manfredi, one of the team coaches. “This really speaks to the work ethic, tenacity and insatiable desire for knowledge that these students have.”

Another CHS team took second place in the regional competition.

#ElkPride",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2919158994816660&id=241009872631599,,0.0,"Congratulations to Centerville High School students Deklin Caban, Alison Hardie, Auggie Harner, Shriya Rangaswamy and William Zhang, who recently won the Penguin Bowl, a regional ocean science academic competition that is part of the National Ocean Sciences Bowl (NOSB)!

The Penguin Bowl, which was hosted by the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium and co-hosted by Youngstown State University, is part of a nationwide competition that tests students’ knowledge of ocean science disciplines through buzzer-style, multiple-choice questions and open-ended team challenge questions. The CHS team will join winners from 22 other regional bowls April 16-19 in Mississippi for the NOSB Finals.

“Winning this tournament is a really incredible feat, given that we are a landlocked area and our high school does not offer advanced courses in oceanography nor marine biology,” said Mrs. Manfredi, one of the team coaches. “This really speaks to the work ethic, tenacity and insatiable desire for knowledge that these students have.”

Another CHS team took second place in the regional competition.

They began their research with a quick-write on current energy usage in the United States. They then met with Mrs. Kibby, the ELA curriculum coach, to learn how to follow and evaluate an argument by using mentor texts, such as Greta Thunberg’s speech from this fall’s U.N. Climate Action Summit.

Students’ critical thinking skills were tested as they got into “energy expert” pairs, representing a variety of energy sources, to evaluate claims and take into account potential counterclaims.

The project culminated in 5-minute presentations where a student U.N. panel tracked their use of ethos (gaining audience trust), pathos (appealing to their emotions), and logos (targeting logic with facts).

This collaborative effort between Centerville, Kettering and Oakwood High Schools offers programs for juniors and seniors.

“Career Ed classes help students focus on something that they enjoy, but also it gives them a reason to be at school and a passion,” said Craig Suttman, the Career Education principal at CHS. “They’re interested in being here, excited about learning, they’re excited to be with the students they’re spending two periods with every day for two years.”

Families of sophomores wishing to learn more about the programs can attend a Career Expo Family Night tonight from 7-8 p.m. in the Performing Arts Center.

To learn more about all of the Career Education programs, check out the “Elkonian Extra” prepared by students in Mrs. Sanders’ yearbook classes at http://bit.ly/2QYQT32 or visit the Career Education website at www.centerville.k12.oh.us/schools/chs/career-tech.

This collaborative effort between Centerville, Kettering and Oakwood High Schools offers programs for juniors and seniors.

“Career Ed classes help students focus on something that they enjoy, but also it gives them a reason to be at school and a passion,” said Craig Suttman, the Career Education principal at CHS. “They’re interested in being here, excited about learning, they’re excited to be with the students they’re spending two periods with every day for two years.”

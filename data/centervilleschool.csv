With the summer kicking off we would like to provide kids with workouts to do in the off season. This is totally voluntary for those seeking self improvement. The workouts won't be one size fits all and will be tailored for sprinters and mid to long distance runners. Parents are more than welcome to participate as well if they're motivated to take on a workout plan. It will include classic well known body weight workouts of the day (WODs) that everyone can do with no equipment and will also include running. For the running, we would like everyone with a smartphone to download the Strava app, which will allow them to record their route, pace, and overall achievements. Strava is also a social media app, so they can follow the achievements of the rest of the team as we go. After downloading the app, they will have to create a strava profile and join the Centerville Track and Field Club which can be found under the clubs tab on the Strava App. We will begin posting workouts tomorrow.",0.0,"Centerville Tornadoes Track and Field

With the summer kicking off we would like to provide kids with workouts to do in the off season. This is totally voluntary for those seeking self improvement. The workouts won't be one size fits all and will be tailored for sprinters and mid to long distance runners. Parents are more than welcome to participate as well if they're motivated to take on a workout plan. It will include classic well known body weight workouts of the day (WODs) that everyone can do with no equipment and will also include running. For the running, we would like everyone with a smartphone to download the Strava app, which will allow them to record their route, pace, and overall achievements. Strava is also a social media app, so they can follow the achievements of the rest of the team as we go. After downloading the app, they will have to create a strava profile and join the Centerville Track and Field Club which can be found under the clubs tab on the Strava App. We will begin posting workouts tomorrow.",2020-05-27 21:31:59,,

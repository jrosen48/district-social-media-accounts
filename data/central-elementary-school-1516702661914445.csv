ATTENTION TEACHERS, PARENTS, KIDS...

I'll be hosting a series of weather lessons for kids in the coming days/weeks here on Facebook. Once completed, these will be posted on our website, likely along with at least a couple of worksheets relevant to the material I've covered.

Tomorrow's first talk will be a basic introduction to weather for younger kids...think K-4. I'll cover topics like the water cycle, thunderstorm threats and safety, tools that meteorologists use, and more.

Friday's lesson will be all about hurricanes and should appeal to a wider age group.

I will attempt to come up with some additional lessons for the coming weeks, but may also repeat some of these to give kids opportunities to engage live on Facebook with their questions.",0.0,"Steve Caparotta WAFB

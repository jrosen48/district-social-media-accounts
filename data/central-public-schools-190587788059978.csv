If you have friends and family that would like to listen to our graduation ceremony and live outside the radio play area, I would encourage you to download the KLGB App, which can be found at https://www.radio.net/s/kglb .

Additionally, we will be streaming the graduation ceremony live on our Raider Recap Facebook page. The link to the live feed can be found by using the following link:

The order of the parade is flexible, but we will attempt to have ECFE, Elementary, Middle, then High School.

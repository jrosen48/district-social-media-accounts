In addition to Spanish and French, we will now offer Italian in the HS World Language Department. Italian is a romance language spoken by over 60 million people around the world.

Speaking Italian gives you access to the world with native speakers from Rome to Milan to Sicily to San Marino. Italian is considered one of the easiest languages for a native English speaker to learn. The grammar and sentence structure are different from English, but simpler. Because both languages have Latin roots, they also share thousands of cognates – words that sound the same and have the same meanings.

Speaking Italian gives you access to the world with native speakers from Rome to Milan to Sicily to San Marino. Italian is considered one of the easiest languages for a native English speaker to learn. The grammar and sentence structure are different from English, but simpler. Because both languages have Latin roots, they also share thousands of cognates ‚Äì words that sound the same and have the same meanings.

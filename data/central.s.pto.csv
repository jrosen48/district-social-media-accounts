Good Afternoon,
With school starting in under two weeks, it is important that all families planning on attending Central Springs Schools have their children registered. We use the registration data to determine elementary class sizes and middle school and high school use it to determine class sections.
Families can register online through Sunday, August 12th. After Sunday, families not registered will have to come into the school to fill out the paperwork and pay all their fees. Any elementary student not registered and fees paid will not be assigned to a teacher and will not be able sign up for a conference. Middle school and high school students must be registered with all fees paid in order to receive their school issued laptop/computer.
Thank you to all those who have already registered, hopefully we can get everyone registered by the end of the weekend.
We look forward to an awesome school year.",0.0,"Central Springs CSD

Raider Nation:

Friday, July 31, is the long-awaited graduation celebration for the Central A&M High School Class of 2020.

A plan was written, revised, and approved by the Shelby County Health Department. Unfortunately, given the pandemic, the ceremony is only for seniors who have yet to receive their diploma and their invited family members.

The public will not be admitted to the football field for the ceremony. Only the family members of seniors may attend on school property.

I know this group waited for a full and public ceremony, but that is not possible at this time. This is the best we can do. At least they are able to celebrate with their family members and as a class.

If you wish to do something for this class, send your thoughts and prayers their way. I know they will truly appreciate that gesture.

Steven Nichols is the son of Jason and Barb Hazlet and Louie and Claire Nichols.

Steven found out years ago he was interested in attacking a career involving automobiles. His passion for engines and vehicles leads him to attend a trade school for auto mechanics.

Hailie Nihiser is the daughter of Gary and Kristina Nihiser.

Hailie has been preparing for her future for quite awhile. While working a part-time job at McDonald's, Hailie has put herself in position to receive some help for her to pursue her goals.

McDonald's is providing a grant to Hailie to help pay for her enrollment at Midwest Technical Institute in Springfield. At MTI, Hailie plans to complete the requirements to begin her career as a phlebotomist.

Hailie joined us at Central A&M the beginning of her senior year, and she showed the ability to live out what she really wants to accomplish in life: ""My one desire is to do what I can to help others, and I think this is a great path to do so."" With her smile and attitude, we have no doubt she will help people!

Eventually, Hailie plans to continue her education as a phlebotomist and eventually become a DPT (Donor Phlebotomy Technician) to increase salary and to begin working in blood collection centers.

Congrats, Hailie!

Happy Juneteenth!
Juneteenth is a celebration commemorating the ending of slavery in the United States. On June 19, 1865, Major General Gordon Granger, along with Union troops, arrived in Galveston, Texas with news of Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation that had taken effect on January 1, 1863. Prior to this, there was no Union presence in Texas and Lincoln’s Proclamation was not being enforced. Although today marks a substantial win for freedom and justice in the United States, there is still much work to be done to address the inequitable and biased systems dating back to our country’s origins.",0.0,"The history of June 19th, otherwise called Juneteenth. #IAGDTBAR #RaiderStrong

Message for all Raider Athletes:

A sports physical is MANDATORY in order to participate in fall sports. Sports physicals are considered current if the date is within a 13-month window. So, to be eligible for all of fall sports, the physical would need a date after October 15, 2019 or so.

If you need a sports physical (Freshmen need a school physical, which suffices), make the appointment now. Physicals may be difficult to get due to the situation caused by the pandemic.

As of now, we have no date for the Shelby County Health physicals that are usually held at the Baptist Church.

Athletes, this is something you need to take care of before practice begins. No athlete will be allowed to practice unless the athlete has a current physical.

Hunter Semelka is the son of Andy Semelka and Noel Meador.

Hunter is planning on entering the work force after graduation.

At Central A&M, Hunter was enrolled in the Work Program and also served as Mr. Smith's Teacher's Aide.

Hunter enjoys his friends, dogs, and video games. At school, Hunter could always be found during lunch in the picnic table area by the back doors. I called it the Daily Meeting as the group of friends discussed a variety of topics. There were plenty of world problems solved in that group!

Our country has a long way to go to fix the racial inequities that exist and that work can’t begin until white people open their hearts and their voices. We have to start listening and do better. I don’t always get it right and I am willing to admit that but I will always listen and try my best to understand and do better. The black community is suffering and deserve our support. There are also law enforcement officers that are out there everyday doing their jobs with integrity and they are suffering right now too. This isn’t a matter of sides, it’s a matter of justice.",0.0,"Nicole Ekiss

Congratulations to Sarah Berg, who earned Central A&M's first ever Seal of Biliteracy!

From Spanish Teacher Mr. Jess Lehman:

Join me in congratulating Sarah Berg on earning the Illinois State Seal of Biliteracy in English and Spanish. The State Seal of Biliteracy program recognizes high school graduates who have attained a high level of proficiency in English and in one or more foreign languages. This bilingual stamp of approval allows colleges, universities, and employers to distinguish between students who say they know a second language and those who can actually prove their abilities. Sarah is the first CAM student to earn the Seal since the adoption of the program in 2018.

Way to go, Sarah!

While at Central A&M, Sam participated in Scholastic Bowl, IT Club, and served as Freshman Class Treasurer.

Sam plans to pursue a career as a Psychologist.

All you need to know about Sam's dedication and perseverance is summed up with this: Sam Baker is an Eagle Scout.

The Eagle Scout charge is ""Your responsibility goes beyond your fellow Scouts -- to your Country and your God. America has many good things to give you and your children after you; but these good things depend on the qualities she instills in her citizens. You are prepared to help America in all that she needs most. She has a great past, and you are here to make her future greater.""

Kurt Callan is the son of Paul and Stefani Callan.

Kurt plans to chase a long-time dream of his after graduation. He will enroll at Richland Community College in Decatur to study Criminal Justice.

Kurt has been known as a student with a willingness to share points of law with anyone who would listen. The fact that he will be pursuing law enforcement is not a surprise.

At Central A&M, Kurt was involved with student government as a class officer and also studied Criminal Justice while at Heartland Technical Academy for half a day the past two years.

Kurt has his own style, as evident by his constant Hawaiian shirts and his sense of humor. I enjoyed our daily conversations as he relaxed by the back doors during lunch. He is confident in where he wants to be, so I would not be surprised to see him all the way up at the FBI! Kurt, chase your goals!

We thank our wonderful and generous community members for sharing with our Central A&M Raiders!

Here is Scholarship Award #2

Each year, the Central Illinois Conference honors two students from each school as Scholar-Athletes. A $100 scholarship is also awarded. I will have the check for you when you turn in materials and pick up items next week.

This year, the recipients gave us incredible memories from athletics, but also gave their all in the classroom. The 2020 Central Illinois Conference Scholar Athletes from Central A&M:

Jacob Paradee -- North Central College, where he will also play football.

Channing Reed -- Lincoln Land Community College, where she will also play basketball.

Both are also National Honor Society members and will graduate with Honors.

Congrats, Jacob and Channing!

Will Voudrie recently earned his first turkey with a successful hunt.

The Goodbrakes celebrated Ryder's 10th birthday with style.

Sarah learned how to fry fish....now that's an important life skill!

Grayson is having fun with his new toy, while Colton visited the vet with his cat and enjoyed some outdoor time.

Paul and Victoria enjoyed Quiplash with older brother Ryan via Zoom from Florida.

And, a sneak peek at the 5th Grade art masks. To be completed next school year.

Keep moving forward, Raiders. This will not stop us.

You are waiting on the graduation plan. I do not have the plan, but here is the latest update:

I have had the results of the graduation survey for a week.

However, ISBE, our state education governing body, has been putting out guidelines concerning graduation.

So, I waited to put out a plan.

Now, it appears those guidelines are changing again.

I anticipate releasing the graduation plan next week, after, hopefully, all the ISBE guidance is complete.

I can tell you that 45 of 57 families responded and 36 of those (80 percent) wanted a full ceremony. That will be reflected in our plan.

Until next week......

Here are my draft choices -- if we buy local, we will dominate this competition.

Crawford's -- Pizza
Mama Chan's -- Stir fry, rice
Guadalajara -- Burrito
Monical's -- Pizza
Whit's End -- Pizza
Krekel's -- Shake
Moweaqua Packing Plant -- Turkey Medallions
Moweaqua Foods -- Fried Chicken
Brick's -- Grilled Cheese
Crazy Ladies Cafe -- Biscuits & Gravy

Go Raiders! Let's Eat!

We start today's collection with another Senior door, this one featuring Hannah Schinzler.

One thing about this social distancing is the chance for families to be together. Look at the fun Mr. Aberle is having with daughter Adeline during reading and music time.

Kendra is hanging in the yard with a football.

Jacob is busy planting this year's crop.

Mallory enjoys time riding her horse.

Jade has become an expert chef when it comes to banana bread!

Keep moving forward, Raiders. This will not stop us.

Jillian Cooper is spending time with her horse and learning Igbo, a language native to southeastern Nigeria. Now, that is impressive.

Kooper McLain participates in a Zoom class meeting with Mrs. Hardimon. I was able to join in for a little while. It was so wonderful to connect more personally than we have been. Great to see the young Raiders, even if through a screen.

Mrs. Forlines has been communicating with her class the old-fashioned way! Nothing like handwritten letters!

The Rorks were using sidewalk chalk to spell out sight and spelling words, and Nova is learning how to draw, so she can draw a picture for each classmate.

The Greers are completing school work on a nice sunny day, the Templeton boys went for a bunker this time, and Andrew enjoyed a little bike time after work.

Please check your email periodically for updates from the district.

Also, Raiders, this is a good time to communicate with your teachers. If you have fallen behind in a class, email your teachers to determine if there is anything to make up or do extra to help. Check in with each teacher.

You should be able to find the email address of each teacher by beginning to type the teacher's name. If you cannot, contact me through message or email at cbrown@camraiders.com

If you know of any student who does not have internet access, let us know.

We strongly urge all students to spend some time each day to keep up with your work. However, also spend time each day taking care of you and your family. Have some fun, too.

We cannot wait to be together in school once again. We cannot wait to celebrate the Class of 2020 and all the accomplishments of all of our Raiders.

We will make it together.

The loss hurts...but it is more than that. It is the realization that this group will not play together again. Sure, they are blessed with talent. However, they are blessed with work ethic. They gave us so many thrills the past few years.

And, this hurt is for the whole team. The Seniors are crushed as one would expect, but the freshmen, sophomores and juniors feel it, too. They are now charged to carry this momentum forward and make it a tradition. But, tonight, they ache for the seniors.

We in Raider Nation are also proud of the athletes as they gave all they had and came up short, as most teams do.

All this breaks my heart as a principal who cares about these kids.

And it even goes deeper than that.

I will miss them as athletes....but that does not compare to how I will miss them as people....as I feel each and every May when the next set of seniors graduates.

Thanks for the ride, Raiders!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1523742764450584&id=508652252626312,,0.0,"Pushed to tears tonight as the Central A&M Raiders fall in the IHSA SuperSectional in Carbondale.

The loss hurts...but it is more than that. It is the realization that this group will not play together again. Sure, they are blessed with talent. However, they are blessed with work ethic. They gave us so many thrills the past few years.

And, this hurt is for the whole team. The Seniors are crushed as one would expect, but the freshmen, sophomores and juniors feel it, too. They are now charged to carry this momentum forward and make it a tradition. But, tonight, they ache for the seniors.

We in Raider Nation are also proud of the athletes as they gave all they had and came up short, as most teams do.

All this breaks my heart as a principal who cares about these kids.

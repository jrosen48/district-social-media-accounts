What great talent The Film Dudes were able to showcase with our 3rd grade classes creating 4 movie trailers while K-2, 4-5 showed their Mannequin Challenge skills off.

This school year we were blessed to host The Film Dudes, Eric and Matt, for two weeks. They spent their time teaching acting, filmmaking, and social media basics to each grade level (K-5) for a week this fall. Their second week was focused on our core group with 3rd grade going a little more in depth to create the movie trailers.

We will be sharing Trailers, Mannequin Challenges, and a Behind the Scenes film once we have all of them ready to go.

Thanks to everyone who was able to join us tonight for our Premier Night!

We just learned that there will be Columbus Area Youth Football this year! Central City's youth football program has been a part of the Columbus Area Youth Football for quite a few years. All games will more than likely be played in Columbus this year but practices will be held here in Central City. We will have more information next week and once that is received we will set sign up dates. In order to make this happen we will first need parents to commit to helping coach. If sign ups go like they have in the past we will need 2 head coaches for 3rd/4th and 1 to 2 head coaches for 5th/6th grade. Please let me know if you have interest in helping coach and stay tuned for more information on sign ups next week!

___________________

Besides work, during this quarantine, I have had time to finish some of my paintings and start some new ones:)

“Love me for who I am, not who you want me to be” is a quote I live by. It has and forever will be my favorite quote. I want people to love me and love my personality the way I am, not the way that society wants me to be. I am my own unique person. I want to be loved for my differences. Also, sunflowers are my favorite flowers and I wanted to do something a little different, therefore today I painted the sunflower red. (Which is still real, but it is more rare of course) .

Besides work, during this quarantine, I have had time to finish some of my paintings and start some new ones:)

“Love me for who I am, not who you want me to be” is a quote I live by. It has and forever will be my favorite quote. I want people to love me and love my personality the way I am, not the way that society wants me to be. I am my own unique person. I want to be loved for my differences. Also, sunflowers are my favorite flowers and I wanted to do something a little different, therefore today I painted the sunflower red. (Which is still real, but it is more rare of course) .

We hope that our students will be able to return on April 8th and we will go back to learning in a traditional, face-to-face format, but we have also created plans to address a longer mandated school closing, if needed.

Mrs. Weh received the 2019 Advocacy Award for organizing the “Chance to Dance - Dance Party” for students enrolled in self-contained special education classes. At the dance party, participants interacted with their peers in a low pressure and fun social atmosphere. The activities at the dance also allowed students to meet important educational and social goals in an authentic environment. Two hundred students and fifty supervising adults attended the event from Clinton, Marion, Washington, Bond, Fayette and Jefferson Counties on October 23, 2019.

Wow!!! We are completely BLOWN AWAY by the incredible fundraising efforts and enthusiasm we received from Central Community High School District #71 and Albers Elementary SD#63 during the week of World Down Syndrome Day -- they raised $1,845.62 collectively, with Albers coming in first at $1,066.40 and Central with $779.22.

We cannot say THANK YOU enough to these two schools -- the administrators, the teachers, and the students who made this all possible!! Thank you for making these contributions to our Community Link Buddy Walk, and thank you for advocating for people with Down syndrome and other disabilities. You are an inspiration and an example of what is possible when we all work together to make amazing things happen!!

Be sure to sign up for our Buddy Walk by April 5 to get a t-shirt with our NEW logo!

Wow!!! We are completely BLOWN AWAY by the incredible fundraising efforts and enthusiasm we received from Central Community High School District #71 and Albers Elementary SD#63 during the week of World Down Syndrome Day -- they raised $1,845.62 collectively, with Albers coming in first at $1,066.40 and Central with $779.22.

We cannot say THANK YOU enough to these two schools -- the administrators, the teachers, and the students who made this all possible!! Thank you for making these contributions to our Community Link Buddy Walk, and thank you for advocating for people with Down syndrome and other disabilities. You are an inspiration and an example of what is possible when we all work together to make amazing things happen!!

Be sure to sign up for our Buddy Walk by April 5 to get a t-shirt with our NEW logo!

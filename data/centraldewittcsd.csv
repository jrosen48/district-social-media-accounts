River clean-up efforts (Living Lands and Waters)
The importance of youth voice for environmental action
Solar energy
Gardening
Wild edibles
Bioremediation (soil health)
Spiritual connection with nature
Composting

The Figge has selected Lauryn Ginter as the winner of the 2019 Figge Factory T-Shirt Design Contest. They loved her succulent and cactus drawing and thought it would make a great shirt. Lauryn wins $100, a family membership to the museum, a framed copy of her drawing, and screenprinting party for her and 3 friends. Her design will also be printed on shirts that will be sold in the Figge museum store! We are so proud of her accomplishment and artistic talent! Lauryn went up against 85 entries from Quad City area schools. Check out her design below!
Congratulations Lauryn!",2020-01-08 10:52:51,,

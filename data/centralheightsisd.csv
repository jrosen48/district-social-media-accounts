Dear Central Heights ISD Family,
After visiting with other Nacogdoches County Superintendents over the weekend, CHISD has decided to extend its closure thru April 17th.
Both the city and county of Nacogdoches have declared a "" stay home "" order starting at noon today. I have communicated with Greg Sowell (County Judge) and this does not pertain to the delivery of instructional materials and student meals. We will continue to offer instruction online as well as packet pickups following the schedule that we started on March 23rd and we will also continue to offer meals to students 18 and under each day Monday-Friday.
An update pertaining to information regarding Transfer Applications will be posted on the CHISD website beginning on April 6th. Current transfers should be receiving a letter in the mail soon and we are asking that everything is returned by mail during the school closure.
We appreciate your patience during this time.

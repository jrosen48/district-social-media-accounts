Bralen said that once his best friend checked in for him, he knew it would be the last time he would take the court and it was really over at that point. Bralen’s advice to the underclassmen would be to cherish the time that you have at school. Some days you may not want to be there, but just remember that once you are gone, there is no coming back. Congratulations Bralen! We are proud of you.",2020-04-02 16:18:42,,

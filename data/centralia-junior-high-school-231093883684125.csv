I want to give a huge shoutout to Centralia Illinois Police Department and Officer Denton

This child was scared of cops a few weeks ago. Now every morning she demands her window is down so she can say good morning and have a good day to Officer Denton.

She insisted that Officer Denton and his friends needed cupcakes.

Thank you Officer Denton for everything you do.

Students, this is the last instructional week! Make sure to get your work turned in, either online or packets (packets can always be dropped off in the orange bins).

Parents, the next (and final) drop off/item pick up is Friday, May 22. ALL items (library books, any text books, spring pictures or money, etc.) are due. This is the last opportunity to send someone to pick up items from lockers.

Report card info. will be posted later this week.

Graduate picture sign up times are available via the link that was shared on the CJHS Facebook page on Friday (these are not mandatory). If your child comes for pictures, he/she will be given their diploma and cover at that time IF they have met all of their academic obligations and all items have been turned in (or fees paid). If they do not come for pictures OR if they have not met their academic obligations, have fines, etc., then arrangements will be made to get diplomas and covers to those students.

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT:

Centralia City Schools Family,

The Governor’s announcement today that school will be closed for the remainder of the year is sobering. However, the Board of Education, principals, teachers, and support staff are dedicated to continuing meaningful learning opportunities, food service, and student and family support until the end of the school year. Over the next few days, the administrative team will continue the process of reviewing and analyzing our current Remote Learning Plan. We will adapt as needed and work hard to make sure you are up to date on current information as we have it. Remember to look to www.ccs135.com for all information and updates on our school closure page. I am extremely proud of the way everyone has handled this difficult situation. Your support and encouragement has helped to keep us motivated. Thank you and stay safe.

Over the weekend, teachers have been hard at work making preparations for how to best meet the needs of our students through the upcoming days. Tomorrow, your children will be given instruction on how to access Google classroom (if they do not use it already), and teachers will be posting activities for them for the week. This is also a way for students and parents to connect with teachers if needed. For those who may not have access to technology, teachers will send home packets with similar activities to those being posted. We want all of our students to have access to continued learning over the days of this closure.

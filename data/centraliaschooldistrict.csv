In the current school year we have spent $202,061.31 on the pool facility which includes general maintenance obligations, swim week for students, and the ongoing repair of the spa facility. This is about 0.37% of our annual budget (roughly one third of one percent).

Last year we spent $164,426.31, or 0.32% of our total annual budget.

The pool does receive EP&O levy support for things like maintenance, swim week (3rd grade and CMS students), and use by the CHS swim team.

In recent past years the pool liner has been replaced as a regular maintenance issue. The pool HVAC system was replaced about 7 years ago largely with energy efficiency grants received by the district.

the City of Centralia also contributes to maintenance and upkeep of the indoor pool facility.

The pool was built after a majority of Centralia's voters approved a bond for its construction in the late 1970s.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157797465688758&id=163243053757,,0.0,"""How much does Centralia School District spend on the Community Indoor Pool"" is a question we hear quite often.
In the current school year we have spent $202,061.31 on the pool facility which includes general maintenance obligations, swim week for students, and the ongoing repair of the spa facility. This is about 0.37% of our annual budget (roughly one third of one percent).

Last year we spent $164,426.31, or 0.32% of our total annual budget.

The pool does receive EP&O levy support for things like maintenance, swim week (3rd grade and CMS students), and use by the CHS swim team.

In recent past years the pool liner has been replaced as a regular maintenance issue. The pool HVAC system was replaced about 7 years ago largely with energy efficiency grants received by the district.

the City of Centralia also contributes to maintenance and upkeep of the indoor pool facility.

The pool was built after a majority of Centralia's voters approved a bond for its construction in the late 1970s.",2020-03-06 14:06:24,,

While it's accurate to say per-pupil funding from all sources is up, that's not the whole story. Each revenue source can only be used for specific purposes. Our levy funded programs rely on local revenue because other sources do not fully fund them, or do not fund them at all.

So here's the story of per-pupil funding in terms of our local levy. In 2017-18 our local EP&O levy provided $1,611.15 per student. This year it provides $961.19 per student. That is a decrease of more than 40 percent in two years. This is a result of state legislation that reduced our local levy from $2.83 per $1,000 to $1.50 - without giving our local community a say. We have relied on reserve funds to keep these programs and services in Centralia.

The levy on your ballot is a replacement of the current levy, which expires this year. New legislation allows districts to seek levies up to $2.50 per $1,000, which will allow us to continue to provide our levy-funded programs and services.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157698519173758&id=163243053757,,0.0,"There's been a lot of conversation about per-pupil funding increases for education.

October 11 is the 25th annual International Day of the Girl Child. It is an awareness day created by the United Nations to draw attention to gender inequality around the world.

Worldwide, millions of young women are denied access to healthcare, education, employment, and basic civil rights on no basis other than their gender. Worse, in the 21st century, young women are still being forced into child marriages and being taken by traffickers. Some of these inequities still exist in our own country.

In Centralia, we believe that the idea that a cap should be placed on a child's level of achievement at birth by virtue of their gender is abhorrent. We are immensely proud of the approximately 1,800 young women in our schools. They are future leaders, business owners, inventors, parents, politicians, educators, and more. They will change the world in ways we haven't even thought of. We can't wait to see everything they accomplish.",0.0,"Centralia School District 401 added 78 new photos.

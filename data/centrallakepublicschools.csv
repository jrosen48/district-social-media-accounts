You are more than welcome to enter the store, but you will see another new sign asking that you do not enter without a face covering. We are just trying to comply with the directives from our Governor. If you do not have a face mask, we do have disposable ones we are selling either for $1.00 each, or you can get a 10 pack for $9.95. If you need to purchase one in order to enter, either call us for curbside delivery, or enter, purchase one at the front counter and put it on. We really do appreciate everyone's cooperation!

What a night for Trojan Nation! We were able to honor Jasmine Hines tonight and retire her jersey. We also honored Finch Vanniman as she signed with the Aquinas Saints.

Lady Trojans all played an incredible defensive game against the Lady Hornets winning 56-10!

Mrs Jessica sang the national anthem, wow!!

And the icing on the cake was our Lil Lady Trojans played at halftime!

Thank you to all who planned and out this night on. It took many hands. Thank you to the Hines family and the Vanniman family for your two gifts with us! And finally thank you to all of Trojan Nation for always support the students and the Orange and Blue!

On July 15, the district will announce the plan for the fall and the learning options available for Central students. If you are unsure about the best education option for your child, we recommend you wait until July 15 before making a decision or registering for the Central Online Home School.

**PLEASE NOTE: If you choose to enroll your student into the Central Online Home School, they will be dropped from the current school they are enrolled in as the Online Home School is a separate school.

**If you want to pull your student from their regular school and enroll them in the Central Online Home School, please make sure you check ONLINE HOME SCHOOL when registering for this school – do not check the school your student is currently enrolled in.

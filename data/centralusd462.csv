Join us Tues., Dec. 3rd for the high school basketball scrimmages and parents meeting at 6:00 p.m. and grab a snack or dinner at KIMCHI HUT FOOD TRUCK. The truck will be parked in front of the high school in Burden and begin selling at 4:00 p.m. until sold out. The food truck is open to anyone and we hope the community will come out and take advantage of the opportunity if possible! You can't beat $1 egg rolls! :) Please help us spread the word. Contact Jillian Henning for questions. A portion of the proceeds will benefit the National Honor Society. Kimchi Hut",2019-11-25 11:34:43,,

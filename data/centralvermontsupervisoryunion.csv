Many of you heard Governor Scott’s announcement earlier this evening that Vermont schools will remain closed for the rest of the school year. His expectation is to be closed to in person instruction, but to continue teaching students remotely.

Though his announcement was shocking, we cannot say it was completely unexpected. Please know that your schools are ready to support you and your children in any way they can. Superintendent Bollard will provide more details tomorrow.

Please take care. We will get through this together.

Today we unveiled our brand new sensory path! We are so thankful to Captain Scott and Ms. Lynne for all of their hard work to get this path put in over vacation. Thanks also to Ms. Shawna and Mr. Carl for helping to teach students sensory path expectations today.

Students are loving the opportunity to try out the sensory path for fun today, and will be learning how to use it as a tool to help them take care of their minds and bodies in the future. 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♀️",2020-01-02 12:27:07,,

Another educational, engaging, and FUN trip to Crossmolina Farm! Today we made fresh apple cider, a 3D map of the farm, and harvested vegetables for next week's Harvest Dinner at school! 🍎🥔🥕

We are SO thankful to Margaret and Jonathon who are welcoming us into their space with open arms and teaching us so much about their diversified farm! We are also thankful to Misse who is our school to farm guru! We can't wait for our next visit!

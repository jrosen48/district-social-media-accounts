Let's All Dance Together Apart!

Studio 23 in Hillsboro has prepared a video for families and littles to move together. As Parents as Teachers, we will use this as one of our group connections, even though we can't actually be together.
The video is just over 20 minutes long, and doesn't require special clothes or shoes. It would be helpful for one song to have a scarf or piece of fabric, or even a tissue to wave as you move.
To participate, please let me know if you are interested. You will then receive a link to the video and a download of motor skills you can expect at different ages of your children. The link will be available during August. Your request for the video will be counted as attendance for our records.

The outdoor odor wafting through Buena Park and surrounding areas is NOT from natural gas. According to the Los Angeles County Fire Department, the odor is the result of a chemical spill at a construction site near the City of Compton. A hazmat team has responded and according to officials, the spill is under control. Officials report the odor is harmless, although individuals who are sensitive to odors should consider staying indoors until the odor completely dissipates.
If you ever suspect a natural gas leak, immediately evacuate the area and, from a safe location, call SoCalGas® at 1-800-427-2200.",0.0,"Thanks for the update Buena Park Police Department!

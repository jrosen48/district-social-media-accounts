In a frank and open discussion, Supt. Daniel Booth shares about race and race relations in this current climate of racial tension, in a talk with Illinois Principal Association Executive Director Dr. Jason Leahy.

In the past few weeks, Supt. Booth said he has had answered questions and had frank discussions with at least a dozen of his non-African American colleagues across the state on this issue.

""I have heard deep reflecting occurring"" in these conversations, Supt. Booth said. ""This is a great moment in time when we can recognize, when ... the scales fall off our eyes and we are able to see things in a different light.""

He suggests that educators be reflective, as opposed to feeling guilt and educate themselves on issues that they don't understand and for African American educators to help their non-black colleagues understand African American experiences ~ which have similarities and differences ~ ""with grace and mercy.""

Latasha Schraeder, the District's Assistant Superintendent for Pupil Services, shows off the teacher binders for the Second Step socio-emotional learning curriculum starting in the new school year.

During Thursday night's virtual Board of Education meeting, School Supt. Daniel Booth acknowledged six retiring educators for their years of service to students in District #95:

Kathy Bell, 24 years

Michelle Garthe, 27 years

Ann Hamman, 14 years

Angela Jenkins, 28 years

Tari Moorman, 20 years; and,

Paula Sierfert, 13 years in the district and another 14 working with District schools

That means, today is ""Show Us What You've Been Up To"" during the quarantine and school closure.

One of the first to answer this question is Carbondale Middle School teacher Mrs. Hale. She says: ""What I've been up to... soaking up sunshine as much as possible, and I've been turkey hunting with my dad,""

(...and Mrs. Hale, thank you for all you do! #ThankATeacher #ThankYouMrsHale!)

Share your responses... and pictures,videos always make this soooo much sweeter!

That means, today is ""Show Us What You've Been Up To"" during the quarantine and school closure.

One of the first to answer this question is Carbondale Middle School teacher Ms. Hale. She says: ""What I've been up to... soaking up sunshine as much as possible, and I've been turkey hunting with my dad,""

(...and Mrs. Hale, thank you for all you do! #ThankATeacher #ThankYouMsHale!)

Share your responses... and pictures,videos always make this soooo much sweeter!

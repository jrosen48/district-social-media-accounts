Families may choose the CFBISD remote model of learning for their child if they wish their child to attend school five days a week at home in an online learning environment.

In all grades Pre-K through 12th, CFBISD's Remote Learning online classwork and instruction will be much like your child's traditional classroom with engaging lessons from certified teachers.

Remote Learning activities are designed to guarantee that your child will be learning at the highest level and encourage a love of learning. Our goal for Remote Learning is to work together to ensure students gain the academic skills necessary for their future success, and still have them participate in the electives and extracurricular activities they love.

We appreciate our patience as we adapt to the new school year.

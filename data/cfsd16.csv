Great news!

Yesterday the USDA announced that they are extending free meals for kids through December 31, 2020.

This means that our free grab-and-go breakfast and lunch food service will resume Wednesday, September 2, 7:30 am - 10:30 am, for any children who are 1-18 years of age. Please refer to the flyer below for additional information.

As with our summer program, families will receive the food bags curbside. Parents may pick up meals for their children. No student ID, student number, or student name is required.

We will offer the same three locations for pickup:

Orange Grove Middle School

Their statement about why: ""We consider service to our community to be the most core aspect of being an FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge) team. This shield donation is a natural extension of that philosophy, and we're very thankful to CFHS and all of our other 3D printer donors which made it possible.""

The team raised donations to cover the cost of the filament, elastic and transparencies. The team followed Cornell University's design for the Prusa shield, which is a high-quality, durable, adjustable style. The shield can be wiped down with a disinfecting wipe, and it can be comfortably worn over a face mask. If the transparency is damaged, the team can replace it.

Dear CFSD Community,

It has come to my attention that families may believe that we will ignore an Arizona Department of Health Services' (ADHS) anticipated August 7 metric that may indicate that it is not safe to reopen our schools in-person on August 17. That is not true. It is unimaginable that Governor Ducey will not heed the ADHS metric if it indicates that Arizona schools are not safe to reopen. Regardless, we will take the ADHS metric seriously and follow its advice.

Sincerely,

Reopening for 2020-2021

June 16, 2020

Dear CFSD Community,

I want to provide a brief update about the planning effort that is underway to reopen CFSD for the 2020-2021 school year. We are working on two options for families:

Full-time in-person learning (brick-and-mortar school)
Full-time remote learning

We did explore offering a blended/hybrid option for combined part-time in-person learning with part-time remote learning. We abandoned that option because it is an unreasonable work expectation of our teachers to provide both without adding a significant benefit to students.

Much more planning and preparation remain before details are finalized. We want to share the plans with you no later than early July so that you have time to make a decision about which option best serves the needs of your family.

In the meantime, please know that this planning is driven by our commitment to protect the health and safety of students and staff, and sustain a robust learning environment.

Sincerely,

Mary Kamerzell",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=4294358783909405&id=311702135508443,,0.0,"A Message from CFSD Superintendent Kamerzell re:

🎼FROM MS. HIGGINS🎼
Presenting our finished ""Virtual Choir"" video! I had so much fun putting this together and I hope it brings a smile to your face to listen/watch our students sing during this crazy time.

This song, ""When I Grow Up,"" was supposed to be our closing song for the combined Canyon View, Ventana Vista, and Esperero choir concert that was cancelled due to the school closures. A couple of weeks ago, we asked students to record videos of themselves singing their part for this optional project.

This final product has students from all 3 of our schools in grades 2 through 7. There are 36 students mixed into the audio and 34 in the video (a couple of students only recorded audio).

Featured soloists are Lila Poore (6th grade) and Siena Mayfield (7th grade).

A huge thanks to Mrs. Moore and Mr. Colwell for teaching their students the song and helping me collect the videos on their Google Classroom sites!

I hope you enjoy these sweet voices! :) I look forward to hearing them again in person soon!

The pets here at PACC wanted to give a big THANK YOU to the third grade classes from Canyon View! The students who made these blankets were in Miss Mary Clark’s class, Mrs. Heather Frankfort’s class, and Mr. John McGraugh’s class.

Each blanket had a homemade gift tag to give to each cat or dog.

Thank you guys SO MUCH for the thoughtful gifts to the homeless pets here at PACC!",0.0,"Pima Animal Care Center

We've had families return to the same site every day which is really
encouraging. Parents often express gratitude while their kids are
excited to see what is in their bags. We had a family give a thank
you card to our staff at Canyon View and a boy gave us Chinese
Knots at the high school. We've had parents and kids ride up on
bicycles to get their meals. Some families bring everybody along for
the outing - dogs included.

Next week’s menus are posted below. We have 3 locations: Canyon View Elementary School, Catalina Foothills High School and Orange Grove Middle School, with service from 8 a.m. - 10:30 a.m. Thank you for your support of our grab-and-go meal program, with free breakfast and lunch for everyone ages 1-18.",2020-04-10 10:03:11,,

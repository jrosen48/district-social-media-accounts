Mindy had help from Jodi Pierceall, Emily Pierceall, Vicky Gagnon, Kim Lange, Lisa Kretsinger, Roxy Waterhouse and Denise Burdick each week packing the meals.

Our custodians stepped up to help pack food each week and also then thoroughly cleaned everything.
Thank you Chris Johnson, Jim Van Matre, Jean Bratton, Larry Young, Zach Van Matre and Steve Morrell. 👏🏻👏🏻

Deb Taylor delivered food each week with the help of Kiley Neeley & Amy Hunt. Thank you Birch Bus!! 🚌

Our superintendent, Mr. Robinson, delivered meals EVERY MONDAY! 👏🏻👏🏻

There were over 9700 meals made during this time. This was a huge undertaking and these people stepped up in a huge way to ensure our students had meals to eat.

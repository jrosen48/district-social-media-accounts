I have completed the task of walking every neighborhood in the Pleasant Grove district - One hundred sixty one point seven (161.7) miles! Unfortunately I didn't take my phone on my first couple of walks and don't have pictures, so I am sorry. I hope to continue this activity throughout the summer, as it has brought so much joy to my heart. I hope it has done the same for the PGES families. I look forward to the time where we can all be together - IN SCHOOL. I can't thank you enough for the messages, chalk drawings, waters, waves, and so much more - we have a special community.

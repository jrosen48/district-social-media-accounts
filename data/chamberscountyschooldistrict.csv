SENIOR SHOUTOUT: We realize high school seniors have had a strange end to their senior year, and we want to do our part to recognize them. We are hard at work putting together our annual graduation section.

We also realize parents might want to do something special for their graduating students. With that in mind, we developed the following plan, allowing for parents to purchase an ad — customized however they want — in our graduation section for $25, $50 or $100. These prices are well below our normal rates, as we understand the state of the world and that many families might want to do something special on a fixed income. Please call (334)644-1101 or email ashley.tipler@valleytimes-news.com for more information.

It was followed by an online survey that allowed county residents the opportunity to express their opinion on the proposal, as well as issues related to school security, technology, and capital improvements. HPM, the company that was hired to conduct the survey, has been assessing public input and will announce the results during the upcoming forums. The first of these meetings will be held this Monday, Nov. 26, at the Valley Community Center beginning at 6:30 p.m. EST (5:30 p.m. CST), followed by the second forum on Tuesday, Nov. 27, at the Alfa Building in LaFayette beginning at 9 a.m. CST (10 a.m. EST).

Hi Ram Nation. We have been made aware that there are calls being made to various banks, businesses, and community members stating that they are collecting funds on behalf of Valley High School Football and Cheer. They are leaving a 1-800 number as a call back. We have verified that no one from Valley High School or the affiliated booster clubs authorized these calls. While we do call on our community to help raise funds, we do not outsource to anyone and would not use a 1-800 number.

When it comes to schools -

I promise, y'all won't have to ask if your school is open or closed. We will post that information immediately as we get it on the app, on the web, and on social media. And talk about it on the air.

There is zero need for any school to be closed tomorrow - any potential snow won't get here until later in the evening.

IF schools were to be closed here in the Valley, Wednesday would be the potential day. That decision likely won't be made until we see how much - if any - snow is falling tomorrow.

I know many of us are saddened and heartbroken about the devastation taking place in the Houston area right now. Here is a way you can start to help! Get your students and their families involved and consider adopting a classroom that has been affected by Hurricane Harvey. The idea is that your classroom will help collect basic supplies or gift cards to help setup students with tools to get their classroom back on its feet.

UPDATE: We have had an incredible number of people and classrooms who want to help a TX classroom!! I am temporarily closing sign-ups for ""helpers."" We want to match up everyone who has signed up so far in a timely manner. We are already matching multiple groups to every TX classroom, which is GREAT!!! Many TX teachers can't get into their schools to assess the damage and their needs yet...I anticipate having more teachers sign up to be helped. As these sign ups roll in, I will reopen submissions for helping classrooms and groups
**SIGNUPS WILL REMAIN OPEN FOR TEXAS TEACHERS --> Please apply if your students and classroom need assistance, we have so many people who want to help!

Those permission slips must be turned in no later than homeroom on Monday so that we can get the correct number of glasses to the classes.

Many schools are having viewings of the eclipse. Students will only be allowed to participate if they have the permission slip returned and have NASA approved eye wear. Be looking for information from your child's school. Because of the cost of the eye wear, some schools will be watching a live stream of the eclipse rather than an outdoor viewing.

During the eclipse no one will be allowed outside of the school building unless they are participating in the viewing. This includes adults and children. This is a safety precaution due to the possibility of eye damage. If you choose to check your child out of school on the 21st, you must do so prior to 1:00 pm central or 2:00 pm eastern. According to NASA officials, the peak of the eclipse will be in our area between 1:34-1:37 central time or 2:34-2:37 eastern time.

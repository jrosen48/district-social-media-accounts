The Transportation Survey for next school year will be available on line until Wednesday, June 10th. Please fill out the survey at www.championlocal.org/bus if you have not already done so.

Just a reminder, if you have not turned in your child’s chromebook, hot spot or other items for this school year, you can still drop them off Tuesdays from 12-1 and 6-7 PM in front of the Elementary School. This is the time of year where service and maintenance occurs. If they are not returned in a timely fashion we will be forced to send them out for repair and a fee will be assessed for the service.

I wanted to take a moment to remind everyone that we will be passing out food to those in need on Tuesday’s throughout the summer. We will be adjusting the times slightly. Food will be passed out now from 12-1 and 6-7 PM.

Also, we will be sending out a survey this week by email, social media and mail to help us know how many students will need transported by bus next year. No decisions for next year have been finalized. This data will help with the decision making process as guidance becomes available.

Just a reminder, both the Middle School and High School are collecting books and chromebooks this week. Please review the dates and times to drop off your child’s items to the schools. It is very important for chromebooks to be dropped off this week so our staff can begin updating the software and prepare them for next year.

I know there are many questions that you probably have today from the Governors announcement. Our administrative team will begin working to finalize our plans for the end of the year and we will hold another town hall meeting next week to address your concerns. Please follow our facebook, instagram and school webpages for more details.

Tonight from 8:20 to 8:40, Champion Schools will be lighting the Champion Stadium to honor the Class of 2020 from 8:20 to 8:40. The stadium will be closed, but students and families may drive around to see it. You may enter the PK-8 entrance and drive around and behind the stadium. We must maintain social distancing and no one will be allowed to get out of their cars.

We will be holding our food pick up tomorrow from 12-2 and 6-7 pm in front of the PK-8 Building. You may drop off any donations at that time as well.
Stay Safe and have a good night.

We will accept donations for the food pantry again during this same time.

I wanted to let all parents know that have lost their jobs due to the Covid-19, you can still apply for the free and reduced lunch program while we are closed on our food services website. This program can also help cover the cost for workbook and other fees through the school. I know this is not the way we had planned to spend Easter and spring break, but I hope we can all enjoy time with the ones we love together or remotely and remember that this will not last forever.

Superintendent's Update",0.0,"I hope everyone has had a productive week of online learning. I want to remind everyone that we have WiFi hotspots to give to families that do not have reliable internet access at home. If you would like one, please call and leave a message at 330-847-2338. Beginning next week, we will be changing our food distribution day to Tuesday from now on. Times will be the same from 12-2 and 6-7 PM. We will accept donations for the food pantry again during this same time.

I wanted to let all parents know that have lost their jobs due to the Covid-19, you can still apply for the free and reduced lunch program while we are closed on our food services website. This program can also help cover the cost for workbook and other fees through the school. I know this is not the way we had planned to spend Easter and spring break, but I hope we can all enjoy time with the ones we love together or remotely and remember that this will not last forever. My best to you and your families. As always, we remain Champion Strong! Have a good night!

With all the recent changes, I would like to offer an opportunity for you to attend a virtual meeting to share more information and give you a chance to ask questions about our district practices moving forward.

This meeting will be held online using Zoom tomorrow night from 6:30-7:30 P.M. You can dial in to participate or login on your phone, chromebook or computer. Zoom is a meeting tool that many of our teachers have begun to use to communicate to your students and more will begin to use in the weeks to come.

Our technology coordinator will be sending you the link on how to join the meeting. You will have a chance to ask questions either by audio or through the chat feature, and I will explain how that works once we begin.

If we do not have your updated email address in FinalForms, please email me your new address so we can include you in the email tomorrow. My email is john.grabowski@championlocal.org

Hope to see you tomorrow night for our virtual chat.

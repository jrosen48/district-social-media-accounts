She stayed in host communities and volunteered at 5 different elephant sanctuaries while visiting Chiang Mai, Bangkok, and Kanchanaburi, where she was education about human-elephant conflict and finding ways to create a peaceful coexistence through community-based conversation. She also helped with reforestation efforts and increased biodiversity in areas by planting trees, helped build a check dam which provides water for elephants, and visited elementary schools where she taught English to the younger students.

""I met amazing, passionate people on this trip. I also learned the importance of community and the role it plays in nature conservation, reforestation efforts, and creating peaceful coexistence between humans and elephants.

Do you know what that means? It means it's time for our annual Chandler Prep Snowstorm! It's a way to show our amazing teachers how much we appreciate them through monetary gifts during the holiday season.

Our teachers really look forward to and are so grateful for this flurry of appreciation. Take part in this wonderful CPA tradition.

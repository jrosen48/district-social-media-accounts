CW Community,

We are working on a new ""music video"" that we would love for our community to be a part of. I won't give the title of the song away, but it is one that absolutely captures our community spirit.

I would love for your help.

How can you help?

Send me a video of your students dancing. It can be your whole family or it can just be your students. Just a short clip, as only a little clip will be used. But you can email it to my email, 22.trodriguez@nhaschools.com, or you can send it to the C.W. Art Room FB Page Inbox.

Let's get as many people involved as we can!

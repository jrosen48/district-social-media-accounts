Kindness makes you feel good. Researchers have found that thinking of others brings about lasting well-being. Kindness is contagious, and just as rewarding for the giver as the receiver.

Activity: Do as many acts of kindness as you can this week. They can be as simple as opening a door or calling or writing a letter to a loved one. Pick up trash on your daily walk, read with a sibling, or do an extra chore without being asked.

Please help us by remembering that there will be kinks to work out. There will be glitches. It takes time to smooth these out. So tomorrow we appreciate your patience with us. We will be working throughout the day to help solve any issues. Thank you in advance for understanding. After a bit of time, things become easier for all.

Tomorrow morning we start eLearning. Our teachers and staff have been working tirelessly to get this rolling. I am so proud of them. Please help us by remembering that there will be kinks to work out. There will be glitches. It takes time to smooth these out. So tomorrow we appreciate your patience with us. We will be working throughout the day to help solve any issues. Thank you in advance for understanding. After a bit of time, things become easier for all. Teachers and administrators are available by email during school hours to help with classroom questions or problems. We want the very best for all of our students and their families.

Sincerely,
Diane",2020-03-17 22:46:52,,

There is a calendar change for October. Previously, students were to be out of school on Oct. 28th for teacher professional development. We are now holding the professional development on Friday, Nov. 1st, so students will not be in school on that day. That is the day after Halloween, so your children now will have that day off. Students are now to attend on Monday, Oct. 28th. As a reminder, we also have early dismissal on Thursday, Oct. 31st.

Please mark your calendar accordingly for these dates:
Oct. 28th-School is in session.
Oct. 31st-Halloween, early dismissal at 1:20.
Nov. 1st-Professional Development, No School.

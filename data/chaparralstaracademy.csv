Our yearbook company sent some extra books that I had the option of selling or returning to the company for a refund. They came in handy since a few people wanted them. Before I returned the last few books for a refund, I wanted to check one last time to see if anyone else missed out on purchasing.

This year for the annual fundraiser, we are having a Write-A-Check Campaign.

1. You can donate by check. Please make checks payable to CSA PTSO and drop off at the front office

2. You can donate through the GoFund Me link: https://www.gofundme.com/f/chaparral-star-academy

All donations are appreciated and will be used to help with the following:

· Additional Teacher Supplies

· Student Social Events

· Donation to Student Clubs, Prom & Graduation

· Beautifying School/Maintenance Fund

· Winter Wonderland

· End of Year School Gift

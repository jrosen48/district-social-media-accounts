As you may have experienced, late this morning, a transformer issue on Quaker Road interrupted internet access and power at the Bell School and for many of our students learning remotely at Grafflin, Roaring Brook, Bell, and Horace Greeley.

The internet and power have been restored at Bell, however please note for future reference that had the power not been restored, the building would have been dismissed early due to loss of critical systems that are important to maintain our safety. We appreciate your patience as our technology systems come back online.

Our teachers also know that students may not be able to access online learning this afternoon due to home connectivity issues.

Thank you for your flexibility as we quickly pivoted to full remote instruction this morning at the high school. I was notified of a large fiber and power pole down on Route 22 at 6:30 am. At approximately 6:40 am, we were told crews were on-site, repairing a fiber cable we need to access the internet. They were unable to share with us an exact time for internet restoration. As such, we moved to remote instruction for the entire high school today so all students could attend class.

A special thank you to the many members of our faculty at Greeley, who needed to return home and prepare for class. We know this was disappointing for many of our students who were scheduled to attend class at Greeley and are sorry this happened.

We look forward to opening our doors on Tuesday morning.

Sincerely,

Your Greeley Quakers are Regional Champions!
After conceding a goal in the first 5 minutes, the Quakers dominating second half play. Grace Arrese put home a rebound off a penalty corner with about 15 minutes left in the second half to level the game at 1.
With 1:25 left in the first overtime, Lily Schoonmaker took a pass from Emma Terjesen and backhanded one past the Kingston keeper (who was exceptional) for the win.

How will my child receive Title I services in the 2020-21 school year?

We continue to discuss the safest and most effective methods in which to deliver Title I services this year to students. Much will depend on the color-coded instructional delivery model we are in and the daily/weekly schedule of the building as to how Title I services will then fold into the overarching educational plan.

Our Title Tutor team as well as our district and building administrators continue to share ideas on this topic and will continue to collaborate in putting together a Title intervention program specific to each building and its needs in the coming weeks.

Regardless of the method of delivery we know that Title I tutors will provide intervention support this year to students eligible for need at Maple Kindergarten, Munson Elementary, Park Elementary, and Chardon Middle school.

Q: Will my K-12 student be assigned a Chromebook by the district for the school year?
A: Yes. Both in-person and virtual (Blue response model) students in Grades K-12 will be assigned a Chromebook by the district for the 2020-21 school year. We are aware that many grade levels were asked to keep their Chromebook (in safekeeping) over the summertime. Please await further details from your school regarding whether this will be your child's assigned Chromebook for 2020-21 or if there will be a Chromebook pickup day for exchanging/picking up. (Specific instructions will vary, depending on grade level and school.)
P.S. We anticipate schoool-to-family communications to commence in the upcoming week.

Madeline would like to thank her family for always encouraging her to reach her goals and always supporting her in her endeavors. Madeline would also like to thank all her Business Crew pals for all the fun times over these past four years. They’re memories that she will never forget.
""I wouldn't have wanted to be on any other crew. I have loved these past four years on Business Crew, and I will cherish the friendships and memories I have made forever.""]

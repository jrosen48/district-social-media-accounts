The reported error occurs when a student attempts to enter their email studentID@ccboe.com and password. Some students are able to immediately join Zoom classes. Others are being asked to confirm the email account, which is an error. We are working with Zoom to correct this issue, which is being caused by the single sign-on (SSO) feature added to the system yesterday.

If a student has been able to join their classes, they should not have any issues today. Students who have not been able to join a Zoom class today should wait for further updates from the school system when we are able to ensure they can sign on. Zoom is working to alleviate the SSO problem.",2020-09-03 10:31:40,,

To try out, students can email ccpstv96@ccboe.com for an audition time and date. In the request, students should include an email (if different from the one used to set the audition.) An audition invitation will be emailed through Cisco Webex. Webex has an app that can be downloaded or accessed through a web browser.

For the auditions and during tapings, anchors must follow a professional dress code — students should dress as if going on a job interview. The audition consists of reading a script, and should take no longer than 15 minutes. Anchors serve one-year terms and must audition annually.

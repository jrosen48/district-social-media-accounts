I am so proud that Illinois has one of the best self-response rates in the nation! Completing the census safely online, by phone, or by mail means census takers do not have to come in person to your residence. However, 48 percent of Illinoisans still need to respond. So if you have not yet filled out your 2020 Census, please do. The online survey takes only a few minutes. If you have any questions about the census, check out this video, which can also help your students learn this important lesson in civics. Illinois’ number of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, Electoral College votes, and certain federal funding streams all depend on everyone getting counted.

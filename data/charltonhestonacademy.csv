You may have heard there was an accident with a CHA school bus. Allow me to provide some clarity. The incident occurred in the Rose City/Lupton area. Basically, a vehicle hit the front drivers side as the bus was making a left hand turn. It appears that the vehicle may have been trying to pass the bus. There are no major injuries reported and all students and staff are home safe. This incident is under investigation. I’ll keep parents informed as any additional information comes to me.

Please know Charlton Heston Academy and other surrounding schools and some businesses received a threatening phone call of a bomb being inside buildings. CHA has evacuated all students and staff and have the police in the building conducting their sweep. We have been advised that this is a bogus phone call and that their is no danger to students, staff, the community nor the building.

Again we did evacuate the building to take even more caution but will re-enter the building in a few minutes when we receive the final notice to do so.

Please call the school directly if you have questions.

Good morning Patriot Nation-

Due to the excess standing water and flooding in and around the region, school will be cancelled today, March 15, 2019. All school-related events are cancelled as well. I do apologize for the late notice as we had hoped the water levels would have decreased much more from yesterday evening until today. Nonetheless, it has been determined that traveling on some of the roads is simply not safe at this time.

As always, thank you for your support in keeping the school community safe.

Have a great weekend!

Due to the poor road conditions CHA will dismiss at 1:30 pm today. Please know buses will leave the school at 1:40 pm. This will allow all buses and other traffic to travel before it gets dusk outside, and we will expect buses to be traveling during a time where there is less traffic altogether. Parents can expect to pick their children up at the stops in the same amount of time as the normal routes with a few minutes delay due to the road conditions. Parents who are picking students up at dismissal and may be running a few minutes late, we will have all students waiting in the elementary cafeteria.

Please take your time and drive safe if you need to come to the school.

Thank you,

Good morning CHA School Community-

As you may have heard or read, there was a confirmed shooting in Houghton Lake early this morning. The shooter, or shooters have not been apprehended. CHA does have multiple bus stops in Houghton Lake and specifically in the area of the shooting. In addition, with St. Helen being adjacent to Houghton Lake, closing school is the safest choice. Please know after school programs are NOT cancelled at this time. I will provide updates as they become available.

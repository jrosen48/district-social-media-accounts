Earth Day, PE Challenge!",3.0,"Happy Earth Day! 🌎

This Week for PE, Mrs. Weldon challenges you to find items around your house that you can reuse or recycle into making PE/Sports Equipment. In my video, I gave 3 examples of how I found items in my recycling bin to create bowling, baseball and rackets! But, I'd like to see if you can make a different sport equipment. Please post a picture or video of what you made!

Good morning students and families!

I hope you all got a chance to watch my video and look at my examples on how to create a monochromatic self-portrait yesterday. Once you finish creating your self-portrait, try taking on the Bingo board art project of drawing someone at home from your family next. You already have the skills! Ask your family member to pose for you and be sure to include the details that make them unique (like hairstyle, jewelry, etc.).

Also, since you already colored your self-portrait monochromatically, try practicing coloring your family member realistically this time. Go the extra mile and add in a fun patterned background or include something they love in the background to show their personality.

I am looking forward to receiving your self-portraits and the portraits of someone you care about. Please email me photos at apawarski@CSICharter.org.

Take care,

Hi 6th Grade Families,

I know that some of you might not be able to get to StudySync on a computer at home. I found these directions for using the StudySync App. When you get the app there is an App Key which is only good for 24 hours. You use the key to set your PIN. It seems that if you are able to use the App you will be able to download the assignments and work offline. Then when the device is reconnected to the internet, the assignments will update.

Keep up the great work-

Happy Monday, to my Physical Education athletes!

This week (week 3), you will play PE BINGO! In your packet, you will find a BINGO board. Pick out some activities on the BINGO board that you would like to do. There are 5 days in a week, so try to do one each day this week! Try to do 5 in a row to get a BINGO. Or maybe you want to try to fill in the entire board! I'd love to see pictures or videos of you completing your exercises. Don't forget to also fill in week 3 on you exercise log. Below I have attached the BINGO board, just in case you may have lost it.

Happy Thursday!

Have you tried this simple, but fun art project yet? Choose one shape and create an artwork only using that one shape repetitively.
.
I decided to honor the gingko leaf shape from my favorite earrings (that I can't wear anymore because my cat destroyed the other 😢). I traced the shape, over and over, and allowed each to overlap. I then traced the shape in sharpie and colored in the smaller overlapping shapes different color. See some examples in the photo attached.
.
What shape will you choose? How will you choose to draw that shape repetitively? Send me your pictures when you’re finished!

Hi Friends!

I hope you all enjoyed your week 1, Fitness dice activity! This week you will be choosing one of the color workouts (red, yellow, green or blue). Feel free to try all of them! After you complete all of the exercises, rest for 30 seconds and do the exercises again. Have someone tell you when 12 minutes is up, then you are done! Don’t forget, you should also be filling in your exercise activity log each day! I hope you are all getting a chance to go outside and play. Some fresh air and some exercise is just what we all need right now! I would love to see pictures of you completing some of your exercises, feel free to share. Another GREAT idea would be to ask someone to help you learn to tie your sneakers, if you don’t already know how. I can’t wait to see how many new friends know how to tie their sneakers, when we get back to school! I miss all of you running around in the gym, singing to my music!

Keep safe and healthy,

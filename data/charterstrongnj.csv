We are so proud to share that BEN Founder, Dominique Lee, will be honored by the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools as a Charter School Leader of the Year alongside, Trailblazer Honoree Jalen Rose, US Representative Donald M. Payne Jr., US Representative Shelia Jackson Lee, US Representative William Lacy Clay and other noteworthy charter leaders.

Lee, of the BRICK network, said that turning around failing schools in Newark was among his network’s greatest accomplishments.

“One of the things I am most proud of is actually proving that school transformation can happen,” he told The 74. “We were able to transform some of New Jersey’s lowest-performing schools and at the end of our work, we had some of the highest student growth percentiles in the state.”

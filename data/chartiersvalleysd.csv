Senior Sarah Verduci has been selected as January's CVHS Student of the month. She's honest, trustworthy, and persistent. While the award is not based on academic achievements, Sarah is successful both in and out of the classroom. She plays 2nd base for the softball team and is a member of Interact and DECA.

When asked by a reporter if there was else she wanted the community to know about her, she immediately mentioned a charity event she is charing -- MiniTHON. Sarah hopes the community will come together on April 4 for this version of Penn State's THON, to raise money and awareness for childhood cancers.

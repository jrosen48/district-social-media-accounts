Our first day of ""school"" was encouraging! We had a high percentage of students log in and begin their classes and our continuous learning activities. I know that we had a few glitches, internet connection issues, etc. But we will continue to work through those and things will get smoother.

We were unable to obtain a direct internet connection to the Raymond gym. We are working through other options (individual hotspots) and other possible solutions.

Tomorrow lunches will be served from 11:00 AM - 12:30 PM. Thanks to our Food Service crew for their hard work! We also thank our custodial staff for the constant cleaning and for helping to keep us all safe.

Thank you for the smooth distribution of belongings and instructional materials today. We saw all but a few of you and arrangements will be made with those that couldn’t make it today.

Our continuous learning activities will begin tomorrow. There will inevitably be a few glitches and frustrations. I ask for your patience while we work through those issues. Stay in contact with your teachers and just do what you can do. It will be OK.

MTC will be working on an internet connection for the Raymond gym tomorrow. We will let you know when it is up and going. Hopefully by Wednesday.

We will begin compressing our serving times for lunch as well. Starting on Wednesday, we will serve from 11:00 AM until 12:30 PM. We do not have students showing up in that last half hour.

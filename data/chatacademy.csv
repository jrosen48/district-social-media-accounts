Columbus has issued a boil water advisory for Downtown and others sections of the city.
The city of Columbus has issued a boil alert advisory because of a power outage at the Dublin Road water plant.
Water customers in the following area are advised to bring all water used for cooking and drinking to a rolling boil for one minute until further notice:

This also could cause discolored water and potentially a temporary increase in lead levels in the water. As a standard practice, the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency recommends doing this to reduce possible lead exposure in drinking water:
If the water has not been used for several hours, run the tap until there is a noticeable temperature drop. Then, run water for 30 seconds to three minutes before using it for drinking and cooking.
Use cold water for cooking, drinking, and preparing baby formula. Boiling the water will not reduce lead.
Clean your faucet aerator.
If water customers have questions, call 614-645-8276.

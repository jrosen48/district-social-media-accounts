Chatfield's next Senior Spotlight will be focusing on someone who was on the Section Runner-Up Football Team this year. That senior is Nate Bernard. A few of Nate's favorite things are the book Where the Red Fern Grows and the movie Kicking and Screaming. During his free time, Nate enjoys fishing, hunting, and spending time with friends. Someone that Nate admires is his dad, Mike. Nate admires his dad because he can fix anything. Next year, Nate will be attending Rochester Community Technical College to start his career path in plumbing. Ten years from now, Nate hopes to be working in a job he loves. Nate, thank you for making every day exciting and good luck at RCTC! You are going to do great! Go Gophers!",2020-05-20 12:28:44,,

While this is not what I was hoping for, at least we know now how to plan.

Chatfield FFA has partnered with Kwik Trip to showcase an agricultural commodity each week and donate it to our very own Chatfield Community Food Shelf . Why are we doing this? It is so easy to support our local farmers by purchasing local and buying from companies like Kwik Trip that source their products locally and what could be better than giving to your own community food shelf. Support our local farmers ANY way that you can today and always, without them we cannot eat the products we enjoy.

Chatfield High School's next Senior Spotlight will focus on Jake Mueller. Jake is a huge Lord of the Rings fan. So much so that his favorite book is The Hobbit and his favorite movie is Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. One of Jake's favorite high school memories is being involved in Rube Goldberg. Jake was a part of a Rube team that received national recognition. Jake admires his dad because he has always been a hard worker. Next year, Jake will be attending the University of Wisconsin Stout. Ten years from now, Jake is hoping he will have a stable job. Jake, it has been an honor having you be a part of Chatfield's school culture and we cannot wait to see you succeed in your future endeavors. Good luck, Jake! Go Gophers!",2020-05-07 10:50:42,,

Elma is a country music listener who loves riding horses, fishing, and spending time outside as well as spending time with family and friends. One person that Elma looks up to is Chatfield's very own Ms. Fritz. According to Elma, ""Ms. Fritz does not let a person's mistakes define them, but rather their accomplishments and potential."" Next year Elma will be attending Winona State University and plans on majoring in Social Work. Elma, Chatfield High School will miss your hard-working and friendly attitude.

Elma Erding is the next Chatfield student to be in the Senior Spotlight. Elma is a country music listener who loves riding horses, fishing, and spending time outside as well as spending time with family and friends. One person that Elma looks up to is Chatfield's very own Ms. Fritz. According to Elma, ""Ms. Fritz does not let a person's mistakes define them, but rather their accomplishments and potential."" Next year Elma will be attending Winona State University and plans on majoring in Social Work. Elma, Chatfield High School will miss your hard-working and friendly attitude. Thank you for making Chatfield a better place!

Landon Bance...

Landon is used to being in the spotlight. During his career at Chatfield, he has made many high-pressure shots for the Chatfield Gopher Boy's Basketball Team. Landon is going to continue to play basketball next year at UW Superior. During his spare time, Landon listens to the Beatles and watches the Star Wars movies. 10 years from now, Landon hopes to have a good job, a nice home, and maybe a family. He even hopes he can celebrate the Vikings winning a Super Bowl at some point. Thank you for all the excitement and energy you have filled Chatfield High School with, Landon. We will be cheering you on and are excited to hear your success stories from UW Superior!

Brennen Round...

""Being a Kardashian should never be a goal!"" According to Brennen, this is a quote to live your life by. There are very few dull days around Chatfield High School thanks to Brennen. He loves to fish, forecast weather, watch the Alien Trilogy, and listen to music. Brennen has shown strong leadership, smarts, humanity, and empathy. Brennen's secret talent (or not so secret) is his ability to forecast the weather. In school, people base their plans off of Brennen's predictions. He is not sure of his future plans, but based on his time in Chatfield, we know that Brennen will always keep people around him smiling and make the world a better place. You will be missed Brennen.

Here is some further clarification on the upcoming vacation day (Friday) to help in your family planning.

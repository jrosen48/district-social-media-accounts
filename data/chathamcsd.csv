We share this news because our local neighbors are joining together for a great cause!

Today officially begins our School Supply Drive from 4-8 in the MED parking lot.

Little Nest Daycare in Chatham Center donated several hundred dollars of School supplies and gave us a good start!

Yesterday, we received word that Bimi’s Cheese Shop in Chatham is graciously donating $1000 to our cause! The PTA will be able to fill mulitple carts of supplies!

An extra box of crayons, left over folders from last school year or extra loose leaf paper will ALL help!

As a community, we can support our staff and students as we navigate a new way of life with education. Please share this post!",3.0,"Chatham MED PTA

The PTA is holding two drive-thru drop off school supply events in the MED parking lot (to the left). If you are able to purchase one or more of the items from the flyer, I know our educators and families who may struggle getting the supplies would greatly appreciate it. After surveying the staff, we have compiled a list of items either they tend to run out of quickly or purchase out of pocket. **Please note** Social distancing must remain in effect with both events.

Dear Chatham Families,

I wanted to let you know we have made learning materials for students available online at www.chathamcentralschools.com. They are posted by school building on the “Coronavirus” information link found on the District homepage, and in the “Announcements” sections of the MED, CMS, and CHS homepages.

I also thought it was worth noting that the District Chromebooks lent to students have built in safety features that provide the same level of firewall and content filtering protection at home as they do when students use them here at school.

Lastly, for the small number of families who were unable to pick up their student packets yesterday, we have made arrangements to deliver the packets to your home this week, so please be on the lookout for them.

Parents and Guardians,

Today we practiced lockdown drills in all three of our school buildings. We were assisted by officers from the Chatham Police Department, Columbia County Sheriffs' Office, and the State Police.

The students and staff handled the drill very well, and we were able to move students to secured areas.

It is important that we periodically practice these drills with as many different variables as possible.

If you have any questions, please contact your building principal or my office.

Sincerely,

Sal DeAngelo

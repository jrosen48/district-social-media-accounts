Graduation was originally scheduled for May 30th; however, due to the current situation with COVID-19 graduation will either be postponed until later this summer or we will host a virtual ceremony. With that being said, Dr. Lovell and everyone at MECHS would prefer to host traditional graduation with virtual being the absolute last resort.

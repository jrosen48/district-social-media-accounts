Mrs. Simmons and PTC partnered to bring a new STEM program, based on BMX bikes, to Hillside. Students will design and model bike tracks using computer modeling and physical materials. They will have bikes to build, ride, and maintain. They will be able to visit a BMX track and even talk to a BMX Olympian! This program, combined with Tesoro Viejo's miles of trails, will be a fun and educational experience for our students.

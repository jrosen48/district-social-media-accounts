The seniors of 2020 have received their yearbooks! We plan on distributing other
pre-ordered yearbooks on the days designated for students to come and pick
up their locker contents, June 17,18,19 from 4-7 p.m.

You may also purchase a copy of the yearbook during those times, even if
you didn't order ahead. To purchase, make a check for $48.60 (includes tax)
payable to CCRS Yearbook Club, or cash in that amount. Steve Patnode will
be at school to handle the transaction.

The yearbook will also remain on sale in the Main Office. Calling ahead to
say you'd like to come in to purchase a yearbook is best, 518-846-7135.

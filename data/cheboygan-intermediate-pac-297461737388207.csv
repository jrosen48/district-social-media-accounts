Pendulum Painting is the kit of the week for kids 8-14. We're taking you outside to explore the intersection of science & art: our paint is sidewalk chalk paint! Get ready to get messy as you splat and spin some surprising designs!
Want to get in on the action but can't pick up a kit? Find a recipe for sidewalk paint and ideas for pendulums at this link. And send us photos of your gravity art!!!

After visiting with their principal, we have learned that they have a small set of visitor bleachers that hold 360 people in normal situation (no social distancing). They have been gracious enough to offer to allow fans to sit in lawn chairs on the track to help with social distancing.

For those who cannot make the road trip, I found a website www.hugofootball.com that has a link at the top that says ""Watch games here..."" This link will take you to a radio station's Facebook page that covers Hugo games.

This year will be the fourth award of the Jerry Don Hurst Memorial Scholarship.

The $500 scholarship will be awarded to a Checotah senior who plans to attend college or a trade/technical school.

Please help me get the word out to Checotah seniors. The application should be posted to the high school website shortly, and I believe there should be hard copy applications in English class. Deadline to submit all information is April 2nd.

One evening after school, unbeknownst to him, he was given a poison laced drink containing potassium cyanide by two classmates. He died within minutes of taking a sip of the drink. Both classmates were convicted of murder and sentenced to prison.

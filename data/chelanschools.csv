Congratulations to Chelan Middle School teacher and 8th grade football coach Clayton Plummer! He has been named the District 6 Middle School Football Coach of the Year!

The Chelan Pirates went undefeated this year, 5-0. We appreciate all he does, as well as Coach Lund and all the football coaches that work with our student-athletes in making them successful on and off the field. Go Pirates!",2020-01-16 14:21:51,,

Chelan Middle School is so excited and proud to announce that Olivia Strandberg is the Regional Spelling Bee champion! After 9 rounds, the field was down to two spellers. Olivia correctly spelled “glockenspiel,” and after her opponent from Omak misspelled a tricky word (mnemonic), Olivia correctly spelled “lahar” for the win!

But Olivia’s not only the Regional Spelling Bee Champion... she has also won an all-expenses paid trip to Washington, DC to compete in the Scripps National Spelling Bee May 26-31! The spelling bee will be televised on ESPN. What an outstanding accomplishment!

Lauren Ware competed as well, and made it to the top 7 spellers! She was eliminated on the word “Kudzu”.

Go Lauren and go Olivia and go Pirates!!",0.0,"Congratulations to Olivia Strandberg, who won the Regional Spelling Bee, and will be representing Chelan at the Scripps National Spelling Bee!

Good Evening Parents,

This afternoon in his daily press conference, Governor Baker announced that schools will remain closed in Massachusetts for the duration of the 2019/20 school year. We will not be returning to our school buildings for classes this year, remote learning will continue for the rest of the school year. As this decision does not surprise me, it at least provides a level of certainty with regard to our end of year schooling and helps frame the transitional work ahead.

I will work with our school leadership teams to address many of the commonly asked questions about this abrupt end to the school year in my weekly update. As I have mentioned previously, I feel very badly for our transition-year students (i.e. 4th grade to middle school, 8th grade to high school, and 12th grade to college or career). Please know we will work to make the transitions as smooth as possible and honor end-of-year activities and celebrations in some way, shape or form. More to follow.

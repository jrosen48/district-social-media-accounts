This is my 10th year teaching and I am so excited it will be at Elkins Park School! I spent the last year as a long term sub for the Cheltenham School District and absolutely loved working at CHS and EP. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, camping, reading and spending time outdoors. I'm looking forward to another great year with a new group of students!

Dear Cheltenham Families and Staff,

We are in the final lap of the 2019-20 school year. Days were sprints and months marathons. These past few months have reminded me of a Walter D. Wintle quote my high school track coach Mrs. Mackey used to keep us motivated to hold strong and finish:

If you think you are beaten, you are;
If you think you dare not, you don‚Äôt;
If you‚Äôd like to win, but think you can‚Äôt,
It‚Äôs almost a cinch you won‚Äôt.
If you think you‚Äôll lose, you‚Äôre lost,
For out in the word we find
Success begins with a fellow‚Äôs will,
It‚Äôs all in the state of mind.

In their caps and gowns and waving ‚Äúthank you‚Äù and other signs, seniors started the parade at their elementary schools, then made their way through the township with stops at Elkins Park School, Cedarbrook Middle School and Cheltenham High School. The students were met with fanfare at each stop, including piano and vocal performances of their school songs at Cheltenham and Myers elementaries.

Due to coronavirus, the parade replaced the traditional ‚ÄúSenior Walk‚Äù through the students‚Äô lower schools and offered teachers and students one final opportunity to say goodbye.

In the past few days, I found myself experiencing a profound sense of joy and pride. It is not because my heart has stopped mourning the lives that have been taken so brutally or my anger and sadness with regard to the injustice and racism in this country have completely subsided. The joy comes from watching the sense of accomplishment and unencumbered elation on the faces of our young graduates. As they walked across the stage in their caps, gowns, stoles and cords, wearing colorful outfits and fancy shoes and donning extravagant mortarboard decorations, my heart was overflowing with happiness. Though the number of family members in attendance was smaller than at a typical graduation, the love our families radiated is just as powerful. I am so proud of this class and their accomplishments, and eagerly await seeing more of them on the stage on Monday and Tuesday.

Communications Committee May 2020 Update

With co-chair Joel Fishbein presiding and board members Charles Burdell-Williams and Tyrone Scott, superintendent Dr. Wagner Marseille and members of the administration in attendance, the communications committee convened a virtual meeting on Thursday, May 28. The agenda included the monthly communications analytics, social media year-end review and Coronavirus-related media relations. Thanks to spring sports senior salutes and other senior- and staff-related campaigns, Facebook metrics were up in most categories. The year-in-review included a platform-by-platform look at successful campaigns and cumulative statistics. Coronavirus-related media relations included a few trend articles in the Inquirer, a story about the new teacher contracts on Inquirer.com and some television hits focused on senior events. The Communications Committee will reconvene in August.

I‚Äôve been engaged in deep reflection, knowing I should not react hastily when emotions overwhelm me.

Dear Cheltenham Families and Staff -

Good evening. Though our schools remain closed as a result of COVID-19, our administrative team and staff have been conducting daily zoom meetings to discuss how to better support our students and families during this pandemic. These past two days, however, have been about what‚Äôs right in front of us, serving our most in-need families to do our part to ease their burdens.

For the second consecutive Wednesday, we distributed grab-n-go meal bags to our most in-need families. This week, we nearly topped 500 meal bags, all with enough food for several days. Our next meal bag distribution is on Wednesday, April 1 from 10 a.m. - noon at Administration Building (2000 Ashbourne Rd., Elkins Park).

What will you miss most about Cheltenham?
‚ÄúThe thing I will miss most about Cheltenham is the community. I'm really at home here now, and I love this school. I'll miss just being here, seeing everyone, and participating in school events. Having to adapt to a new community of strangers will be a really big challenge, especially because of how comfortable I am now.‚Äù

Dear Cheltenham School District Families -

The Cheltenham School District learned this afternoon from the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) Secretary Pedro Rivera that schools will not be penalized if they fail to meet the annual day or hour requirements as the result of coronavirus-related closures.

To that end, during the next 14 days of the Pennsylvania Governor Wolf-imposed school shutdown, the Cheltenham School District will provide enrichment resources and activities to keep our K-12 students engaged. Students who do not complete these activities will not fall behind, nor will they be penalized. These resources are purely optional.

CHELTENHAM >> The Cheltenham boys basketball team held off a furious second-half comeback from Jhamir Brickus and Coatesville to earn its first trip to the District 1-6A semifinals in three seasons.

Brickus scored 23 of his game-high 30 points after halftime as the No. 6 seeded Red Raiders cut a 15-point deficit in the third down to one in the fourth but the No. 3 Panthers got just enough late baskets, stops and free throws to hold on and claim a 68-61 second round victory Friday night.

CHELTENHAM >> The Cheltenham boys basketball team held off a furious second-half comeback from Jhamir Brickus and Coatesville to earn its first trip to the District 1-6A semifinals in three seasons.

Brickus scored 23 of his game-high 30 points after halftime as the No. 6 seeded Red Raiders cut a 15-point deficit in the third down to one in the fourth but the No. 3 Panthers got just enough late baskets, stops and free throws to hold on and claim a 68-61 second round victory Friday night.

‚ÄúWe just had to make sure we stayed focused,‚Äù Cheltenham senior Jaelen McGlone said.‚Ä¶",,,

With its 62-41 victory Friday at Hatboro-Horsham, the Panthers boys basketball team wrapped up the Suburban One League American Conference title for the first time in more than a decade.

With the hoops squad‚Äôs fifth league title solidified, Cheltenham can claim American Conference titles in football and boys basketball in the same season for the first time in school history. With Ryan Nase at the helm, the football team won the conference title this fall with a perfect 6-0 mark, en route to playing in the state finals.

Adding intrigue to the Panthers‚Äô accomplishments is if the boys basketball team - led by second-year coach Pat Fleury - can win its final two regular season games this week, it will complete the season with a perfect 14-0 record, marking the first time in school history both teams will complete their league slates unblemished!

The Cheltenham Board of School Directors spent this past Saturday strengthening their collective understanding of and commitment to cultural proficiency on retreat with diversity/cultural proficiency trainer Dr. Barbara Moore Williams. The group examined the cultural proficiency continuum and its essential elements, barriers and guiding principles. They took a spin on the social identity wheel, an exercise which encourages participants to identify and reflect on the various ways they identify socially, how those identities become visible or more keenly felt at different times, and how those identities impact the ways others perceive or treat them. They also spent time examining teacher and student identities. With the finalization of its equity statement and current work on an equity policy, the board exhibits tremendous support for cultural proficiency, equity, access and opportunity for all students.

As Wyncote enters the New Year, we started off on a new adventure. Today we explored the Wyncote Pride PBIS Safari. Each student received a passport to document their learning. As a class, the students travel to a new destination each day for a 20 min tour of that location with one of our guides. At the location, the explorers learn the behavior expectations for this area. Each expectation is stated in a kid-friendly and positive action phrase. Students are given chances to practice the expectations and then receive a ""stamp"" for the passport. We shared the new voice level posters as part of this lesson. We will be using this common language and expectations to reinforce positive behavior. We will continue this safari every morning this week and next. We will end with a bus lesson at the end of next week, Please ask your child what expectations they explore each day!

The plaque is symbolic of Marlowe‚Äôs years-old stick figure collection representing those who perished at Aushwitz. Marlowe conceived of the stick figure project in 1996 as way to help students put into perspective the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust. The project is approaching 1.3 million stick figures, which represents only children nine and under, and covers the entire Elkins Park School gym. The class is determined to reach 1.5 million stick figures before Marlowe creates a stick figure exhibition at Gratz College in 2020.

In all, more than two dozen Polar Panthers took the plunge, raising nearly $6,000, 170 percent of the team's fundraising goal. With the Plunge's overall top fundraiser, the Polar Panthers finished second among 11 teams in amount raised, second only to the host school.

Besides being a choir nerd, I am passionate about connecting music to students' personal lives and to the world around them, all while creating quality musical experiences and performances. In my spare time, I love to visit Bethany Beach, Delaware, play the organ at my church, and watch “Parks and Recreation” with my closest friends.

I hope this letter finds you doing well and remaining safe. As Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf moves Montgomery County into the “Green” phase, members of the district’s office of education and operations departments continue to meet weekly to collaborate and problem-solve, and review the most recent information from federal, state and local health agencies and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE).

Just this week, PDE issued new guidance, in partnership with Regional Educational Laboratory (REL) Mid-Atlantic at Mathematica, one of the nation’s foremost social policy research firms. The 60-page report is divided into three key parts: Emerging evidence on COVID-19 and school closures; key Informant interviews; and agent-based model predictions.

It became clear quickly that the 2019-2020 season would abruptly come to a close leaving many — including our talented seniors — without a final send-off.

The CHSvJBB, however, did not take these challenges as defeats. Members proved their resiliency and came together to produce an incredible performance of one of this year’s selections.

We would like to wish everyone a safe and happy summer. To JBB seniors, congratulations and good luck with your future endeavors.

Dear Cheltenham Families and Staff,

We are in the final lap of the 2019-20 school year. Days were sprints and months marathons. These past few months have reminded me of a Walter D. Wintle quote my high school track coach Mrs. Mackey used to keep us motivated to hold strong and finish:

If you think you are beaten, you are;
If you think you dare not, you don’t;
If you’d like to win, but think you can’t,
It’s almost a cinch you won’t.
If you think you’ll lose, you’re lost,
For out in the word we find

Dear Cheltenham Families and Staff,

We are in the final lap of the 2019-20 school year. Days were sprints and months marathons. These past few months have reminded me of a Walter D. Wintle quote my high school track coach Mrs. Mackey used to keep us motivated to hold strong and finish:

If you think you are beaten, you are;
If you think you dare not, you don’t;
If you’d like to win, but think you can’t,
It’s almost a cinch you won’t.
If you think you’ll lose, you’re lost,
For out in the word we find
Success begins with a fellow’s will,
It’s all in the state of mind.

Cheltenham High School seniors took one final trip down memory lane at the inaugural CHS Parade of Schools on Wednesday, June 10. With signs and noisemakers, teachers, staff and administrators packed the bus loops at all seven of CSD’s schools to cheer on members of the Class of 2020 as they parade by in cars.

In their caps and gowns and waving “thank you” and other signs, seniors started the parade at their elementary schools, then made their way through the township with stops at Elkins Park School, Cedarbrook Middle School and Cheltenham High School. The students were met with fanfare at each stop, including piano and vocal performances of their school songs at Cheltenham and Myers elementaries.

Due to coronavirus, the parade replaced the traditional “Senior Walk” through the students’ lower schools and offered teachers and students one final opportunity to say goodbye.

The joy comes from watching the sense of accomplishment and unencumbered elation on the faces of our young graduates. As they walked across the stage in their caps, gowns, stoles and cords, wearing colorful outfits and fancy shoes and donning extravagant mortarboard decorations, my heart was overflowing with happiness. Though the number of family members in attendance was smaller than at a typical graduation, the love our families radiated is just as powerful. I am so proud of this class and their accomplishments, and eagerly await seeing more of them on the stage on Monday and Tuesday.

Communications Committee May 2020 Update

With co-chair Joel Fishbein presiding and board members Charles Burdell-Williams and Tyrone Scott, superintendent Dr. Wagner Marseille and members of the administration in attendance, the communications committee convened a virtual meeting on Thursday, May 28. The agenda included the monthly communications analytics, social media year-end review and Coronavirus-related media relations. Thanks to spring sports senior salutes and other senior- and staff-related campaigns, Facebook metrics were up in most categories. The year-in-review included a platform-by-platform look at successful campaigns and cumulative statistics. Coronavirus-related media relations included a few trend articles in the Inquirer, a story about the new teacher contracts on Inquirer.com and some television hits focused on senior events. The Communications Committee will reconvene in August.

Like so many of you, I have been searching for the words to describe my feelings in light of the protests and violence taking place and anger on display in more than two dozen cities across our country. I wanted to communicate with you much sooner, but I have been angry. So as part of my training, I am using the practice of the 3Ps and an A (Pause, Paraphrase, Probe and Acknowledge) of cultural proficiency. I’ve been engaged in deep reflection, knowing I should not react hastily when emotions overwhelm me.

As part of his Avalon Foundation Design Fellowship, CBK project based learning teacher Isaac Stanford created a student voice-focused video highlighting the three core practices (collaboration, student choice and community partnerships) of the class’ Manual Cinema project. In this project, students connected their previous assignment, the story map project, to creating cinematic shadow puppets. The goal was to create entertaining and informative movies to introduce their Cheltenham Elementary School “buddies” to the places they researched in the story map project. Both videos will be featured on High Tech High’s UnBoxed website as part of its effort to showcase project based learning in public school classrooms.

This week, we honor our more than 40 spring sports senior student-athletes from baseball, softball, girls lacrosse, boys volleyball, and boys, girls and unified track and field. Their seasons may have been canceled but our love for them was not! Their years of training, dedication to achieving goals and sportsmanship will not soon be forgotten.
CHS Athletics hung these 40+ posters on the fence along Rices Mill Rd. in front of the high school for the entire community to see. If you have the opportunity, check them out.

I hope this communication finds you doing well and staying safe. It’s difficult to grasp that we are winding down this most “surreal” school year. While not without its challenges, distance learning has revealed a strong collective resolve, a bottomless well of grace, and a commitment to educating our youth among our families.

With June approaching, celebrations aren’t far behind. Though unlike any end-of-year anyone has witnessed, this spring, we will stand for our elementary school fourth-graders heading to Elkins Park; EP sixth graders moving to Cedarbrook; CBK eighth graders being promoted to the high school, and CHS seniors poised to begin their next adventure. We will adjust and adapt and I can’t wait to celebrate them all - just in new ways.

In the midst of the chaos the coronavirus pandemic is causing, one thing remains certain. The Class of 2020 has plans … and we can’t wait to find out what they are. Whether they plan to attend college, join the workforce, learn a trade, take a gap year or serve our country, National Decision Day on Friday, May 1 is CSD’s opportunity to celebrate them and their future plans.

Since we won’t be able to celebrate at the high school by taking pictures of students wearing garb reflecting their choices, the counseling and communications offices are partnering to host a virtual National Decision Day.

Participating is simple. Take a high quality photo of your student wherein they announce their plans (even if it’s just them holding a sheet of paper with their decision) and forward it, along with their name and decision to communications@cheltenham.org by Wednesday, April 29 at 5 p.m.

Questions can be addressed to Ms. Lori Cohen. (lcohen@cheltenham.org)

March 26, 2020

Dear Cheltenham Families and Staff -

Good evening. Though our schools remain closed as a result of COVID-19, our administrative team and staff have been conducting daily zoom meetings to discuss how to better support our students and families during this pandemic.

Dear Cheltenham Families and Staff -

Good evening. Though our schools remain closed as a result of COVID-19, our administrative team and staff have been conducting daily zoom meetings to discuss how to better support our students and families during this pandemic. These past two days, however, have been about what’s right in front of us, serving our most in-need families to do our part to ease their burdens.

For the second consecutive Wednesday, we distributed grab-n-go meal bags to our most in-need families. This week, we nearly topped 500 meal bags, all with enough food for several days. Our next meal bag distribution is on Wednesday, April 1 from 10 a.m. - noon at Administration Building (2000 Ashbourne Rd., Elkins Park).

Which teacher(s) made the biggest impact on you and why? ""Mr. Deiley and Mrs. Putterman have made the biggest impact. Mr. Deiley has shown me that I need to work hard to get answers and solve problems, not just lean on other people. Mrs. Putterman has always been a fun teacher and has taught me the most about life outside of the classroom. I've loved all her classes.""

Dear Cheltenham School District Families -

The Cheltenham School District learned this afternoon from the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) Secretary Pedro Rivera that schools will not be penalized if they fail to meet the annual day or hour requirements as the result of coronavirus-related closures.

To that end, during the next 14 days of the Pennsylvania Governor Wolf-imposed school shutdown, the Cheltenham School District will provide enrichment resources and activities to keep our K-12 students engaged. Students who do not complete these activities will not fall behind, nor will they be penalized. These resources are purely optional.

Senior Evie Gorman earned a 2020 Scholastic Art Awards honorable mention for her image of classmate Kyra Quigley. “Scholastic Art recognition is a huge honor for our awardees and highlights the exceptional talent of our students,” said teacher Lori Oliveras.

The Scholastic Art & Writing Awards are the nation’s longest-running and most prestigious recognition program for creative high school and middle school students. This year, students submitted nearly 350,000 works of visual art and writing to the Scholastic Awards, and more than 90,000 works were recognized at the regional level and celebrated in local exhibitions and ceremonies.

Senior Evie Gorman earned a 2020 Scholastic Art Awards honorable mention for her image of classmate Kyra Quigley. “Scholastic Art recognition is a huge honor for our awardees and highlights the exceptional talent of our students,” said teacher Lori Oliveras.

The Scholastic Art & Writing Awards are the nation’s longest-running and most prestigious recognition program for creative high school and middle school students. This year, students submitted nearly 350,000 works of visual art and writing to the Scholastic Awards, and more than 90,000 works were recognized at the regional level and celebrated in local exhibitions and ceremonies. Visual and literary arts luminaries serve as jurors. Some jurors are past award recipients. Panelists look for works that best exemplify originality, technical skill and the emergence of a personal voice or vision.”

With its 62-41 victory Friday at Hatboro-Horsham, the Panthers boys basketball team wrapped up the Suburban One League American Conference title for the first time in more than a decade.

With the hoops squad’s fifth league title solidified, Cheltenham can claim American Conference titles in football and boys basketball in the same season for the first time in school history. With Ryan Nase at the helm, the football team won the conference title this fall with a perfect 6-0 mark, en route to playing in the state finals.

Adding intrigue to the Panthers’ accomplishments is if the boys basketball team - led by second-year coach Pat Fleury - can win its final two regular season games this week, it will complete the season with a perfect 14-0 record, marking the first time in school history both teams will complete their league slates unblemished!

The Cheltenham Board of School Directors spent this past Saturday strengthening their collective understanding of and commitment to cultural proficiency on retreat with diversity/cultural proficiency trainer Dr. Barbara Moore Williams. The group examined the cultural proficiency continuum and its essential elements, barriers and guiding principles. They took a spin on the social identity wheel, an exercise which encourages participants to identify and reflect on the various ways they identify socially, how those identities become visible or more keenly felt at different times, and how those identities impact the ways others perceive or treat them. They also spent time examining teacher and student identities. With the finalization of its equity statement and current work on an equity policy, the board exhibits tremendous support for cultural proficiency, equity, access and opportunity for all students.

January 3 at 1:02 AM ·

As Wyncote enters the New Year, we started off on a new adventure. Today we explored the Wyncote Pride PBIS Safari. Each student received a passport to document their learning. As a class, the students travel to a new destination each day for a 20 min tour of that location with one of our guides. At the location, the explorers learn the behavior expectations for this area. Each expectation is stated in a kid-friendly and positive action phrase. Students are given chances to practice the expectations and then receive a ""stamp"" for the passport. We shared the new voice level posters as part of this lesson. We will be using this common language and expectations to reinforce positive behavior. We will continue this safari every morning this week and next. We will end with a bus lesson at the end of next week, Please ask your child what expectations they explore each day!

Elkins Park teacher Lise Marlowe's sixth grade class presented 93-year-old Auschwitz survivor Itka Zygmontowicz a special plaque dedicated to the memory of her 11-year old brother Srulek and 13-year old sister, Syzl, who perished at the concentration camp on November 22, 1942.

The plaque is symbolic of Marlowe’s years-old stick figure collection representing those who perished at Aushwitz. Marlowe conceived of the stick figure project in 1996 as way to help students put into perspective the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust. The project is approaching 1.3 million stick figures, which represents only children nine and under, and covers the entire Elkins Park School gym. The class is determined to reach 1.5 million stick figures before Marlowe creates a stick figure exhibition at Gratz College in 2020.

Friday, Dec. 13, Polar Panthers from the high school took a long walk off a short platform into a freezing cold pool in support of CHS Unified Bocce and Track and Field at the annual Philadelphia Suburban Plunge at Souderton Area High School.

In all, more than two dozen Polar Panthers took the plunge, raising nearly $6,000, 170 percent of the team's fundraising goal. With the Plunge's overall top fundraiser, the Polar Panthers finished second among 11 teams in amount raised, second only to the host school.

Interim principal Dr. Renato Lajara jumped first, earning style points with a half twist, followed by a belly flop from football coach Ryan Nase.

Against the backdrop of a YouTube video of a roaring fire, more than 20 CHS Skills for Life (S4L) students enjoyed the fruits (turkey rolls?) of their labor with students, teachers and administrators at their 10th annual Thanksgiving Feast.

“This is one of my favorite days of the year,” said Skills for Life teacher Philip Cohen. “Everyone has such excitement and willingness to help in any way they can.”

While balancing jobs and class, the S4L students cooked a tasty meal that included turkey rolls with stuffing, cranberry sauce, pineapple stuffing, macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes, salad, cornbread and crescent rolls. They also outfitted their S4L suite in festive holiday decor. Many of the students’ families provided the desserts.

The event is an excellent opportunity for the Skills for Life students to showcase the skills they’ve learned including shopping, budgeting and soft skills like entertaining guests.

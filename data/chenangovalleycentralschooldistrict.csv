Every year, our YES Safe Choices LEADers visit hundreds of classrooms and speak to thousands of elementary students about the dangers of drugs and alcohol.

Every year we say thank you with a special reception to recognize these incredible young people. While we couldn’t make that happen this year, we’re still recognizing our most outstanding leaders through the Jill Kavanagh Memorial Scholarship.

Our next honoree is Dominick Lomonaco from Chenango Valley High School, a 4 year member of YES LEADs and president of his group for both his Junior and Senior years.

Dom’s has shown remarkable leadership throughout his time at YES, always being there to offer support and guidance to his fellow students. In addition to several accolades and awards, Dom has earned the respect of his teachers, coaches, administrators and students alike and truly walks the walk of YES LEADs and YES Safe Choices.

We’re all incredibly proud of the leader you’ve become, Dom!

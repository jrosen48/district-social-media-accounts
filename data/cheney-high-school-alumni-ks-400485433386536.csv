The Cross County team qualified three runners, Ethan Albers, Abbye Hudson, and Mollie Reno. They will run Saturday morning in Lawrence at Rim Rock Farm.

The Cheney High School Boys Basketball team is headed to State!

We'd like to have a community send off for all that want to be involved. On Thursday the boys will load the Cardinal Bus at 12:45 and go on Lake Road to the south end of town. They'll head north on Main Street and we want to send them off right!

Poke your head out of the businesses and line the streets with signs and well wishes if you can!

Elementary, Middle and High School students that are able will be released to line Main Street and do the same.

Thanks for all of your support and Go Cardinals!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=605253679576376&id=400485433386536,,0.0,"From: Todd Hague, AD

Our Chapter voted to add $1000 from their Blue and Gold Sales. The project that was chosen was the Cheney Senior Citizen Center remodel. The first step was to move everything from the main floor to the basement. They removed old trim, crown molding, wall tiles, old carpet, painted trim, ceiling, and walls, and tomorrow will help with the flooring.

Parents, Guardians, and Staff Members,

In an effort to assist the district in understanding the number of parents who would prefer some form of on-site instruction in the fall, and those who would prefer a strictly on-line option, we emailed a second parent survey on Friday, July 17th. It is critical that we have as many parents as possible complete the survey so that we have accurate data to analyze as part of our ongoing planning process (as of this morning we have received 2,887 responses). Therefore, I am urging each of you to take a few minutes to complete the survey prior to 4:00 p.m. this afternoon.

If you have any questions related to the survey, please contact our district office at 509-559-4502.

Have a great day!

Since the beginning of his freshman year at Cheney High School, Jackson Schreiber knew a cyber career was meant for him.

He participated in the Cyber Patriot competitions and took additional cyber courses hoping the knowledge would help him reach his goal.

Schreiber's career dreams came true when he joined the U.S. Army as a cyber operations specialist. After enlisting out of Cheney Army Recruiting Station, Schreiber completed Basic Combat Training and is now attending Advanced Individual Training.

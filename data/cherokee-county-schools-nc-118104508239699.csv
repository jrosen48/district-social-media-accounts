Attention Ranger families. Today, as a result of contact tracing we have received directives that a significant number of the Ranger staff must report for testing and begin quarantine immediately.

Attention Cherokee County Families: Tomorrow March 16th we will begin allowing meal pick up at six of our schools. These are Andrews Elementary, Peachtree Elementary, Martins Creek Elementary Middle, Murphy Elementary, Hiwassee Dam School, and Ranger Elementary Middle. Parents and students can pick up the meals (2 at once a breakfast and a lunch for later) between 8am and 1pm. If you need food delivered to your child please call their school or call central office 837-2722 and give Kristie or Cindy your name, address, and numbers of students in your care. The students do not need to be with you to pick up the meals. All school aged students are eligible for free. We are also in the process of working to roll out child care assistance for families who have no alternatives and need to work. Please tell our students that their teachers and principals love them and miss them and will see them again soon. Thank you all for your support during this mandated closure.",0.0,"Jeana Conley

Attention Cherokee County Families: Tomorrow March 16th we will begin allowing meal pick up at six of our schools. These are Andrews Elementary, Peachtree Elementary, Martins Creek Elementary Middle, Murphy Elementary, Hiwassee Dam School, and Ranger Elementary Middle. Parents and students can pick up the meals (2 at once a breakfast and a lunch for later) between 8am and 1pm. If you need food delivered to your child please call their school or call central office 837-2722 and give Kristie or Cindy your name, address, and numbers of students in your care. The students do not need to be with you to pick up the meals. All school aged students are eligible for free. We are also in the process of working to roll out child care assistance for families who have no alternatives and need to work.

Andrews Elementary was blessed with a new sign yesterday, thanks to the hard work and generosity of Junaluska Baptist Church! The church provided the materials and the sign was constructed by member Billy Carringer. AHS senior, Cade Ward, painted it, and two other members, Melvin Hicks and Chris Walker, installed it! We are so touched by the time, talent, love, and money given to bless us in this way!

Hello Murphy Elementary community. Today we had a fire in the kitchen at Murphy Elementary as a result of an electrical issue. The cafeteria and school was quickly evacuated and the staff at MES had the fire contained in less than 3 minutes. The Murphy Fire department was quickly on scene and the building was declared safe by the fire chief. As a result of this the cafeteria and lunchroom will be cleaned by a professional cleaning service and new equipment installed. This should be a quick process and we hope to have the cafeteria back open by early next week. In the meantime the staff has made arrangements for breakfast and lunch to be served and temporary serving lines have been set up. During this time the new ""Super Snack"" will not be served. Otherwise it will be business as usual at MES. Thank you for your support.",3.0,"Murphy Elementary School

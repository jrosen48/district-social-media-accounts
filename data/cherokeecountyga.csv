This week we‚Äôre heading out to Bascomb and Oak Grove for our #TravelingTuesdays adventure!

‚ÄúBascomb and Oak Grove are two communities that grew up in Southwest Cherokee County around churches and schools. The two communities were close together and in many ways similar so that their separate identities are often hard to distinguish. Bascomb community was on the Bell‚Äôs Ferry Road near the Bascomb Road intersection. Bascomb Methodist Church was a one-room facility until the 1930s. During the summer baseball games were played on the church grounds. Farmers in the area raised crops of cotton and corn. Farmers would transport their crops to Marietta by horse-drawn wagon. The Oak Grove community was further south and had a gristmill and sawmill owned by W.O. Tyson.‚Äù

Today we are off to Mica/Conn's Creek for this week‚Äôs #TravelingTuesdays!
‚ÄúThe community of Mica was located about eight miles east of Ball Ground and sprung up as a result of the gold rush in the area. Kenneth Krakow in his ‚ÄúGeorgia Place-Names‚Äù says Mica was named for the gold and mica mines in the area. Stancil‚Äôs Store was established in 1912 in the area and continues to serve the community.‚Äù I've been having trouble finding the community boundary line between Conn's Creek and Mica, can anyone tell me what the boundary line is between them or if there is a line at all? It would be greatly appreciated! It's common enough for smaller communities to overlap some and even more common for larger communities to expand over and eventually encompass smaller communities while they grow.

Today we are off to Mica/Conn's Creek for this week‚Äôs #TravelingTuesdays!
‚ÄúThe community of Mica was located about eight miles east of Ball Ground and sprung up as a result of the gold rush in the area. Kenneth Krakow in his ‚ÄúGeorgia Place-Names‚Äù says Mica was named for the gold and mica mines in the area. Stancil‚Äôs Store was established in 1912 in the area and continues to serve the community.‚Äù I've been having trouble finding the community boundary line between Conn's Creek and Mica, can anyone tell me what the boundary line is between them or if there is a line at all? It would be greatly appreciated! It's common enough for smaller communities to overlap some and even more common for larger communities to expand over and eventually encompass smaller communities while they grow.

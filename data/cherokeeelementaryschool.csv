1st Grade Art Show

Alicia Mitchell shared a link to the group: Mrs. Mitchell‚Äôs Music, Masterpieces, and Melodrama.
April 29 at 7:37 AM ¬∑

Fine Arts activities for Wednesday, April 29. We had planned an end of the year Fine Arts Extravaganza for April 27th, and with the virus we are unable to experience that evening. So, for the next five days in art, there won‚Äôt be a project. Rather, we‚Äôll have an online art show for each grade level. Today we start with 1st grade. If your child‚Äôs art is not displayed it‚Äôs because of one of two reasons:
1. They were unable to complete the project.
2. They asked me not to display it.

I hope you enjoy!

1. We are feeding children ages 0-18 through the Summer Seamless Program, no questions asked. Sign your children up weekly for a weeks worth of breakfast and lunch. www.cherokee.k12.ok.us or call the school and press #5.

2. We are sending out a survey to gage our student‚Äôs ability to communicate with us virtually. Look for it and send it back. It‚Äôs important that we are able to serve all students. https://forms.gle/rBNf8VR5VLRgeGHA9

3. The OSSAA has informed us that all their activities are cancelled, not postponed, for the remainder of the year. There are no summer activities allowed until restrictions from the CDC are removed or revised.

Throughout this week, we’ll be sharing video messages and words of encouragement from our School Board.

It’s likely fair to say that when they took office just four short months ago, a mid-March end of in-person instruction for the rest of the school year was not on their (or anyone’s) radar screen.

We appreciate their ongoing leadership, guidance and support during these trying times, as we work to adapt to provide students with learning experiences that will help them be prepared for success during the 2020-21 school year!

Coming up next in the FACE FWD film series, Tuesday, February 18, 2020- The Mask You Live In. A documentary. From the filmmakers:

The Mask You Live In follows boys and young men as they struggle to stay true to themselves while negotiating America’s narrow definition of masculinity.

Pressured by the media, their peer group, and even the adults in their lives, our protagonists confront messages encouraging them to disconnect from their emotions, devalue authentic friendships, objectify and degrade women, and resolve conflicts through violence. These gender stereotypes interconnect with race, class, and circumstance, creating a maze of identity issues boys and young men must navigate to become “real” men.

Experts in neuroscience, psychology, sociology, sports, education, and media also weigh in, offering empirical evidence of the “boy crisis” and tactics to combat it.

The Mask You Live In ultimately illustrates how we, as a society, can raise a healthier generation of boys and young men.""

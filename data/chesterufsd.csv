Sesame Street: Janelle Monae - Power of Yet",0.0,"Happy Monday CES Students and Families!

Mrs. Contreras was watching this Sesame Street video with her son and was so excited to share, as it represents our theme, ""The Power of Yet!""

During remote learning, we only ask that you do your best. If you are having trouble or are frustrated, please let your teacher know. We’re here all to support you!

The teachers and staff are thinking of you each and every day. We miss you and although we're not in school, YET, we're looking forward to seeing you when we return!

Be safe & stay healthy.
With love,
Ms. O'Hara

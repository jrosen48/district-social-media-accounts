A little history of the origins of The Cheyenne-Arapaho Old Settler's reunion -Part 1

On April 19, 1892 the Cheyenne-Arapaho Land Run began at noon with the firing of a Cavalry man's gun. By nightfall there were 50 people who called the town of Cheyenne their home. They had arrived on horseback, covered wagon and even on foot. On April 19, 1907 ""Daddy"" Hez Cox, a Cheyenne businessman who had participated in the run, called a meeting to establish an association to preserve the early day history of western Oklahoma. The Old Settler's Association established the custom of annually commemorating the date of the C & A Land Run with a celebration. The first ""Old Settler's Reunion"" was a picnic with a basket dinner, square dance and a horse race.

Watch for Part 2 soon.......

For those of you attending the banquet on Saturday, below is the lyrics for you to learn and sing at the banquet. Just to keep in mind, we are looking for a song leader. Who will it be?

Joyous and Ever Loyal

Joyous and Ever Loyal,
Let us boost Cheyenne High,
Let every heart sing,
Let every voice ring,
There’s no time to grieve or sigh,
It’s ever onward,
Our course pursuing
May defeat, ne’er our ador cool,
But united we will boost for her,
Our Own High School.

Strong City School Song

Stand Up and Cheer,
Cheer loud and long for old Strong City,
For today we raise the white and blue,
Above all others,
A sturdy hand now is playing,
We are sure to win this game,
We’re here to win,
We’ve got to win,
For it’s Strong City High School Day

Just some pics of students at CHS back in 1988 and 89. Enjoy!!

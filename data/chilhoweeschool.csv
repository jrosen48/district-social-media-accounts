Senior Spotlight: Miranda Heaper

Miranda has been here at Chilhowee for 9 years. She has participated in basketball, volleyball, football cheer, NHS, and FFA. Her favorite memory from elementary is from way back in Kindergarten when she played house with Maddy and Zach and they tried to make Zach be the mom and put him in a dress. Her favorite memory of high school is from a couple years ago when they were playing Cross the Ocean with the whole school and her class ended up dragging Zach on the floor. Her next plans include going to State Fair Community College to be a Dental Hygienist. If she ends up liking it she will continue on to become a Dentist. Her advice to the younger classes is to try to get into school activities like sports, FFA, or NHS. You will have fun, get to go on trips, make new friends, and you'll make really good memories with your friends. Miranda it has been our pleasure to watch you grow up!

His next plans are to attend a two year college before going on to a four year college. His advice for the younger classes is to become a great class and pursue your passion of what you want to be. Go to a college that builds up you dream career. Never give up on what you want to do for your career and achieve the goals you set to become a great student and great person.

Senior Spotlight: Lucas Coulter

Lucas has been a part of the Chilhowee Family since way back in second grade and it has been our pleasure to watch him grow up. Lucas spent his time in school participating in Football, Track, Basketball, FFA, and NHS. In elementary school his favorite memories are the times he spent playing basketball and football at recess with all his friends. His favorite times in high school include; playing sports, going on FFA trips with his friends, and getting to know people. His future plans include attending State Fair Community College and majoring in either conservation or zoology. His advice to younger classes is to do your homework and try your hardest, it will pay off in the end.

We are proud of you Lucas! Good luck in your next adventures.",0.0,"Chilhowee R-IV Counselor's Corner

(Seniors I hope the rest of you send me your survey. Miss you all!)
So Draven was just with us a short 4 months but he quickly became a part of our Indian Family and a joy to have at our school. During his time here he spent time working outside of school. His favorite memory from his Elementary days is playing kickball with his friends. During High School he enjoyed hanging out with his friends and most importantly his girlfriend. His future plans include going to college to become a veterinarian and living in the country with a big pond to fish in. His advice for the younger classes is to simply pay attention and stay on homework. He misses Chilhowee and hopes he can come back to the school at some point to see everyone. Good luck Draven!

Really missing our seniors right now and want to make sure they know they are loved. Starting with Olivia (hopefully more to come, seniors fill out the survey I sent you!) We love you Class of 2020!

Olivia has been a student at Chilhowee for 5 years. She has been active in Volleyball, Track, and National Honor Society. She says her favorite memory of high school is Senior Skip Day (by the way she has a big sense of humor). After high school Olivia will be heading off to college to a get a degree in Pre-Veterinary. Her advice for younger classes is, ""Don't give up because it is all worth it in the end."" She would also like to remind us to, ""Do what you can now because senior year goes by in a heartbeat, and you never know what you will miss about high school until it is gone.""

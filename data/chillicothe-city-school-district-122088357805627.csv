In February we were awarded the 2019 Children's Hunger Alliance,Menu of Hope, Summer Program of the Year. We received the award in Feb, a few weeks before the State shut down!
I know my department's experience with our summer program is what made our delivery program over the past 11 weeks so successful!
I wish we could utilize Babe like we have in the past, but being able to continue serving our youth this summer is the most important part!

CCSD Summer Lunch Program had it's first day of operation yesterday!! Keep your eyes open for Babe and the school vans as they drive around delivering lunch to our students this summer!
Over the past 10 week our CCSD Food Service Staff, School Bus Drivers, Schools Nurses, School Aids, many school staff volunteers and community volunteers were able to deliver 139,008 meals to our community! If that doesn't show how much our school and citizens of Chillicothe love and want to keep our children fed, I am not sure what will!

Tabitha Muse deserves more love than I could possibly show her. With the strength of an Army, the humbleness of a Saint and the love of an Angel, she takes care of those who need it the most. I feel extremely blessed to work beside her on projects like mobile lunches. I watched her sit down and go through over 180 lunch request and make informative changes
, off the top of her head...no address book or notebook! She is so invested in our community and it is definitely a work ethic to strive for!
We were able to serve and deliver around 200 lunches today and I am so thankful for Tabitha and Michelle.
Also a thank you to Jaymie Wood, Dustin Weaver, Matthew Ballentine, Aaron J Brown, Josh Tripp for delivering all of them.
And a huge thank you to Rhonda Mowbray, Lisa Risner, Misti Griffie, and Tina Barnett for cooking and packing all of the lunches.

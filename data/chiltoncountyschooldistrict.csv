The plan is based on our effort to mitigate the risk of COVID-19. The current order from the ADPH states in paragraph 11. B. and C. that:

“Spectators are allowed to attend athletic events, but attendance at events will be significantly reduced as “spectators shall not congregate within 6 feet of a person from another household except to the extent necessary.” Furthermore, “spectators shall wear a mask or other facial covering that covers his or her nostrils and mouth at all times while within six feet of a person from another household.”

In order to comply with this order and allow for a safer environment, we will implement the following protocols for the fall 2020 athletic venues:

• Spectators will not be allowed entry to an athletic venue without a mask.
• All spectators will be required to wear a mask or facial covering at all times at any Chilton County Schools athletic event while within six feet of a person from another household.
• Spectators must not congregate within six feet of one another unless they live in the same household.
• Anyone who has come in contact with a person with COVID-19 or is currently quarantined should not attend any athletic event at Chilton County Schools.

Mrs. Harrison selected their work initially for the State Superintendent's Art Exhibit in March and then it was chosen for this extended honor in May. Only 32 pieces of art were selected in Grades K-12 statewide.

Juan's art is an acrylic painting of a pear and Connor's art is a drawing of a tractor made from melted wax crayon on a warming tray. Both boys created the work in art class with Mrs. Julie Harrison, art teacher.

A final decision about proms and graduations (high school and kindergarten) has been delayed until May 18th. The governor’s current health order extends through May 15th… We will address the events after the governor’s updated health order on May 15th. Currently, proms have been postponed and not rescheduled. Our hope, based on the ongoing health situation, is that we can offer a prom to our students this summer, but at this point, we don’t have a definitive answer. High school graduations will remain as scheduled:

Chilton County High School June 12th @ Tiger Stadium
Isabella High School June 12th @ Isabella
Jemison High School June 6th @ Panther Stadium
Maplesville High School June 9th @ Maplesville
Thorsby High School June 11th @ Thorsby
Verbena High School June 10th @ Verbena

All graduations are scheduled for 7 pm.
Individual schools will schedule honors programs.
We reserve the right to reschedule dates, times, locations and provide guidelines to address public health guidelines.

If we announce a reschedule of the June graduations, graduations will be rescheduled for the week of July 6th-11th. Our last option is a virtual graduation. We will address that if public health and safety will not allow us to safely graduate in June or July.

Kindergarten graduations will be addressed on May 18th as well. Our hope is to reschedule kindergarten graduations in some form during June. We will plan to schedule those the week of June 15th-18th. Date and time to be determined by individual schools. We reserve the right to reschedule dates, times, locations and provide guidelines to address public health guidelines.

Please direct any specific questions to your schools administration.

We appreciate your understanding, patience and remaining positive during this unprecedented health crisis. Chilton County is a strong community and we will overcome!

In addition, please communicate with us if you are traveling to a domestic location with a known outbreak or if you are scheduled to travel on a cruise ship.

Based on the CDC levels of concern, there may be post travel protocols that apply.

Chilton County School Board approved the change of grades at Clanton schools based on the recommendation of the Superintendent at the board meeting on January 21, 2020. The change will take place at the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year in August 2020. The approval was made to move the 3rd grade to Clanton Elementary and 6th grade to Clanton Intermediate. The Clanton schools will now have the following grades:

Clanton Elementary K-3rd
Clanton Intermediate 4th-6th
Clanton Middle 7th and 8th
Chilton County High 9th-12th

The change was based on the following factors:

• The passage of the Alabama Literacy Act which sets in place guidelines to give 3rd graders the resources to be proficient in reading.
• The need to move 6th grade which is considered an elementary grade. The move of 6th grade will allow more instructional time than what is currently being received.
• The two school feeder patterns (Clanton and Jemison) will now be structured the same.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2640435162843308&id=1418177841735719,,0.0,"Clanton Schools’ Grade Transition

As we continue to assess the count in COVID cases in our area we believe that it will be in the best interest of our athletes and staff to prolong the suspension of our summer strength & conditioning program. Upon the re-start of workouts on 7/27, we will only extend an invite to our incoming 9th-12th grade to insure proper distancing protocol. We strongly encourage athletes to remain active in obtaining goals set for themselves. As before, we will start at 8AM. All athletes will be responsible for face coverings, and water bottles. If you have any questions or concerns please contact Coach James.....PRIDE goes a long way. GO PIRATES!",2020-07-19 19:52:35,,

If you have a desire to play sports in college, consider registering for both the NCAA & NAIA. Register early in your high school career so that you can keep an eye on your eligibility and stay on track. Remember that your grades and the courses that you take can affect whether or not you are eligible, so it is your responsibility to ensure that you take the right courses and earn the right grades. It is important that you read the guidelines outlined with each clearinghouse so that you ensure that you have can qualify to play beyond high school. Talk to your coaches or Ms. Lipsey if you have any questions. Also, let Ms. Lipsey know if a transcript or fee waiver needs to be uploaded. See the NCAA/NAIA section of my google classroom, and each of the websites to get more information.",0.0,"Your future awaits....

Can you solve these Mathematics Brain Teasers?

The Merchant
A merchant can place 8 large boxes or 10 small boxes into a carton for shipping. In one shipment, he sent a total of 96 boxes. If there are more large boxes than small boxes, how many cartons did he ship?

How can you add eight 8’s to get the number 1,000 (only use addition)?

Once you solve the riddle, please take a picture of your work and send it to Mr. Hubbard. After you are finished, find a riddle of your own and post to social media to have others solve.

Mindset Thought For Today:

Adversity is a catalyst for creativity. It is the breeding ground of personal growth. When we interviewed men and women of success and happiness, they always pointed to times of great adversity; when they built the skills, developed the Mindsets, or forged the relationships that ultimately defined their success. How can we take this time of uncertainty, fear, and challenge; and use it as a building block for a better life and a better world?

He cherishes all of the memories that he made going to regionals in track every year. He also appreciated the time that he was able to be there for his close friends and enjoy life together with his classmates. Kevin wants to tell underclassman to enjoy the time that they have left, because high school is a thing that happens once in a lifetime. Be there for each other and be kind to others. If you’re in a tough situation in life or going through a lot of things, never give up! Pick yourself up and push yourself through it.

Karena wishes to attend Texas State Technical College in the fall to become a HVAC Technician. Her favorite classes in high school were Mr. Overman’s science classes because he gives them a lot of work, but also makes her laugh (with her “annoying laugh” as she calls it). She cherishes the times when her class would play a learning game and her group would always argue the entire game. Karena wants to tell underclassman to keep their grades up and come to school. Congrats, Karena!

Last Thursday and Friday I had the opportunity to make some delicious food with the Food Service team from Chimacum Schools (near Port Townsend, WA)!The two days of training focused on how to incorporate more whole foods and scratch cooking into their school menus! We learned about taste physiology and how our tongues sense flavors, and we learned ways to build flavors using both culinary techniques and tasty ingredients. We also discussed how to build world flavors to make scratch food kids can't wait to eat! Let's talk about this type of training in your district!",3.0,"Chef Kent Getzin Consulting: Creative Culinary Solutions

From Team Educate-Oars:

“Practicing & counting down the days! Seventy48 is almost upon us!
Team Educate-Oars has a pretty cool story, (just like our competition we’re sure)! The long dory Dragonheart was built at our local ‘Community Boat Project’ in Port Hadlock, by our students. Dragonheart’s completion was back in 2011/2012 school year. Team Educate-Oars came together this school year, all teachers from Chimacum School District. Our desire as we paddle together is to facilitate unity within our schools, Primary through High School! We 💙our community and we’re thankful for our school district!”

This past fall we invited our community to share their thoughts about what we are doing well, and where we can improve as a District.

Our goal was to get a sense of shared values from our schools and community. We were excited to learn more about the priorities that were voiced for the Chimacum School District.

We have reviewed the results and shared them with our committee, in order to expand on what we heard we were doing well and to create new educational opportunities.

Tonight’s football game had the Shelby Coyotes hosting the Chinook Sugarbeeters. In the second half, Shelby’s quarterback, Tanner Parsons, went down with an injury. He sat on the bench for the rest of the game, unable to return. Shelby still went on to win the game 25-12 with Tyler Larson taking over the QB spot. At the end of the game both teams went to the center of the field for the mandatory handshakes. Afterwards, remarkably, the entire Chinook football team came across the field to the bench where Tanner Parsons was sitting. In a display of great sportsmanship, each player and the Chinook coaching staff went and shook his hand and wished him the best. In closing, I just have to say that it’s still a great day to be a Shelby Coyote, but hats off to the Chinook Sugarbeeters for being a total class act.",3.0,"Great job, boys!

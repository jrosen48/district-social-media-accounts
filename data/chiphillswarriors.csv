In an effort to meet the needs of our families, Chippewa Hills will be providing food to our kids during this mandated school closure.

All Chippewa Hills School District and St. Mike students who have an AM bus route will have enough breakfast and lunch for the week delivered to their doorstep by CH transportation. Deliveries will begin around 3:15 Monday, 3-16-20 and 3-23-20 (2 weeks worth of food @ this drop off). We will be following routes and drop off will be sometime between 3:15-4:30 (look for a normal drop off time). Someone should meet the driver at the road to pick up the food. If you do not wish to participate, please notify Ronda Snyder at rsnyder@chsd.us with your child’s name and bus number.

Reminder: sign ups/equipment issue is July 23rd 6-8 pm at the high school football field. Attached are sign up sheets to have completed with you on The 23rd if you have not already completed and returned to the school. There is also concussion paper form for you and your student athlete to read and sign, as well as some FAQ's including cost and start times. The season will end by the last weekend in October. Once teams have been formed(after sign ups) coaches will contact parents for team specific information. It is VERY important to register your child on the 23rd, even if they are unable to attend so we are able to form teams. Make sure you read the FAQ page, if you still have questions feel free to message us. Also: we are still in need of coaches and volunteers, especially in our flag program. WE NEED YOU!!!! Thank you!

In 2015, Chippewa Hills School District, was supported by the passage of a bond. In series 1 we made improvements to some of our buildings and athletic complex with such items as roofs, boilers, fields, track and security measures. We have started series 2 of that bond with additions and enhancements to Mecosta and Weidman Elementaries over this summer. Today was the start of a new Barryton Elementary which is being constructed over the next year opening in the fall of 2020.

Today’s ceremony was two-fold: the event shows our gratitude and appreciation for our each of the communities as they supported our students, staffs, schools and district in passing the 2015 bond. Yet today also represents Chippewa Hills moving forward as we make changes that will benefit our students by providing them safe and quality facilities that will enhance their learning experiences.

Thank you to the Chippewa Hills family as you support our schools. Our students will take full advantage of the opportunities they have been granted. Today we break ground for the future of all Chippewa Hills Warriors.",5.0,"The ground has been broken on the new Barryton Elementary School! The building is set to open Fall 2020!

Mr. Justin Williams and Mr. Ron Dannemiller have made donations to the stadium project. Mr. Williams has provided all the trucking needed to move the dirt out of the stadium. This will be around 400 loads of dirt. Mr. Dannemiller will supply the underground conduit and complete the wiring for a new sound system. Thank you Mr. Williams and Mr. Dannemiller for making a difference in the lives of the student-athletes in Chippewa.

The 500 Club is growing and I personally want to thank all those that have made donations. Go Chipps!

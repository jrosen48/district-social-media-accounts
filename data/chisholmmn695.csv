This last summer Education Minnesota, working with the Administration and School Board Members, put together an E-Learning plan. This plan allows schools to close the physical building, but have students attending school through a digital format. This enables the school to continue the education of your students.
Today, when you are meeting with teachers, please ask about their e-learning plan. The Plan has 7-12 students using their Chromebooks and K-6 teachers have a rubric for the students to follow to complete their work.

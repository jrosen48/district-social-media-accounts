Hello All!
As the summer comes to an end and the start of the school year fast approaches we will continue to provide meals for students in the district. As you may have heard, the USDA is extending free meals to all students until December 31st. The State of Massachusetts will be providing more clarity on Thursday, 9/10, to determine if our district qualifies. A Google form will be released this week for meal ordering for the opening of school. We appreciate your patience and look forward to your participation in the SEBRSD Meals program!

If you have any questions please feel free to email me at pulverb@sebrsd.org or give me a call at 774-200-7162.

Here are some questions and answers from last week's parent/student meetings.

What are the summer reading assignments?
Read Stamped. We have a copy for everyone. Go into the Google Classroom (4allky3), and do the reflection questions and the creative project. They count for two English test grades in the first quarter.

When will my student get a schedule?
We mailed them out a few weeks ago, so call us at 508-885-8505 to find out if we have your correct address and to get a copy of the schedule.

If I am taking a virtual high school class, will i have to log in with a teacher, or do i work on it on my own time?

What are the summer reading assignments?
Read Stamped. We have a copy for everyone. Go into the Google Classroom (4allky3), and do the reflection questions and the creative project. They count for two English test grades in the first quarter.

When will my student get a schedule?
We mailed them out a few weeks ago, so call us at 508-885-8505 to find out if we have your correct address and to get a copy of the schedule.

We know you have been patiently waiting for information and we thank you for that. This Thursday we will host three info sessions. 1:00pm - we encourage anyone who is available during the day to hop on this one. 6:00 - grades k, 1st & 2nd. 7:00 - grades 3 & 4. We will be using Zoom, which only allows 100 participants so we are hoping with the three sessions everyone will be able to get on. We will post the Zoom link for each meeting here, on our website and we will send an email. Thank you!",0.0,"#WireVillageRocks #Progress #Unity #Knowledge

Fun hands on way to review creating classifying polygons!
1.) use tape to make your shapes.
2.) color in the shapes with chalk
3.) carefully remove tape.
4.) count and classify the different shapes you made.
Have fun!! Thank you Miss Hester!

First week of remote learning had an assignment to write to a doctor or nurse thanking them for all they do. Leah chose to write to St. Vincent's hospital as she was born there. Last night she got a pleasant surprise, a note of thanks and some special goodies. Leah wanted to share as this whole assignment brought her and her family joy.

In response to COVID-19, we're developing AP Exams for this year that students can take from home.

2020 AP Exams will be:
🔹 Given May 11-22 and June 1-5
🔹 45 minutes long
🔹 Open book/open note
🔹 Online (or a photo of handwritten work)
🔹 FRQs only

You can find more details about course-specific exams, test security, scores, and more here: http://spr.ly/61831x4sT.

During this challenging time, we will work to give every AP student the opportunity to earn the college credit and placement they’ve been working toward all year while maintaining a focus on the health and safety of the AP community.",2020-04-04 12:50:50,,

Dear Families,

We have been in contact with Lifetouch regarding this Spring’s school pictures. As you know we haven’t been able to get into the school due to COVID-19 and recent school closures, so we have not been able to see if the Spring Picture packets are at school. If you have an account with LifeTouch you can go online and order your pictures there. If you are unsure you can call them and I believe they will give you your code to look them up online. We will keep you updated as we learn more information.

Thank you.",0.0,"Wire Village School - Spencer

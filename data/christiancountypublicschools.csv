Instruments will be sanitized with an ethanol based wipe, sprayed with Sanitmist, and will spend 15 minutes in a UV light cabinet for complete disinfecting. If you do not feel comfortable with this process, we can select a student instrument by identifying physical features and using a chart to select an instrument that best suits the student without actually playing it.

It’s unfortunate that because of the way our state funds EdChoice vouchers, our school district is left financially damaged. We are already in the process of making staffing and operational budget cuts to the tune of $2.5 million, and even more will likely be on the horizon. We will continue our advocacy work in ensuring that the state funds EdChoice vouchers directly instead of deducting the funds from public school districts. It’s an unsustainable funding model and must be changed.”",2020-04-29 08:04:14,,

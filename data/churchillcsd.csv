You will notice as you drive by the CCHS campus that the stadium lights are on for a short time in the evening during the week. CCHS is taking part in a nationwide program called ‘Be the Light.’
Throughout the remainder of the school year, the stadium lights will come on at 8:20 PM (20:20 military time) every evening, Monday through Friday, and will remain on for 20 minutes. This display of support 1) recognizes all of the seniors and early graduates in the Class of 2020, whose final year has been somewhat taken from them; 2) to say ‘Thank You’ to all of the custodians, those helping with meal prep each day, and bus drivers in the district who help deliver meals and provide WiFi hotspots around our community; and 3) to recognize the effort and sacrifice given by ALL medical, health care and emergency professionals in their fight against COVID-19.
We invite you to honk your horn with three short blasts if you drive by the stadium complex while the lights are on to show support for these three groups. We love all of you, we miss our students, and we are stronger together. #BeTheLight",4.0,"#bethelightfallon

Today is National Census Day! 36% of Nevadans have completed their census — did you finish yours?

Please SHARE this video to help our state receive its fair share of federal funding.

The NVCensus2020 is important, safe and easy. Nevada will earn $20,000 in federal funding over the next ten years for every person who is counted. Responses can only be used for statistical purposes and the questions asked regard basic demographic information. You will not be asked about your finances, social security number, or citizenship status. Lastly, the census is easy! It takes less than ten minutes, is about ten questions, and you will make an impact for ten years!

Complete your census online (census.nv.gov), by phone (English: (844) 330.2020; Spanish: (844) 468.2020) or in the mail today! Completing it ahead of time means no Census worker will show up at your home in May/June.",0.0,"Be sure to fill out your census!

Cleaning your hands not only helps prevent you from catching germs but from spreading them, too – especially to others who may be more susceptible to illness.

One of the best ways to encourage your child to clean their hands is by washing your own. “Kids watch and learn from their parents,” says Dr. Sebert. “Make sure to model good hand hygiene to keep your family healthy.”

How else can you prevent the spread of germs and viruses?

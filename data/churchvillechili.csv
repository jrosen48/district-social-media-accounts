Dear Churchville-Chili Families,
As we are nearing the end of May, we are making final decisions regarding end of year grading, reporting, and school closing procedures. Next week we will be sharing with you the end of year calendar along with the process for retrieving student belongings and materials.

Student Materials and Belongings Retrieval - Currently each principal is finalizing a detailed plan to communicate with families regarding pick-up dates and times for student belongings. Due to the capital project work at Churchville Elementary, CES students will be able to pick up supplies and materials on May 28. Mr. Johnson will be providing specific details in an InstantConnect message and eNews to CES families later today. All other schools will be providing a June timeframe for students to pick up their belongings.

Good morning Saints,

We are thinking of you and hoping that each of you and your families are healthy. We are looking to celebrate you on social media and on our website.

Please send us or post an appropriate baby picture and current picture (side by side). You can go right to the district website at www.cccsd.org and email your pictures, and we will take it from there! We are hoping to have everyone participate!

We know it is challenging for each of you not to be able to participate in spring activities leading up to graduation. Try to stay positive, think about the future opportunities you will have and begin to journal some stories that you will be able to tell your children, grandchildren and families for years to come.

Together, let’s remain hopeful, take care of yourself, and we will get through this safely.

Thinking of you,
Mr. Wilson and Ms. Orologio

Today, we would like to highlight Amanda Cheatham. This is Amanda's first year as a school counselor at Milam Elementary. Her favorite part about being a counselor is the relationships that are built between students and families. Outside of counseling, Amanda is beginning the journey of training her mini Australian shepherd, Remi, to be a therapy dog to work with children and families. Thank you, Amanda, for your dedication to our students! #NSCW2020 Milam Elementary, Conroe ISD",2020-02-03 10:00:36,,

Today, they got to see the pages come to life right in front of their eyes at Schulman's Movie Bowl Grille - Corsicana. Students were able to depict difference between the movie and book, right away, leaving them blown away at what they read in the book vs. what they saw on the screen. Allowing the students these opportunities not only allows them to become better readers and writers, it is preparing them for STAAR in using these same literature features to compare and contrast different passages provided.

Good things happen when neighbors come together. Last week I mentioned I would be supporting the BakPak Pals program through Communities in Schools of Robeson County. Today, I made a $1,000 donation to help provide students with nutritional meal and snack options during the summer. BakPak Pals expects to provide bags to over 200 students each week this summer in Lumberton, Maxton, and Red Springs. The program began in 2011, and guidance counselors identify students who may not have consistent access to adequate food on weekends during the school year. Now, the program has been extended during the summer months as well. Typically, a BakPak consists of two juices, two breakfast items, two main meal items, a fruit cup, pudding cup, and snacks. Thank you to CIS of Robeson for working to eliminate hunger as one of the major obstacles facing many of our students!",0.0,"Josh Whitley - State Farm Agent

1209 servings of food for our kids in need! THANK YOU! We appreciate everyone who supported this food drive for BakPak Pals! This was a joint effort of ABE, the Robeson County Partnership for Children, the Robeson County Public Library, and our caring community. All food items were delivered to Communities In Schools this morning. This will help give our kids a great start to a new school year.

I will arrange a time we can volunteer to pack the food to send home!

CIS mentioned they need small peanut butter jars for Thanksgiving and Christmas break, so we may do a drive this fall!

Thank you and continue to be a positive force for our kids and our schools!!

Later this week, we‚Äôre releasing our annual Impact Report. Titled Community Matters, this report details the unique way CIS is poised to address this issue. In the meantime, check out CIS President and CEO Dale Erquiaga‚Äôs take on chronic absence on our blog:",0.0,"COMMUNITIESINSCHOOLS.ORG

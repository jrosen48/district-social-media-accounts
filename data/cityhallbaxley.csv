Since I opened my salon I have arrived at work several times to these little notes tucked into my door. As I business owner and a not very big women it gives me a great feeling of peace knowing that even when I am not here our local Police are checking up to make sure that things are okay. Especially in the world we live in it is so nice to know that my business is being looked after, even throughout the night and monitored. Just within the past week I have received 2 of these. This morning when I got here a few minutes before 7 and it was still dark and no one else was on this street I pulled up and noticed this tucked in my door. It just makes you feel safer.

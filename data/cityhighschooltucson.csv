Another graduation for the books 🎓🎉 Staff of @cityhighschool stopped by graduates’ homes with decorated cars and a bus, a red carpet, personalized cakes, gifts and the student’s favorite song playing. There was even a life-size cutout of City High’s co-founder Brett Goble so students could pretend to shake his hand. The idea for the ceremony came from the parents of City High art teacher Jessica Melrose.

It is with a heavy heart that I tell you the news that I will not be returning to teach at City High next fall. After 15 years of teaching, I decided it was time to take a break.

Please know that I have thoroughly enjoyed working with all of our hard-working and creative students over the years, collaborating with the best colleagues there are, and have really appreciated all the support from our families. Thank you. I will miss you all.

There is some uncertainty about what is next for me (like many these days). I will continue to work from home for most of June, completing my grant reporting obligations and tying up some other loose ends. I have been working closely with school leadership & our hiring teams to ensure that my drama program, guitar students, VOICES program coordination, and advisory will all be in good hands going forward.

Please feel free to reach out if you want to stay in touch. I will continue using my cityccl.org email through June.

Much love to everyone,

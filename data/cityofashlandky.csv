likely, with a few areas reaching the mid-90s. In addition,
moisture values will increase today resulting in very humid to

possible. If conducting outdoor work, take frequent rest breaks

Why You Should Celebrate the SPIRIT OF TRAVEL

The coronavirus public health crisis is having devastating impact on the U.S. travel and tourism industry—and the entire American economy. Travel businesses are having to make tough decisions and our entire workforce is directly affected.

This year, more than ever, the travel and tourism industry must unite together, support each other and remind the country that even through the most difficult times, the spirit of travel cannot be
broken.

It is the spirit of travel that makes visitors feel at home, provides lasting memories and inspires millions each and every day. It is the spirit of travel that is the undercurrent of American culture. And now is a time for the spirit of travel to be protected and supported.

It is a tragic day in the Baton Rouge community. I am deeply saddened by the incident earlier that resulted in the loss of one of our bravest souls, a 21-year veteran of the Baton Rouge Police Department. A 7-year veteran was also injured and is currently in the hospital. My thoughts and prayers are with their families, with every member of the Baton Rouge Police Department, and with all public safety officers. I ask our entire community to remember their families in your prayers, and may their sacrifice never be forgotten.

I’m also saddened by the loss of one of our community members killed just hours prior. The two officers were investigating that incident when they were shot.

As we mourn this tragedy, let us reinforce that violence in our community, and particularly violence against those who serve and protect, is unacceptable. During this stressful time, both in our community and across the globe, it is imperative that we join together now more than ever.

Without these guys, our department would be lost. These guys are constantly cutting grass, laying sod, & keeping our Parks in immaculate shape. Not only do they handle the upkeep of our Parks & other city properties, they also assist with setup & cleanup of all our Special Events. We cannot say enough about how valuable these guys are!

∙ More positive tests coming from a younger age group (20-40 years of age)
∙ Last week recorded the highest number of reported cases in Cobb/Douglas since the pandemic started
∙ The positivity rate has risen from around 4% to more than 10%. Combined with more testing this is evidence of increased spread in our community.
∙ One Positive: Death rate is still declining, likely because of the ages of those being hospitalized (younger group)

Due to the Coronavirus, the City of Marietta has made the difficult decision to cancel all events scheduled for July 4, 2020 including the Let Freedom Ring Parade, festivities on the Square, and the fireworks show.

This was an extremely hard decision to make, but it was necessary to keep our citizens, visitors, and employees of the City of Marietta safe. While we will miss seeing everyone on the Square, we look forward to a fun announcement coming soon to keep the patriotic spirit alive in the City!

#MariettaShopsLocal Challenge! I was challenged by Lindsey Wiles with the City of Marietta, Ga., Government in a new, fun, social distancing approved challenge to support our local businesses. And to then challenge 3 of my closest friends to patron three local businesses via delivery, curbside pick-up, take-out, etc. so long as that business is following CDC guidelines for social distancing. Here is my video if you have a minute to waste to laugh at me and see who I visited and challenged. 😆

Many have been asking how they can help and stay connected to us here at the Museum during this current Covid-19 health crisis. One way to help MMH is by getting or renewing your Museum Membership!

Your membership start date will be extended til the Museum is reopened to the public. During this time you would be helping MMH monetarily as well as taking advantage of our membership discounts for the store (any items in the store we can ship directly to you) as well as any member communications.

Thank you for your continued support of the Marietta Museum of History. We can't wait to see you all when we reopen the Museum!

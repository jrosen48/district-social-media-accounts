During times of uncertainty and stress, it is crucial to practice good sleep hygiene to help to keep you healthy. It can be very difficult to keep your sleep schedule while working and learning from home. Try to go to bed around the same time at night and get at least 7-9 hours of sleep. It's okay to sleep in a little bit later, but don't over do it. Sleep, along with exercise and eating properly can all help to keep you healthy. Make these a regular part of your day.

Okay Decatur....So we have had a long running program of popping into the elementary schools around the city to read to all of our amazing kiddos. It lets them see the police in an amazing way and is a great interaction for all. We hate that due to what is currently going on that is not quite possible...However, we had the brilliant idea to continue this via Facebook live! So for the first time ever, Monday, March 23rd, 2020 you can login to our Facebook page at 11:00am and see one of our officers read two short children's books live! Hopefully your elementary aged kids will still think this is as fun as we do. We look forward to seeing you all there live!",0.0,"This is why we love the City of Decatur Police Department, GA! #KeepGALearning

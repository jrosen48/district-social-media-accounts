The governor just closed schools for the remainder of the year. I know this is very disheartening to many as we will finish out the year instructing students using distance learning. As of right now, we have no plans of cancelling graduation. Even if we have to postpone for a month or two, the plan will be to have graduation. Our seniors deserve the right to walk across the stage and receive their diplomas and we are going to do our best to make that happen. I will get back with you when I receive more information.

Clairton City School District (CCSD) is soliciting your input as we develop a plan for reopening school next year. CCSD hopes that we return to a ""normal situation"" and will be providing in-person learning in the building. However, CCSD must plan for other instructional models until the mitigation of COVID-19.

Therefore, CCSD parent/guardian feedback is extremely important for the district to collect and analyze while following CDC guidelines to determine the best plan of action for the opening of the 2020-2021 school year. Participation in this survey is vital and greatly appreciated! Please complete the survey by the end of the day on Thursday, June 11, 2020.

Amy Adams and Jennifer Garner invited me to read a book for @SaveWithStories, and this was my choice for you. When researching for #Sulwe, I was reminded of how great children's books can soothe little ones, but also adults too. Not Quite Narwhal, written and illustrated by @jessie_sima and published by @simonkids, is one of those books for me.

#SaveWithStories is a place to watch your favorite children's books read aloud in order to engage children out of school right now and to raise money to support those in need.

Everyone needs to DROP, COVER. AND HOLD ON.

DROP to the floor now.
During a large earthquake, the ground might jerk and jerk you. You can be prepared by already dropping to the ground.

Take COVER under something solid.
You can be prepared by protecting yourself from objects that can be thrown around.

HOLD ON until the shaking stops.

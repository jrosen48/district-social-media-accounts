JACK PINE CONFERENCE ATHLETIC PASS SALES

ATHLETICS TRANSPORTATION GUIDELINES

These are in place for all athletic teams.

We will transport kids to games using school transportation. The following guidelines are a part of every road trip, beginning with golf today.

Busses will arrive 15 minutes prior to scheduled leave time so coaches can utilize the MHSAA COVID 19 checklists and temporal thermometers with their teams we do prior to every practice.

THE FOLLOWING APPLIES TO EVERY SCHOOL IN THE STATE--If a student-athlete has a fever higher than 100.4 prior to entering the bus, THEY WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO TRAVEL. We ask for your understanding in this matter, as you certainly would likely not want your child playing a sport against another athlete with a fever. They will not be allowed to travel to the contest, and will need to be away from school and team until they have a ""normal"" temperature for at least 24 hours without medication.

By this point, if your CHS son or daughter is interested in playing a fall sport, they should have been in contact with the respective Varsity coach (contact info on the CHS Athletics website). If they played a sport last year, they are not required to have a new physical IF they meet all of the requirements on the MHSAA Health Waiver, which all varsity coaches have. HOWEVER, we are STRONGLY encouraging all student-athletes to get a new physical if able.

At this time, all MHSAA fall sports are scheduled to begin ""on time"". This is subject to change and will be reliant on a number of things out of our control. Also, the next few weeks could also potentially see MHSAA-initiated changes to the calendar in terms of permissible team activities.

The Michigan High School Athletic Association has NOT cancelled the spring sports seasons. In fact, the MHSAA has not even officially cancelled the basketball and hockey tournaments. Those were put on hold last Thursday until April 5, and the status has not changed. The only announcement from the Association came on Tuesday that “In doing our part to keep everyone as safe as possible, MHSAA staff is working remotely as of March 17. The MHSAA headquarters is currently closed to visitors and walk-in customers.”",0.0,"RRNSports.com

2018 Seniors!
These four seniors were part of the group that I coached when I first started coaching at Clare!

I have seen them grow into AMAZING young women.

They have grown as volleyball players, but more importantly as young women.

They have been a part of fundraising, organizing events, team camps, youth camps, public speaking, raising awareness for mental health and breast cancer, and helping to grow a program that we all are so proud to be a part of.

Thank you Kennedy, Jayce, Kylie, and Rease for letting me be a small part of your journey through Middle School and High School athletics. I cannot wait to see where life takes you and the ways that you change the world and make it a better place!

Since August 8th these young ladies have been in the gym working hard to be successful on the court and they have had done that on MANY occasions!

More importantly they have been working hard at finding ways to help with mental health awareness. October is the kickoff for our Be the Change campaign. We will spend the month (and the rest of the school year) finding small ways to make a difference here at Clare Public Schools.

This morning the girls wrote over 500 inspiration messages to put on each students locker in the high school with a ""Kindness is Always in Style"" magnet.

Our locker room was full of smiles, laughter, and team work this morning as they were trying to make a small difference in someones day! What a way to start the day!

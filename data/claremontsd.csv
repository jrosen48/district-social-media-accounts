We have made it through the first month of remote learning. No one could have ever guessed this is how we would end our school year. We recognize that everyone’s routines have been thrown off and Remote Learning comes with many challenges. One of those challenges being that all students work and learn at their own pace. We want to make sure we continue to support students at all levels and abilities. To assist with that we have obtained access to three tools for students to use if you are looking for something else. Please know that this is not mandatory and does not take the place of classwork assisted by your child’s teacher. The Age of Learning has given us Free access to ABC Mouse, Adventure Academy, and Reading IQ.

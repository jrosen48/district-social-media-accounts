The Chamber Singers and Dr. Wilson put together this ""virtual choir"" video using their closing song from the concert. Amidst all the uncertainty and bad news, they offer this little bit of hope and joy. Please keep in mind that Dr. Wilson is not a professional editor but it was certainly a labor of love.

The CHS girls tennis team embraced moments after they lost a third round doubles match on Friday, during the CIF Division Two Team Championships at the Claremont Club. Claremont and Woodbridge tied on sets, 9-9, but the Warriors pulled off the narrow win, 82-80, on games. The Wolfpack took the runner up prize, which is the furthest any girls tennis team has ever advanced in the CIF tournament.

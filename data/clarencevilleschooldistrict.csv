Today marks the beginning of Teacher Appreciation Week and you are most likely seeing your student’s teachers with a new lens of appreciation right about now.

The things you miss and now appreciate more than ever about your child’s teacher are the things that make him or her great; they’re the things that help to make Clarenceville great.

With the return of the Shaw Family Educator Award, we are happy to provide you with one way to express your appreciation this year.

If you’d like to share your newfound appreciation, please take a few minutes to nominate a Clarenceville Staff member who helps to make the district great. Nominations can be submitted via the website bit.do/sfea and will be accepted through June 5.

And encourage your child to nominate someone as well!

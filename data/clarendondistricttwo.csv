Greetings, CSD2 Family!

The Office of School Nutrition Services will be providing meals to students enrolled in Clarendon School District Two beginning September 11, 2020. This survey will provide information on how to prepare for feeding students participating in the hybrid model as well as those who will be learning virtually.

You must submit a new survey for each enrolled student in your household.

As a part of the USDA requirements, each child will have a School Issued Meal Number to collect their meals. Be sure to include your email address to receive follow-up information specific to your student and their Meal Number.

We will be sending this survey out in a variety of platforms; however, you only need to complete it once per child.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact Tonia Smith at tmsmith@csd2.org or 803.825.5134.

Thank You!!

We also held an ACT Prep Bootcamp conducted by the ACT Prep program by the name of MasteryPrep.

By law, every K-12 public school in South Carolina must have an SIC that is made up of parent, teacher, student (grades 9-12), and community member representatives. The principal is an ex-officio member of every SIC. SIC will meet once a month and 2x in January to focus on school improvements.

Nominations are being accepted for Parent positions on the SIC for MHS. Parents will serve for two years. Please send parent nominations to pgoldsmith@csd2.org by Tuesday, November 12th 5pm.

Ms. Trulsen applied for their Bright Ideas Grant with the proposal Full STEAM Ahead with KEVA Planks. These blocks will be part of the library’s makerspace. The teacher librarian will collaborate with classroom teachers to provide a variety of hands on opportunities/challenges for our students to learn about science, engineering, mathematics, and art. KEVA planks are an exceptionally versatile tool to integrate STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Mathematics) concepts to students of all ages and skill levels. These are wooden planks that are uniform in size that can be used for an endless number of creative projects. Planks are assembled using various stacking techniques. Construction progresses quickly so multiple trials or experiments can be conducted in the course of any challenge. Trial and error maximizes discovery and learning.",2019-11-05 18:16:30,,

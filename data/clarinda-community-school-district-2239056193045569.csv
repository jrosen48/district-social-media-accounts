I'm attaching the info for attending events at Creston so you are aware for the Volleyball match tonight. Creston's guidance for indoor events and volleyball is very similar to Clarinda.

9th Grade 4:30 JV 5:50 Varsity 7:15

Masks are required by fans to attend

Clarinda Volleyball Tournament on Saturday, Sept. 5th

Due to the number of teams attending we have split into two sites: (Middle School & High School)

We are also using a ticket system to enter the game. Each Varsity player and coach received two tickets to hand out to whoever they would like. Only event workers and people presenting a ticket are allowed to enter. When switching building you must keep your ticket to enter into the event.

Thank you for all your work and patients as we continue to work to keep activities going. Have a great day and good luck tonight!

Last week, the State of Iowa presented options for continuous learning as we move forward while school districts are currently not in session.

Building administrators have sent both an email and a text to families outlining what that continuous learning will look like for your child.

Current understanding is that COVID-19 spreads mostly from person to person through respiratory droplets produced when a person coughs or sneezes, similar to how flu spreads. Most person-to-person spread happens when people are in close contact. It is also possible that the virus can spread when someone touches a contaminated surface and then touches their mouth, nose, or eyes.

As the week closes and we take time to rest, relax, reunite with family and friends, and reflect on the season, I invite you to consider baking cookies or holiday treats to celebrate our amazing teachers and staff! On Friday, December 20th, we are hosting professional learning at Clarinda High School. As a send-off to winter break, I'd like to have each teacher leave with a plate filled with at least one dozen cookies or treats. Yes, that is a lot of cookies; however, the time, energy, care, and expertise our staff extends in support of students equates to a lot of hours. If you plan to bring a large number of goodies, would you please email me. This will help in planning and will tell me how many hours I need to roll up my sleeves and bake.

Thank you for your support! The district appreciates your partnership. Feel free to pass the invitation along to anyone you feel might be interested in joining us!

Take care,

We are excited about tonight's basketball games at Clarinda High School and Clarinda Middle School vs St. Albert. When attending tonight's game we would like to encourage all to enter through the activity doors. Below I have attached pictures of those doors for everyone to see.

Also, it is important to remember that we have a fire lane that runs along the North Side of the high school building. Please help us in observing the marked areas for no parking.

Game Schedule:
JV Boys @ Middle School 4:30

JV Girls @ High School 4:30
Varsity Girls @ High School 6:00
Varsity Boys @ High School 7:30

Looking forward to a packed house tonight in the Cardinal Gym!

Friday's weather is supposed to give us a sample of winter weather temperatures. Today's dress up day for homecoming is Minnesota. Too bad that wasn't planned for Friday.

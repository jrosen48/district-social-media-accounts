Our schools operate so very efficiently because of the strong leadership of Mrs. Feeley, Mr. Delmonaco, Mrs. Bergin, Mr. Beltramba, Mr. Bucior, Mrs. Clarke, and Ms. Applebaum. I consider myself beyond fortunate to get to work alongside them.

Below is a link to a music video entitled ""Waitin' On A Sunny Day."" ALJ 2016 graduate Zachary Sandler is featured in this video. We are obviously very proud of him and the Clark Schools music program of which he is a product.
Hope you enjoy the video and weekend ahead. We will be continuing with our Showcase of Success next week. As always, many thanks for your ongoing support.

As we are continuing with our remote learning approach, an increasing number of our teachers are opting to conduct virtual meetings with their students. Kindly remind your children that each school's code of conduct will still be in place during these virtual meetings, and therefore, they should not be recording the session, each other, or the teacher. We have been fortunate not to have any such issues arise yet but wanted to give this proactive reminder.

On another note, please see attached from the Public Library regarding the obtaining of a library card if your family does not already have one so that online materials can be accessed. As always, many thanks for your cooperation. Enjoy the rest of the day.",2020-03-23 15:43:50,,

Bentley Garcia was playing in the water with his sister at Holly Recreation Area when he noticed something was wrong, June 9.

Garcia, a nine-year-old student from Clarkston Community Schools Clarkston Elementary, noticed a little girl went too far in the water and was struggling.

“I decided to go get her,” he said. ” I just thought of something I have been taught what to do if someone is drowning.”

The 2019-20 school year for the Clarkston Community Schools Clarkston High School senior class was anything but normal, especially from the middle of March through last weekend.

As school buildings closed in mid-March and all activities, including sports, prom, and everything else a senior looks forward to, the students and staff had to make due with online virtual learning.

Last weekend was a reprieve from all of that as the 600-plus students in the Class of 2020 enjoyed a graduation ceremony in front of Wolves Stadium and then the unique Commencement Cruise through the streets of Clarkston.

This Thursday, June 11 from 8-9am, your coffee is on Dave Smith - State Farm Agent, as he sponsors an hour of Coffee, Conversation, Compassion and Culture, in The Coffee Bucket parking lot (socially distanced of course).

During this hour, no need to order online or pay - just show up, order, let Dave buy your coffee, and if you’d like, hang out to talk with him - a small step in the healing process for our country. Change starts with conversation. Please join us.",2020-06-10 07:08:12,,

🏆2020 Clarkston High School #SeniorAwards have been announced and #TeamRUSH27 is super #RUSHProud of Logan for being recognized with the CHS Engineering Department’s #EngineeringAward!

Mrs. Laura Kalinowski, who leads the department, had this to say “[Logan] has gone above and beyond expectations in the classroom. His projects were always full of creativity and he was thoughtful of the technicalities. It has been a pleasure to be Logan’s teacher the last 3 years and I’m so happy to honor him with our Engineering Department Award.”

Over his four years on Team RUSH, Logan has demonstrated these qualities and more in the shop, 3D printer lab, and in the #RUSHPit. He grew into numerous key roles that the team relied on, including machining parts on the CNC machines, CAD design work, robot repair/maintenance, and training others. His dedication, focus to detail, and #RUSHSpirit have been second to none. Congrats, Logan!

:: Virtual Learning Spotlight ::
Susan Mohr from CHS is in the spotlight today! In the words of her student, Sierra Waitkus:
.
""Madame Mohr is not only a great teacher but she is a great role model as well. She believes in simplicity and shares that belief with us. At one point, she shared a story with us, where the workers of a company would say ""I am here"" and the boss would reply with ""I see you."" We would say this in class (in French of course) and it made a lot of students appreciate living in the present. Madame Mohr is one of those teachers who always urges her students to find a deeper meaning in and out of the classroom. She does this because she genuinely cares about each and every student that walks into her classroom. She is the positivity that has helped me, and so many other students, get through the day. Madame Mohr has helped make Clarkston feel like home.""

:: Virtual Learning Spotlight ::
Today, we recognize Amy Morris from Bailey Lake Elementary, currently teaching Young Fives. In the words of the parent that nominated her:
.
""Mrs. Morris has continued to share her love with her young students through her daily calendar video! She helps them start their day with a familiar and happy routine that sets the tone for learning at home. She has offered show-and-tell videos for the children to see their friends and practice speaking skills along with stories and letter-sound videos where she shows the movement. My son loves to see his teacher and friends during this time through the Seesaw videos posted! Mrs. Morris has provided families with helpful information and kind-hearted support. She is going above and beyond to help make this learning experience a happy one for her students. Thank you, Mrs. Morris!""

Today we're offering a few reminders for keeping students and staff healthy during the cold and flu season:

Please discuss proper handwashing with your child and remind them that they should not share food or drinks with others.
Teach your child to sneeze or cough into their elbow or tissue.
If your child is ill, please keep them home.
If your child is running a fever, their temperature must be normal (98.6 degrees) for a 24 hour period before returning to school.
Please do not send medication to school. Staff cannot (by state law) dispense medication without a form signed by your doctor. This includes over the counter medication (ointments, cough drops, Tylenol, etc.). The forms can be found on our website under ""Plan of Care"" (https://www.clarkston.k12.mi.us/parents)

A doctor's note is required if your child has to stay indoors for recess.

Today we're offering a few reminders for keeping students and staff healthy during the cold and flu season:

Please discuss proper handwashing with your child and remind them that they should not share food or drinks with others.
Teach your child to sneeze or cough into their elbow or tissue.
If your child is ill, please keep them home.
If your child is running a fever, their temperature must be normal (98.6 degrees) for a 24 hour period before returning to school.
Please do not send medication to school. Staff cannot (by state law) dispense medication without a form signed by your doctor. This includes over the counter medication (ointments, cough drops, Tylenol, etc.). The forms can be found on our website under ""Plan of Care"" (https://www.clarkston.k12.mi.us/parents)

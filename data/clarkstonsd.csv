Starting on Monday (9/14/2020) the Clarkston School District will reinstate our normal bus routes and bus stops we used prior to COVID-19. Bus stops will return to the one mile radius pick up instead of the COVID 1.5 mile radius pick up that started in August.

If you drive your children to school or if they walk please feel free to continue to do that as you wish. As a precautionary measure, if we see a spike in the number of positive COVID-19 cases, or if we see the buses move to more than 50% capacity, we may have to return to the COVID 1.5 mile radius pick up.

For all K-8 students riding in the morning, please be prepared for a bus arrival at your regular stop 10 minutes later than normal. Special Education stops are not affected by these changes. Please contact your school’s front office for additional clarification.

Did you know…
Washington successfully passed a bill that established October as “Disability History Month” in all public schools. In passing the bill, the legislature stated that “recognizing disability history will inspire students with disabilities to feel a greater sense of pride, reduce harassment and bullying, and help keep students with disabilities in school.”

It is important for people to understand that people with disabilities are more alike than different. For children, this is especially important because attitudes develop during childhood by watching and listening to peers, teachers and family. Schools, clubs and youth groups are ideal places to increase knowledge about people with disabilities and to foster positive attitudes about them. ""Inclusion is within everyone's ability!""

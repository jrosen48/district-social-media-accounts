Hey Clarksville Tiger Fans. Listen up!! Just in case you don’t know, Senior Night will take place this Friday night at New Century Club Field beginning at 7PM. This event was originally scheduled for Friday October 30th, but has been changed due to the uncertainty with Covid 19. Please come out and support our Seniors and show your love for them and their families. This is a very important night for our Seniors and this is an excellent decision to have this event early based on what is happening in our world. Immediately following our Senior Night Festivities the Clarksville Tigers will look to bounce back from its first loss of the season as they take on the Prairiland Patriots. The Patriots are coming off of their first loss of the season as well. Both Teams enter Friday’s contest at 2-1. Should be an exciting night of fun,festivities, and football. Get your game face on and come out to New Century Club Field for an enjoyable evening. Support our kids. 🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈TPND",0.0,"Ruben Putteet

We learned so much about our current plans and systems when the entire district was in remote learning mode and we have made some adjustments in preparation for this Wednesday. One of those adjustments is the need for all 6-12 distance learning students need to bring their charged chromebook to school as you will use your device to test on.

CISD well understands the issues associated with anything new. Google Classroom, See Saw, Chromebooks, IPADS, Distance learning, etc were either terms that we never discussed last year or we talked very little about. Suddenly and abruptly these are foundational terms in our school system. We realize that not everyone will be in the same place with this and for that reason the district has set up a hotline for parents and students to call into and seek help. The hotline will begin tomorrow (Wednesday) and designed for parent and student questions to be answered after normal school hours.

This hotline will work from 6 pm to 9 pm during the week day. It will not be operable over the weekend. Those numbers are as follows:

Monday, March 23 — One more packet pick up day at Cheatham. 1st grade teachers will be there from 10:30 - 12:00. Library open again from 5:00 - 6:30. If you need anything tomorrow, please let us know before pick up time.

We will soon have home access to Renaissance where Accelerated Reader is housed. Additional services are being added that will include math as well as books on line that students can read and test on.

As we move through these uncertain times, please let me stress that home schooling activities should take no longer than a couple of hours. Please use these days to enjoy new activities with your children. Board games, card games, dominoes! Please make sure they learn to tie their shoes, tell time on a clock with a face, and do some physical exercise every day.

I hope that you are taking advantage of this quality time that you are having with your children!

To ensure that you have the items you need for school, the district has ordered basic supplies: spirals, composition books, pencils, pencil sharpeners, and erasers.

We will have a curbside distribution in front of CES Library on Friday, March 20. Backpack buddies, supplies, and packets from some grade levels will all be provided.

Recommended times are set by first letter of last name. This is by no means mandatory. Hopefully it will help with traffic back up.

As you may already know, CISD school board made the decision at last night's meeting to extend the closure of school through March 27. They will reassess at that time whether or not open or remain closed.

It is our goal at CES to maintain an academic environment for your child. Each grade level has created a private FaceBook page for their grade. That is where most assignments will be housed along with enrichment ideas for your family.

As administrator of the CES page, I have shared resources that I think your family will find entertaining, educating, and enjoyable. These are not assignments, but simply resources that I and other have found that I think are worthy of your time.

Given the rapidly evolving situation with COVID-19, Clarksville ISD will extend the suspension of normal district operations through Friday, March 27th in an effort support our nation’s need to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19. Our health officials report that cases are continuing to spread in the state, and an increase in confirmed cases in our county seems likely. Suspending operations for this length of time will allow us to determine, in coordination with local health officials, whether the virus is continuing to have community spread or whether it has been contained. We are coordinating with other school districts in the county and will use next week to make any decisions on whether there is a need to extend the suspension further.

Congratulations to Jorge Balvanera, Michael Love, and Nakariah Turner on three excellent performances in the ATSSB All-Region Honor Bands this weekend!

These students represented Clarksville very well as they met with other students from various districts in our area for the first time, then learned very difficult music in eight hours to perform with students they’ve never played with and a conductor they’ve never worked with before.

Our focus area will be on obtaining and maintaining student success during the school year. We need your input on when to have it.

We would like your advice on what day and time would be a good time for you. We would like to know if a Saturday morning from 9:30-12:00 or 11:00-1:30 would be a good time, or a week day after school is more convenient.

Lunch will be served and door prizes given away! Please respond to this post. We will set a date and time based on the responses we receive. We ask that you respond before Friday, November 8th. Thanks in advance!",2020-09-17 10:09:11.733516,,

As we embrace new pathways students are being prepared to exit school with soft and hard skills; college readiness skills; guidance in the selection of career choices etc. Careers featured: EMT, Nursing, Teaching, HVAC, Military, X-Ray Tech. Representatives from PJC spoke about all the career choices offered at PJC. Currently we have 11 students traveling to PJC enrolled in PJC Welding program.

Wow!! What a day we had. Clarksville High School held its first Career Fair for students 8th thru 12th grades. Mrs. Annette Hobbs, our Career, College and Military Readiness Coach planned and implemented this awesome event. As we embrace new pathways students are being prepared to exit school with soft and hard skills; college readiness skills; guidance in the selection of career choices etc. Careers featured: EMT, Nursing, Teaching, HVAC, Military, X-Ray Tech. Representatives from PJC spoke about all the career choices offered at PJC. Currently we have 11 students traveling to PJC enrolled in PJC Welding program. Dr. Phillips expressed that we had some students in Instructional Practices to become teachers. Mr.Ward, our Superintendent shared words of expectations as we journey into CISD new Career Pathways. It truly was a great day for our students.",2019-09-06 10:41:50,,

We will be having a little competition during our high school band camp for all students involved in the marching band. Points will be given for random things according to what section you are in. Here’s your first chance to win points!

Mr. Brown and I just went to an insanely good concert put on by a certain rather famous brass quintet. The first high school band student to reply to this post with the name of the quintet pictured will win 5 points for your section before band camp even starts!

This program offers CHS Trojans the opportunity, guidance, and support to earn an associate degree while still in high school! Students apply in the 10th grade and commit to a three-year program spanning grades 11 and 12, plus an additional year as a full-time student at Oakland Community College (OCC). Splitting time between courses at their home high school and college classes at OCC, students work toward their diploma and a college degree at the same time. There is no cost to the students or their families for tuition, fees, or books!

For more information on this incredible program, check out the Clawson Public Schools ACE flyer below. For incoming 10th grade students interested in this program for the 2021-2022 school year, please note the contact information of Ms. Holland and Ms. Schlenker, our CHS Counselors, at the bottom of the flyer. 📚🎓",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=632643904298729&id=245702216326235,,0.0,"Did you know Clawson Public Schools offers the ACE Program, Accelerated College Education, to our students at Clawson High School?

We are doing this on behalf of all Clawson Public School employees who wanted to show their students that they are not forgotten. We will start around 6:00 p.m. Hope to see you all at a socially responsible distance!

All of us at CPD know how lucky we are to work in such an awesome community. Today, we escorted Principal Sines, Superintendent Tim Wilson, and some very dedicated teachers around the city in their vehicles. In this time of social distancing, the staff at Schalm desperately wanted to let their students know that they care for them and miss them. Judging by the turnout, the students really miss their teachers!
With Executive order 2020-21 in place, other Clawson Public Schools will not get a chance to participate in the mini parades. As a show of support, our police and fire departments will be cruising the south and east side of the city this Thursday starting at 6:00 P.M. On behalf of CPS, we want to send the message that our students are not forgotten and we are all thinking about you. We will get through this together!

Very difficult to fully describe how proud we are of these young men and women. So many smiles, laughs, celebrations and certainly happy tears!

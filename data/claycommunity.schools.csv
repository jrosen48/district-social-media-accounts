Last Friday afternoon, Governor Holcomb issued Executive Order 20-37 – Face Covering Requirements. To revise the CCS 2020-21 School Year Roadmap (Re-entry plan), CCS worked closely with the Clay County Health Officer, other area health professionals, legal counsel, and state agencies. The revised Roadmap, which reflects the Governor’s Face Covering Requirements, is posted on the CCS Website. In general, all students and employees will be required to wear a face covering.

CCS has put many measures in place for the safety and health of our students and employees, and we look forward to beginning the new school year on August 5.

As was mentioned when we developed our CCS 2020-21 School Year Roadmap, it will be a working document that will undoubtably undergo several revisions throughout the school year. We will be working with our local health department, etc. to address the Governor’s new face mask requirement, etc. in our Roadmap, and we will share this information when it has been finalized.

As was mentioned in the information posted yesterday, we are living in unsettling times; unfortunately, our students have been impacted by them. The extension of the Governor’s Stage 4.5 Mandate, limiting social gatherings to 250 people, impacted our initial graduation plans of having traditional ceremonies at both CCHS and NHS. The plans presented yesterday were prepared to be as student-friendly as possible and to allow our graduates to meet together as a class for one final time; however, after receiving much feedback, we have altered the plan for NHS to allow graduates to invite two guests, and still adhere to the Governor’s Mandate and our county health official’s guidance. NHS Graduates will be divided into three groups and three different times for this Saturday afternoon and evening. The NHS administration will share the details of the ceremony plans with their graduating seniors and their parents.

We congratulate our seniors and look forward to enjoying this special time with them.

If anything is stable at this time, it’s the use of the word “tentative”. The fluidity of the present pandemic has caused leaders around the country to alter their plans. This happened in Indiana last week when Governor Holcomb postponed Stage 5 of the Back on Track Indiana Plan and, instead, moved to Stage 4.5. Stage 4.5 limits social gatherings to no more than 250 people through Friday, July 17; unfortunately, this directly impacted the date for the NHS 2020 Graduation. The NHS Graduation will now be held on Saturday, July 18, at 7:30 p.m. at the NHS Football Field. (Graduation plans for GOALS Academy – July 16 and CCHS – July 18 remain unchanged at this time.)

Parenting provides countless rewards and blessings, but it also comes with its share of worries, challenges, and major responsibilities.

The learning process of kids involves much more than books and computers can offer them. Fathers play such important role in all developmental stages of children’s lives.

CCHS and NHS have made tentative plans for their 2020 graduation ceremonies.

The following are the tentative graduation plans, at this time:

NHS Friday, July 17, at 7:30 P.M. at the NHS Football Field Rain dates will be July 18 at 7:30 P.M. and July 19 at 7:30 P.M.

Obviously, these plans are only tentative and are subject to change depending on government mandates, etc., and attendance to these events may be limited. CCHS and NHS will share additional details with the public about their graduation ceremonies at a later date.

The last month of school typically sees many fun and exciting activities; unfortunately, this is anything but a typical school year. Even though we miss our students presence in school, we are grateful that we are able to provide eLearning activities for them. This coming week is our second week of three eLearning days, which will be held on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Teachers are available to answer questions throughout the week, so I encourage students and parents to reach out to them if needed.

As a reminder, the meal pick-up program for students will be held again on Tuesday from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. at Clay City Elementary, Forest Park Elementary, and Meridian Elementary. (See the April 5 post for additional details.)

Recently a situation came to the attention of the Northview Athletic Department that we would like to address with our community.

A local business was solicited by a third party company based in Texas and was told that NHS was doing a fundraiser by putting their business logo on a souvenir cup and selling the cup. In good faith, the business graciously provided their logo and the fee and was happy to support NHS. However, NHS had never been a part of this fundraising effort. NHS does not utilize this third party solicitation style for fundraising.

It is unfortunate that in this day of non-stop robo-calling from scammers across the country have now stooped to lying about fundraising for a local high school athletics.

If you, or your business, is approached by a suspicious fundraising company claiming to represent Northview High School, please call Scott Buell or Bethany Jones at (812) 448-2661.

The program will provide backpacks and school supplies to every student in grades K-3 in the Clearview, Elyria and Lorain school districts.

The supplies were purchased with money seized from drug dealers and forfeited to the Lorain County Prosecutor’s Office. Backpacks will be delivered to the school districts and be available to children on the first day of school. ✏️ 📖

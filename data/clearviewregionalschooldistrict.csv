Mike, The Voice, Wolk has taken his high level of enthusiasm and energy to new levels! For those of you who don't know, Mr. Wolk is our announcer for many of our Home Boys' and Girls' basketball games. Well, last night, a portion of his pre-game introduction from this past Saturday's Boys' basketball game appeared on ESPN's Sports Center.

Needless to say, we are very proud of Mr. Wolk and appreciate the level of excitement he brings to our games!! Don't worry, he has been signed to a long-term contract with Clearview, with a no-trade clause!

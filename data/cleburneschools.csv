#JSUStrong
#gamecockproud

Mr. Cochran is currently in his third year as Technology Coordinator for Cleburne County Schools. Prior to
this current position, he served as the Network Administrator for Talladega County Schools for 18 years.

He obtained the Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Information Systems from Jacksonville State University in 1997 and after 20 years, returned to JSU to obtain a Masters of
Science in Instructional Technology. He has also earned the certified Chief Technology Officer designation from the Alabama Leaders in Educational Technology Association and was recently inducted into the Phi Kappa Phi Honor Society at Jacksonville State University.

""By obtaining my Masters in Instructional Technology, I was able to blend both the technical knowledge obtained from my B.S. in CIS and the educational experiences of my technology coordinator roles. The quality expectations and varied array of content exposure gained from the Instructional Technology degree have allowed me to better understand the teachers’instructional needs and assist with the development of plans to expand technology integration into the learning experiences for future generations.
During my tenure at Cleburne County Schools, the district has been able to double the number of students participating in the JSU Technology Fair and obtained over $50,000 in grants to
provide STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) programs for our middle school students with plans to expand these initiatives to our high schools. Much of the research
and studies during my pursuit of my Masters built the basis for my being able to support the school district in these expanded opportunities.

I would like to thank everyone who supported me throughout the challenges of working full-time, being an on-demand first responder, as well as being a parent and husband. I will say it was
not easy returning to school after 20 years, but with the support of my family and friends, I was able to accomplish a goal never imagined when I first entered JSU in 1993. Being nominated
for the honor of induction into the JSU School of Education Alumni Hall of Fame is extremely humbling.""

The winter month are upon us, and with that come coughs, colds, flu, and many other illnesses. Here are just a few reminders for you for the upcoming months.

Please remember that if your child has an oral temperature over 100 degrees F., he or she is considered too ill to be in a school environment. Any student who has suffered an illness accompanied with fever should be fever free for 24 hours without the aid of Tylenol, ibuprofen, or other fever reducing medications. Taking medications to lower the temperature to normal and sending your child to the school environment to infect others is not acceptable.

Viruses can also be a problem this time of year. If your child has nausea with vomiting and diarrhea, he or she is considered too ill to be at school. Your child may return to school when he or she has had no vomiting or diarrhea for 24 hours.
Please remind your child to wash his/her hands frequently, especially after coughing, sneezing, or wiping the nose.

Thank you

What is Even 4 Education?(E4E)
E4E is your way of helping provide what every child in Cleburne County deserves - the best facilities, opportunities, and education offered in the United States of America. When you say YES to E4E, you have contributed to educating the children of our great county.

Why Even 4 Education?(E4E)
Because it is time that the answer “We do not have enough money” becomes a thing of the past. Cleburne County Schools have always been asked to do more with less and we are proud of what we have accomplished in the past. Our vision is to supplement our schools and students to achieve EVEN more with EVEN 4.

Who?
Participating businesses will allow ALL consumers to donate their change to help us change student lives. Consumers will be ASKED if they want to make their purchase EVEN ($) for Education. (Example: A $3.60 purchase can be an even $4.00 upon approval of the customer. The extra $.40 will go straight to the children of Cleburne County Schools).

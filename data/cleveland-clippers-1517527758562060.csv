Second grade boys use summer for practices, scrimmages

To build hitting and fielding skills during scrimmages, the pitching mound was staffed by a coach…with a player standing alongside.

“It was fun for the boys to get together and play, and they made the best of it,” said Andy Smith, who, along with Scott Lassiter, Mark Giebel and Nate Fuller, mentored years’ team.

To build hitting and fielding skills during scrimmages, the pitching mound was staffed by a coach…with a player standing alongside. Each batter got pitches until he put the ball in play, and there were a few more than nine defenders in the field.",2020-08-19 10:55:25,,

U12 girls finish season

With no U10 softball this summer, the U12 team ranged from players going into the eighth grade this fall all the way down to going into the third grade. After a road trip to Lake Crystal on August 4, their season ended two days later with a game against visiting Mankato.

Collecting hits for the Clippers at Lake Crystal, where—facing superior pitching—they were shutout decisively, were Jocelyn Kortuem and Maya Lassiter. The Clippers did post runs against Mankato, 19 of them, but the Peppers crossed the plate five more times for the victory. Hits for the Clippers came off the bats of Taylor Wolf and Anna Lamont.

Against visiting New Ulm on July 28, the Clippers fell 25-2. Kaitlyn Flowers had the only hit for Cleveland and scored one of the runs. Lassiter scored the other. Before that, Mankato beat the host Clippers 21-13. Flowers and her younger sister Natalie had hits in that game as did Lassiter.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2655999048048253&id=1517527758562060,,0.0,"From: Richard Rohlfing <richard@rohlfingphoto.com>

U12 girls face older competitors

Continuing to square off against much more experienced competition, the Cleveland U12 girls team, which includes players as young as to-be third graders, fell to host New Ulm 11-2 last Tuesday and to visiting Mankato last Thursday.

In New Ulm, the Clippers truck out on 14 at bats. Kaitlyn Flowers got the only hit. Taylor Wolf and Maya Lassiter both reached first on a free pass and scored. Wolf’s run came in the third on off-target pitches while Lassiter crossed the plate in the fifth on a Jocelyn Kortuem ground out.

“That was a tough team,” said head coach Scott Lassiter. “Most of those girls looked to be much older. Their pitchers were throwing balls as fast as the 14U teams I have seen. However, I thought our girls did great. I am very proud of our sportsmanship and bravery. They were hitting really hard at us, and our girls stopped some fast ones.”

I would like to thank the staff at CHS for continuously going out of their way to support their students and especially the Class of 2020. The teachers, staff, and administration have been working so hard to make this transition easier for everyone. Throughout this difficult time, Principal Lusk and Mr. Cink have been checking in with the seniors on Google Meets to make sure that we are all doing okay and to keep us updated. Today, we picked up our caps and gowns and senior lunch from the school (all while social distancing). A special thank you to the lunch ladies for preparing such an awesome lunch for the seniors. While driving to the front of the school to pick up our caps and gowns, we were greeted by all of the teachers, staff, and administration. I think I can speak for the entire Class of 2020 by saying that we are so thankful and blessed to be a part of such an amazing school and community.

Breakfast/Lunches that will be sent out in the next couple of days will need a microwave!

Examples: shredded pork, goulash, chili, tortilla casserole and breakfast sandwich.

We have been busy thinking,planning and working outside all the road blocks that have come up.

A HUGE Thank You to Kokomo’s Bar & Grill for the donation to help make this all happen so quickly!

Thank you all! We miss your kids and it’s not even a week! Enjoy them they grow up fast.",2020-03-23 14:35:04,,

We are getting on the #hydranthero bandwagon!!

With this snow fall we are going to be running a contest, pretty simple for rules.
1. Shovel the snow around your neighborhood hydrant at least 3 feet out from any connections.
2. Snap a selfie or a video of you doing the work.
3. Post it to the comments in this thread.

Prize will be selected at random and will receive a ride to school in a fire truck! (Must go to CHS and be able to get to the fire hall) they will also receive a $10 gift card to BP in town for a hot cup of coffee or some gas for the snowblower! Do not need to be a student to enter!

Entries must be submitted Monday 1-20-2020 by 11:59 pm to be eligible for the prize. Please like and share this post to get the word out, and feel free to clean out more than one hydrant!

EDIT: We understand that the weather hasn’t been very warm/nice but we have a warm up on the way and are extending the deadline 48 hours!

On Saturday, January 11, 2020, the 18U Summer Baseball program is having a bingo fundraiser at the Cleveland Legion starting at 6pm. This is the first year that Cleveland has had an 18u team. We are beyond excited to get things rolling to bring an experience and lifetime of memories to our student athletes. All proceeds from this event will go towards purchasing equipment, tournament fees, and other expenses, such as umpire costs, league fees, and field rental. With that, we are looking for parent/player volunteers to help us with selling cards, helping with food and/or bringing a dessert, and clean-up.

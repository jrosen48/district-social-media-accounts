With summer school quickly approaching, we highly recommend you contact your child's physician if they are considered high risk or immunocompromised prior to attending summer school or school this fall.

Efforts will be made to social distance as much as possible. Hand washing and good hygiene practices (cover your cough/sneeze, wash hands before and after eating and bathroom use, etc) will be encouraged and enforced. Please monitor your child’s temperature, and keep your child home if they have a fever or any other signs of illness.

Immunizations are still required for your child to attend school. Please be sure to submit immunizations to the school via mail, drop off, fax or email prior to the start of school. Students cannot attend if they are not up to date or have the proper documentation on file.

Dear Billings Community,

I was approached with a wonderful opportunity today to accept a delivery from the Convoy of Hope, with food items from the USDA Farmers to Families Food Box Program. These items include half-gallons of 2% milk, boxes of fruits and veggies, boxes of individually packed cinnamon rolls, bottles of tea, and onions. The food is free and available to anyone who can use it. We will be here at the school tomorrow from 8:00 am to noon, outside the cafeteria, behind the school on Mt. Vernon. If you can use the food, but cannot get here and pick it up yourself, please call me and I will do my best to deliver it to you. Hope to see you tomorrow! If you have any questions, you can call me on my cell, 417-838-4609.

You might have noticed these signs popping up around town. While the school year isn't ending the way any of us envisioned, we want our seniors to know we are so proud of them! Some of the high school staff and faculty got together yesterday to deliver these signs to our amazing seniors. It was a bitter sweet task--we certainly wish we were still in school enjoying our time together instead of staying six feet apart on a front lawn, but just being able to see some of these smiling faces was a bright spot! Congratulations, Class of 2020!
If you have a picture of your senior with their sign and want to us to add it to the Clever Class of 2020 Sign Album on this page, just send it to submissions@cleverblujays.org.",0.0,"Clever High School

Just a heads up that Grab-N-Go Friday and Monday (April 10 and April 13) will look a little different. Our wonderful crew will be taking some well deserved time off, but you will still be able to get your Grab-N-Go meals!

First Baptist Church of Clever will be supplying and distributing Grab-N-Go meals on 4/10 and 4/13. A big shout out to them for helping take care of our community. We have always said it takes a village, and the churches, organizations, and community members have shown that Clever Bluejays take care of each other.

FBC members will be distributing Grab-N-Go meals on 4/10 and 4/13 in the Elemiddle bus lane between 11:00 am and 12:30 pm to Clever community members 18 years of age and under. Friday will be hamburgers and Monday will be hot dogs (both days will include a breakfast as well).

Please be advised that Influenza B and A as well as strep has hit the district. We have sent numerous students home with flu-like symptoms and fevers. It is imperative that students remain home if they are ill. Students need to be symptom and fever free for 24 hours without fever reducing medications before they can return to school. Fever is considered 100 F or greater. Please note that students should also feel well enough to participate in normal activities before resuming school.
Symptoms noted are persistent coughing, sneezing, body aches, chills, fever, sore throat, headache, nasal congestion and drainage, lethargy, dizziness, light headedness, weakness, tiredness, nausea.
Some students have had only a few minor symptoms and have tested positive for Influenza.

The safety of our students is our number one priority. From the time a student steps onto a bus until he or she arrives home, we are responsible for their well being. With that in mind, I would like to take this opportunity to remind parents/guardians that end-of-day transportation changes must be communicated with appropriate office personnel in a timely manner.

Notice of changes must be received in the appropriate office no later than 2:00 p.m. (or 12:00 p.m. on early release Fridays) to ensure communication to the student. Messages must be accurately logged and delivered to each student with end-of-day changes, and any messages received after the cutoff time negatively affect our ability to do so.

To mention just a few, we had a “shop with a cop” opportunity, thank you to our local police officers for all of your service and for these types of opportunities; there were Holiday class parties; the PTO partnered with the school to get 14 meals to local families to make their holiday a bit brighter; a local church adopted a family for the holiday; the kiddos went crazy for our resident elf who kept popping up at interesting places all around the school, and of course we wished Mrs. Porlier a happy retirement, complete with a cake decorated by our own talented Mrs. Followell!

Hello Families,
We’re looking forward to seeing everyone at our Elementary Open House Tuesday September 10th from 5:00-6:30!

Free hotdogs while they last 🙂

Please bring your calendar to schedule fall and spring conferences!

We have lots of shiny new things to show you, but a few things are still in progress. The construction crews did an amazing job with getting so much accomplished in those ten weeks of summer! We are looking forward to seeing the last few things come in over the coming month.

See you tomorrow!

Teddy's acrobatic career started with backyard trampoline, when he was but a wee lad, where he spent many a summer's day bouncing (in the shade, of course, he's very pale) and teaching himself flips. He has since branched out to martial arts, cheerleading, tumbling and a variety of aerial arts.
Teddy has been teaching gymnastics for the past 6 years, and couldn't imagine his life at a muggle job (He means a corporate desk job and he would know as he has a Masters in Business). He left his cushy bank job to pursue all things acrobatic. When not teaching, he's most commonly seen training, taking classes or going out and socializing. Sometimes he combines all three activities into one! Teddy is very easy to spot with a loud voice and his luscious blonde locks.

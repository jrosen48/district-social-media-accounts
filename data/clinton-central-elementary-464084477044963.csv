Our generous donators,

·Rose Acres for donating 300 dozen eggs, which allowed us to distribute a dozen eggs to each family for 3 weeks.

·Aldi Foods for donating grocery bags, which allowed for each child to have their own sack on distribution days.

·Ruler Foods for donating loaves of bread to include with the meals.

·Healthy Communities for the many household items that were passed out to the families.

We would also like to thank the parents who signed up their children and picked up their meals. We would like to thank Mr. Remaly for all his help and support in the planning and all the hours he spent helping with our distribution of the meals. We would like to thank our Administration for helping pass out the meals. We also acknowledge our fellow co-workers who worked hard together and with combined efforts in the Elementary to prepare and pass out the meals.

Sincerely,
Becky McQuinn and Tina Crum",2020-06-22 17:05:23,,

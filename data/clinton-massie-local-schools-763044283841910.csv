We know that our families have numerous questions about how the next school year will be conducted. We understand the anxiety this lack of knowledge causes to a family and especially our students. Our goal is to make sound decisions that are student-centered and fiscally responsible at the same time. We are meeting as an administration team regularly to discuss our options and look for savings because of the state funding reductions. As we move forward we will update families as soon as possible. As plans surface from the state and other school districts we understand this may prompt our residents to want the same answers at the same time. We ask for grace and patience as we take our time and make decisions that hopefully will not have too many revisions once posted.

We were being very cautious when we split up the alphabet into three parts to ensure the lines would not be too long. Last night things went very smoothly and we are opening pick-up time from 4-7 this evening to all grades and all letters of the alphabet. No matter if you are A-G, H-N or O to Z please feel free to stop by tonight! We will also have an all student pick-up time tomorrow from 12-2 pm. This will eliminate the need for the rescheduled evening pick-up on Thursday. The same traffic patterns apply for both pick-ups.

If you can't make either day don't fret! We will have days in the summer to pick-up locker/cubby contents which will include also gym locker contents. Thanks for your understanding and flexibility! It was so fun to see a few students last night!! Stay Safe! #fuelthepositive

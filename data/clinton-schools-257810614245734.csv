For five long months we have waited and prepared to open our doors to our Cardinals.

We have planned (and planned some more), so that our students could come back to school in the safest way possible.

Even with the many hours of preparation, we know that not everything will be perfect tomorrow. Buses will be late, car rider lines will move slowly and those school office phones will be busy.

But despite all that might go wrong, our promise to you is this-our staff will take care of your children, build relationships with them, help them grow academically this year and do all we can to keep them safe. YOUR kids are also OUR kids.

If we show each other patience, flexibility, grace and kindness, we can make it through the first day, and every day after that.

TOGETHER, WE GOT THIS!

There are currently two paths to receiving a substitute teaching certificate.

Involve your civic group or business! Businesses can help by putting messages of support on your signs or windows and posters/balloons on your doors!

It is always our goal to have the most up-to-date contact information for our families. One of the ways we will reach out to parents regarding important events, school closings, and safety alerts is via our text messaging service through SchoolMessenger.

If you received text messages from our district last year AND your cell phone number has not changed, there is nothing further you need to do.
If you did not receive text messages from the district last year OR your cell number has changed, there are TWO very important steps you need to take.

1). Provide your child's school with the cell number where you wish to receive text messages (please also provide the school office with your email address).

2). After updating your preferred number with the school office, follow the simple steps on the document below. You MUST opt-in to receive text messages from the district.

The Clinton School District is looking forward to beginning the 20-21 school year as scheduled, on Tuesday, August 25th.

As we work on re-entry planning and the steps we should take to keep our students, families, and staff safe, we have created a survey to gather feedback from parents/guardians on reopening this fall as well as insight on how Distance Learning worked for your family last spring. Please click on the image below to complete the survey.

Your feedback, as well as advice from local, state and national health officials, will be used to help us implement a thoughtful and methodical reopening plan that meets student instructional needs and the health concerns posed by COVID-19.

*Masks are now optional to wear for practice and the ceremony.

*Seating has changed. Graduates will now sit in the home stands. Parents and families may sit on the field or in the visitor stands. There will be an area for handicapped seating, and an area marked off for picture taking. Please bring lawn chairs to sit in. We still ask that families sit together on the field.

*Don't forget: we will practice on Friday, June 26th at 5pm. We will start in the gym and move out to the stadium. We will have a cookout at the conclusion of practice.

*The gates will open at 8am for seating, and the ceremony will begin at 9am. If there is inclement weather, we will delay until the weather has passed. If this happens, please check our social media pages on FB and Twitter.

The District's No-Tax Rate Increase Bond proposal provides for renovations and improvements to be made to existing school facilities.

The kitchen at Clinton Intermediate School is currently a “warming-kitchen” only, not allowing for food to be prepared on-site. The District's bond package will allow for the current kitchen to be upgraded to a full-working kitchen. The No-Tax Rate Increase Bond will also allow for the current office spaces at Henry Elementary and Clinton Intermediate School to be converted into classrooms, allowing for additional learning spaces for students. The proposal will also provide for improvements to be made to student restrooms and other school facilities.

If you have visited Henry Elementary or Clinton Intermediate School, you have noticed that upon entry into the buildings there is no secure vestibule that restricts visitors from advancing past the office and into the rest of the building.

At the other schools in the District, visitors are confined within a vestibule and cannot access the rest of the school until someone in the office grants them access. Having a secure vestibule at Henry Elementary and Clinton Intermediate School was suggested as a needed improvement in a recent audit by Homeland Security and local law enforcement agencies.

CSD teacher and track coach, Nathan Johnson shared this special story with us.

""In 2010, right before I started working in the CSD, I was training for triathlons and ran a 5k race in Chilhowee. During the race, I remember a little girl who was 7 or 8 years old running in the same race and she kept up with me for the first mile or so, and I was so impressed. This little girl was Abbie Dameron who is now a CHS senior. Abbie ran track her freshman year and was going to come back this season to end her high school career. I recently gave her the trophy I received from that 2010 race, with a little note on the bottom as a senior track gift since she couldn't run this season.""

Spring Break looked a little different for CSD staff this year. Like you, staff spent most of their time in their homes with their family. But staff were also busy preparing for how school will look come next week.

Staff took part in virtual meetings, prepared lesson plans in a way they never have before, read books to their students, and more than anything missed their students!

Even though school won't look the same next week, we want to stay in touch with our students and families. Watch for some ways we plan to put some fun into our current situation!

Intro to Engineering Design is a new class offered at CHS this year. In this class, students are introduced to the engineering profession and a common approach to the solution of engineering problems, an engineering design process.

Teachers across the district who complete the Google Level 1 Educator Program, and are able to show how the integration of technology into their classroom will benefit students and supplement their teaching, are able to receive a classroom set of Chromebooks.

Congrats to 2nd grade teachers, Ms. Houk, Mrs. Briggs and high school teacher, Mrs. Daniel to be the first three teachers to receive their certification and receive this new technology. Several other teachers in the District have also completed their certification.

""With this initiative-based program, we don't waste money, time and effort on pushing technology onto a teacher who doesn't need it or want it. Our program also does not introduce a technology fee, which most standard programs require. We believe this program will maximize impact on student learning while using our resources responsibly"", says Donnie Sage, CSD's Director of Technology.

The district has utilized all of their built-in calendar hours for school closures. With the last weather-related school closure on February 13th, the district must begin making up hours missed.

Beginning on Tuesday, February 18th, Henry Elementary and Clinton Intermediate School, will be increasing their start times by 10 minutes. CIS will begin classes at 8:05 and Henry Elementary at 8:10 (doors at both buildings will still open at 7:30 and morning bus pick-up times will remain the same). The district's other buildings already attend school 10 minutes longer than Henry and CIS, thus their start times will not be affected.

Adding minutes to the school day allows the district to make-up the minutes missed, without adding additional days to the end of the calendar.

Please remember that the new start times mentioned above will also be the start times for Henry and CIS during the 2020-2021 school year.

If you have any questions, please contact your child's school principal.

It is that time of year when we start seeing more illnesses in our students. We just want to remind our families when students need to stay home.

*Students need to stay home if they have a fever of 100.0 or greater.

*They should not return to school until they are fever-free for 24 hours without fever-reducing medication.

*Students need to stay home if they are having diarrhea and vomiting and should not return until they have had 24 hours of no vomiting or diarrhea

*Sometimes your doctor will recommend your child stay home longer for certain illnesses. Please follow your doctor's advice.

*If your student stays home sick, please call their school office to notify them.

This is a great time to remind students to wash their hands and use hand sanitizer often and to keep their hands away from their eyes, mouth and nose. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact your child's school nurse.

135 tulips were planted at all schools last fall in memory of the 135 fallen officers who lost their lives in the line of duty in 2017. In the last few weeks, students have enjoyed watching the tulips they planted bloom.

This tulip campaign was sponsored by the Henry County Honor Coalition and was in conjunction with Red Ribbon Week.

We recently came together to donate $1,000 to the Clinton Community School District toward PPE costs for the 2020-21 school year.

We've long been a supporter of our area schools. With the uncertainty surrounding those schools for the school year, we wanted to help them prepare for a year unlike any other.

That's why we're donating money to our area schools to purchase additional items, such as PPE, so they're safer when opening this fall. Overall, First Central State Bank is committing $5,000 to area schools this fall.

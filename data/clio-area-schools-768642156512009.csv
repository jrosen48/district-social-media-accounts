Our wrestlers had a great weekend at the New Lothrop Hall of Fame tournament. The team took 2nd overall and had several individuals make the finals, including senior Jacob Smith, who went undefeated and was crowned tournament champion in the 160 lb weight class.

In addition, freshman Khloe Williams competed in her second MIGWAY tournament and once again brought home the gold medal.

You can catch the team at home on Wednesday, January 8, when they take on Brandon and Swartz Creek in the first league matches of the season.

Our DECA Chapter was very well represented at the International Career Development Conference held in Orlando, Florida.
Our members qualified to attend based on superior performances at the district and state levels.
This year Clio had 13 students compete for a chance to win the coveted DECA Glass. Our team of Cassidy Fortney, Ashley Wagner, and Ethan Webber (pictured here with Mr. Thompson) placed in the Top 5 for their Chapter Awards Project, earning them ""DECA Glass!""

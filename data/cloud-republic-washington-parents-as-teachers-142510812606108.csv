Activity of the Week!
Peek-A-Boo Board
For this activity, you will need colorful felt or cloth (several pieces), scissors, glue gun & glue sticks, a large piece of foam board or large piece of cardboard, and animal photos (or animal flashcards). To get started, cut several pieces of felt or cloth to fit the size of my animal flashcards/pictures. Then prepare the board by gluing the zoo animal flashcards around on the white foam board. Next, grab the glue gun and glue each rectangle on top of its matching zoo animal flashcard. Only put glue along the very top edge of the rectangle so that the felt stays secure to the board and you can still lift up the felt to easily to see the animals. Once the glue is dry allow your child to come and play. Encourage them to search for specific animals and talk with them about the animals they find.

Activity of the Day!
Ice Play
The idea behind this invitation to play is to freeze interesting items inside blocks of ice for your children to release and explore. For this activity, you will need water, containers such as ice cube trays, small cups, plastic bowls, balloons, etc., and small toys large enough not to pose a choking hazard for your child. Place water and the small items into containers. Place the containers into the freezer until frozen solid. Once the items are frozen take your child outside and provide them with pipettes, or a squeeze filled with warm water to help rescue the items inside the ice. You can also provide items for chipping and hammering the ice: spoons, scoops, toy tools, and safety goggles. Encourage your child to try different methods of releasing their toys and them to play as long as they are interested!",0.0,"Harvey County Parents as Teachers

Alright parents, there have been a lot of on-line 'tips' for eveyone as we stay at home. We talk a lot about the behaviour of the kids but let's take a moment and talk about yours....
Some of you may be ready for a little check in, so I made you a chart. That's right a chart for the parents! It's a check in to remind you that your kids take their lead from you. Just like we help the kids track what they are doing here is one for you. You can put whatever is important to you on your list. Writing it down and posting it will help you remember it in the moment when you are not at your best, cause you are human and trying to navigate this new reality.",0.0,"I love this! ❤️

Have a moment to do something silly with your child during changing time? Great! After you change your child try this #VroomTip. Puff up your cheeks like a blowfish & then place their feet on your cheeks to push the air out until you go ""pop!"" This game may be silly, but it's not! Your child learns to watch & respond, which are important to communication. Stopping for a little silly is always good.

A better plan is to walk to your child and talk face-to-face.

Do you ever stop to listen to yourself when you are lecturing your child? Likely you could have stopped after the first sentence. All the gibberish that follows probably didn't make it better - and may have caused your child to completely tune you out. Say LESS and they'll hear you MORE.

DAILY ACTIVITY: Hide and Seek

We haven't yet met a kid who didn't like some version of hide and seek. It is a great game to play inside or outside, too!

WHY THIS ACTIVITY IS GOOD FOR KIDS:
Hiding games encourage kids to focus attention, use working memory, and practice basic self-control skills. And of course because they're super fun :)

For this activity, you will need a sensory bin or large tub, rice, a giant bowl, a slotted spoon, an icecube tray, and mini dinosaurs or other small animals. Start with the big sensory bin and add in the giant bowl. Mix the mini dinosaurs and the rice together – making sure to really hide the dinosaurs down deep. Next to the bowl, place the ice cube tray as the “keeper” of the dinosaurs once they are scooped out. Show your child how to use the slotted spoon to find the dinosaurs, scoop them out, and transfer them to their ice cube tray.",0.0,"Harvey County Parents as Teachers

Singing can reduce stress and relieve anxiety. And when you sing with your child during diaper change it's a brain-builder too! Next diaper changing use this #VroomTip to sing about what you're doing. Watch your child & copy the sounds they make so you can create a song together. Sounds fun right? When your child hears new sounds & sees your response, they will become focused & engaged. It helps them learn words & sounds. Plus it's stress relief for you.

Early learning happens at home. Due to the impact of COVID-19 many families are now spending more time at home together. We're offering Vroom Tip videos every Tuesday at 10am to help add early learning into your new daily routine. Parents and caregivers YOU already have what it takes to create a bright future for your child!

#VroomTip: Play ""Beat and Repeat"" anywhere. Create a rhythmic beat with two claps. Can your child copy it? Repeat until they get it. Have them create their own rhythm with two claps. Anytime someone misses, try again. Then make it three beats. How many beats can you get to? Four? Five? Six?

#BrainyBackground: Your child develops self-control as they copy your patterns or create their own. If they make a mistake, all the better. They learn that mistakes are a necessary part of learning—a good lesson no matter how old you are! https://youtu.be/Auns4tHyXes",0.0,"YOUTUBE.COM

Early learning happens at home. Due to the impact of COVID-19 many families now spending more time at home together. We're offering Vroom Tip videos every Tuesday at 10am to help add early learning into your new daily routine. Parents and caregivers YOU already have what it takes to create a bright future for your child!

Baby conversations can take place anytime, like feeding time. Use this #VroomTip to start the conversation by describing what you think your baby wants. Conversations go both ways, so watch how your baby responds to you without words and keep the conversation going. You can show babies new ways of communicating. Like making a sign or gesture for milk.

#BrainyBackground: When you listen to what your baby is telling you and respond back, with or without words you are having a real conversation. Even before babies can say words themselves, they are learning what words mean and how to communicate all while strengthening your bond. https://youtu.be/GvvVoN2xekY",0.0,"YOUTUBE.COM

We're offering Vroom Tip videos every Tuesday at 10am to help add early learning into your new daily routine. Parents and caregivers YOU already have what it takes to create a bright future for your child!

Baby conversations can take place anytime, like feeding time. Use this #VroomTip to start the conversation by describing what you think your baby wants. Conversations go both ways, so watch how your baby responds to you without words and keep the conversation going. You can show babies new ways of communicating. Like making a sign or gesture for milk.

#BrainyBackground: When you listen to what your baby is telling you and respond back, with or without words you are having a real conversation. Even before babies can say words themselves, they are learning what words mean and how to communicate all while strengthening your bond. https://youtu.be/GvvVoN2xekY",2020-03-24 18:24:27,,

Sorting the laundry? Use this #VroomTip to encourage your child to help you find all of the socks and make a pile of them. Pick a sock and make up a story, pretending it is a puppet looking for its matching friend. Celebrate when you find a match. Then let them take a turn as the puppet.

#BrainyBackground: Not only is this activity fun, but your child makes connections as they group the socks and look for the matching pairs. They must use focus and self-control to remember the details of the matching sock. When they pretend, they're thinking creatively.

Encourage sharing and taking turns with this #VroomTip. Ask your child to feed you! After they take a bite say, “My turn!” Open your mouth and see if they'll give you a bite. Say, “Thank you!” and then prompt them to take a turn. They will love having a turn at being in charge!

When Mr. Sparkles (the teacher assistant’s pet) went missing, the detectives in Room 161 KPD were on the case! These kindergarteners studied and measured shoe impressions, conducted finger print analysis, interrogated suspects while working on their questioning skills, made maps, studied video surveillance, and even decoded secret messages while making inferences about who could have committed the crime! All of the clues led them to the final revealing moment where the kids realized it was their teacher all along! They decided to set her free after a stern discussion about right and wrong!

Bethel first grade astronauts went to space academy last Friday! They rotated through stations answering questions about the work that astronauts do. They created, researched, and even tasted their way through astronaut life. Students are now writing scripts for their video reflections they will build using the iMovie app. Can't wait to hear what they learned!

SWEEP!

How ""sweep"" was it? The boys fought back from 18 points down, forced OT on a half-court buzzer-beater from Cory Adams, then finished the job in OT!

The #1 ranked girls team in the state got another strong outing from Aylesha Wade with 21 points in a wire-to-wire victory.

Adding to the drama of the night, Coach Jackson earned his 300th career coaching victory. Congratulations, Coach Jackson!

Mr. Barrett's third graders engineered brand new animals that would survive in an assigned environment: mountains, wetlands, ocean, rainforest, arctic, or desert. They then used a sphero robot to move their animal through a ""test"" environment following their presentation to the class. How creative these students are! Ask them tonight what the name of their animal was and what adaptations they used to survive.

She began her time in education as a paraeducator before going back to school at age 40 to earn a teaching degree. She loves getting to know her students and working with families to help them flourish during the school day.

One way Susan connects with students is through poetry. She asks her students to use their senses to communicate, writing about what they see, hear and feel.

***Take a Book/Give a Book***

Campbell Moore, a 4th grade student at WNES, decided this year for her GT project (in addition to her ""Pop It and Drop It"" soda tab campaign) she wanted to create a Free Little Library for her community.

She spent all winter planning, building, and painting it with the help of her dad, Nathan Moore. It is located at Bert's and is now open for business!

The Cloverport Schools STLP team created an awesome QR Code system that will help people locate the library and also future Little Libaries around our community. STLP also did a book drive and collected several books that will go in the library!

They will be adding more books over the next few days but if you have some books laying around the house, feel free to add it to the library! If you know of a child who loves books, please, take one from the library! *You dont have to give a book to take one!*

Way to go Campbell and the STLP team! We are proud of you! ♠️💙",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3513715368702031&id=762606220479640,,0.0,"♠️📚ACES LITTLE LIBRARY 📚♠️

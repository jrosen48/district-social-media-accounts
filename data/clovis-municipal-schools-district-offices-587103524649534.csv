This year, instead of doing a traditional science fair, 4th and 5th grade have participated in creating STEM projects as a group.

Instead of students completing a traditional science experiment at home and doing a science board, Barry developed a list of STEM projects that students could choose from that more closely aligned with NextGen science standards.

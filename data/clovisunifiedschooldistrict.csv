Check out this amazing virtual performance the Clovis High School band and colorguard did of the Cougars' fight song to commemorate its 50th year.

The CHS Fight Song was written in September 1970 by then Clovis High band director Patrick Balakian.

The story goes that Balakian was good friends with Clovis Unified founding superintendent Dr. Floyd ""Doc"" Buchanan. One day, maybe during a Friday night football game as the former fight song ""On Wisconsin"" was played, Balakian went up to Doc and said,"" You know that Clovis is playing someone else's fight song?"" Doc turned to Balakian and said, ""So write one for us!"" And he did.

Thank you for the many questions -- nearly 700 so far -- for tonight's Town Hall online event about the opening of the 2020-21 school year.

We will be creating our presentation with these in mind, answering the most commonly asked questions during our discussion. We will take a few live questions as time allows. Questions and answers reflecting the many submitted questions will also be added to the FAQ on our website. Please check that often for updates.

Questions may still be submitted online at https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/8fa850560cbf44ac84bcd0185add2980 .

The Town Hall will be live at 5 p.m. July 22 at https://www.youtube.com/user/clovisusd/feed. It will also be recorded and saved on the district's YouTube channel for on-demand viewing.

These are challenging times. We will work hard to keep our parents, students and staff informed with changes and updates as they occur. And, we will do our very best to make this a great school year for our children!

Together, we've got this Clovis Unified!

Their Junior Group Performance project, ""Freewheeling for Feminism: Breaking Barriers on the Bicycle,"" placed ahead of 90 other projects from across the United States and international territories!

The girls' thesis statement reads in part: ""...this began to change in the 1880s when women gained a new sense of freedom after the 'safety' bicycle was introduced. The new mode of transportation fostered greater independence as women had more control over where they went and when. The eventual acceptance of women in the public sphere, caused by the bicycle, helped women break clothing, gender, and suffrage barriers that continue to influence today's modern feminist movement.""

Several Clovis Unified schools have held (or will be holding) teacher parades through their school neighborhoods. Signs, streamers, chalk drawings and pom poms were used by teachers, students and parents to offer one another support and to let each other know how much they are missed.

Said Dry Creek Elementary Principal Aaron Cook - whose staff spent nearly three hours happily waving from their car windows last Friday - “We miss our kids! Our teachers were asking to do this. We didn’t have a chance to tell them goodbye before this [site closure] happened. This is a way we can reach out to see our students and tell them we love them in a safe, social distance environment.”

The love was definitely felt, and teachers from many schools said they were thrilled to see the smiling faces of their kids.

In addition to other actions implemented by the district last week, today, students in all classes will view age-appropriate video lessons on proper hand washing and hand hygiene. Students will be given time before and after lunch/recess to wash their hands. Signage has been placed in highly visible locations around campuses reminding children of good hand washing practices.

Parents and guardians have also received an email from Superintendent Eimear O'Farrell Sunday afternoon on this subject.

Clovis Unified is in close communication with local health officials for continued best practices and recommendations for our area, and will make adjustments accordingly.

Peer counselors are trained through an elective class that is offered at all secondary schools in the district. The classes teach students by engaging them in role playing scenarios, helping them identify how and when to make referrals for mental health services, and more. Students can self-refer or be referred by a teacher or a friend for a session during the school day.

CLASSROOM GRANT UPDATE!
Earlier this school year, we awarded a classroom grant to the Buchanan High School Yoga Club for yoga mats and equipment. Here, the group, led by instructor Gabrielle Waters, is preparing for a club meeting where they'll be rewarded with the benefits of their breathing and meditative Yoga exercises. Yoga aims to calm the mind and body, while increasing flexibility, muscle strength and posture.

Interested in funding an innovative school project of your own? Our Classroom and School Grants application window will open in early May 2020 and information can be found on FoundationForClovisSchools.com.

Hundreds of students from Clovis Unified's high schools attended the Transition Leadership Conference this week. Keynote speaker Brad Bell -- a CUSD graduate -- shared his own story of challenges growing up and how he ultimately made choices to not let his past define his future. He encouraged students to know who they are and what they represent. ""Your story is still being written, and no one gets to write the next chapters but you,"" he said.
Students also participated in breakout sessions in which they could share their own stories and learn about resources, support and opportunities, including a CTE/College/Career Fair.
Also at the event, Gateway High teacher and transition counselor Randi Steele was presented with the Prandini Legacy Award for her impact on students.

The northeast Fresno school, that serves close to 600 students, was honored with the Exemplary High Performing School award.

Recognition as a Blue Ribbon School is based on a school’s overall academic performance or progress in closing achievement gaps among student subgroups.

“We recognize and honor your important work in preparing students for successful careers and meaningful lives” said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos in a video message to the honorees. “As a National Blue Ribbon School, your school demonstrates what is possible when committed educators hold all students and staff to high standards and create vibrant, innovative cultures of teaching and learning.”

Local area law enforcement agencies and school districts are joining together to remind drivers they are required to stop when a school bus has its red lights flashing or stop sign extended. This indicates students are getting on or off a bus.

Red means stop. It's the law, and the right thing to do.

Schools will be back in session soon and more buses will be on the roads. (Clovis Unified starts Aug. 19.) Keep our children, bus drivers and motorists safe.

Both directions of traffic are required to stop when a bus has its red lights flashing. Failure to do so can result in fines of up to $1,000 and could mean loss of driving privileges for one year.

Don't pay the price in a fine or a life. Red means stop.

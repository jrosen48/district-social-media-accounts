1. Our CMCSS teachers, administrators, and staff are committed to each and every CMCSS student.
2. Our CMCSS students continue to amaze us with their talent, resilience, and strength of character.
3. Our CMCSS parents and families are essential to creating a safe, encouraging environment for our students.

Remember, our children learn by example. Let’s encourage, support, and find solutions together.

Our very own Bethany Erb was nominated by one of her amazing students, Kait. When she is not working hard as our Director of Awards, Recognition, and Scholarships she is making a huge difference in her own school. Kait says that Bethany's support ""extends way beyond her office"" and she ""helps a ton in little fragments everywhere.""

Kait praised Bethany by sharing that ""she's been there not just for me, but for other students and staff during this unpredictable time and I can say it means a lot to all of us to have her."" We hear that Bethany has even inspired some Tik Tok videos!

We think this says it all: ""Bethany has encouraged me to want to be a school counselor myself.""

We love you Bethany and we are so grateful to have you as a member and Board Director.

Do you know someone who should be recognized for their amazing work? Tell us about them, so we can honor them in an upcoming newsletter.",8.0,"Thank you for being a difference-maker, Ms. Erb!!

Because of the challenges created by COVID-19, we’re developing a new at-home AP Exam option. Students will be able to test on a computer, tablet, or smartphone.

We will invest so that every AP student impacted by COVID-19 has the tools and connectivity they need to review AP content online and take the exam from home.

We are committed to supporting our Advanced Placement students in preparation for the upcoming AP exams, and your school will be in touch during the coming weeks. In the meantime, students can visit apcentral.collegeboard.org to continue working through review resources for their specific test. Students should not take steps toward testing on their own without consulting their school first. Students are not alone in this endeavor. Their teacher, principal, and district are here to support them.",2020-03-23 13:26:30,,

CMCSS has proactive measures in place to reduce the spread of illness in our schools such as our two-step cleaning process, which allows custodians to focus their attention on high-touch surfaces to kill germs. District leadership is continuing to meet with local health officials to review best practices and receive updates which may impact this community. CMCSS is focused on keeping our more than 36,500 students and 5,000 employees safe.

The following resources from the CDC provide actionable things you and your children can do to prevent the spread of flu, strep, and COVID-19.

To be officially StormReady, a community must:

∙ Establish a 24-hour warning point and emergency operations center
∙ Have more than one way to receive severe weather warnings, forecasts and to alert the public
∙ Create a system that monitors weather conditions locally
∙ Promote the importance of public readiness through community seminars

1. Our CMCSS teachers, administrators, and staff are committed to each and every CMCSS student.
2. Our CMCSS students continue to amaze us with their talent, resilience, and strength of character.
3. Our CMCSS parents and families are essential to creating a safe, encouraging environment for our students.

Remember, our children learn by example. Let‚Äôs encourage, support, and find solutions together.

Our very own Bethany Erb was nominated by one of her amazing students, Kait. When she is not working hard as our Director of Awards, Recognition, and Scholarships she is making a huge difference in her own school. Kait says that Bethany's support ""extends way beyond her office"" and she ""helps a ton in little fragments everywhere.""

Kait praised Bethany by sharing that ""she's been there not just for me, but for other students and staff during this unpredictable time and I can say it means a lot to all of us to have her."" We hear that Bethany has even inspired some Tik Tok videos!

We think this says it all: ""Bethany has encouraged me to want to be a school counselor myself.""

We love you Bethany and we are so grateful to have you as a member and Board Director.

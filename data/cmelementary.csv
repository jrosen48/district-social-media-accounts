Today, we were bestowed with the honor of recognizing Lance Cpl. Curtis A. Christensen, Jr., who lost his life Jan .11, 2008, defending and serving our country. 3rd - 6th Grade students lined up the front walkway cheering on the runners who came up to the flag post to meet and greet Mrs. Christensen and thanking the sacrifice her son and her family made. It was a touching morning to say the least and one that the students will remember for a long time to come.
We hope we can be part of this honorable event for years to come.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1727089017389431&id=324615467636800,,0.0,"What an absolute honor and privilege for our school to be a stop along the Run for the Fallen Heroes recognizing and paying tribute to the men and women lost during their line of service in our Armed Forces.

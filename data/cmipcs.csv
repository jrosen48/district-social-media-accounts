It wasn’t my intention to offend, only to ask how your week went, but no matter: an apology is due. I’m very sorry.

All of us at CMI know that spring break was not what anyone had hoped for. Plans were cancelled. Actual break time may have been elusive. And many of our community members are struggling right now.

The “Welcome Back” in my post was very sincere. We’re all glad to see you and our students again, even if it’s “only” online. And we do hope that you found some enjoyment over break. Know that we’re here for you and that we appreciate everything you do to support us.

I submit a humble “mea culpa.”

Emily Rice of the DC Department of Energy & Environment (DOEE) joined the Squad today as we searched for the first hidden geocache in our new series.

Our project, “Geocaching DC’s Waterways,” involves hiding 5-6 geocaches with partner schools and school communities. Each geocache will highlight an aspect of stormwater runoff, its effects on the pollution of the Anacostia River, and how to mitigate it.

This geocache, which was hidden by another Squad just before Thanksgiving, highlights the trash trap at 14th and Gallatin Sts, NE, which traps litter before it lands in a tributary of the Anacostia River.

This morning, the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) announced the release of the SY 2018-19 DC School Report Cards, including ratings for all public schools in DC on the School Transparency and Reporting (STAR) framework. They provide more evidence that public charter schools continue to improve and to deliver quality educational choices to DC residents.

Here are the highlights:

-The number of top-rated DC public charter schools is on the rise, with 30 schools earning a rating of either 4 STAR or 5 STAR
- For the first time, families in Wards 7 and 8 each have a 5 STAR school among their school options
- After closing three low-performing public charter schools last school year, there is currently only one one-star school still operating within our network

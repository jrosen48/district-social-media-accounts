We had such high hopes that we would get to see everyone in August but, that is not going to happen as you have already heard. We are moving to 100% virtual as the Governor has asked all districts to do. We want to be able to provide ALL of OUR students the necessary tools to do so. Below you will see the schedule to check out Chromebooks according to grade. In addition to checking out the Chromebooks, we will have a tutorial video on the Learning Management System, Canvas, that we and the state have opted to use for distance learning. We HIGHLY encourage the student and one parent to please attend this session to be informed of this learning platform we will be using in the 2020-2021 school year.

My administration made the very difficult decision, in close consultation with educational and health leaders, to extend public school closures through the rest of the academic year. We have to continue to take very aggressive steps to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.

We know this has tremendous implications for families and students all across the state.

Here is some information about a program that you can participate in that reduces the cost of internet or telephone service for those who qualify. The savings average about $9-13 a month, which is not a huge difference but for many of our customers, it allows them to upgrade to faster service so that multiple devices can be used at a time without disruption. Information will also be posted on TBTC social media. Questions contact:

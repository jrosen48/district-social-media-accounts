On Monday, August 31st we treated our new students to a breakfast picnic outside so we could all get to know each other. The discussion was facilitated by Mr. Dziuban, our social worker; Mrs. Veronda, our school psychologist, and Mrs. Carlson, our principal. The students shared where they were from and how CCIS is different from their previous school. Students were also able to ask questions and learn more about CCIS.

It has been such a great experience for our students to practice their writing skills all year with a friend. There is so much more motivation when they know there is a real recipient behind the letter, and knowing they will get mail back. The student’s eyes would light up when pen pal letters arrived at the school. Mrs. Franklin’s class is from Mazon. We had been talking about having a picnic for the students at the end of the year so students could meet each other face to face. We had already taken a class picture and sent it to each classroom in January. It was time to meet face to face. Then, we were sent home for e-learning. Mrs. Franklin suggested a Zoom meeting so we could still see each other face to face. We had 35 students participate in our Zoom meeting. It was great to “see” each other even though we were not able to get together.

They also used Unifix Cubes to give hand-ons and visual support. Another way we practice place value is by counting the number of days we have been in school this school year.

The art project was a great hands-on activity for the students to create something and a great language activity to discuss the similarities and differences among the witches.

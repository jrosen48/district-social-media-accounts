We're with Marah, a thoughtful young lady from Girl Scout Troop #4205. Her Silver Award project consisted of creating comfort supplies for individuals experiencing homelessness. She was kind enough to make our department one of the several organizations presented with the supplies to distribute when needed.

Thank you, Marah. We appreciate your desire to help others in need and wish you much success!

She was observed contributing to her community by making certain that the storm drains were clear since a storm is in the forecast. We learned from several eyewitnesses that she is frequently seen in the area cleaning up and helping others. Today, her conduct had consequences...Thanks to partnerships with David's Drive and Chester County Safe Kids Coalition, she left the police station with a new bike and safety helmet. Well done, Donnelle...We appreciate your hard work and sense of care. We hope that you enjoy your new ride and continue to strive to make a difference.

Being part of community activities and forging constructive relationships is important to our organization and the community we serve. With COVID-19 mandates and recommended safe practices in policing, you may notice less engagement and we may be handling more calls for service by phone. We've asked officers to maintain social distance when possible. We ask the public to do the same and be mindful of everyone's safety during this challenging time.

We ‚ù§Ô∏è seeing Reeceville students in action!

The 5th grade just finished their second Project Lead the
Way module, called ""Robotics & Automation."" Students built and investigated test beds with motors, color sensors, bumper switches, and touch LEDs. They worked in groups to research and present information on different types of robots (industrial, consumer, medical, military & security, exoskeletons, and telepresence), then built and modified robots to solve a real-world problem: locating & removing radioactive uranium fuel from the Fukushima nuclear disaster site in Japan.

Thank you to our awesome STEM/Science teacher Mrs. Canning, and way to go, Reeceville fifth graders!

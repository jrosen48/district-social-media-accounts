On Sunday, Batt. 3, T8, E21, and T21 participated in Lexy Trout's welcome home ceremony from her last chemo treatment. Lexy is 9 years old and was admitted into Scottish Rite Hospital on January 1st of this year with a severe headache. The test results came back as brain cancer, finding 3 tumors on her brain. After several surgeries, chemo therapy, and radiation over the past 9 months, Lexy is now cancer free. Lexy's parents wanted a big welcome home for her tonight after being discharged from her last chemo treatment so her friends, family, neighbors, and our Cobb Fire family showed up big for her. Lexy rang the bell on T21 to symbolize her last treatment. This kid has a huge heart and more courage than I can imagine. She won her battle with cancer with many additional hurdles to overcome due to Covid19. Congratulations Lexy!!! Thank you so much for inviting us, it was such an honor to be part of something so special.",0.0,"We wish you the best Lexy.

Yet another Cobb County leader has been selected for a prominent statewide position, as Cobb’s State Court Clerk leaves to become the first Clerk of the new statewide business court.

Davis leaves Cobb after more than 28 years of service. During her confirmation, Davis said her experience in Cobb prepared her well for this new challenge.
“The prospect of serving in a specialized court for the state of Georgia is so incredibly exciting,” Davis told the committee. “I’m driven by the idea of developing a first-in-class court. That’s the gold standard that my office currently operates under and has a reputation for pursuing.”
The new court begins operation next month. Robin Bishop, the Chief Deputy Clerk, will assume Davis’ role in Cobb County.

Attention Students & Parents!

We miss you all! Join us for a district wide parade!

Teachers & staff will line the sidewalks in front of both buildings ready to see your smiling faces as you drive through the parade route.
Teachers will be holding signs they’ve made just for you and ready to wave at you all.

Saturday, May 2nd from 6:00-6:30pm

The parade route is as follows: Enter through the elementary front parking lot (through the pick up line exit), continue up the main parking lot and in front of the high school, exiting near the home baseball dugout area. See the map below.

We hope to see you all then!",0.0,"https://www.facebook.com/164120813655006/posts/2992062317527494/

I am working on a slide show in honor of our 8th graders and I could use your help! I need an individual picture of each student, pictures of you as a class, in groups doing school activities, sports, hanging out...anything to make this amazing! Pictures from elementary would be good too. Once I have these, the slideshow will be shared on the school's facebook page and with each student. The deadline for pictures is May 8th. Please email all pictures to me - mgoodman@cusd17.com

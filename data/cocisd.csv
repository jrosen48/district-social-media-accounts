Our Trojans were celebrated in a mighty way at all of our campuses as we cheered them on to the 2020 Basketball State Championship Tournament. On Tuesday, March 10, James Street Elementary and Coldspring Intermediate students were excited to give each player the signs, poster, cards and letters they made to show their admiration and support. Lincoln Junior High students did the same, welcoming the team with a giant ""Trojan Pride Never Dies"" sign to greet them as they pulled into the campus. On Wednesday morning, Trojan Nation came out in force to cheer for our Trojans during the community pep rally at the high school gym. Afterward, the team was given a send-off as they boarded the bus to head to the state tournament.

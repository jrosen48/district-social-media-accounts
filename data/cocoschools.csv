You might have heard that the Governor made a statement suggesting that schools may not reopen until the fall. At this time, the Department of Education, the Department of Public Health, and the Governor’s Office have not made a decision in this direction. I continue to communicate daily with local public health officials and with our school leaders as we monitor and plan during this situation. I want to assure you that the school leaders throughout Contra Costa are working hard to help support families during this very stressful time. Your schools will continue to communicate with you as the situation evolves and decisions are made.

Our 3rd Graders Sevice Learning Project was learning how to spend money and want versus need. Mike Ewy with Community State Bank came and presented to them on this topic. They also created a business plan and sold their items to each other. Last but not least the 3rd Graders did a canned food drive for our local Genesis in town. They raised 3,000 cans! The student that raised the most cans in each class got to pie their teacher! These kids are going to go places!

It's official - School is closed as of the Governor's briefing just now through April 29th. Our teachers have been prepping for this potential and are ready to support our students.

Regents exams are going to be cancelled as well. Official word and details are expected tomorrow. We do not have any more details then that - but our kids still need to continue working as we will likely have a local final exam in all of those classes originally tied to a Regents.

All students have been given access to, or have been able to have academic packets made available, as a part of our Phase II of learning while on closure. If your student says they haven't gotten any work please contact your student's school. It is available and students are expected to be working! Phase II work has been pushed out over the last few days!

Stay strong and healthy everyone!

On Friday, October 11th, 2019 we will be participating in the county-wide early dismissal day. Students will be dismissed from school 15 minutes early. Students will follow their normal dismissal procedure. However, please discuss with your child(ren) what their “emergency dismissal” would be if there was an actual emergency. The school has on file your child’s emergency dismissal procedure that was filled out and turned in at the beginning of the year.

On Friday, October 11th all dismissal procedures for buses, walkers, and parent picks up will be at:

Cohen Elementary – 2:15 p.m. (Students begin exiting the building)
2:30 p.m. (Buses exit the Cohen Campus)

Kids World will still be in session.

As always if you have questions please contact the main office at 734-7132

When Ms. Crucetti stopped by to drop off some learning materials, she was greeted with colorful signs, balloons, sidewalk messages, and a gratefulness garden!

🌈Ms. Crucetti created a thankfulness quilt on her wall using the artwork created by several of her students.

Earlier in the week, the Edwards family celebrated with pre-K teacher Mrs. Petraznik when she stopped by with learning materials.

From Rachel Edwards, Abram Lansing PTO President: ""We would love to thank all the teachers in the Cohoes School District! We are part of such a great community and school district!""

This really made our day! Almost all the staff from Van Schiack Elementary came through our little city like a parade, to say hello, and that they miss our kids.

There were SO MANY, in fact, that they couldn’t all fit in my little parking lot and be able to circle out so we thought we missed them. We heard them beeping so we went inside a little disappointed but happy we heard them.

Well, Derek’s teacher and team would have none of that so they came back in a smaller group so that they could fit and say hello to Derek. Couldn’t ask for a better team of elementary school staff & teachers! Thank you for all you do!! 🎒 📚 🏫

Each day has featured a celebratory theme, incorporating holiday hats, pajamas and sweaters.

""We know that kids are going to be excited that last week of school before break, so we don't fight it. We embrace it,"" Principal Jacqueline DeChiaro said. ""We have fun while we learn and get our work done.""

In addition to their festive attire, students have made frequent visits to the ""Believe Room"" - a classroom that a handful of Van Schaick staff members spent an entire weekend turning into a winter wonderland.

""It's all worth it when you see their faces. We want to bring some of the magic of the holiday season to Van Schaick,"" DeChiaro said.

The lavishly decorated room features a station where students can make cards for senior citizens at The Eddy.

Van Schaick Grade School had a busy week to say the least! Oct. 21-25 was Character Education Week, with students wearing different color shirts each day to represent a positive character trait they aim to exemplify.

Throughout the week, students could earn a yellow character brick by ""getting caught"" demonstrating one of the traits. They earned red bricks by showing good character at home. On Friday, the students teamed up to create displays around the school using their collected bricks.

They also made ""Ben's bells,"" which were hung throughout the Van Schaick neighborhood to remind people to be kind.

The school's PTO sponsored Family Fun Spooktacular Dance was Thursday night and it featured some amazing costumes!

Students wrapped up the week by wearing pink clothing in support of Real Kids Wear Pink. Van Schaick's annual Food Drive is also in full swing and will wrap up next week!

“The kids have been super excited about it,” said PBIS coordinator Melissa Santarcangelo. “They’ve been asking ‘how do we get the tickets’ and ‘when do we get the tickets.'”

Santarcangelo added that she wants to see even more students achieve the incentive goals next time around.

“The cool thing is that, even for the kids who didn’t get it, the next five weeks is a fresh start. There’s always that opportunity to do better,” she said.",2019-10-18 16:19:02,,

Paul D. Tonko (D-NY) on Thursday delivered more than 30 sports-related books to Cohoes Middle School. The books came from the Library of Congress (LOC) as part of their Book Surplus Program.

The LOC receives about 20,000 books per day, but can only house about 10,000. The surplus books are distributed around the country to libraries looking to expand their collections.

Physical education teacher Teresa Gendron requested and received books on famous athletes, sports teams, and health and wellness. About 20 middle school student-athletes attended the Q&A with Congressman Tonko.

“Now they have more resources to learn about how famous athletes prepare, train, and take care of themselves,” Gendron said. “They’re going to read about what interests them, and athletes want to learn about other athletes.”

In appreciation for his visit, Principal Dan Martinelli presented Rep. Tonko with a Cohoes Tigers hat.

“When I look at that ‘C’ I’ll think of Cohoes, but also ‘class’ and ‘character,'” Tonko said. “I think your generation is rising to the challenge to fight for a better tomorrow.”",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2976938005653658&id=128787407135413,,0.0,"Rep.

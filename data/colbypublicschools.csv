Second, activities are really taking off. If you haven't received an Orange Calendar yet, let your office know so that you can stay in the know - check your student's backpack first, though. They should have come home with the youngest student by Friday!

Most of all, we are excited to continue our Fall Sports and the Homecoming Festivities we have planned. We know you might be missing our traditional Homecoming Dance. Don't worry - StuCo membership is planning and organizing an alternative event in the future to replace the homecoming dance this year.

The past couple of months have been hard. We have had to transition from your classroom to remote learning, setting up new lesson plans, preparing materials, and finding new ways to check in on and connect with our students. And all of us have done this while juggling the effects of COVID-19 on our family and personal lives as well.

I‚Äôm proud of our efforts and Colby Public Schools will continue to work hard to support you as you continue to support the children and families in our community. I know that we will take everything we have learned through this experience to make the educational opportunity for children in Colby even better when we are able to return to our buildings.

Any child residing in the Colby Public School District (USD 315) who will be five years old on or before August 31, 2020, is eligible to enroll. The final enrollment will be in August. At that time, we will need copies of your child's immunization records, birth certificate, and social security card.

To get started, we will need some basic information so that we can get your child(ren) into our system. Please proceed to Kindergarten Pre-Enrollment for 2020-2021. https://bit.ly/2yzLFW8

Thank you, and welcome to Colby Public Schools!

Good afternoon, by now many of you have heard of Governor Kelly's announcement earlier today regarding the remainder of this school term. Over the next several days and weeks, we will be providing information to you either as it becomes available to us or as decisions are made locally.

Please be patient as we work through this and bear in mind that we have never found ourselves in this situation and so we do not have a precedent from which to operate. Many decisions and changes must be made and implemented in a very short time. We will be doing our very best to make this transition as smooth as possible.

To this end, a ""button"" has been placed on all the district websites (district, grade school, middle school, and high school sites) with the label ""Coronavirus Information"". It is placed in the top, right corner of all sites so you can access all the information from any of your current bookmarks.

Good afternoon, by now many of you have heard of Governor Kelly's announcement earlier today regarding the remainder of this school term. Over the next several days and weeks, we will be providing information to you either as it becomes available to us or as decisions are made locally.

Please be patient as we work through this and bear in mind that we have never found ourselves in this situation and so we do not have a precedent from which to operate. Many decisions and changes must be made and implemented in a very short time. We will be doing our very best to make this transition as smooth as possible.

To this end, a ""button"" has been placed on all the district websites (district, grade school, middle school, and high school sites) with the label ""Coronavirus Information"". It is placed in the top, right corner of all sites so you can access all the information from any of your current bookmarks.

We have placed important information on this page for you and ask that you access it at your earliest convenience.

Are you heading to cheer them on at Regionals? Concordia's Athletic Director wanted to share Event Info and the best places to park for Regional Wrestling.

He says, ""Yellow is where we will set up buses, red consists of parking lots fans can utilize. Outside of those lots (which will probably fill) fans and school personnel will need to take advantage of side streets surrounding the school.""

So take note, park legally and safely, and CHEER LOUD!

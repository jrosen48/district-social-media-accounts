Many of the supplies were donated by the organization, but to offset costs, families could make a monetary donation. Students worked in pairs to make close to 30 blankets to donate. While the donations are something to celebrate, the real cause for celebration is the empathy students expressed for others as they reflected on the project. One student shared how much he focused on the fact that the blanket would be going to a child in need. Another student shared that by doing the project she became more aware of the needs of others. After a discussion with classmates about a fellow student in our district who is struggling, they decided to provide a blanket to them as well!

Many of the supplies were donated by the organization, but to offset costs, families could make a monetary donation. Students worked in pairs to make close to 30 blankets to donate. While the donations are something to celebrate, the real cause for celebration is the empathy students expressed for others as they reflected on the project.

The Senior Seminar classes hosted a “Where your education will take you” and “How I Built This” events throughout last week. The idea was for them to think about their life as something they build. Faculty, staff, and Amy from VSAC showcased a variety of personal stories i.e. how did you get where you are and what challenges and surprises did you encounter along the way? Students were also provided with information about resources available to them, regardless of the track they saw themselves post high school.

Busing Update for Midterms:

This message is to inform parents and students that there have been minor updates to the busing plan for exam week. Buses will run in the morning as usual, and will leave at 12:30PM. Students may not remain at school in the afternoon unless they have administrative approval. Students who attend CTE will have regular transportation in the morning from CHS to CTE. In the afternoon, CTE students will take the bus from CTE to Colchester Middle School, where they will board the correct bus for home. If your student lives in the islands, the CTE bus will continue from Colchester Middle School to the islands for drop-off.

Students who attend BTC will have regular transportation in the morning, however, the afternoon bus will bring you to Colchester Middle School after school. Students are responsible for finding their way home from Colchester Middle School.

If you have any questions about busing, please call Chad DeMagistris, Assistant Principal, at 802-264-5734, or Gabby Brooks, Administrative Assistant, at 802-264-5701.",2.0,"If you have a high school student who plans to ride the bus during exam week please see the announcement from CHS! 👇

All things considered, this is our safest option for our volunteers and visitors tomorrow.

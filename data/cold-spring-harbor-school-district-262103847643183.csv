Senior Lawn Sign Delivery!
It wasn’t DoorDash or Uber Eats knocking on everyone’s door this morning, rather it was an amazing group-undertaking by parents, teachers and staff, who gathered at the high school to coordinate “Senior Lawn Sign” deliveries to all the homes in the district with a graduating senior! Principal, Dr. Jim Bolen, led the charge, which followed 10 bus routes…and off they went to ring doorbells and knock on doors to the surprise and delight of our graduates. A huge thank you goes out to the CSHPTG for making it all happen! We are so proud of our seniors and the CLASS OF 2020!!!",0.0,"Cold Spring Harbor School District added 63 new photos.

The competition provides students with a health-related topic that impacts their local community and asks the students to develop a solution that addresses the nature of the problem, an innovative solution, appropriate resources necessary for implementation and an evaluation of the impact of the solution on specific community groups. This competition was established in 2013, and approximately 40 schools participate on the island. This year’s topic was “Vaccinations” and Director of STEM, Ms. Libertini, was very proud to announce this award, as a first-time entry for CSH!",2020-03-12 15:18:05,,

Last year the class of ’20 won the cup and would like to make it a repeat, but the class of ’25 has shown a lot of spirit this year.

The entire 8th grade participated in a History Day Contest.

This is the first time the junior high hosted a History Day Fair. It was a huge undertaking and Director of Humanities, Theresa Donohue, had a team of 10 judges who compiled their results to announce the “best of the best” and award student certificates.

Bulletin Boards always provide great showcases for art and reading! At West Side, Mr. Arloff’s sixth graders were challenged to research a topic and write a research-based information report to share what they discovered. A variety of diverse topics were explored, such as allergic reactions, water scarcity, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, solar power, greenhouse gases and more. Alex Lombardo researched plastic straw pollution, and learned that by 2050 there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish! Sasha Slaven studied dreams, and learned that some people have prophetic dreams which tell the future. Dylan Reilly wanted to learn more about time, how was it created, what are time zones, and what would happen without time? And thank you Jakob Masata, for making us think about car “idling.” He shared it’s much more important to stop pollution which is a top priority, by not warming up your car or idling while you wait!

During a science unit in Ms. DeRosa’s class, students were asked to research and construct a 3D polyhedron element from the periodic table with help from Library Media Specialist, Ms. Fraiberg. Sutton was surprised to learn about Ne (noble gas), and that it is used to make neon sign and glow sticks! Alexis chose Mn (manganese) and learned it can be used for batteries and to decorate glass. While Asher chose Cr (chromium) which is a metal that makes stainless steel for motorcycles and cars. Everyone was very excited about their elements and the many possibilities for which they can be used! Thank you for sharing these “not so elementary” elements…",2020-02-24 16:05:27,,

Pippin hit the stage in 1972 directed by Bob Fosse, which tells the tale of a young prince who longs to find passion and adventure in his life. The student’s song and dance numbers were simply spectacular!

Lloyd Harbor and West Side 4th graders have been living as Colonials for the past week! Beginning with their trip to the Lloyd Manor House they have been learning about Colonial children’s chores and the games they played. Earlier in their studies students researched the various jobs of Colonials through reading authentic texts, and learning trades such as; silversmith, shoemaker, Millers, ship building and so many more. They’ve also enjoyed hands-on experiences with lantern making, cross-stitching, and barn building. Thank you to educator, Ms. Joan McGee from Preservation Long Island, a local resident, who marked her 30th year visit to our schools for Colonial Day studies!",0.0,"Cold Spring Harbor School District added 29 new photos.

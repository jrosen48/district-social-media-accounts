Our Alumni dinner for June 13th is cancelled and is being reschedule for September 12th at the Mary’s Home Knights of Columbus hall. This dinner is important for several reasons. First, it allows us to gather with friends, classmates and a group of fellow “Eagles” tell old stories and create new ones. Second, it is the single largest fundraiser for the Alumni each year. We have graduated from a single $200 scholarship in the old days to our current awarding of two $750 scholarships this year.

Eugene Community,

Due to the winter weather this week and tomorrow’s basketball game being up in the air, we have decided to move our homecoming game and coronation to February 7th vs New Bloomfield. This is happening regardless if tomorrow’s game is cancelled or not.

Homecoming week will be February 3rd - February 7th.

More information to follow...

Thanks for being flexible and let’s hope for better weather for round 2!

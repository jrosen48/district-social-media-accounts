Kate Oligschlaeger noticed a student that wore the same clothes and ate every bite of their food at breakfast and lunch. Kate came to me and asked if her family could buy the student some things. I told her that is a wonderful idea and she did just that!! Her family brought in some much needed clothes, shoes and helped this student so much!! They had a smile for days because of the kindness that was shared by this family. Thank you, Kate for being that star student and helping another family in need!! Great work!! We are proud of you!!

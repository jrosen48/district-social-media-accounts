We wish times were different we were able to hold graduation as usual for our graduates. A message is being sent to seniors/parents in just a few minutes with reminders for the day and a little more information.
If you are a community member and would like to watch or hear the graduation, below are some ways to do so.
Graduation starts at:
 2:00 p.m. for graduates with last names beginning with A-H
 3:00 p.m. for graduates with last names beginning with J-Z
We have been able to also add a radio station to broadcast tomorrow’s events. You can tune in to 93.9 for both graduations. It can also be viewed on You Tube at: https://youtu.be/uZQ-HBgu60Q where it will be Live Streamed on a 20-second delay.
Congratulations to all of our 2020 Graduates!",2020-08-01 10:34:58,,

Certainly not the school year we wanted or planned on with so many challenges, missed events and activities and even more missed friends and supporters of our students and district. But, I'm still proud of all of us- our kids, their parents and my staff. This team has overall handled themselves positively, been supportive of each other and adjusted as well as any group I've seen anywhere. And it's been done because we love our Comets. We value what we do and WHY we do it. Our WHY is strong- it's always about learning of our kids and helping them to be successful academically, artistically, athletically, socially, emotionally and behaviorally.

On what would have been our last day of the 2019-2020 school year, students, know that we will miss you this summer and have missed you the past 3 months. We'll continue to focus on our WHY- you- in everything we do and every decision we make moving forward. Thanks for making us proud! Have a fantastic summer!

Hi Folks,

We're getting quite a few inquiries concerning the reopening of our Fitness Center.

We are still closed as we are committed to following the direction of state and local health authorities.

The minute we have the green light to open we will update our page with a DATE and the SAFETY PROTOCOLS in place for your safety and the safety of our team.

In the meantime we are offering outdoor personal training (look for the Parking Lot Personal Training post) and will be offering a Family Fit outdoor fitness class for parents/guardians and children to stay active, get out of the house and spend quality time together!

We miss you! We hope to see you sooner rather than later as long as we can BE SAFE.

In 2019 Morgan was the Coleman first place VFW Patriot's Pen writing contest winner. The essay was written as a 7th Grade class assignment. However she was determined to go farther and in 2020 as an 8th grader, she voluntarily wrote an essay and submitted it. She not only placed first in Coleman she also placed first in District 11. She represented District 11 in Kalamzoo in January for the State competition. She received 4th place in the State of Michigan. She is very disappointed that she cannot read her essay this year at the Veteran's Memorial on Memorial Day due to the Corona Virus pandemic.

Today we say thank you to the final player from the 2020 team, Senior Alivia Bovee. This would have been Alivia's first season, hence why she had yet to pick her number. I had to do some searching to find pictures of Livi in softball attire.
We were excited to have Alivia coming out for softball this season and were looking forward to what she could do for us. We had only been together for a week for softball, but her focus to better herself from day one was unmatched.
Yes, we were just inside and taking swings on tees and in the cage, but Coach was looking forward to she Livi make contact with the ball on the diamond. She did hit numerous homers over the net and into the weight room off the tee! I will never forget the look on her face after those swings.",0.0,"Comet Softball

Staying in number order, next up is #24 Junior Ali Zietz. Ali has been part of the varsity team on and off in both her freshman and sophomore seasons, including being with the team for the post season. This allowed Ali to gain a lot of experience including being there for two Final Fours and a State Runner-up. This was going to be a big break out season for Ali. She was going to be looked at to play two or three different positions, have her pitching skills put on display, and would also be part of a dangerous batting order. I know she is continuing to work on her skills and when she is able to take the field as a senior, she will be ready to lead the Comets.
Coach cannot wait to see how Ali grows and develops before the next season. Her skills in the circle as well as at the plate will be huge to the success of the Comets in the future!",0.0,"Comet Softball

Continuing in number order, Junior Lexi Aultman was changing her number to 19 this season, even though she was unable to wear it we will celebrate her as the #19!
Lexi was an addition to the roster for the post season run last year. This allowed her to gain valuable knowledge of the game at the varsity level from the veteran girls and coaches. Lexi was busy this year learning multiple positions and focusing on her approach at the plate. Lexi was preparing herself for a standout junior year, and we were all looking forward to her contribution to the team. Lexi will have some big shoes to fill and will be look at as a leader moving forward!

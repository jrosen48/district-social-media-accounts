The Coleman Schools' Comet Team never disappoints! Shout out to every single one of them for their energy in getting ready this week to bring our kids back in a positive, safe and unique time. From secretaries, counselors, School Resource Officer / County Agencies and custodians to teachers, transportation and food service staff, paraprofessionals, other support staff, administration and board office staff, the thought and energy is so impressive. While it will be challenging, know that everyone is doing their very best on behalf of our kids. We'll stumble sometimes because this is new, hit the mark sometimes, and be amazing sometimes but we'll always, always work to do the best for our Comet community. I feel fortunate to work with all our families again next week.

One year, after completing the school year at Yager School, teacher Lloyd Schad was asked to finish the last four weeks of school at Luman. Three other teachers either quit or resigned because of discipline issues.

Inadvertently, when we sent out Board Scholars letters, pamphlets and checks, we did not send the students' certificates. Those are available in the Board Office Mondays through Thursdays, 8:30-4:00 during the summer if you would like to stop by. Those who do not pick up can receive them when we return to school in the fall. We will also have them at graduation for the seniors.Thanks and sorry for the oversight.",0.0,"Jennifer McCormack

Certainly not the school year we wanted or planned on with so many challenges, missed events and activities and even more missed friends and supporters of our students and district. But, I'm still proud of all of us- our kids, their parents and my staff. This team has overall handled themselves positively, been supportive of each other and adjusted as well as any group I've seen anywhere. And it's been done because we love our Comets. We value what we do and WHY we do it. Our WHY is strong- it's always about learning of our kids and helping them to be successful academically, artistically, athletically, socially, emotionally and behaviorally.

On what would have been our last day of the 2019-2020 school year, students, know that we will miss you this summer and have missed you the past 3 months. We'll continue to focus on our WHY- you- in everything we do and every decision we make moving forward. Thanks for making us proud! Have a fantastic summer!

We value what we do and WHY we do it. Our WHY is strong- it's always about learning of our kids and helping them to be successful academically, artistically, athletically, socially, emotionally and behaviorally.

On what would have been our last day of the 2019-2020 school year, students, know that we will miss you this summer and have missed you the past 3 months. We'll continue to focus on our WHY- you- in everything we do and every decision we make moving forward. Thanks for making us proud! Have a fantastic summer!

Hi Folks,

We're getting quite a few inquiries concerning the reopening of our Fitness Center.

We are still closed as we are committed to following the direction of state and local health authorities.

The minute we have the green light to open we will update our page with a DATE and the SAFETY PROTOCOLS in place for your safety and the safety of our team.

In the meantime we are offering outdoor personal training (look for the Parking Lot Personal Training post) and will be offering a Family Fit outdoor fitness class for parents/guardians and children to stay active, get out of the house and spend quality time together!

We miss you! We hope to see you sooner rather than later as long as we can BE SAFE.

Go check out the service drive from the Board Office to the High School! Athletic Boosters are honoring ALL Spring Sport Student Athletes with their own sign. They didn’t get to have a season in 2020 so we thought we get their names out there. This week we honor the Track Teams. Go ahead and add a balloon or something to your sign (keep it simple) but please leave them for this weeks Friday Night Lights. The signs are then for each athlete to keep. Every student athlete that signed up for a Spring Sport has a sign. Thank you Tigner Printing for doing the signs!",4.0,"Coleman Athletic Boosters

I wanted to share a few updates with all of you.

Shelter- As of last night, Coleman High School had no one staying in the shelter and not today either. We are expecting some more evacuees tonight and the Red Cross is staying on as well as a rotation of custodians. People can enter at the side door of the high school.

Donation Center- As of about 1:00 this afternoon we have become a donation center and items of need and information are listed on the flyer that was posted recently on our website and Facebook page. Feel free to share it out. People should only arrive at the times listed at the side door of the high school or they will not be able to get in. No perishable items, no clothing.…",2.0,"MIDLANDFOUNDATION.ORG

Today we say thank you to the final player from the 2020 team, Senior Alivia Bovee. This would have been Alivia's first season, hence why she had yet to pick her number. I had to do some searching to find pictures of Livi in softball attire.
We were excited to have Alivia coming out for softball this season and were looking forward to what she could do for us. We had only been together for a week for softball, but her focus to better herself from day one was unmatched.
Yes, we were just inside and taking swings on tees and in the cage, but Coach was looking forward to she Livi make contact with the ball on the diamond. She did hit numerous homers over the net and into the weight room off the tee! I will never forget the look on her face after those swings.",0.0,"Comet Softball

Staying in number order, next up is #24 Junior Ali Zietz. Ali has been part of the varsity team on and off in both her freshman and sophomore seasons, including being with the team for the post season. This allowed Ali to gain a lot of experience including being there for two Final Fours and a State Runner-up. This was going to be a big break out season for Ali. She was going to be looked at to play two or three different positions, have her pitching skills put on display, and would also be part of a dangerous batting order. I know she is continuing to work on her skills and when she is able to take the field as a senior, she will be ready to lead the Comets.
Coach cannot wait to see how Ali grows and develops before the next season. Her skills in the circle as well as at the plate will be huge to the success of the Comets in the future!",0.0,"Comet Softball

Continuing in number order, Junior Lexi Aultman was changing her number to 19 this season, even though she was unable to wear it we will celebrate her as the #19!
Lexi was an addition to the roster for the post season run last year. This allowed her to gain valuable knowledge of the game at the varsity level from the veteran girls and coaches. Lexi was busy this year learning multiple positions and focusing on her approach at the plate. Lexi was preparing herself for a standout junior year, and we were all looking forward to her contribution to the team. Lexi will have some big shoes to fill and will be look at as a leader moving forward!
Coach looks forward to seeing how a full year of development will help Lexi grow as a softball player, and he is hoping that none of it is done UNDERHAND! (Dave you know what I mean.)",0.0,"Comet Softball

Things have gotten hectic over the last few weeks and a message I had intended to send out before didn't happen. But, I'd like to give a shout-out to a gentleman in our community who asked to remain anonymous.
He contacted me originally saying he wanted to donate to students who were struggling to pay for lunches and was leaving it up to us who to help; but he'd be back each week. He started with, I think, $40. The next Friday he showed up with another $20 and the following week he stopped by twice to donate money to the same cause; just like that week after week. His face has now become familiar and it's always friendly; we appreciate seeing him and to date he's donated about $140.

2019-20 Coleman Boys Basketball Banquet.

Before I get started with Varsity, I’d like to congratulate coach Dirk Smith and the JV team on a very successful season. They finished 16-4, which was the best JV season we’ve had in many many years! I was fortunate enough to attend many of their practices and assist Dirk during the games. What a great season! Well done guys!

I’d like to thank the following people for all of their support:

Mr Mammel AD

Laurie Bell athletic secretary

Chad Klopf, Nick Katzinger, Ty Klopf, Ken Germain, Tyler Germain & Bo Carbeno for doing our books/stats. Plus anyone else I missed.

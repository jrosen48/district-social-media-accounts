This pertains to high school football, volleyball, and cross-country held on CCPS campuses only (home games only). Visiting teams will NOT be permitted spectators.

Spectators will be subject to health/safety guidelines, including using REQUIRED face coverings and practicing social distancing using pre-identified, marked bleacher seats which will allow for each participant's 2 household guests to sit together, but remain 6 feet apart from other spectators.

ANSWER: Stephanie Vick, Administrator, Florida Department of Health-Collier (FLDOH-Collier), provided the following information (as of July 14, 2020):

Once there is a positivity rate less than 10% and consistently dropping for a period of at least two weeks, then protective measures may be incrementally reduced. Masks would be the last protective measure to be made optional. Proper and frequent handwashing will stay

Our goal, over time and in consultation with the FLDOH-Collier, would be to loosen protective measures, as appropriate, in schools. At the start of the school year, however, we will be following the advisement of local healthcare experts to ensure a safe and healthy environment for students and staff.

ANSWER: Yes, by enrolling at eCollier Academy you will be withdrawing your child from the out-of-zone school. You are therefore forfeiting your parental choice/out-of-zone spot at the school. As a result, that spot may be provided to another student on the waiting list to attend the school. However, if you wish to return to the parental choice/out-of-zone school, you are encouraged to reactivate your application for parental choice/out-of-zone at any time. Priority will be given to eCollier Academy students requesting their return to the previously approved parental choice/out-of-zone school; contingent upon available space (subject to class size requirements and staffing levels).

Collier County Sheriff’s Office detectives today arrested a Gulf Coast High School student after an investigation determined he was responsible for a threat of violence to Pine Ridge Middle School made over social media.

The 15-year-old student is charged with written threats to kill or do bodily injury or conduct a mass shooting or an act of terrorism, which is a second-degree felony under Florida Statute 836.10.

Detectives said the student confessed to making the threat, but denied having any plans or intentions of harming anyone. He told detectives he was mad at his parents and just wanted to scare people.

School safety remains our top concern. If you see something of concern please don’t spread it, report it.

January 7 at 5:59 PM ·

Collier County Sheriff’s Office detectives today arrested a Gulf Coast High School student after an investigation determined he was responsible for a threat of violence to Pine Ridge Middle School made over social media.

The 15-year-old student is charged with written threats to kill or do bodily injury or conduct a mass shooting or an act of terrorism, which is a second-degree felony under Florida Statute 836.10.

Detectives said the student confessed to making the threat, but denied having any plans or intentions of harming anyone. He told detectives he was mad at his parents and just wanted to scare people.

School safety remains our top concern. If you see something of concern please don’t spread it, report it.

Call 911 or the Collier County Sheriff’s Office non-emergency number at 239-252-9300, or to remain anonymous and be eligible for a reward contact Crime Stoppers at 1-800-780-8477.",2020-01-07 13:11:37,,

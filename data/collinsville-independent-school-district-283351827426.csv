Bernard Cigrand was a Wisconsin teacher and dentist. He started the idea for an annual flag day to be celebrated across the country every June 14, in 1885.

Bernard promoted the idea for years. He picked June 14th, the same day the Second Continental Congress issued the specifics for the first ""American"" flag.

It wasn't until 1916 that President Woodrow Wilson officially established June 14 as Flag Day.",2020-06-14 11:30:38,https://video-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/103671171_746554069423950_5448728665470835382_n.mp4?_nc_cat=103&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=Mdp-4A-TkO0AX-lAZxL&_nc_ht=video-atl3-1.xx&oh=6506b6abf0982f60bb2521322c29c613&oe=5F638F6A,

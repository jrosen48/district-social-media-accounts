We hosted over 50 music students. They nibbled on tasty treats, watched movies and got to experience the haunted hallway multiple times! A huge shout out to Bridgette, Allison, Jenna, Karisma, Jordan and Jack who spent hours decorating and even more hours entertaining. You guys are amazing! And thanks to Jenna and Allison for baking the yummy treats. Congratulations to our costume winners - Tobey and Anya. Tons of awesome outfits!!!

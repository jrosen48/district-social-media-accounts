April was the saddest month ever
And don't try to convince me that
I should be happy in quarantine
Because when you take a closer look
The world is pretty sad and lonely right now
Even if
Some happiness does shine through once in a while
That happiness does not last long
And it's not true that
We have a choice over our emotions
Because
True happiness during quarantine can only be found
If you work at it
It's not true that happiness exists for everyone right now
I'm sure that you can agree that
The reality of quarantine
Creates
Sadness
It's something I can't change
And you'll never ever hear me say that
Quarantine has been fun

A program specifically created for parents/guardians and community members will be held Wednesday, October 23 and repeated on Thursday, October 24. Both presentations will be held at 7 p.m. at Colonial Elementary School. Learn more about Rachel Scott, a victim of the Columbine High School shooting in 1999, and how her writings encourage people to create a chain reaction of kindness and compassion.

The evening programs are not meant for students under grade seven. Representatives from Rachel's Challenge will make developmentally and age-appropriate presentations for all grade levels in Colonial schools during the week of October 21.

It seems as though the social distancing guidelines are working to slow the progression of COVID-19. Let’s all continue to do our part in helping to end this pandemic. No matter how much we hope the government can come up with a quick fix, the coronavirus can only be stopped by each and every one of us exercising our individual responsibility to make ourselves and everyone around us safer.

I would like to take this opportunity to remind everyone about the importance of the Census. Please take advantage of any free time you may have to go online or complete the form that has been mailed to you. We want to make sure everyone is counted because it plays a major factor in the amount of state and federal funding that the county is eligible for, thus keeping our local property taxes to a minimum.

Thank you for your time and, as always, feel free to contact me, your district commissioner, or any county staff if you have any questions or concerns.

Yours Truly,

Denver F. Braswell

It seems as though the social distancing guidelines are working to slow the progression of COVID-19. Let’s all continue to do our part in helping to end this pandemic. No matter how much we hope the government can come up with a quick fix, the coronavirus can only be stopped by each and every one of us exercising our individual responsibility to make ourselves and everyone around us safer.

I would like to take this opportunity to remind everyone about the importance of the Census. Please take advantage of any free time you may have to go online or complete the form that has been mailed to you. We want to make sure everyone is counted because it plays a major factor in the amount of state and federal funding that the county is eligible for, thus keeping our local property taxes to a minimum.

Thank you for your time and, as always, feel free to contact me, your district commissioner, or any county staff if you have any questions or concerns.

Yours Truly,

Denver F. Braswell

Complete Count Committees (CCCs) are established to motivate and increase census response. CCCs also play an integral role in ensuring a thorough and accurate count of the community in the 2020 Census.

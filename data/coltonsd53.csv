Caleb is a role model for all students and staff. He has outstanding behaviors and does his best to help out all students. During lunch (Caleb did not see me), a student did not have a lunch for the day and said that they were fine. Caleb took food out of his lunch and gave it to the student. Caleb is a very considerate young man. The way that he interacts with staff is only of respect. He also is a team player. Caleb played football in the fall and basketball this winter. His effort level during games and practice are at a very high level. His coaches speak very highly of him.

This is Caleb’s first year as part of Student Council and he has truly embraced the role of STUCO President and has developed into a leader of his peers. Much is expected of the STUCO President and Caleb has risen each time to meet challenges throughout the year. I admire Caleb’s desire for self-improvement which can be observed in a variety settings at school. Individual growth is often attained when accomplishing a task outside of one’s comfort zone. This is true for Caleb as he has learned how to speak before large groups (the entire school) and how to plan and organize large events (school dances, fundraisers, etc.). I have enjoyed watching Caleb grow over the past six months from a person who leads by example to a confident young man who leads with a distinguished voice and a quiet confidence that elevates the performance of those around him.

Caleb is an amazing, humble STUCO President. He listens and takes ideas from student council members and students in the school. He has come to me many different times to present ideas and asks for advice. It has been a pleasure working with him to better CMS. He has the ability to speak in front of students and staff. His ability to organize and manage student events has been incredible.

In the classroom, Caleb is an excellent student. He has high standards for himself and puts forth the required effort to meet those standards. He frequently asks questions for clarity and demonstrates a desire to learn. Perhaps, equally impressive is Caleb’s ability to help other students learn. He is patient and has a knack for teaching his peers.

Academics are very important to Caleb. He is very involved in his learning. He advocates for himself about learning. We have had discussions about his plans after high school. He is goal oriented and driven to be a successful human in life. He currently is a student assistant for Mrs. Bouck. He assists a 6th grade PE class and does a wonderful job.

Humility. Despite the numerous awards and much deserved special recognition he has received over the years, Caleb remains humble and respectful to all of his peers and school staff. Keeping one’s ego in check is not only difficult for a young person developing an identity, it is challenging for adults as well. It is inspiring to witness how Caleb has remained grounded and true to his himself and to his values and beliefs.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1711671025538267&id=1290556644316376,,0.0,"CONGRATULATIONS TO THE FEBRUARY SUPERINTENDENT STUDENT AWARD WINNER: Caleb Behrens

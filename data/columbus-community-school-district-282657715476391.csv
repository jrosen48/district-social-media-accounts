Prior to the school year we pushed out a lot of information about the Secondary Building Personal Technology Devices (PTDs) expectations. Their usage is down and we are seeing a gain in less student anxiety to check their phones and more class time devoted towards learning. However, we still see many students bringing them to class. Remember that if PTDs are brought to class, they should be turned into the teacher prior to the start of class and will be returned when class is over.

The four times during the school day students can access PTDs are: Before and After School, Passing Periods and Lunch. The four places that you can secure your PTDs are: Teacher's room, Locker, Office and Home.

In mid-December, the state of Iowa published their new Iowa School Performance Review now that we operate under new federal regulations known as ESSA or the Every Student Succeeds Act. The score takes student academic achievement, proficiency, growth and view of the school into consideration.

Roundy Elementary, Columbus Junior High and High School all scored very well! Because of our score, we do not qualify for any of the designated lists requiring additional support or review from the state. Attached is a letter that includes more information about how scores and figured and what they mean.

This is a reason to celebrate! The students, teachers, staff, parents, and community have all worked very hard the past few years and our efforts are beginning to pay off! The staff is also dedicated to continuing moving the district forward in a positive direction.

Have a great weekend everybody!

Red Out 2017 - This year's Red Out shirt is sure to please, as it’s made of the super soft material that doesn't fade! The design may look familiar to you, and we love the nostalgic feel it brings to our Cardinal Pride.

On the front we have a ""pocket,"" or as the students call it, a frocket. (We'll coin a new term since it isn't really a pocket—it's a fafrocket!). On the fafrocket, it says Cardinals Since 1927. This was the first year that Columbus High School was publicly called the Cardinals.

On the back, you get a sense of all of the ingredients it takes to make a Columbus Cardinal.

Prices are as follows:
All shirt sizes Youth Small to Adult XL are $15
2X-3X are $18
4X-5X are $20.

Please bring correct change (or checks made payable to CHS) to your campus secretary, as they have graciously agreed to collect money.

ORDERS AND MONEY ARE DUE BY WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 20TH.

All proceeds benefit the CHS Junior Class of 2019 to be used for Prom and Graduation.

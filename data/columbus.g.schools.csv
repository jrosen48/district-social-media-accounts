Due to the school closure we could not have our usual Art show, so this year we decided the best way to share the art our students created was through a digital art show. Unfortunately, with the students not being physically present to choose what is represented in the art show, we had to take some liberties in choosing what is showcased. We hope you enjoy what our students created. We are proud of the hard work and dedication that our Bulldogs showed throughout this school year.

Columbus Grove Guidance Department and school nurse are partnering to create a Caring Closet for students in grades K-12. A Caring Closet will contain personal hygiene products and Columbus Grove school attire for children within the Columbus Grove Local School District.

Columbus Grove Local School’s Caring Closet's mission is to serve our most vulnerable students and who are in need of a little extra help with obtaining daily necessities; those students who are striving to do well academically, but need an extra boost to ensure their focus can be on their education and not on meeting their basic needs. Our belief is that as a staff and community, if we can assist those who are struggling to keep their focus on education, we will not only be improving the individual lives we touch, we will aso be improving our overall community as these students become contributing members of society.

Items can be dropped off in the Guidance Office during the month of December. More about the collection can be found here.

Starting Monday, November 18th, Columbus Grove Schools will begin using a new service called Final Forms. The service allows parents to complete and sign enrollment, back-to-school, and athletic participation forms for their students electronically. It saves all of the information season-to-season and year-to-year so that parents don’t have to re-enter the same information over and over. This helps save staff time so that information doesn’t have to be entered in manually, and makes the information easily accessible for staff and coaches.

Emails will be going out to all parents Monday that will help you to create your account and begin entering information. If you don't see an email by Tuesday, please check your spam folder, and if you can't find it, please contact Mr. Keehn and he can make sure we have the correct address on file. You can find more information and the instructions for getting started here.

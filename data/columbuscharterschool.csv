Here is her fantastic nomination letter:

Catherine has been a student at CCS since Kindergarten. Through the years, she has excelled not only academically but behaviorally.

Coming into her middle school years, and especially in her eighth grade year, Cat has become a leader in the classroom and among her peers. When she sees someone struggling in class, she takes the initiative and goes to them to help.

She is not a follower at all. She forges her own path, even if it could cost her by not submitting to the will of the crowd. As a matter of fact, we have witnessed students following her lead, even when you think they wouldn't because they see she is doing what is right and saying it also.

Her moral compass is strong and her conviction to speak-up for those wronged is beyond her years. She is well-liked and respected by her peers and teachers alike. And for this, we are honored to nominate her for this most prestigious award.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10158724176322259&id=169755207258,,0.0,"Congratulations to our RBA Award winner - eighth grade student Catherine Russ!

Ms. Ochoa emphasized the importance The Roger Bacon Academy curriculum places on these topics and how vital they are to the growth of our students as citizens.

Justice Newby informed us the North Carolina Supreme Court will be holding session in Wilmington in early May, so we are planning field trips for our students to witness the judiciary in action.

Ms. Ochoa, commented, “It was an honor to discuss our school and the Constitution’s continued relevance as originally ratified with Justice Newby. It is important our students know our country’s history and their rights as American citizens. We look forward to attending the North Carolina Supreme Court while it holds session in Wilmington and see our judicial system at work! “",2020-03-05 09:59:30,,

Saturday looks to be a BEAUTIFUL day for a race!

So, come on out to WECT TV's ""Get Fit With 6"" expo, Saturday, January 25th from 10am until 3pm at the Coastline Convention Center right by the Cape Fear River in downtown Wilmington!

Admission is free, and there will be some great wellness organizations on hand to help you with those New Years Resolutions you may have made.

You can even enter the 5K race or 1 mile wellness walk! Or just cheer on one of our fantastic RBA race team members

(details and registration info at the link provided,)

Make sure to stop by the RBA booth, (# 41, right beside the stage,) and say hi! (there may even be a little bit of swag in it for you!)

And if you know a family with a K-8 student, bring them as well so they can learn about the choices they have in their child's education, and how a top-performing, tuition free Roger Bacon Academy charter school can exercise their child's mind!

Hope we see you there!

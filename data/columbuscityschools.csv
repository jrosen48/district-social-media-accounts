Playon Patrick, five time winner of the City of Columbus’ annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr Youth Oratorical Contest and 2020 graduate of Fort Hayes High School, has been selected to perform a spoken word during the event.

As part of the Department of Neighborhoods, MBK Village is focused on supporting the success and engagement of boys and young men of color in our community.

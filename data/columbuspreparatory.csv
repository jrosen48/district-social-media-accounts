Our school board just completed their virtual special meeting to discuss a change to the start date for the 2020-2021 school year. At the recommendation of the administrative team at CPA, the Board unanimously voted to approve the move of the start of school to Monday August 24, 2020.

This move allows the team additional time to complete working on technology needs identified through the completed surveys. Expect an email communication regarding this in the near future; if you indicated a need for a device.

We are so excited to hold our ""Virtual Meet The Teacher"" event tomorrow night. Please check your emails for a link to join your child's class. All invites will be sent by noon tomorrow.

Hello Colusa Unified,

Please be advised that tomorrow, Thursday, November 16th, our local law enforcement will be running active shooter drills at the Parelli Plant near Colusa High School’s football field. Our district was just today made aware of this drill.

We understand the timing of this drill is not the best given yesterday’s incident in Corning. However, we also believe it is important that our local authorities hone their skills for the safety and greater good of our community and kids.

The drill will begin at 8:00 AM and run until approximately 5:30 PM. During the exercise, the officers will be discharging “simunitions”. These are cartridges which sound like real ammunition, but fire a paint/dye filled plastic bubble which has a range of less than 150 feet. The simulated “gun shots” will begin sometime around 11:00 AM.

Please talk with your students as you feel necessary / appropriate to make them aware that this is ONLY a drill.

I appreciate your attention to this matter.

Hello,

This is Dwayne Newman, Colusa Unified Superintendent. Due to the situation with the Oroville Dam and because we are unsure of the effects any breach may have, we are going to cancel school for tomorrow, Monday, February 13, 2017.

There is no information that Colusa itself is in danger at this time. We are doing this out of an abundance of caution and because many of our staff commute from areas which may be effected. Please continue to watch the district website and Facebook pages for further updates.

Our thoughts and prayers go out to those impacted by this event. Everyone please be safe.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1098376713642235&id=140237016122881,,0.0,"School Closure Monday

Parents, Guardians, and Members of the Colusa USD Community;

There have been multiple reports in the news of people in clown costumes frightening children (and adults) across the country. In some instances these “clowns” have created social media pages and used those venues to issue threats.

There are rumors here in Colusa about such activities, but at this point I have checked with Colusa PD and we have no information that any threat has been made toward our schools. The Colusa PD is aware of the situation, and will alert us immediately should such a threat occur.

Please reassure your children that our schools and school events, are safe. Help them understand that we will always be vigilant in protecting them from any threat. The community will be informed immediately via multiple methods of communication should any threat occur.

If you notice something suspicious, please contact your child's school or dial 458-7777 for Colusa PD or 911 as appropriate.

Thank you for helping us keep CUSD a safe place for kids.

Apparently, when the storm sewers were originally installed, the outflow pipes were significantly smaller than needed. Because of those small pipes, the system simply cannot drain fast enough to keep up with the runoff from a storm.

At any rate, on rainy days please try to avoid picking up your child at the Lafayette / 4th Street corner just north of the BPS office. The pond which formed today was nearly a foot deep and the suction created by the drains beneath the water may be significant. Please avoid parking in this area, and instruct your children to stay away from the standing water. Let's keep everyone safe!

Hope you are all staying warm and dry this evening.

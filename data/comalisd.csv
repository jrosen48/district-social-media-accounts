- Did you remember that it‚Äôs National School Lunch Week? If you forgot, eating vegetables like broccoli, cabbage, and spinach may help you remember things. It may even help you have a super memory when you need to remember things during a math or science test. Today‚Äôs featured vegetables in the cafeteria are cherry tomatoes, mixed vegetables and our famous vegetable bar loaded with cucumbers, broccoli, tomatoes, bell peppers, and baby carrots. Also, DON‚ÄôT FORGET to grab a fruit. Fruits are always tasty and easy to eat. We‚Äôve washed it for you, just peel it or bite right in. #NSLW #SavetheDay #NSLW19 #HealthySchoolLunch",2.0,"Our cafeterias have a wide variety of healthy options to choose from.

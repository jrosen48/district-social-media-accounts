Schools had just eight days to plan for distance learning. It is a challenge our schools have never faced before. We’re incredibly proud of the dedication our schools have shown to their communities and the innovation they’ve displayed in meeting this task. While the way we educate is different, the education is the same. We are committed to providing a high-quality education to every student, no matter the format. We ask that parents continue to be patient as we all learn to embrace this new normal together.",0.0,"Minnesota Department of Education

But the bottom line is, every “bad situation” is an opportunity for growth for the young athlete and a dress rehearsal for real life. This is not the last time they are going to have to deal with a difficult person, a confidence cutter, be in a situation that they don’t think is fair, etc…. and so we encourage parents to listen with positive intent, help prepare them to deal with it and turn it into a life lesson.

The UIL recently announced that schools not enforcing social distancing and masks at all UIL contests may be open to sanctions, including, but not limited to forfeiture of contests.

At Commerce ISD contests, we will have seating on every other row in the gym as well as in the stadium. We will mark rows that aren't available for seating on the ends of the row with blue tape. We are also required to make multiple announcements regarding the UIL rules. Please follow these guidelines. Failure to follow these procedures will result in you being asked to leave the contest.

Our goal is to keep our students and fans safe. We want to ensure that our students do not have to forfeit any contest. Our students deserve to have the full educational experience and following these procedures helps us to provide them that opportunity. We hope to see you at the game!

Fletcher's Original Corny Dogs
June 10 at 4:08 PM ·

It’s a lovely day to get out and spend time with the family. You never know what you might see out there on the road.....right Katie?👩🏻‍🎨

We love the billboard “Corny Dogs"" created by Katie Ritchie which is at 5300 Jacksboro Highway in Fort Worth supporting the exhibit at The Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth.

UPDATE ON THIS MORNINGS POLICE ACTIVITY AT CHS

This morning, we rushed to get information out to parents and others as fast as possible. In doing so, we failed to confirm if a LOCKDOWN had been initiated. We were told and believed that a “HOLD IN PLACE” had been initiated instead. Upon further investigation, it was found that a LOCKDOWN order had indeed been given and was followed by staff and students. Furthermore, it appears that the release of the LOCKDOWN was handled appropriately according to procedures.

Everything else in our original tweet is accurate.

K9 Coco and I were selected as one of the 30 finalists across the United States in a popularity-vote contest to win a brand-new police Chevy Tahoe equipped for K9 transport.

Our current vehicle is in need of constant repairs and the safety of K9 Coco is very important.

She is the only pitbull in the contest!

She is a two-year-old pit mix rescued from the Pflugerville (TX) Animal Shelter. She was given a second chance at life and she is now trained in narcotics detection. She serves as an ambassador to her breed, which is often stigmatized, and to shelter dogs. Shelter dogs are the best dogs!

It’s time for CHS Football again and that means it’s time for the Crunk Crew to kick it into high gear! Each year we make it our goal to keep it as rowdy as possible, and it wouldn’t be possible without the support of our community.

With that being said, we are asking for sponsorships for each individual game! Sponsorships are donation based, so there is no set amount a donation has to meet. There is a list below of games to choose from. Once a game is taken, I will edit the post and take it off of the list! Thanks in advance and Go Tigers!

Mr. Robin Richards has been selected as the Commerce FFA Faculty/Staff Member of the Month!

When we needed to switch locations for our August meeting in a hurry, Mr. Richards stepped up and helped us to change around the gym in order to accommodate our members and our “Welcome Back Wiffle Ball” game. In addition to this, you can find Mr. Richards mentoring and coaching six of our very best FFA members each day in the volleyball court.

This recognition came with a sign to display outside of his classroom as well as a small gift. Please join us in congratulating Mr. Robin Richards!

On Tuesday August 25th, history will be made as we host the first ever home volleyball tri-match in Commerce history.

We will play Cedar Shoals at 5pm and Oglethorpe Co. at 7pm. Tickets are $7 for all three matches (if you have the Tiger Sports pass our five events alone make up almost 70% of the cost of the card itself).

Doors open around 4:15pm and the team run on will be at 4:30 with warm-up starting right after.

We hope you're able to make it for this historic evening. Please remember to socially distance in the Gym and wear masks, especially if seated near the benches. Let's go 🐯🏐!

Also the Fit to a Tee store is open until Friday 8/28 at 5pm. Once it closes no more inaugural season shirts will be made. Fit to a Tee needs at least nine more shirt orders to print the minimum twelve needed so use this link to order anything in time for when the Area matches begin on September 8th.

Nothing can prepare us for the loss of a friend or loved one. The most important thing that we can do during this difficult time is support one another, and remember to cherish our friends and family every day of our lives.

The safety and security of our schools cannot be understated. All threats to our schools and students are taken very seriously and are investigated thoroughly.

On November 19, 2019, a report was received from Commerce Public Schools that a high school student allegedly threatened to bring a gun to school. An investigation immediately started concerning the allegations.

The investigation has consisted of interviewing more than 15 students including the student that allegedly made the statement and also reviewing hours of video surveillance of the school. The student that was accused of making a threat has been cooperating with law enforcement and allowed a search of his residence where no firearms were found.

The investigation has concluded and the allegations that a threat was made has been determined to be unfounded.

To make students and parents more comfortable, extra security will be at the school throughout the week.

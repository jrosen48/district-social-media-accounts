Our top priority as a small business is and always will be our community. The past few days have been hectic and for many parents there will be major adjustments to their daily schedule due to no school. There are many children whose meals ONLY come from what the school provides. We will be giving FREE chicken tenders, fries, Domino’s PIZZA- for all children up to 12th grade. We are trying it for this day, and hoping we can continue for every Sunday and let everyone know. This is the least we can do to try and bring everyone together during this tough time.

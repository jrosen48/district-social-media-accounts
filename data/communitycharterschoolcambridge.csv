Hi everyone! I‚Äôm working on a small project with a friend where the main goal is to use my platform to uplift and credit black women for all that they do. I was inspired to do this by a peer who posted a video of black men detailing why they love black women and what they‚Äôll do to continue to support us. I want black women to use their own voice and let us know what they need to better support themselves! I‚Äôve included some of my contact information in the flyer attached to this post, and if you, or someone that you know, wants to participate please please please let me know!! I‚Äôm hoping this will turn out to be something great!",0.0,"Check out this incredibly cool project CCSC alum Nichelle is organizing to uplift and celebrate Black women!

Show us how your Braves pass the time with safe hobbies at home...maybe it's fishing, gaming, puzzles, working out, taking care of animals, gardening, or building things.

Take a picture of your Brave doing the thing they love to do the most when they aren't learning and post it in the comments below.

You have until 3 PM on Monday, April 27 to submit your entry. We will select a winner for the most interesting hobby, the best photo, AND we will randomly select up to FIVE entries for a golden hoodie!!! (If you are a previous Golden Hoodie winner, you may enter but are not eligible to win again.)

By submitting your photo you grant CISD permission to publish the photo. Judges will select winners to be announced on Tuesday, April 28. Golden Hoodie prizes will be mailed or delivered to your porch shortly after.",2020-04-23 15:18:58,,

Special Message from Mayor Holt:

It is with regret that I feel we must close the City Park effective as of 5pm Thursday, April 9th. We all enjoy seeing kids and families enjoying this facility especially during Easter weekend but to deal with the virus and meet mandated requirements, we all must do what we can to protect ourselves and our Citizens.

We appreciate our Citizens’ support during these strange times. Better days are ahead.
Thank you.

It’s been a few years since we have had an Ag Mech project at a major show. I am so proud of the work these kids put into this cooker. They learned how to draw plans, break down of cost, decide what and how much material was needed, then they used the skills they learned all year to build it. They had to measure, cut, weld, grind and paint. They had to create a book from start to finish. This was a collaborative effort.

All this hard work earned them a BLUE ribbon at the San Antonio Ag Mech Show. There were 180 in that class. They will go on to compete for division. No matter what that outcome is, our kids and Mr. Bedell did a fabulous job!!

I would also like to thank the Community FFA Alumni Association for having faith in our kids and Mr. Bedell to purchase material for this cooker. Hopefully next year they can build a trailer to show their talents on a larger scale.

Lots of job opportunities for these kids in their future!!",0.0,"Way to go Braves!!! 🏆

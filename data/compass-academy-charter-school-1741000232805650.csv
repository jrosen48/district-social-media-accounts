How can I stay up to date with the latest information and current events from my child’s teacher and the school?

1. Make sure teachers have current emails so you can get the weekly news letters etc. Teacher/ parent emails are the first line of communication. Don’t forget to check your email!

2. Check your students binders and or take home folders.

3. Check the school website calendars.

There are two of them: Academic Calendar has holidays, testing and report card dates.

Events Calendar has the school events. Sometimes date changes occur and can’t be helped so check continually for updates.

Athletics has its own tab and all sports schedules are posted there.

Thank you for being patient with us today. Learning a new dismissal system can be challenging. The mobile app, PikMyKid, will not work for Compass students being dismissed at 3:00. There are simply too many people trying to use the app at once, causing the system to crash, and the weather is causing the technology to overheat.

For Tuesday, August 20th,

Please take a piece of paper and on that paper write the following:

Student name (first and last)
Student grade level and Teacher name

Tomorrow after school, the students will be sent home with a tag on cardstock for the parents from now on to use to pick up their child from school.

Please make sure your child’s teacher knows where to send your child to be picked up- car rider, parent walk up or after school care.

PikMyKid will still be used for after school care.

Thank You!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2364297443809256&id=1741000232805650,,0.0,"Parents,

Hi Friends,

I want to make sure my students have the materials they need to succeed, so I've created a classroom project request through DonorsChoose.org, an award-winning charity.

Donations of any size will help my kids. Right now, any contribution you make to my project will be doubled by Aspect Ventures. Your donation will brighten my students' school year, and you'll get heartfelt thank yous from my class and photos of your gift in action.

Here's my classroom request:

Actively Reading

To have your donation matched dollar for dollar, just make a contribution on that project page - donations will be doubled automatically, but only while funding lasts.

If you know anyone who is passionate about education, please pass this along. My students and I greatly appreciate your support.

We appreciate you all and everything you do to make Compass the best school in town!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1762702190635454&id=1741000232805650,,0.0,"FROM COMPASS ACADEMY PTO:

We are going to try something new this year in the way we honor our teachers in saying ""thanks for doing what you do!"". In the past PTO has honored our teachers at the end of every 6 weeks with some sort of gift. As we are getting bigger it's becoming harder and harder to be able to do that for the whole school at one time. PTO will be honoring teachers by grade level per month. The month of September, kindergarten and 1st grade teachers will be getting a special gift from PTO. During this time if you would like you can also show your current or your past kindergarten and 1st grade teachers some love and surprise them with a special little gift to say, we appreciate you for all you do! We appreciate you all and everything you do to make Compass the best school in town!",2016-09-08 16:54:25,,

Schools across the state are participating in a new parent engagement survey. This survey gives you the chance to share your input on several topics to help measure how our schools are doing in meeting your needs.

The survey only takes a few minutes and your responses are anonymous, but they will be critical in helping us identify opportunities to maximize satisfaction, engagement, and communications.

We gave educators almost no notice. We asked them to completely redesign what school looks like and in about 24 hours local administrators and teachers ""Apollo 13'ed"" the problem and fixed it. Kids learning, children being fed, needs being met in the midst of a global crisis.
No state agency did this, no so-called national experts on curriculum. The local educators fixed it in hours. HOURS.
In fact, existing state and federal policies actually created multiple roadblocks. Local schools figured out how to do it around those too. No complaining and no handwringing - just solutions and amazingly clever plans.
Remember that the next time someone tries to convince you that schools are better run by mandates from non-educators. Remember that the next time someone tells you that teachers have it easy or try to persuade you that educators are not among the smartest, most ingenious people in society. And please never say to me again, ""Those who can't do anything else just go into teaching.""

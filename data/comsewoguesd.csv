- The solar panels will generate over 15% of the District's future energy consumption.

- Excess energy exported will offset energy consumption at other schools throughout the District.

- All existing electrical service was upgraded to accommodate the new system.

- The solar panels are arranged at a fixed 10-degree tilt to maximize energy performance on all open roof areas.

- An output display has ben mounted in the lobby of District Office to show real-time energy consumption.

- There is a guaranteed annual energy savings of $84,500

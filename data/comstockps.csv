KPL is hosting a creative writing program on Wednesdays for Teens. First, teen writers need to visit BookRix and create their own account, then search for KPL-Creative Writing Wednesdays and request to join. Once they have an account, participants can upload their submissions. Please note the original event description referenced another platform called Fictionaut which we ultimately weren’t able to use for this program.

Each Wednesday features a different writing prompt.

7/15: In the form of diary/ journal entries, write a story that provides glimpses into a person’s life at different ages.

Each Spring CHS joins schools around the nation to celebrate “Decision Day,” an annual event that aims to highlight the many post-secondary plans that seniors have decided to pursue. We believe this is such an important event for a few reasons: These seniors, perhaps more than ever, deserve to be CELEBRATED! They have made it through one phase of life, and prepare for another by way of post high school plans. Some sort of earned certification is so vital in today’s economy. Whether it’s college degree, a professional certificate, on-the-job training or serving in the military, we encourage all of our seniors to decide on a path beyond a high school diploma that best fits their talents and interests. Our seniors set the tone for underclassmen in helping them see the opportunities that await them.

We ask that residents wait for the vehicle to reach the front of their home, and then come out to get the meals for the children in their home. Children may also come to the street or sidewalk to get their own meals.

The management is asking residents to still practice safe distancing, and not crowd the vehicle, or drive up to us for service. We will run this program beginning at 11:30am, until we hit each street.

The middle school students have been busy the last month reading our Global Read Aloud (GRA) book, The Bridge Home by Padma Venkatraman. GRA is a program where millions of students all over the world read the same book at the same time. The goal is not only to read the book, but also to make global connections using video chat, blogs, Twitter, postcards, and more!

Today, the 7th grade students had the amazing opportunity to spend time Skyping with Dr. Venkatraman. They were able to get answers to their questions about the book and learned a lot about her writing process. We really appreciate the time she spent with us!",0.0,"Comstock STEM Academy

Molly Baker, from TopoNexus, led students to the natural area to do hands-on activities around stormwater issues relating to parking lots and power boats. Brad Kallio did demonstrations of how renewable energy works and took them on a visual tour of renewable energy solutions to problems faced in Michigan. Lastly, students listened to Peter Sinclair, a videographer from Midland, who presents stunning videos featuring interviews he has conducting with top climate change scientists having them speak on the current issues.

Living in Space requires a space station! Concord Academy Boyne 5th graders simulated the tight living quarters in Space by making a blow-up cube/space station out of a plastic tarp, box fan and LOTS of duct tape! Students also explored hydroponics and water purification as part of Raven Hill's Halfway to Anywhere grant awards from Charlevoix County and Petoskey Harbor Springs Area Community Foundations.

I was wondering if you would be interested in helping me; I’m helping to find homes for high school exchange students who are coming to the US in the fall (yes – despite the pandemic). We are running out of time, as schools are soon starting and these kids need to book their flights. I’m not sure if this is something you’d ever consider, but I’m including the applications for 4 students that I am seeking homes for. Maybe one of them will resonate with you. OR, maybe you’ll think of someone else that would be a good fit. At this point, because we’re running short on time, I’m looking for even Welcome Host Families. A Welcome Host Family only makes only a 6-8 week commitment. It allows a student the chance to get here while we continue to find a permanent family. You could be a hero for one of these kids! Thanks in advance for looking at the applications. I hope to hear from you!

If you have any interest or know someone I would greatly appreciate your help

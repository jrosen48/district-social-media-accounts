Concrete students and families, you can check out books from our school library from home! To do this you will need to learn how to login and search the Concrete School’s online library catalog and select books to put on hold from the Library. Some of you already know how to do this, but in case you don’t, I am including directions on how to do this. If you already have library books out remember to return your library books first so that you can check more books out! There will be a book drop box in the school entrance for you to return your books.

I want to play a fun little game with you! I am going to start posting pictures on the Concrete Elementary School Facebook page titled ""Where in the World was Mrs. Wing being Active?"".

In these pictures I will be showing some type of physical activity somewhere somewhat recognizable. Maybe it's a place you've been, or maybe it's by a famous landmark. This could be someplace local, in a different state, or even in a different country!

Look for clues! The FIRST person to correctly guess my location on that Facebook post will get a small reward from me in the mail! When you guess, make sure you are as SPECIFIC as possible. For example, don't say ""the park""; instead give me more information like ""Riverfront Park in Sedro-Woolley."" Have fun and good luck with your guesses!

For my second photo: Where in the World was Mrs. Wing being Active?

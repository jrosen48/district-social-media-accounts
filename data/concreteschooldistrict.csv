From Laura Moffitt, School Library Specialist:

Concrete students and families, you can check out books from our school library from home! To do this you will need to learn how to login and search the Concrete School’s online library catalog and select books to put on hold from the Library. Some of you already know how to do this, but in case you don’t, I am including directions on how to do this. If you already have library books out remember to return your library books first so that you can check more books out! There will be a book drop box in the school entrance for you to return your books.

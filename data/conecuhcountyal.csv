Across the state and country, school leaders are making tough decisions about how to reopen schools as concerns grow regarding the increase in Coronavirus cases.
We are seeking your input in order to determine the best option for our students and employees. At this time, approximately 600 parents/guardians have completed our declaration survey for the upcoming school year. Approximately 40% of families have chosen the traditional option (face-to-face instruction) and about 60% have chosen the remote option (online learning). The results have also indicated that over 40% of our students, do not have access to internet at home. This means that online (remote)education could be extremely difficult.

With that in mind, Conecuh County Board of Education is anticipating offering a holistic approach, which includes a choice of either remote(online) or a traditional approach. With the holistic approach, we are trying to address the needs of all families.

As concerns continue to grow and with the rapid changes, we need to hear from ALL of our parents and guardians. If you have not completed our parental declaration survey, we are asking that you please take the time to complete it now. Thank you for your input.

We are continuously monitoring this situation and are in contact with state and government officials to ensure that we are providing updates as soon as possible.

Students whose parents choose not to send them to school on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday of next week due to health concerns over the coronavirus pandemic, will be automatically marked as ""present at home."" This will minimize the stress on teachers, parents, and data entry personnel to collect excuse letters from parents upon students' return to school.

We will utilize the district's Facebook page and the Remind App to communicate updates to employees, parents, and students. Our thoughts and prayers are with all of our employees, students, parents, and community.

Sincerely,

Dr. Zickeyous Byrd, Superintendent
Conecuh County Board of Education",2020-03-13 18:51:10,,

Dr. Zickeyous Byrd

Although Hillcrest High School (HHS) has shown a steady increase in their Alabama A-F Report card over the last several years, including this year, we have learned today that they have been listed as a failing school based on the Alabama Legislature’s Accountability Act. It can be quite confusing to understand how HHS can be designated as a failing school, even though their scores improved.

According to the Alabama Department of Education’s (ALSDE) website, “Alabama's Accountability System is a unified approach to meeting the requirements of Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) and Alabama Act 2012-402. Federal law mandates the use of various indicators for meaningful differentiation among schools while Alabama Act 2012-402 requires the State Superintendent to develop a school grading system which is also known as “Alabama’s A-F Report Card.”

In addition to the ALSDE’s A-F Report Card score, the Alabama Legislature is also required to identify failing schools which are the schools that ranked in the lowest 6% on the Alabama A-F Report Card. This means that even if ALL Alabama Schools were to make A’s and B’s on the A-F Report Card, the schools with the lowest B’s would be deemed failing schools. This is the reason HHS has improved, does NOT have a failing score of an F, but is still named a failing school. Confusing, right?

The failing schools designation is the result of one snapshot of one test (the ACT) taken by last year’s 11th graders across the state who are now 12th graders. The Scantron Assessment was used for last year’s 3rd-8th graders. It’s horrible to think that the legislature would allow one test, on one day, for one grade level for a high school to determine a so-called “failing” status of a school. We don’t fail students based on one assessment, so it is also unfair for schools and districts to be graded and deemed as failing in this manner. For us, HHS, it’s teachers, and students are far from failing. HHS has improved and will continue to improve!

Consider the data trends at HHS: In 2016-2017, HHS earned a 68/D and was not a failing school. In 2017-2018, HHS earned a 63/D and was not a failing school. However, in 2018-2019, HHS demonstrated 5% in gains with a score of 68/D, which is one of the highest rates of growth in the district, and is now designated a failing school.

No, we’re not happy with a 68, but we do see huge improvements and we are confident that our scores will be even higher for next year. Hillcrest has always met every challenge with great resilience and might and will do it again this year. Our students and staff understand the mission and I guarantee you this will only be a “one year” designation. Like always, we’re going to show everyone the pride of Jagnation and the Power House of the South!!

Encouragement from Mr. Daffin, HHS Principal

We remain optimistic about the progress HHS has made and will continue to make. The failing schools designation is unfair, but the state legislature is required by law to make the designation for the bottom 6% of all public Alabama schools. According to Mr. Daffin, HHS Principal, “This is a new year. We will use the information from last year’s scores to inform us of what we need to do for this year. We will continue to provide resources, support, and opportunities for our students to shine in academics, on assessments, and through the arts and extra-curricular activities. We are implementing test-taking skills and intervention periods, as well as new learning software that will address students’ individual academic needs in reading and mathematics. Hopefully all of our improvement efforts will be reflected in the upcoming spring data.”",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2518950761718303&id=1574680076145381,,0.0,"A message regarding Alabama’s Failing School List.

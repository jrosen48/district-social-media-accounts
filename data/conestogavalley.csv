SUNDAY MORNING LOVE LETTERS...from a middle school student.

Our recent Suicide Prevention Meeting inspired so many letters of encouragement, support and love. The instructions were ""write a letter to a stranger"" who may need encouragement.

In the age of electronic communication, it's amazing how powerful and impactful a hand-written letter can be.

The results were some amazing, hand-written messages that we hope touches your heart and lifts your spirits...as they were intended to do.

Enjoy this week's Sunday morning letter and look for one every Sunday this winter.

To learn more about The Love Letters project and how to write letters, please contact MHA at mha@mhalancaster.org or 717-397-7461.

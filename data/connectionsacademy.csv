My advice to other parents would be don't be afraid to contact a teacher or staff member of Connections Academy. They are there to help you and want what's best for your kids.

After a traumatic brain injury caused him to miss out on a lot of his previous schooling, Eugene turned to the flexibility of cyber education, which allowed him to thrive on his own terms. 💻 📚

Eugene was highly involved during his time at Reach Cyber. He was a member of National Honor Society, Reach Cyber’s Steering Committee, participated in the statewide Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) Innovations Challenge, and composed original works of poetry for Reach Cyber’s Literary Magazine. 👍 👍

Focused on his future, Eugene will follow his passion for writing at his local community college with plans of transferring to the University of Pittsburgh after earning his Associate’s Degree.

This private tour is not open to the public, which made it a truly special experience for California Connections Academy Schools students and families.

Attendees were able to wander through the over 200,000sqft studio campus while observing animators in fun, engaging workspaces that included eye-catching art, memorabilia, and lounging spots. As an extra treat, students received a private demonstration from an animator creating a cartoon episode that will actually be shown on TV some time next year. ✍️ 📺 ️🧑‍🎨

""Talk to the person being bullied and make friends with them. Make sure they know they’re not alone because that can be a hard thing for some people.” —Alabama Connections Academy Student

Students Share About Bullying",12.0,"It's sad, but true. According to DoSomething.org, 1 in 5 of students ages 12–18 report being bullied during the school year.

We connected with some Connections Academy students to see how they dealt with bullying and if they had any advice to help other students. Below is some of what they had to share. #StopBullying #Bullying #BeKind

""Talk to the person being bullied and make friends with them. Make sure they know they’re not alone because that can be a hard thing for some people.” —Alabama Connections Academy Student

""It’s not okay to stand by and watch someone be bullied. Abuse is never okay. I noticed if you call a bully out from abusing others they usually stop. Sometimes the bullying gets worse, but the bullies don’t like to be called out.” —Oregon Connections Academy Student

""Intervene. Stop it. Step up and say something. Be that kid’s voice. Bring attention to what is happening to an adult. Make it known that what the bully is doing is unacceptable. Befriend the victim of bullying.” —Indiana Connections Academy Student

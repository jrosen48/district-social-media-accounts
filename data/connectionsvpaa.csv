It appears that we may have a PSPS event arriving this evening through Wednesday evening. With power due to be out at the school, we will not be able to operate our servers meaning that students will not be able to access the web via their iPads.

Have you seen the Extended Learning Opportunities (ELO) site?

It is built by local educators in order to offer short term and long term lessons and resources for educators and families to continue their education. Hundreds of local general and special education teachers are working together to provide multiple options for our students including online, paper/pencil, broadcast, and other innovative methods to ensure students have access to educational resources and their teachers.

Today's Common Theme is the 2020 Census! Activities in today's lesson will show the importance of having every person in the country counted.

Spread the word that the census is important by creating a clear, colorful poster with the theme “Be Seen, Be Heard, Be Counted”.

You can take a picture of your poster and upload it on the ELO site by Wednesday, April 22.

In order to upload your poster, you will need to be logged in using your school’s student google account.

Selected posters will be displayed on the ELO Website!

Have you seen the Extended Learning Opportunities (ELO) site?

It is built by local educators in order to offer short term and long term lessons and resources for educators and families to continue their education. Hundreds of local general and special education teachers are working together to provide multiple options for our students including online, paper/pencil, broadcast, and other innovative methods to ensure students have access to educational resources and their teachers.

Today's Common Theme is the 2020 Census! Activities in today's lesson will show the importance of having every person in the country counted.

Spread the word that the census is important by creating a clear, colorful poster with the theme “Be Seen, Be Heard, Be Counted”.

You can take a picture of your poster and upload it on the ELO site by Wednesday, April 22.

In order to upload your poster, you will need to be logged in using your school’s student google account.

Selected posters will be displayed on the ELO Website!

Hello￼￼ everyone ! I'm sure most know, I am a senior at Summerville High. And for my senior project I am collecting instruments for the Band Program. Any kind of instruments; not just winds or percussion instruments. Any instruments we can't use will be taken to a music store for credit to fix or buy additional instruments. There is no pressure to give an instrument, even a share is a huge help. Donations will not be advertised or asked for but will be happily accepted. If any proceeds, they will go directly into our band program to help fix instruments we have and the ones we will hopefully gain through this drive.
I will make another post when my mentor and I decide dates and times, and if I have any more info. Thank you all! If any questions don't be afraid to ask. :)",0.0,"For those of you who would like to assist with a senior project...

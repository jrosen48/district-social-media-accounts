If it is a core class required for graduation, they will have to retake all of second semester.

Many of you have reached out about summer school and the possibility of continuing summer school with the remote learning format. Due to the situations of COVID-19 the district has decided to make this an option for you with some restrictions.

1.) All communication will be through Ms. Buswell and she will relay all work to the appropriate teacher.
2.) The class will need to be completed by July 9th, the last day of summer school.
3.) Any test will need to be taken in person.
4.) All work is still required to be done for course completion.

The district still feels the best option is to attend summer school in person but if you have concerns or conflicts this is another option for you.

Summer school runs June 15th - July 9th. Monday - Thursday 8am - 12 pm. This gives you 16 days of in person help to finish up classes.

In response to what is happening we realize that we are going to need to make Conrad High School graduation happen in a different way.

Here is the request:
We need a place to host this where there is enough spaces for cars and graduates, as well as the backdrop is Conrad Team Bus and a flatbed trailer.

If you have an idea of a parking lot or field or somewhere that would be good - please let Ms. Russell know by emailing her at jeri.russell@conradschools.org

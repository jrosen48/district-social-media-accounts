Jaden’s first opponent in this weekend’s tournament was a young man with Down’s Syndrome. Once he saw who he was wrestling he knew what to do.

They exchanged takedowns and wrestled for 3 minutes. The smiles on the face of his opponent says it all! Everyone cheered for this young man so loudly...it was great!

When he came to shake my hand after the match I told him, “You did great on those takedowns you got!”
With an ear to ear grin on his face he beamed with joy and said “THANKS!!”

I know any one of our Celina Wrestlers would have done the same. Jaden was the fortunate one that got to represent his team and prove that a Champion is more than just a person who wins a match!

I love this sport!!!

Officer Jeremy Perkins makes good on a promise to have lunch with TJ. The pair got together today. They met sometime ago and Officer Perkins promised to visit TJ. TJ’s awesome mom was instrumental in making it happen. She sent us this note and the result will be the subject of many future stories for these two best buddies.

“My son TJ met one of your officers in November and invited him to have lunch with him at his school ( Simon Elementary ) Officer Perkins was working night shift at the time but said he was going to start day shift in January. My child is 12 years and non verbal BUT has managed to remind me several times a day that he has a police officer friend that is going to drive to his school and have lunch with him. TJ got a bike for Christmas, fell off of it and broke his wrist. It would mean alot if Officer Perkins stopped by sometime for lunch. He gave us a card with his badge number so we could call and remind him.”

Red Ribbon Week is an alcohol, tobacco, drug, and violence awareness campaign that is observed annually in October.

Red Ribbon Week began after the murder of DEA agent Enrique ""Kiki"" Camarena in 1985. The events that followed Camarena's disappearance were chronicled in U.S. media, exposing the world of drug trafficking including how far drug traffickers would go to maintain power and control.

On Friday, November 16th from 8:45-9:45 we will have our 1st annual Dads and Donuts event at our school. We will meet in the Conway School cafeteria for free donuts and coffee. Throughout the hour, we will have a presentation about our WATCH D.O.G.S. (Dads Of Great Students) Program. This is a program in schools all across America which helps them to be positively impacted by the committed involvement of fathers and father-figures in their students life.

The goal is to have you spend at least one day this year at the school and be a positive male role model and provide an extra set of eyes and ears.

Dads, grandpas, uncles, step-dads, etc....This is your chance to have some special time with your student in a fun atmosphere at school.

We have been working on problem and solution for the last couple of weeks and some students who come to me for services embarked on a problem-solving journey to provide Keb, a hermit crab, with a shell.

If you haven't read the riveting AtoZ book, Keb Needs a Shell, it is about a rotund hermit crab who can't find a shell to fit him. By the end of the book, he finds a blue boot with spacious accommodations and ample protection from swooping predators.

I challenged these students to make their own protective shells for Keb. I gave each of them a wax cup to represent Keb's body and provided them with paper plates, cardboard, tape, glue, pipe cleaners and, of course, googly eyes as materials from which to choose to make their own protective shell. The mission was to protect Keb so the stronger the shell the better!

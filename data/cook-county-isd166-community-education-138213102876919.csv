This normally wouldn't occur until the last week of school, but because of the current situation I am asking that all school-owned instruments be returned to school via the bus drop off (hubs where materials are returned/dropped off) or dropped off at the school directly on Monday, May 4th. I need to check-in all the school-owned instruments, assess any repairs or cleaning that will need to be done, and organize the room. Students may keep all of their music EXCEPT for school owned Essential Elements method books (they will say ""Property of Cook County"" or something similar on the front cover).

Please contact me if you need to arrange this return for a different day, and please send me an email when you have returned the instrument so I know to look for it.

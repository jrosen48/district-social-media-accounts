1) If passed, the bond proceeds will be spent on capital projects in the areas of student safety, Performing Arts Center renovations, HVAC replacements and athletic facility repairs.
2) The passage of the bond will increase the secondary tax rate to $1.74 and result in an overall tax rate increase of $0.33 or $21.28 per year for the average home in Coolidge.

November SOM is Miss Emily O. Emily is the daughter of Marcus and Robyn and she has two siblings. She is a top student in her class and has the respect of all with which she comes into contact. She loves to draw, and her long time goal is to become a teacher. She credits her success in school by simply paying attention and trying her best to stay on top of her assignments.

December SOM from the 8th grade is Mr. Brandon R.! He is the son of Jaime and Heather, and he has 4 other siblings. Among his interests he loves to play soccer, football, and video games. He hopes to one day develop into a professional soccer player. He says that trying to be successful takes hard work to make good grades, and that good behavior goes a long way to paying attention and being on his game.

At this time, our Delta Co Sheriff’s Office and state officials are confident they have apprehended the subject and that the subject poses absolutely no threat to local students or school buildings. They have also shared great compliments for the quick, decisive action and safe practices of all of our staff. In the words of the state officer in responding to this investigation, “this is a school I would want my kids to attend”.

A call-out for parents has been issued and will be in your inboxes shortly, school is cancelled for Friday, January 31st while everyone takes a moment to rest and recuperate. Hopefully, our students and staff will get over their sicknesses at the same time. Looking forward to seeing everyone Monday.

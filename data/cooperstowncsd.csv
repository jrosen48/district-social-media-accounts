You are receiving this communication regarding your student with special education needs at Cooperstown CSD. Last week a representative from the Pupil Personnel Services office likely contacted you regarding specific plans for your child. Since then, the COVID-19 crisis has required us to change our plans and ALL students must remain in a remote learning mode. Yesterday, the Otsego County Department of Health highly recommended schools engage in remote only learning through and including September 23rd. When DOH makes a statement to this effect we take it very seriously as health and safety are our first concern.

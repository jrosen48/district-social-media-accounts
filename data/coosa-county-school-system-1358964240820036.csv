Coosa parents...no stresses. The teachers will be leading lessons live and recorded. And Kindergarten teachers are also sending home COUGAR binders with no-screen required activities. We have been learning the platforms and preparing lessons. This is NOT the quarantine learning packets of the spring! This is real learning. Kids will interact with teachers. We will be having whole group lessons led by all three of us. Then we will have individual small groups with our own homeroom and 1-1 with students and their parents. We will have imbedded brain breaks. Each of us have sent our emails and Remind messages among phone calls and letters. We are a team-teachers, parents, students. (Many of the above statements apply to all grades K-6.)

Stay positive and be prepared for learning, communication and fun too! Is this ideal? No! Will there be glitches? Yes.

We miss our babies and their sticky fingers and dirty faces but it is necessary at this time to do remote learning for the health and safety of our students, staff and families.

Anyone who wonders why we at Coosa are going virtual only need to talk to teachers at other schools who have been brick and mortar. As a member of several teacher groups, I can tell you they are sending kids and staff home for exposure and outbreaks. Just because you haven’t seen the outbreaks on the news/social media doesn’t mean it isn’t happening.

The positive is that even when school becomes “normal” again, students will never have an excuse for not being able to know about assignments because we will be experts in this little thing called remote learning. No more 20-30 absences in a school year. Students will be able to work from home when they have the flu or a cold or the “I don’t feel like going to school today blues.” Dr. appointment? No worries. You can do your work from home for that day.

I’ll admit I was worried. As I’m becoming more comfortable with technology I have one concern...I may break out in song forgetting that adults can hear me too. 🙂. I also am an artist that is only appreciated by 5 year olds. 🙂.",6.0,"Love the POSITIVITY we all have been witnessing by faculty. Here's a perspective of one...

We have been learning the platforms and preparing lessons. This is NOT the quarantine learning packets of the spring! This is real learning. Kids will interact with teachers. We will be having whole group lessons led by all three of us. Then we will have individual small groups with our own homeroom and 1-1 with students and their parents. We will have imbedded brain breaks. Each of us have sent our emails and Remind messages among phone calls and letters. We are a team-teachers, parents, students. (Many of the above statements apply to all grades K-6.)

Stay positive and be prepared for learning, communication and fun too! Is this ideal? No! Will there be glitches? Yes.

We miss our babies and their sticky fingers and dirty faces but it is necessary at this time to do remote learning for the health and safety of our students, staff and families.

Anyone who wonders why we at Coosa are going virtual only need to talk to teachers at other schools who have been brick and mortar. As a member of several teacher groups, I can tell you they are sending kids and staff home for exposure and outbreaks. Just because you haven’t seen the outbreaks on the news/social media doesn’t mean it isn’t happening.

The positive is that even when school becomes “normal” again, students will never have an excuse for not being able to know about assignments because we will be experts in this little thing called remote learning.

Teacher friends...... This is a great idea. Mount your tissue box under a shelf so that your students don’t have to handle the box to get a tissue.

I saw this on Pinterest and thought some could use this during these crazy times. 💗

To make this work, you’ll need an under-the-shelf storage basket and a pair of needle-nose pliers or wire cutters to cut a gap for the tissues.

There were many comments about having trouble hearing the FB Live, here is a quick recap:

This is the current plan- subject to change with guidance from the State Dept. and CDC.
Communication is KEY between parents and the school. Please work with us to make sure we can work together and make this year a great success.

Elementary Options:
Virtual Option- Your child will be enrolled in the Coosa County School System, but will not physically attend school at all. Your child will receive a chromebook. They will participate in a program aligned with the same academic standards that are taught in the schools. You must have strong and reliable internet service OR have a plan in place for your child to be able to complete their assignments daily (drive to a place with wifi, go to a friend/family member’s house with wifi). There will be a local teacher assigned to monitor your child’s progress, but parents must ensure students are completing their assignments to the best of their ability, meeting deadlines, etc. so that they are on track to master all required skills for their grade level. ** NOTE- You must commit to your choice for at least one nine weeks. If after the first quarter, you decide that Virtual was not the best choice for your family, they can switch to in-person, but they cannot do this in the middle of the nine weeks.
In-Person- Your child will attend school daily, as they did before the pandemic, with additional safety and sanitizing procedures in place. Classes will be manageable sizes (18-20) and students will be distanced/separated as much as possible.

High School Options:
Virtual Option- Same as above.
Hybrid- Some days during the week, your child will be at school, some days they will be working from home. This doesn’t require you to have internet at home. Before students leave school, they will download the assignments/materials they need onto their chromebook for the day they will be working at home so they have everything they need. Students will be required to “call in” to virtually attend class via a Google Meet- It can be a call in (from a phone) or video conference via chromebook if you have internet conference. Students will have to call in/log in to each class- this will count as their attendance and participation. The following day, the student will attend school and will have the opportunity to get information clarified, work with the teacher in person, etc. Your child may be attending Monday/Wednesday or Tuesday/Thursday with Friday being a mix of students. (This will be discussed further at orientation). Many students will be participating in dual enrollment and this option makes this more feasible as well!

The Alert Level will be closely monitored.
We must remember the close contact rule: If you must be in contact with others in less than a 6 ft radius, spend no more than 15 minutes in the closer proximity. We are going to be very intentional about keeping times that we must be in closer proximity to a minimal amount of time.

Face Shields/Masks:
All School Employees will be wearing a face shield or a face mask while on duty.
All of our students will be provided with face shields, which are a great alternative to face masks. (We have many asthmatic students). Face Shields will stay at school and will be cleaned each day.
There will be times that students will be asked to wear a face mask (for example, on the bus). We ask that parents supply masks for their students. Cloth masks are great because they can be washed and reused. It’s recommended you get several so one is available while the other is getting laundered. If your child doesn’t have a mask for some reason, we will provide one for them.
Some children with medical reasons may be assigned a different face shield to wear on the bus. We will be working with the parents and nurses to determine those students.

Water bottles:
We are asking that all parents provide plastic water bottles for their children, clearly labeled with their names.
These will be taken home daily, need to be washed and brought back to school.
Water fountains will not be available to drink out of, only to be used with supervision to refill water bottles. Elementary classrooms have water fountains in their classrooms for this purpose.

Restrooms:
There will be assigned times for restroom breaks as a class to help maintain social distancing procedures. Procedures will be in place for this.

Lockers:
High school students will not use hallway lockers this year, so they will be allowed to bring their backpacks to class with all their materials. There will be an assigned place in each classroom where backpacks will be stored during class time.
This doesn’t affect elementary students who will continue to use their lockers/cubbies in the classroom.

Chromebooks:
Each student will receive a chromebook, a charger, and a carrying case/bag. These should be kept together at all times.
These will travel back and forth from home to school daily. In the event that we had to shut down again, students will have what they need at home for instructional purposes.
Parents will be given these at parent orientation.
Chromebooks need to be charged nightly and brought back to school because they will be utilized in the classroom during the school day as well.
Teachers will teach lower elementary students how to use it.
Any damage to chromebooks will follow the same policy as before.

Library Books:
Physical books will not be checked out.
Students will have access to e-books using their chromebooks.

Parents, please work closely with us to help eliminate misbehaviors, discipline and dress code issues. We truly don’t have time for this with the current pandemic situation.
Bus misbehaviors truly cannot be tolerated as this is more than just the normal bus safety at stake- it’s the health of your child and other children as well. We need your support in talking with your children about appropriate behavior.

PE:
We will still have PE classes, Kindergarten - 9th grade (required by the state department). Outside time will be utilized as much as possible.
Talk with your child about social distancing. They will be able to play and will have times in which they are in close proximity with each other, but they can still be as safe as possible.

Buses:
If you feel more comfortable bringing your child to school versus riding the bus, please feel free to do so! That is always an option.
Loading and unloading buses will be a little different than in the past to limit the large gathering of students.

Temperature Checks:
Students will have their temperature checked when they get on the bus in the morning. We will be teaching students how to take their temperatures on their own.
Parents, please have a plan in place in case your child has a temperature of 100 degrees or more.
Please do not send your child to school if they have a temperature!

Visitors:
Limit visitations to the school unless it’s an absolute necessity.
Each school will have additional procedures in place for visitors for additional activities/events.

NEXT TUESDAY, July 21st @ 7 pm Keith Bullard Stadium:
Orientation for Parents only (no students).
Parents must wear masks. We will be social distancing in the stadium.
Will be going over several things such as guidelines. Most importantly, will be discussing modes of instruction so that you can make the best choice for your student.
Will be given an enrollment packet.

DROP OFF SUPPLY MEETING, July 28th behind the school in the big loop for 1st grade-12th grade. *See recent post for times and more info!*
Students will be divided up by last name
There will be several stations for you to stop in your car to pick something up or drop something off.
Most important thing to drop off will be your enrollment packet. We need every document that you receive at parent orientation completed by the 28th and dropped off.
You’ll be picking up your child’s chromebook and dropping off school supplies at that time (we are trying to limit the people coming into the school).

“Meet your teacher” will be held virtually via google meet.
Each teacher will be sending parents an invitation.

Kindergarten Orientation will be July 30th at 7 pm @ Keith Bullard Stadium.
Separate because these are brand new students.
Will have a separate drive thru and drop off scheduled later.

We will still be starting the school day at the same time. Additional info about this will be given at orientation.

We have several procedures in place to keep the schools clean and sanitized at the classroom and school level, daily and long term.

It sounds silly, but we will be keeping the school day as “normal” as possible… as normal as our days are now.

If you feel more comfortable bringing your child to school versus riding the bus, please feel free to do so! That is always an option.
Loading and unloading buses will be a little different than in the past to limit the large gathering of students.

Temperature Checks:
Students will have their temperature checked when they get on the bus in the morning. We will be teaching students how to take their temperatures on their own.
Parents, please have a plan in place in case your child has a temperature of 100 degrees or more.
Please do not send your child to school if they have a temperature!

Visitors:
Limit visitations to the school unless it’s an absolute necessity.
Each school will have additional procedures in place for visitors for additional activities/events.

NEXT TUESDAY, July 21st @ 7 pm Keith Bullard Stadium:
Orientation for Parents only (no students).
Parents must wear masks. We will be social distancing in the stadium.
Will be going over several things such as guidelines. Most importantly, will be discussing modes of instruction so that you can make the best choice for your student.
Will be given an enrollment packet.

DROP OFF SUPPLY MEETING, July 28th behind the school in the big loop for 1st grade-12th grade. *See recent post for times and more info!*
Students will be divided up by last name
There will be several stations for you to stop in your car to pick something up or drop something off.
Most important thing to drop off will be your enrollment packet. We need every document that you receive at parent orientation completed by the 28th and dropped off.
You’ll be picking up your child’s chromebook and dropping off school supplies at that time (we are trying to limit the people coming into the school).

“Meet your teacher” will be held virtually via google meet.
Each teacher will be sending parents an invitation.

Kindergarten Orientation will be July 30th at 7 pm @ Keith Bullard Stadium.
Separate because these are brand new students.
Will have a separate drive thru and drop off scheduled later.

We will still be starting the school day at the same time. Additional info about this will be given at orientation.

We have several procedures in place to keep the schools clean and sanitized at the classroom and school level, daily and long term.

It sounds silly, but we will be keeping the school day as “normal” as possible… as normal as our days are now.

79,0.0,,0.0,,,"There were many comments about having trouble hearing the FB Live, here is a quick recap:

This is the current plan- subject to change with guidance from the State Dept. and CDC.
Communication is KEY between parents and the school. Please work with us to make sure we can work together and make this year a great success.

Elementary Options:
Virtual Option- Your child will be enrolled in the Coosa County School System, but will not physically attend school at all. Your child will receive a chromebook. They will participate in a program aligned with the same academic standards that are taught in the schools. You must have strong and reliable internet service OR have a plan in place for your child to be able to complete their assignments daily (drive to a place with wifi, go to a friend/family member’s house with wifi). There will be a local teacher assigned to monitor your child’s progress, but parents must ensure students are completing their assignments to the best of their ability, meeting deadlines, etc. so that they are on track to master all required skills for their grade level. ** NOTE- You must commit to your choice for at least one nine weeks. If after the first quarter, you decide that Virtual was not the best choice for your family, they can switch to in-person, but they cannot do this in the middle of the nine weeks.
In-Person- Your child will attend school daily, as they did before the pandemic, with additional safety and sanitizing procedures in place. Classes will be manageable sizes (18-20) and students will be distanced/separated as much as possible.

High School Options:
Virtual Option- Same as above.
Hybrid- Some days during the week, your child will be at school, some days they will be working from home. This doesn’t require you to have internet at home. Before students leave school, they will download the assignments/materials they need onto their chromebook for the day they will be working at home so they have everything they need. Students will be required to “call in” to virtually attend class via a Google Meet- It can be a call in (from a phone) or video conference via chromebook if you have internet conference. Students will have to call in/log in to each class- this will count as their attendance and participation. The following day, the student will attend school and will have the opportunity to get information clarified, work with the teacher in person, etc. Your child may be attending Monday/Wednesday or Tuesday/Thursday with Friday being a mix of students. (This will be discussed further at orientation). Many students will be participating in dual enrollment and this option makes this more feasible as well!

The Alert Level will be closely monitored.
We must remember the close contact rule: If you must be in contact with others in less than a 6 ft radius, spend no more than 15 minutes in the closer proximity. We are going to be very intentional about keeping times that we must be in closer proximity to a minimal amount of time.

Face Shields/Masks:
All School Employees will be wearing a face shield or a face mask while on duty.
All of our students will be provided with face shields, which are a great alternative to face masks. (We have many asthmatic students). Face Shields will stay at school and will be cleaned each day.
There will be times that students will be asked to wear a face mask (for example, on the bus). We ask that parents supply masks for their students. Cloth masks are great because they can be washed and reused. It’s recommended you get several so one is available while the other is getting laundered. If your child doesn’t have a mask for some reason, we will provide one for them.
Some children with medical reasons may be assigned a different face shield to wear on the bus. We will be working with the parents and nurses to determine those students.

Water bottles:
We are asking that all parents provide plastic water bottles for their children, clearly labeled with their names.
These will be taken home daily, need to be washed and brought back to school.
Water fountains will not be available to drink out of, only to be used with supervision to refill water bottles. Elementary classrooms have water fountains in their classrooms for this purpose.

Restrooms:
There will be assigned times for restroom breaks as a class to help maintain social distancing procedures. Procedures will be in place for this.

Lockers:
High school students will not use hallway lockers this year, so they will be allowed to bring their backpacks to class with all their materials. There will be an assigned place in each classroom where backpacks will be stored during class time.
This doesn’t affect elementary students who will continue to use their lockers/cubbies in the classroom.

Chromebooks:
Each student will receive a chromebook, a charger, and a carrying case/bag. These should be kept together at all times.
These will travel back and forth from home to school daily. In the event that we had to shut down again, students will have what they need at home for instructional purposes.
Parents will be given these at parent orientation.
Chromebooks need to be charged nightly and brought back to school because they will be utilized in the classroom during the school day as well.
Teachers will teach lower elementary students how to use it.
Any damage to chromebooks will follow the same policy as before.

Library Books:
Physical books will not be checked out.
Students will have access to e-books using their chromebooks.

Parents, please work closely with us to help eliminate misbehaviors, discipline and dress code issues. We truly don’t have time for this with the current pandemic situation.
Bus misbehaviors truly cannot be tolerated as this is more than just the normal bus safety at stake- it’s the health of your child and other children as well. We need your support in talking with your children about appropriate behavior.

PE:
We will still have PE classes, Kindergarten - 9th grade (required by the state department). Outside time will be utilized as much as possible.
Talk with your child about social distancing. They will be able to play and will have times in which they are in close proximity with each other, but they can still be as safe as possible.

Re: Best Practices regarding Re-Opening Schools

To Whom it May Concern,

We, the undersigned, are physician parents who work and live in the greater Birmingham area. We appreciate the countless hours you have spent responding to the COVID19 pandemic. As physicians serving on the frontlines with a vested interest in our patients and children, we wish to endorse the below evidence-based guidelines to re-open Alabama schools. As a group we agree with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) that the goal of re-opening schools should focus on children returning to school physically and safely. While there are data showing children are less likely to spread COVID19 and less likely to have severe disease compared to adults, this is still a very serious illness. Among the 983 COVID deaths in Alabama to date, two have been children. We believe that schools can and should re-open in a meaningful and sustainable way. However, this is a novel virus and will require a novel response to control the spread in schools. These are our medical recommendations to aid in our common goal of safe schools for this upcoming school year:

· Face coverings must be mandated when indoors. These include medical masks, reusable fabric masks, gaiters or clear face shields. With very few medical exceptions, children over 2 can be taught to wear these for extended periods of time. Universal masking is crucial to controlling spread of COVID19 because the wearers’ mask protects others. If only a few wear them, they are not effective. A mandate is the best way to ensure universal face coverings. Parents will need time and resources to teach their children how to wear face coverings. Just like riding a bike or any other skill, children must be taught and encouraged to maintain their skills. We can partner with schools to develop tools for education, but the mandate needs to be step one. From a medical standpoint, face coverings are the best chance schools have to re-open and stay open.1
· Access to soap, water and paper towels with frequent hand-washing breaks coupled with sanitizer stations throughout the school will help decrease spread. Sanitizing spray and paper towels to wipe down frequently touched surfaces is an alternative to sanitizing wipes that are in short supply.1
· Educate parents on the critical importance of keeping children home when ill. While activities like daily on-site temperature screening make us feel safer, these screenings have not been shown to reduce risk of spread in a meaningful way. We have also found that some families will answer “no” when being screened for illness or exposure only to reveal a significant history of illness or exposure later in the visit. This observation does not mean these processes should not be used, but they are limited in efficacy and must be used in combination with other safe guards.
· Temperature screening must balance the practicality and resources of performing these screening procedures for large numbers of students and staff with the information known about how children manifest COVID-19 infection, the risk of transmission in schools, and the possible lost instructional time to conduct the screenings.”1
· Use all available outdoor spaces in creative ways to give kids more time outside. Gathering outdoors is inherently safer during a pandemic. Outdoor time will also give kids breaks from face coverings. Thinking creatively about outdoor spaces for lunch and snacks would enable more typical socialization while eating. Opening windows in classrooms and other spaces would also improve ventilation and reduce risk.1
· Offer varying hybrids of in person attendance and eLearning. Parents should be given flexibility to change at certain intervals (nine weeks or semester) to account for changing needs and special conditions such as family work constraints or illness. While we want all children to have an option to be in school, reduction in volume of students in the school on a daily basis will inherently make controlling and containing viral spread easier. 1,2
· Develop a COVID prevention plan for all school activities and modify or eliminate high-risk activities. Some of the high risk activities include assemblies, indoor singing, indoor use of wind instruments, spectators at sporting events, crowded locker rooms, parental visits. Some activities that are high risk are also necessary like eating lunch or snacks and pick-up/drop-off. Those activities will need staggered schedules, scrutiny, and creative planning to reduce risks.
· Develop and communicate a clear plan for classroom or school wide outbreaks. COVID outbreaks will be a part of the 2020-2021 school year. Local pediatricians are already seeing similar outbreaks in daycares, summer sports leagues, and camps. Because COVID19 symptoms can be very mild and often do not involve a fever in children, diagnosis and containment of outbreaks is especially complex. Adding to the difficulty of this task is the fact that our best test available has a 20-30% false negative rate.3
· Face Coverings will reduce the need for quarantine. We know that people infected with COVID19 can spread the virus for up to 14 days, with or without symptoms. The current recommendation by the Jefferson County Department of Public Health is that students return to school 14 days after a positive test was collected or 14 days from symptom start as long as symptom free for 3 days without any medications such as Tylenol or Motrin. If a student or staff has a close contact with someone who is infected (more than 15 min, less than 6 feet, indoors without a face covering), they will meet criteria for a 14 day quarantine. If that same interaction involved face coverings for both parties involved, the interaction is no longer considered a close contact.
· Flu vaccines will be especially important this season. We hope all schools will encourage students to vaccinate against influenza this season. We do not currently know what co-infection with influenza and COVID19 will look like. We hope families will reduce the risk of infection by choosing to vaccinate.

In closing, we wish to serve as a resource and want to work together to reach our common goal of ensuring a safe and sustainable return to school. We are especially passionate about this process as we will be the ones taking care of patients and families affected by COVID19. We are on the front lines of fighting this horrifying pandemic and see, firsthand, the fear, the pain and the devastation families experience. We greatly appreciate your consideration of our input.

Recommendations for the Practical, Fair, and Safe Reopening of Public Schools K-12 in the State of Texas",6.0,"Information shared by pediatricians in the Birmingham area regarding the need for students to attend school physically and safely and how it can be done.
Re: Best Practices regarding Re-Opening Schools

To Whom it May Concern,

We, the undersigned, are physician parents who work and live in the greater Birmingham area. We appreciate the countless hours you have spent responding to the COVID19 pandemic. As physicians serving on the frontlines with a vested interest in our patients and children, we wish to endorse the below evidence-based guidelines to re-open Alabama schools. As a group we agree with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) that the goal of re-opening schools should focus on children returning to school physically and safely. While there are data showing children are less likely to spread COVID19 and less likely to have severe disease compared to adults, this is still a very serious illness. Among the 983 COVID deaths in Alabama to date, two have been children. We believe that schools can and should re-open in a meaningful and sustainable way. However, this is a novel virus and will require a novel response to control the spread in schools. These are our medical recommendations to aid in our common goal of safe schools for this upcoming school year:

· Face coverings must be mandated when indoors. These include medical masks, reusable fabric masks, gaiters or clear face shields. With very few medical exceptions, children over 2 can be taught to wear these for extended periods of time. Universal masking is crucial to controlling spread of COVID19 because the wearers’ mask protects others. If only a few wear them, they are not effective. A mandate is the best way to ensure universal face coverings. Parents will need time and resources to teach their children how to wear face coverings. Just like riding a bike or any other skill, children must be taught and encouraged to maintain their skills. We can partner with schools to develop tools for education, but the mandate needs to be step one. From a medical standpoint, face coverings are the best chance schools have to re-open and stay open.1
· Access to soap, water and paper towels with frequent hand-washing breaks coupled with sanitizer stations throughout the school will help decrease spread. Sanitizing spray and paper towels to wipe down frequently touched surfaces is an alternative to sanitizing wipes that are in short supply.1
· Educate parents on the critical importance of keeping children home when ill. While activities like daily on-site temperature screening make us feel safer, these screenings have not been shown to reduce risk of spread in a meaningful way. We have also found that some families will answer “no” when being screened for illness or exposure only to reveal a significant history of illness or exposure later in the visit. This observation does not mean these processes should not be used, but they are limited in efficacy and must be used in combination with other safe guards.
· Temperature screening must balance the practicality and resources of performing these screening procedures for large numbers of students and staff with the information known about how children manifest COVID-19 infection, the risk of transmission in schools, and the possible lost instructional time to conduct the screenings.”1
· Use all available outdoor spaces in creative ways to give kids more time outside. Gathering outdoors is inherently safer during a pandemic. Outdoor time will also give kids breaks from face coverings. Thinking creatively about outdoor spaces for lunch and snacks would enable more typical socialization while eating. Opening windows in classrooms and other spaces would also improve ventilation and reduce risk.1
· Offer varying hybrids of in person attendance and eLearning. Parents should be given flexibility to change at certain intervals (nine weeks or semester) to account for changing needs and special conditions such as family work constraints or illness. While we want all children to have an option to be in school, reduction in volume of students in the school on a daily basis will inherently make controlling and containing viral spread easier. 1,2
· Develop a COVID prevention plan for all school activities and modify or eliminate high-risk activities. Some of the high risk activities include assemblies, indoor singing, indoor use of wind instruments, spectators at sporting events, crowded locker rooms, parental visits. Some activities that are high risk are also necessary like eating lunch or snacks and pick-up/drop-off. Those activities will need staggered schedules, scrutiny, and creative planning to reduce risks.
· Develop and communicate a clear plan for classroom or school wide outbreaks. COVID outbreaks will be a part of the 2020-2021 school year. Local pediatricians are already seeing similar outbreaks in daycares, summer sports leagues, and camps. Because COVID19 symptoms can be very mild and often do not involve a fever in children, diagnosis and containment of outbreaks is especially complex. Adding to the difficulty of this task is the fact that our best test available has a 20-30% false negative rate.3
· Face Coverings will reduce the need for quarantine. We know that people infected with COVID19 can spread the virus for up to 14 days, with or without symptoms. The current recommendation by the Jefferson County Department of Public Health is that students return to school 14 days after a positive test was collected or 14 days from symptom start as long as symptom free for 3 days without any medications such as Tylenol or Motrin. If a student or staff has a close contact with someone who is infected (more than 15 min, less than 6 feet, indoors without a face covering), they will meet criteria for a 14 day quarantine. If that same interaction involved face coverings for both parties involved, the interaction is no longer considered a close contact.
· Flu vaccines will be especially important this season. We hope all schools will encourage students to vaccinate against influenza this season. We do not currently know what co-infection with influenza and COVID19 will look like. We hope families will reduce the risk of infection by choosing to vaccinate.

In closing, we wish to serve as a resource and want to work together to reach our common goal of ensuring a safe and sustainable return to school. We are especially passionate about this process as we will be the ones taking care of patients and families affected by COVID19. We are on the front lines of fighting this horrifying pandemic and see, firsthand, the fear, the pain and the devastation families experience. We greatly appreciate your consideration of our input.

High School Graduation Ceremony Guide

Dress the part for a once-in-a-lifetime event that's rich in style and traditions.

Ceremony Basics

There's no greater recognition of a graduate's achievements than a high school graduation ceremony, or commencement. Diplomas are ""conferred"" or handed out to graduating seniors and the speakers selected for this event often include community dignitaries, alumni and students. The valedictorian, the highest-ranking academic student in the graduation class, usually speaks.

Many schools have to restrict attendance for space reasons. Make sure to check with your school to see if there will be limitations on the number of people you can invite to the ceremony. If your school has space restrictions and you're facing a dilemma about who to include, try these tips:

Talk to your friends and family members and explain that while you want them at graduation, each graduate is allowed only a limited number of guests. Most people will understand and even possibly volunteer to give up their ticket so that someone else may attend.
Consider inviting only one grandparent or aunt or uncle from each wing of your family.
Come up with a creative solution that will feel fair to everyone, such as drawing names.
Let everyone who is not able to attend know they will be invited to the graduation party. Make sure to share your photos and videos to make them feel included.

Ceremony Etiquette

What are the traditions of your particular school? If graduation is a more formal and somber right of passage, it's probably better to replace whooping and hollering with applause.
In most schools, the handing out of diplomas is a quick and orderly process. Make sure that when you show pride in your graduate, you aren't drowning out the recognition of another.
Life's milestones deserve everyone's full attention. Turn off your cell phones and resist the urge to text until the entire ceremony is over. Remain in your seat until the last students receive their diplomas so that they feel properly acknowledged.

The Cap and Gown

Preparing to march to ""Pomp and Circumstance"" requires wearing the traditional graduation cap and gown, a tradition that dates back centuries to the early universities in Europe.

Here's how to wear your cap and gown

The graduation cap is worn flat on the head, parallel to the floor. The front point of the cap should be centered on the forehead.
The graduation gown should fall midway between the knee and ankle.
Men should remove their graduation caps during the school song and the National Anthem.
Tassels are usually worn on the right side and shifted to the left when graduates receive their diplomas.
Men generally wear dark trousers and dress shirts and ties under their graduation gowns.
Women generally wear lightweight dresses or blouses and skirts that do not hang below their graduation gowns. They can also wear a detachable white collar that adds a more finished, decorative touch.
Flowers and jewelry should not be worn on the academic gown.
Caps and gowns can be accessorized with specific regalia like stoles and honor cords in keeping with the traditions of the school.",0.0,"Let's make this event special. See the Ceremony Guide for this once-in -a-lifetime event!

Thank you for supporting the Cougar Cafe (baseball concession) when we were open the first week of April. Thanks to your purchases and donations we were able to raise the money to purchase the shadow boxes we traditionally give our seniors. The Central Cougar baseball program would have been celebrating our Senior Night tonight; hence we would like to recognize our seniors by name. Once conditions permit, we will hold our Senior Night ceremony and present our seniors with their shadow boxes.

Do not be upset if you do not get an answer right away. I hope to do a FB LIVE post tomorrow afternoon or evening. Remember, we are on SPRING BREAK THIS WEEK.

Instruction will continue so all can complete coursework.
Graduation will occur for seniors, ESPECIALLY. The time will be determined at a later date.

School has been canceled in more than a dozen states, many of them with very short notice. If you're worried about your child falling behind with their learning or wasting away in front of netflix next week- we're here to help! Join us on Monday, March 16th, for a daily show featuring science and math lessons, crafts and games. Hosted by Science Mom and Math Dad, this two hour livestream is a wonderful way to put some fun learning into your quarantine.

Each show will feature a science lesson, math activities, interactive games, and stories. If you'd like to share your creation with other families who are following along with Quarantime, post it to Instagram with the hashtags #quarantime and #sciencemomsquad. Feel free to tag me too! We can't wait to see what you come up with!

At the end of each show, we'll take several minutes to answer YOUR questions. If you'd like to submit a question in advance, email us at questions@science.mom. Please note that we get more questions submitted than we have time to answer -we still love to hear from you even if you aren't able to reply!

You can watch the Livestream here on the Science Mom Facebook page (click on the ""videos"" tab) or by going to www.youtube.com/sciencemom A replay is available afterward on both Facebook the Science Mom YouTube channel.

While our science and math lessons are aimed at kids age 7-12, this is a family-friendly show that is for BOTH kids and parents (and any elderly people who are feeling isolated at home and would like to watch some science and math lessons and participate in a few crafts).

Each day we post a simple worksheet that goes along with the show. You can find those at www.patreon.com/sciencemom.",0.0,"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2555301844707352&id=1804658893104988

IEP Meetings get a bad rap... But y’all, I had the sweetest meeting today and my heart is so full. I have to tell you about it. Getting to share accomplishments, strengths, and precious moments is my favorite part of these meetings. I love to tell parents about how their kids have progressed in communication, academic, or functional skills, but I absolutely ADORE getting to share about the friendships they are making, how they make us laugh and surprise us, and let them know how much they are loved! I think there were some “happy tears” shed and definitely some warm fuzzies felt by all ♥️

Our meeting was extra special though... This mama was SO complementary! Of me and the other teachers in my room, of the work we are doing with her son, of our school system and other members of our staff... she had so many nice things to say! With job and other life changes, her priority has been that he stays in here in Coosa County because she has never been so pleased. It was SO wonderful to hear! We NEED to hear it sometimes! We definitely don’t hear it enough.

You always hear about the negative things. Negativity spreads so easily; Let’s be conscious about sharing the positives too. 😊 #spedlifeisthebestlife #imjusthereforthekids #coosacountyschools #centralcoosa",0.0,"So this happened today. What if it happened EVERY DAY!!!

A Note from the Superintendent of Education
“Row, row, row our buses, all the way to school, the more it rains, the harder we row, each and every day!!”, in our best singing voice ever!!! When will this rain and threatening weather end? Thankfully, we have been blessed with safe travels all this week. From rain to ice, 70 weather to 20 degree weather within a few days. This reminds me of classroom management at times. Students can be so engaged in lessons or activities and all of a sudden an interruption occurs and the rest of the day could lend itself to chaos. The key is keeping the routine as close to normal as possible but sometimes that is easier said than done.
The students are receiving a long weekend with today and Monday off, while teachers are spending today in professional development. The main focus for learning reflects the Alabama Literacy Act and what is involved in the act. I mentioned last week that teachers are receiving job-embedded professional development, which means they learn while they practice implementation strategies with students in the classroom. This opportunity occurred again this week as the regional Alabama Reading Initiative Reading Coach came to Central Elementary to support the local reading coach and teachers with reading implementation. The support is a major part of the Act.
Today, teachers will be developing school wide literacy plans to optimize opportunities for reading and building reading proficiency. Although the Act is geared toward kindergarten through third grades, the overall focus of reading instruction continues through 12th grade. Even if teachers are not certified in the area of reading, because of its importance to all facets of life, in general, there should be a depth of reading instruction shared in all classrooms.

I have been participating in a comprehensive literacy study with other educators throughout the state and we are learning about factors that could be impeding the importance of reading in our schools. Most of the participants are in rural with high poverty. In conjunction with this study, I have also been reading a book called, Cultivating Genius. The author, Gholdy Muhammad, reminds us that literacy can be a source of power for young people and a key to transforming their lives. Reading is so much more than calling words but an avenue to learn to debate, express feelings, share cultures and so, so much more. If you have not been encouraging your children or grandchildren to read AND write, please begin that now. It is never too late.

Once again, as the Instructional Leader of the Coosa County School System, with the support of all stakeholders: administrators, faculty, staff, students, businesses and community, I will promote an environment that supports the diverse needs of all students. This will include, but not be limited to, effectively planning for system improvements by collecting, analyzing and interpreting data, problem-solving, and allocating resources to address the most critical needs identified. Additionally, I will seek supports to enhance the unique and diverse characteristics of the county by creating and sustaining opportunities for more school-community relations. I am proud to call Coosa County my home and especially proud to lead the efforts in moving the Coosa County School System forward. Stay tuned…",0.0,"Please read and share!

A Note from the Superintendent of Education
The school system had a very exciting weekend, this past week with students participating in both math and robotics competitions. The outcomes were rewarding as several individual and group awards were claimed in the math competition. The first ever experience in state completion by the robotics team led to a 15th place out of 36 teams. Both competitions were great experiences for all students and sponsors alike. Not only were academic competitions held this weekend but athletic competitions in basketball are winding down to area competitions in the next few days. The senior players, boys and girls, were recognized Tuesday night during the Thorsby game. We are extra proud of these students for their continued commitment of participating in extracurricular activities during high school. It is not an easy task juggling academics and athletics, but these students were up for the challenge. We are so proud of our students and their accomplishments.
Next week will begin the legislative session in Montgomery with a number of topics already being discussed. This time last year, talks were beginning regarding the Alabama Literacy Act which proved to be one of the most talked about bills on the agenda. Today school systems across the state are working to ensure expectations of this act are being met. In order to address literacy for students, we must know what deficits students are showing. We are able to identify deficits based upon assessments that focus on the components of reading: phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary fluency and comprehension
With support from the Alabama Reading Initiative, ARI, the Central Elementary reading coach and 2nd grade teachers participated in job-embedded professional development this week to practice and build their craft of reading instruction. Implementation plans were created and will be monitored by administration in order to give as much support as possible to students and reading instruction. Additionally, the reading coach will work to support the same professional development opportunity for other reading teachers in grades K, 1st and 3rd. As a reminder, if students are not reading on third grade level by the end of third grade, they will not be promoted to the fourth grade.
This feat cannot happen without the support of parents. Parents are critical to the success of a child’s reading ability. Learning to read begins with oral vocabulary. This means babies should be read to even before birth. Additionally, babies toddlers and preschool age children should NOT spend time on a phone or iPad watching videos. Television time should also be limited to educational type shows, not just cartoons. Books should be readily available so that anyone can pick up a book and share the book with the child. Visits to the grocery store and Wal-Mart should also include conversations such as picking up a vegetable and showing and talking to the child about the vegetable. Oral vocabulary growth allows children later in life to make associations with books they are reading.
If you are a parent of a young child and you have not been exposing your child to books, please change your habits now. Books will make a much better gift than a toy. Grandparents, if your grandchildren are not being exposed to reading, please help educate the parents and reduce computer and screen time. Talking to your children will make a world of difference when they begin kindergarten. If changes are not made soon, we will have an abundance of third graders due to lack of reading exposure before entering school.
Once again, as the Instructional Leader of the Coosa County School System, with the support of all stakeholders: administrators, faculty, staff, students, businesses and community, I will promote an environment that supports the diverse needs of all students. This will include, but not be limited to, effectively planning for system improvements by collecting, analyzing and interpreting data, problem-solving, and allocating resources to address the most critical needs identified. Additionally, I will seek supports to enhance the unique and diverse characteristics of the county by creating and sustaining opportunities for more school-community relations.

A Note from the Superintendent of Education
The school system had a very exciting weekend, this past week with students participating in both math and robotics competitions. The outcomes were rewarding as several individual and group awards were claimed in the math competition. The first ever experience in state completion by the robotics team led to a 15th place out of 36 teams. Both competitions were great experiences for all students and sponsors alike. Not only were academic competitions held this weekend but athletic competitions in basketball are winding down to area competitions in the next few days. The senior players, boys and girls, were recognized Tuesday night during the Thorsby game. We are extra proud of these students for their continued commitment of participating in extracurricular activities during high school. It is not an easy task juggling academics and athletics, but these students were up for the challenge. We are so proud of our students and their accomplishments.
Next week will begin the legislative session in Montgomery with a number of topics already being discussed. This time last year, talks were beginning regarding the Alabama Literacy Act which proved to be one of the most talked about bills on the agenda.

A Note from the Superintendent of Education
As I have been making my way from the office to the schools each day, I have been eyeing the former Avondale building. This building that sat abandoned for many years is now being spruced up. The transformation has been slow but finally, this week, a name has gone up on the building. This is definitely something very encouraging for Coosa County. A business based upon a trade; a trade reflective of woodworking and upholstering.
As you have heard throughout the news and social media markets, there is a high demand for tradesmen. The Coosa County School System has had several programs in the past such as building science, air conditioning and refrigeration and auto mechanics, which were very popular programs by the students but were discontinued well before my time due to not being able to find certified teachers or tradesmen willing to give up a higher salary to teach the trade. Programs that have been around, even when the other programs were available, and continue to be popular and viable programs in the school system are Business Office Management, Health Science, Family and Consumer Science and Agriscience.
These four programs continue to exist as an option for students to choose as a class without the actual career tech center building being open. while housed on the main campus at Central High School The building was closed because there has to be five viable programs in order to have a career tech center. We did not have five full programs due to the loss of EARNED teaching units at the high school. A school, such as Central High School, earns teaching units based upon the number of students enrolled in that school for the prior school year. To be precise, the enrollment is captured on the 20th day after Labor Day. With any drop in enrollment, there is a chance of losing a teaching unit. In the past, Central High School has been able to devote five teaching units specifically to the Career Tech Center because the number of teaching units did not create a hardship on the core classes needed that could not be adjusted in the areas of, mathematics, science, English and history. Unfortunately, the strategic maneuvering could not be maneuvered any more.
With the teaching units earned this past year, strategically planning options were not options anymore and the devoted five units did not qualify for a Career Tech Center. Are students offered career tech classes? YES. Do students participate in career tech classes? Yes. Do students have book work in career tech classes? Yes, as they always have in the past. Do students participate in hands-on instruction? Yes, as they always have in the past. Dual enrollment has been an option for trade pathways, FREE of CHARGE to high school students. Students have been participating in these programs, such as welding, for several years. Students now have an option to graduate from high school with an additional certificate from a technical program at Central Alabama Community College ready for the workforce. Part of each program is to support students in finding jobs in the field of certification. This December, we have already had one student to complete a program and several more that will be graduating high school in May with either a technical degree or a two year degree. Very impressive accomplishments of our students!
Close relationships with CACC has been critical in planning and preparing a schedule conducive to the high school schedule. Has is always been easy to accommodate the students with the classes they want to take? Not always, but special attention has been given to each student participating in these dual enrollment opportunities so that we can create a schedule that supports the program. The main thing to keep on the forefront is the student and their interest. If students are not interested in the program, they are wasting time. If students participate in a program of interest, they will excel and be ready for the job force when they graduate high school.
Once again, as the Instructional Leader of the Coosa County School System, with the support of all stakeholders: administrators, faculty, staff, students, businesses and community, I will promote an environment that supports the diverse needs of all students. This will include, but not be limited to, effectively planning for system improvements by collecting, analyzing and interpreting data, problem-solving, and allocating resources to address the most critical needs identified. Additionally, I will seek supports to enhance the unique and diverse characteristics of the county by creating and sustaining opportunities for more school-community relations. I am proud to call Coosa County my home and especially proud to lead the efforts in moving the Coosa County School System forward. Stay tuned…",2.0,"Please read and share!

Programs that have been around, even when the other programs were available, and continue to be popular and viable programs in the school system are Business Office Management, Health Science, Family and Consumer Science and Agriscience.
These four programs continue to exist as an option for students to choose as a class without the actual career tech center building being open. while housed on the main campus at Central High School The building was closed because there has to be five viable programs in order to have a career tech center. We did not have five full programs due to the loss of EARNED teaching units at the high school. A school, such as Central High School, earns teaching units based upon the number of students enrolled in that school for the prior school year. To be precise, the enrollment is captured on the 20th day after Labor Day. With any drop in enrollment, there is a chance of losing a teaching unit. In the past, Central High School has been able to devote five teaching units specifically to the Career Tech Center because the number of teaching units did not create a hardship on the core classes needed that could not be adjusted in the areas of, mathematics, science, English and history. Unfortunately, the strategic maneuvering could not be maneuvered any more.
With the teaching units earned this past year, strategically planning options were not options anymore and the devoted five units did not qualify for a Career Tech Center. Are students offered career tech classes? YES. Do students participate in career tech classes? Yes. Do students have book work in career tech classes? Yes, as they always have in the past. Do students participate in hands-on instruction? Yes, as they always have in the past. Dual enrollment has been an option for trade pathways, FREE of CHARGE to high school students. Students have been participating in these programs, such as welding, for several years. Students now have an option to graduate from high school with an additional certificate from a technical program at Central Alabama Community College ready for the workforce. Part of each program is to support students in finding jobs in the field of certification. This December, we have already had one student to complete a program and several more that will be graduating high school in May with either a technical degree or a two year degree. Very impressive accomplishments of our students!
Close relationships with CACC has been critical in planning and preparing a schedule conducive to the high school schedule. Has is always been easy to accommodate the students with the classes they want to take? Not always, but special attention has been given to each student participating in these dual enrollment opportunities so that we can create a schedule that supports the program. The main thing to keep on the forefront is the student and their interest. If students are not interested in the program, they are wasting time. If students participate in a program of interest, they will excel and be ready for the job force when they graduate high school.
Once again, as the Instructional Leader of the Coosa County School System, with the support of all stakeholders: administrators, faculty, staff, students, businesses and community, I will promote an environment that supports the diverse needs of all students. This will include, but not be limited to, effectively planning for system improvements by collecting, analyzing and interpreting data, problem-solving, and allocating resources to address the most critical needs identified. Additionally, I will seek supports to enhance the unique and diverse characteristics of the county by creating and sustaining opportunities for more school-community relations. I am proud to call Coosa County my home and especially proud to lead the efforts in moving the Coosa County School System forward.

As I have been making my way from the office to the schools each day, I have been eyeing the former Avondale building. This building that sat abandoned for many years is now being spruced up. The transformation has been slow but finally, this week, a name has gone up on the building. This is definitely something very encouraging for Coosa County. A business based upon a trade; a trade reflective of woodworking and upholstering.

372,0.0,,0.0,,2551180954931686,"I think we have all heard the saying, “Education is the Key”. This can apply in every facet of life. Education is key when making any type of important decision; what college to attend, what job offer is best for me and my family, which foods it should eat on a prescribed diet, just to name a few. Being knowledgeable in the roles and responsibilities for the office of superintendent is important for everyone to know in order to understand the depth of responsibility and commitment.
According to the Alabama Association of School Boards, AASB, and the School Superintendents of Alabama, SSA, there are ten overall responsibilities: General Functions, Relationships, Meetings, Policy, Budget and Finance, Curriculum and Instruction, Personnel, Students, Facilities and Community Engagement. All of these topics have multiple roles or responsibilities reflective of each topic. I would like to share this information with everyone to show the depth of responsibility that goes into this position and depending upon the size of the system, how much more this position requires of the superintendent.
The General Function responsibility involves establishing a vision, focusing on raising student achievement, implementing board policies and overseeing daily operations, providing educational leadership for the staff, holding all employees accountable for system performance, identifying needs and reporting the needs to the board for action, initiating development and implementation of a strategic plan, monitors and apprises the board of state and national developments, and participates in professional development activities and whole board trainings. This first responsibility covers an array of responsibilities that drive the system. Raising student achievement and professional development are two very time consuming responsibilities in itself and are continuous day to day responsibilities.
Relationships, as with everything we do in a school system, are critical to success of the system. Overseeing the overall operation of the system and managing all personnel is a day to day responsibility. There are other key members of the system team that must support the superintendent in this area but without the support, additional challenges can arise. Respecting the decisions and opinions of the board and its members is critical. Being open minded about decisions allows opportunities to build trust with one another, such as Board members. Also, providing information to the board in a timely manner regarding information allows the board to make sound decisions based upon the information presented in advance. Keeping the board abreast of policy development and revision is important as well. The board must be given ample time to examine and study policy changes before decisions should be made.
Meetings is the third role and responsibility listed which reflect the role of the superintendent as the Chief Executive Officer, CEO, and secretary to the board as well as a member of the governance team. Assuring compliance with state law regarding meeting notices and maintenance of meeting records is important. Laws are in place with requirements regarding when, where and how meeting information is to be posted as well as the depth of meeting notes. The superintendent is responsible for developing the topics to present before the board and must provide a packet to board members in advance of the meeting to allow time to review and ask questions. All staff members and others relevant to each board agenda is notified of decisions made by the board following the board meeting. The superintendent must assure the board meets for all legally required sessions.
Policy can be an ever changing responsibility based upon the updates that are required through federal and state legislation. The superintendent advises the board regarding the need and when policy changes will be occurring. Drafts of the proposed changes are usually sent to system legal advisors first before being presented to the board members for adoption. Policy manuals must be made readily available to the board members and public, usually accessible through school system websites. Employees must be made aware of changes and educated on the changes and why. At times, policies may not necessarily be needed but procedures may be put into place to reflect expectations and policy. Keeping the policy on the forefront is an absolute.
Budget and Finance responsibilities are often the unseen backbone of a school system. The superintendent along with the board and the Chief School Financial Officer, CSFO, work to ensure the budget is aligned with system goals. Budget hearings are held in order to share with the public what expenditures are expected or have occurred. A budget must be approved yearly at a designated time of the year. A superintendent and CSFO must monitor the financial health of the system which may not always be a “healthy budget”. The board and staff must have clear and accurate information regarding the budget. The Superintendent works with the CSFO to develop a plan to remedy any deficits and/or audit findings. Most importantly, the superintendent MUST be willing to advocate for financial support.
Curriculum and Instruction is a must when it comes to the roles and responsibilities of the superintendent. With raising student achievement as one of the target general functions of a superintendent, creating a culture of high expectations for both students and staff is an absolute. The superintendent must advise the board on all student educational needs as well as evaluating the effectiveness of instructional programs. Leading the efforts of continuously improving teaching and learning is all day, every day. The superintendent works to keep the board abreast of the staff’s work regarding student achievement and program implementation.
Personnel roles and responsibilities reflect the superintendent recommending the employment, retention, promotion and termination of staff. A superintendent must foster a strong working relationship with staff and maintains the lines of communication. Additionally, the superintendent must ensure that all staff members are effectively supervised and evaluated. The superintendent delegates authority as appropriate based upon the job descriptions laid out for all staff members. The superintendent also serves as the board’s liaison to the staff and establishes professional development for them, as well.
The roles and responsibilities of students where the superintendent is concerned reflect a healthy climate for student growth and learning. Additionally, as mentioned earlier, evaluating the school programs in order to meet the needs of students is an absolute. The recommendation and implementation of policies for student support services is dependent upon student needs. First and foremost, policies and rules are established to maintain student safety, health and discipline.
Dependent upon the district’s needs, facilities play a role in the superintendent’s roles and responsibilities. The superintendent implements policies for the use, operation, maintenance and rental of system buildings, grounds and equipment. A superintendent must provide for the proper upkeep of the facilities and equipment as well. Priorities are set for long-term and preventative maintenance of the facilities and equipment yearly as well as working with architects, staff and consultants when necessary. The superintendent also recommends actions related to construction, closing, consolidation, and rezoning, which may or may not be popular recommendations.
Finally, the superintendent plays a critical role and responsibility in community engagement. It is important that the superintendent informs stakeholders about the system’s successes and challenges. There is also the expectation of the superintendent for the staff to engage parents in every possible way. The superintendent should be able to engage in dialog with stakeholders at all levels about issues facing the system. They must work with the news media and social media and build bridges between the system and key organizations and leaders.
I know this was a lengthy article but I felt it was important to get information out about the roles and responsibilities of a superintendent. As a general rule, we do not always know ALL about a person’s job. I think we should ask more people to shed light on the roles and responsibilities they are held accountable for each day. That is how we can understand things better but most importantly, support one another more.
Once again, as the Instructional Leader of the Coosa County School System, with the support of all stakeholders: administrators, faculty, staff, students, businesses and community, I will promote an environment that supports the diverse needs of all students. This will include, but not be limited to, effectively planning for system improvements by collecting, analyzing and interpreting data, problem-solving, and allocating resources to address the most critical needs identified. Additionally, I will seek supports to enhance the unique and diverse characteristics of the county by creating and sustaining opportunities for more school-community relations. I am proud to call Coosa County my home and especially proud to lead the efforts in moving the Coosa County School System forward.

A Note from the Superintendent of Education
Our students are getting in the Christmas Spirit with only one week left of the first semester. That is so hard to believe!. This school year is quickly passing and not only students but others such as administrators and teachers must make every moment count.
I would like to conclude the series I began a couple of weeks ago, “Education is the Key”. I have hopefully educated everyone in the roles and responsibilities of the superintendent and principal. Today, I would like to educate everyone on the roles and responsibilities of a teacher. As with all of these jobs comes various responsibilities.
According to Alabama Code 290-3-3-.03,the Alabama Core Teaching Standards, identify ten areas a teacher must address on a daily basis.
(1) Learner Development. The teacher understanding how learners grow and develop is critical, Recognizing that patterns of learning and development vary individually within and across the cognitive, linguistic, social, emotional, and physical areas, and designs and implements developmentally appropriate and challenging learning experiences plays a large role in exposing students to what is developmentally appropriate content for .students
(2) Learning Differences. The teacher using an understanding of individual differences and diverse cultures and communities to ensure inclusive learning environments that enable each learner to meet high standards is an important aspect to overall learning. Teachers must be in tune to cultural and individual differences of students in teach class.
(3) Learning Environments. The teacher working with others to create environments that support individual and collaborative learning and that encourage positive social interaction, active engagement in learning, and self-motivation is a must. Students should feel safe and non-threatened as learning occurs in various environments throughout the school each day..
(4) Content Knowledge. The teacher understanding the central concepts, tools of inquiry, and structures of the discipline(s) he or she teaches and creates learning experiences that make these aspects of the discipline accessible and meaningful for learners to assure mastery of the content is a daily goal. Students must have opportunities to investigate and follow guiding questions in order to develop thinking skills. Being told answers is not always the right direction to take. A productive struggle is necessary in order to build thinking skills..
(5) Application of Content The teacher understanding how to connect concepts and use differing perspectives to engage learners in critical thinking, creativity, and collaborative problem solving related to authentic local and global issues. Building background is key in order to spark thinking.
(6) Assessment The teacher understanding and using multiple methods of assessment to engage learners in their own growth, to monitor learner progress, and to guide the candidate’s and learner’s decision making. Students must be a part of the learning through self-evaluation
(7) Planning for Instruction Based on the appropriate Alabama Course(s) of Study, the teacher planning instruction that supports every student in meeting rigorous learning goals by drawing upon knowledge of content areas, curriculum, cross-disciplinary skills, and pedagogy, as well as knowledge of learners and the community context. This takes time order to develop lessons that support various levels and keeping focused on the outcome of each day’s lesson.
(8) Instructional Strategies. The teacher understanding and using a variety of instructional strategies to encourage learners to develop deep understanding of content areas and their connections, and to build skills to apply knowledge in meaningful ways. This will assist all involved in a lesson to be engaged.
(9) Professional Learning and Ethical Practice The teacher engaging in ongoing professional learning and uses evidence to continually evaluate his/her practice, particularly the effects of his/her choices and actions on others (learners, families, other professionals, and the community) and adapts practice to meet the needs of each learner. Teachers should never dread an opportunity for professional learning. Teachers should think of themselves as life-long learners.
(10) Leadership and Collaboration The teacher seeking appropriate leadership roles and opportunities to take responsibility for student learning, to collaborate with learners, families, colleagues, other school professionals, and community members to ensure learner growth, and to advance the profession. This is what build capacity in schools and develops the next level of leaders.
It would have been easy to go into more detail for each of the three articles, but unfortunately I am sure Christa appreciates me limiting the information to at least cover the surface. Teachers have MANY responsibilities and it times time to develop in all areas. I hope everyone realizes the depth of the roles and responsibilities of everyone in the school setting. I often hear, teachers are off in the summer. That is not really an accurate statement. Great teachers work all summer preparing for the upcoming school year. Remember, teachers are life-long learners.

Our students are getting in the Christmas Spirit with only one week left of the first semester. That is so hard to believe!. This school year is quickly passing and not only students but others such as administrators and teachers must make every moment count.
I would like to conclude the series I began a couple of weeks ago, “Education is the Key”. I have hopefully educated everyone in the roles and responsibilities of the superintendent and principal. Today, I would like to educate everyone on the roles and responsibilities of a teacher. As with all of these jobs comes various responsibilities.
According to Alabama Code 290-3-3-.03,the Alabama Core Teaching Standards, identify ten areas a teacher must address on a daily basis.
(1) Learner Development. The teacher understanding how learners grow and develop is critical, Recognizing that patterns of learning and development vary individually within and across the cognitive, linguistic, social, emotional, and physical areas, and designs and implements developmentally appropriate and challenging learning experiences plays a large role in exposing students to what is developmentally appropriate content for .students
(2) Learning Differences. The teacher using an understanding of individual differences and diverse cultures and communities to ensure inclusive learning environments that enable each learner to meet high standards is an important aspect to overall learning. Teachers must be in tune to cultural and individual differences of students in teach class.
(3) Learning Environments. The teacher working with others to create environments that support individual and collaborative learning and that encourage positive social interaction, active engagement in learning, and self-motivation is a must. Students should feel safe and non-threatened as learning occurs in various environments throughout the school each day..
(4) Content Knowledge. The teacher understanding the central concepts, tools of inquiry, and structures of the discipline(s) he or she teaches and creates learning experiences that make these aspects of the discipline accessible and meaningful for learners to assure mastery of the content is a daily goal. Students must have opportunities to investigate and follow guiding questions in order to develop thinking skills. Being told answers is not always the right direction to take. A productive struggle is necessary in order to build thinking skills..
(5) Application of Content The teacher understanding how to connect concepts and use differing perspectives to engage learners in critical thinking, creativity, and collaborative problem solving related to authentic local and global issues. Building background is key in order to spark thinking.
(6) Assessment The teacher understanding and using multiple methods of assessment to engage learners in their own growth, to monitor learner progress, and to guide the candidate’s and learner’s decision making. Students must be a part of the learning through self-evaluation
(7) Planning for Instruction Based on the appropriate Alabama Course(s) of Study, the teacher planning instruction that supports every student in meeting rigorous learning goals by drawing upon knowledge of content areas, curriculum, cross-disciplinary skills, and pedagogy, as well as knowledge of learners and the community context. This takes time order to develop lessons that support various levels and keeping focused on the outcome of each day’s lesson.
(8) Instructional Strategies. The teacher understanding and using a variety of instructional strategies to encourage learners to develop deep understanding of content areas and their connections, and to build skills to apply knowledge in meaningful ways. This will assist all involved in a lesson to be engaged.
(9) Professional Learning and Ethical Practice The teacher engaging in ongoing professional learning and uses evidence to continually evaluate his/her practice, particularly the effects of his/her choices and actions on others (learners, families, other professionals, and the community) and adapts practice to meet the needs of each learner. Teachers should never dread an opportunity for professional learning. Teachers should think of themselves as life-long learners.
(10) Leadership and Collaboration The teacher seeking appropriate leadership roles and opportunities to take responsibility for student learning, to collaborate with learners, families, colleagues, other school professionals, and community members to ensure learner growth, and to advance the profession. This is what build capacity in schools and develops the next level of leaders.
It would have been easy to go into more detail for each of the three articles, but unfortunately I am sure Christa appreciates me limiting the information to at least cover the surface. Teachers have MANY responsibilities and it times time to develop in all areas. I hope everyone realizes the depth of the roles and responsibilities of everyone in the school setting. I often hear, teachers are off in the summer. That is not really an accurate statement. Great teachers work all summer preparing for the upcoming school year. Remember, teachers are life-long learners.
Once again, as the Instructional Leader of the Coosa County School System, with the support of all stakeholders: administrators, faculty, staff, students, businesses and community, I will promote an environment that supports the diverse needs of all students. This will include, but not be limited to, effectively planning for system improvements by collecting, analyzing and interpreting data, problem-solving, and allocating resources to address the most critical needs identified.

A Note from the Superintendent of Education
I hope everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday this past week. We all have so much to be thankful for whether it’s our family, health, job, or life in general. So often we take things for granted. Things can change so quickly. Living without regret and having forgiveness in our hearts is not always easy but is a necessity.
I would like to continue the series I began last week with “Education is the Key”. The roles and responsibilities of a superintendent was the first focus. I hope everyone gained knowledge is that area. This week, I would like to shed light on the roles and responsibilities of a principal. According to
Alabama Code 16-24B-4. a principal and contract principal shall supervise the daily operation and management of personnel, finances, facilities, and other matters of the school or campus for which the principal and contract principal is responsible. A principal and contract principal shall assume the administrative responsibility and instructional leadership, as directed by the chief executive officer, consistent with the policies of the employing board, for the planning, management, operation, and evaluation of the education program of each school or campus under the responsibility of the principal and contract principal.
All principals in the Coosa County School System are contract principals, because they were hired after July 1, 2000 reflective of the Teacher Accountability Act. Principals do not earn tenure under the Teacher Accountability Act. A first year principal with no previous experience in a particular system is considered a probationary principal. A principal candidate can be hired on a probationary contract for one or two years dependent upon the Board’s desire. If a newly hired principal has had experience in another Alabama system, the principal can only be hired as a one year probationary principal according to the law. It is the responsibility of the superintendent to evaluate the principals, however, there is no requirement to evaluate probationary principals under the Act. There is also no consequence for failing to annually evaluate probationary principals. Unlike probationary principals, contract principals must be evaluated annually using the evaluation instrument approved by the State Department of Education. If the contract principal is not properly evaluated at any point, his contract shall be extended one year for every year the evaluation is not completed, up to a maximum of three years. All contract principals must be evaluated each year. Without an evaluation, a year extension must be given for every year not evaluated. An employing board may cancel the contract of a contract principal for cause at any time for any of the following reasons: immorality, insubordination, neglect of duty, conviction of a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude, failure to fulfill the duties and responsibilities imposed upon principals by this code, willful failure to comply with board policy, a justifiable decrease in the number of positions due to decreased enrollment or decreased funding, failure to maintain his or her certificate in a current status, other good and just cause, incompetency, and failure to perform duties in a satisfactory manner.
Supervision plays a large role in the day to day operations of the school. Principals must ensure the buildings are safe and free from harmful situations. Holding all employees and staff members responsible for their delegation is an absolute in supervision. There is no way possible a principal can physically oversee students and potential situations. It is necessary that a principal sets the expectation of how, when and where each employee supports in supervision as described in Board policy. Having dependable and accountable employees help to make the responsibility of a principal less taxing. Well prepared teachers allow for less discipline and more learning. As the instructional leader, the principal sets the expectation for being well prepared and well versed in the standards and curriculum. The principal supports teachers in becoming well versed in management, instruction, communication and other areas pertinent to the vision of the school. The principal is primarily in charge of evaluating all teachers. The principal must also work with teachers in order to improve in “areas of concern”.
Continuous improvement should reflect the needs of the school based upon assessments and other data. An instructional leader spends the majority of their time in the classrooms, collecting data and supporting instruction. The instructional leader should be an effective use of resources. It isn’t sufficient for principals to just know their faculty’s strengths and weaknesses. If specific resources can benefit the staff, the principal should be ready and prepared to provide them. They should also clearly recognize that teachers thrive on being appreciated and acknowledged for good performance. Principals must have strong communication skills. Of course, instructional principals should be excellent communicators. Interpersonal or people skills are crucial to the success of a principal. They must be able to communicate their beliefs pertaining to education, including the conviction that every student is capable of learning. These skills inspire trust, spark motivation and empower teachers and students. Additionally, instructional leaders must serve as an instructional resource. Teachers rely on principals and other administration officials to be sources of information related to effective instructional practices and current trends in education. Instructional leaders should be tuned in to all of the pertinent issues and current events related to curriculum, effective assessment, and pedagogical strategies. Lastly, good principals should be a positive, vibrant and visible presence in the school. Modeling behaviors of learning, focusing on learning objectives, and leading by example are crucial to the success of an instructional principal. In addition to these four qualities, a successful instructional principal should also have excellent planning and observation skills as well as proficiency in research and evaluation of both staff and student performance. Principals, like teachers, spend hours after school, planning, preparing, documenting, organizing and problem-solving. Their job responsibilities are critical to the success of the school.
Finances reflect the earnings and expenditures of the school. Some may think a school does not have bills to pay, but unfortunately, they do, power, water, Xerox copies, toilet paper, cleaning supplies, wax and stripper, yard maintenance, etc. This responsibility takes knowledge in what will profit the school most but also weighing in on the needs of the maintenance of the school. Facilities must be kept-up by the school. Major work would be addressed through the superintendent’s office. Additionally, the school must keep budgets of various programs used in the school. Most of the budgets must be approved by the faculty or a team from the faculty.
This article addressed many highlights of a principal’s responsibility. The content may have been lengthy, but I feel it is important that we learn roles and responsibilities of key players in the school system. The more questions we ask, the more we will learn.

(4) Content Knowledge. The teacher understanding the central concepts, tools of inquiry, and structures of the discipline(s) he or she teaches and creates learning experiences that make these aspects of the discipline accessible and meaningful for learners to assure mastery of the content is a daily goal. Students must have opportunities to investigate and follow guiding questions in order to develop thinking skills. Being told answers is not always the right direction to take.

(6) Assessment The teacher understanding and using multiple methods of assessment to engage learners in their own growth, to monitor learner progress, and to guide the candidate’s and learner’s decision making. Students must be a part of the learning through self-evaluation
(7) Planning for Instruction Based on the appropriate Alabama Course(s) of Study, the teacher planning instruction that supports every student in meeting rigorous learning goals by drawing upon knowledge of content areas, curriculum, cross-disciplinary skills, and pedagogy, as well as knowledge of learners and the community context. This takes time order to develop lessons that support various levels and keeping focused on the outcome of each day’s lesson.
(8) Instructional Strategies. The teacher understanding and using a variety of instructional strategies to encourage learners to develop deep understanding of content areas and their connections, and to build skills to apply knowledge in meaningful ways. This will assist all involved in a lesson to be engaged.
(9) Professional Learning and Ethical Practice The teacher engaging in ongoing professional learning and uses evidence to continually evaluate his/her practice, particularly the effects of his/her choices and actions on others (learners, families, other professionals, and the community) and adapts practice to meet the needs of each learner. Teachers should never dread an opportunity for professional learning. Teachers should think of themselves as life-long learners.
(10) Leadership and Collaboration The teacher seeking appropriate leadership roles and opportunities to take responsibility for student learning, to collaborate with learners, families, colleagues, other school professionals, and community members to ensure learner growth, and to advance the profession. This is what build capacity in schools and develops the next level of leaders.
It would have been easy to go into more detail for each of the three articles, but unfortunately I am sure Christa appreciates me limiting the information to at least cover the surface. Teachers have MANY responsibilities and it times time to develop in all areas. I hope everyone realizes the depth of the roles and responsibilities of everyone in the school setting. I often hear, teachers are off in the summer. That is not really an accurate statement. Great teachers work all summer preparing for the upcoming school year. Remember, teachers are life-long learners.
Once again, as the Instructional Leader of the Coosa County School System, with the support of all stakeholders: administrators, faculty, staff, students, businesses and community, I will promote an environment that supports the diverse needs of all students. This will include, but not be limited to, effectively planning for system improvements by collecting, analyzing and interpreting data, problem-solving, and allocating resources to address the most critical needs identified. Additionally, I will seek supports to enhance the unique and diverse characteristics of the county by creating and sustaining opportunities for more school-community relations.

Our students are getting in the Christmas Spirit with only one week left of the first semester. That is so hard to believe!. This school year is quickly passing and not only students but others such as administrators and teachers must make every moment count.
I would like to conclude the series I began a couple of weeks ago, “Education is the Key”. I have hopefully educated everyone in the roles and responsibilities of the superintendent and principal. Today, I would like to educate everyone on the roles and responsibilities of a teacher. As with all of these jobs comes various responsibilities.
According to Alabama Code 290-3-3-.03,the Alabama Core Teaching Standards, identify ten areas a teacher must address on a daily basis.
(1) Learner Development. The teacher understanding how learners grow and develop is critical, Recognizing that patterns of learning and development vary individually within and across the cognitive, linguistic, social, emotional, and physical areas, and designs and implements developmentally appropriate and challenging learning experiences plays a large role in exposing students to what is developmentally appropriate content for .students
(2) Learning Differences. The teacher using an understanding of individual differences and diverse cultures and communities to ensure inclusive learning environments that enable each learner to meet high standards is an important aspect to overall learning. Teachers must be in tune to cultural and individual differences of students in teach class.
(3) Learning Environments. The teacher working with others to create environments that support individual and collaborative learning and that encourage positive social interaction, active engagement in learning, and self-motivation is a must. Students should feel safe and non-threatened as learning occurs in various environments throughout the school each day..

A Note from the Superintendent of Education
I hope everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday this past week. We all have so much to be thankful for whether it’s our family, health, job, or life in general. So often we take things for granted. Things can change so quickly. Living without regret and having forgiveness in our hearts is not always easy but is a necessity.
I would like to continue the series I began last week with “Education is the Key”. The roles and responsibilities of a superintendent was the first focus. I hope everyone gained knowledge is that area. This week, I would like to shed light on the roles and responsibilities of a principal. According to
Alabama Code 16-24B-4. a principal and contract principal shall supervise the daily operation and management of personnel, finances, facilities, and other matters of the school or campus for which the principal and contract principal is responsible. A principal and contract principal shall assume the administrative responsibility and instructional leadership, as directed by the chief executive officer, consistent with the policies of the employing board, for the planning, management, operation, and evaluation of the education program of each school or campus under the responsibility of the principal and contract principal.
All principals in the Coosa County School System are contract principals, because they were hired after July 1, 2000 reflective of the Teacher Accountability Act. Principals do not earn tenure under the Teacher Accountability Act. A first year principal with no previous experience in a particular system is considered a probationary principal. A principal candidate can be hired on a probationary contract for one or two years dependent upon the Board’s desire. If a newly hired principal has had experience in another Alabama system, the principal can only be hired as a one year probationary principal according to the law. It is the responsibility of the superintendent to evaluate the principals, however, there is no requirement to evaluate probationary principals under the Act. There is also no consequence for failing to annually evaluate probationary principals. Unlike probationary principals, contract principals must be evaluated annually using the evaluation instrument approved by the State Department of Education. If the contract principal is not properly evaluated at any point, his contract shall be extended one year for every year the evaluation is not completed, up to a maximum of three years. All contract principals must be evaluated each year. Without an evaluation, a year extension must be given for every year not evaluated. An employing board may cancel the contract of a contract principal for cause at any time for any of the following reasons: immorality, insubordination, neglect of duty, conviction of a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude, failure to fulfill the duties and responsibilities imposed upon principals by this code, willful failure to comply with board policy, a justifiable decrease in the number of positions due to decreased enrollment or decreased funding, failure to maintain his or her certificate in a current status, other good and just cause, incompetency, and failure to perform duties in a satisfactory manner.
Supervision plays a large role in the day to day operations of the school. Principals must ensure the buildings are safe and free from harmful situations. Holding all employees and staff members responsible for their delegation is an absolute in supervision. There is no way possible a principal can physically oversee students and potential situations. It is necessary that a principal sets the expectation of how, when and where each employee supports in supervision as described in Board policy. Having dependable and accountable employees help to make the responsibility of a principal less taxing. Well prepared teachers allow for less discipline and more learning. As the instructional leader, the principal sets the expectation for being well prepared and well versed in the standards and curriculum. The principal supports teachers in becoming well versed in management, instruction, communication and other areas pertinent to the vision of the school. The principal is primarily in charge of evaluating all teachers. The principal must also work with teachers in order to improve in “areas of concern”.
Continuous improvement should reflect the needs of the school based upon assessments and other data. An instructional leader spends the majority of their time in the classrooms, collecting data and supporting instruction. The instructional leader should be an effective use of resources. It isn’t sufficient for principals to just know their faculty’s strengths and weaknesses. If specific resources can benefit the staff, the principal should be ready and prepared to provide them. They should also clearly recognize that teachers thrive on being appreciated and acknowledged for good performance. Principals must have strong communication skills. Of course, instructional principals should be excellent communicators. Interpersonal or people skills are crucial to the success of a principal. They must be able to communicate their beliefs pertaining to education, including the conviction that every student is capable of learning. These skills inspire trust, spark motivation and empower teachers and students. Additionally, instructional leaders must serve as an instructional resource. Teachers rely on principals and other administration officials to be sources of information related to effective instructional practices and current trends in education. Instructional leaders should be tuned in to all of the pertinent issues and current events related to curriculum, effective assessment, and pedagogical strategies. Lastly, good principals should be a positive, vibrant and visible presence in the school. Modeling behaviors of learning, focusing on learning objectives, and leading by example are crucial to the success of an instructional principal. In addition to these four qualities, a successful instructional principal should also have excellent planning and observation skills as well as proficiency in research and evaluation of both staff and student performance. Principals, like teachers, spend hours after school, planning, preparing, documenting, organizing and problem-solving. Their job responsibilities are critical to the success of the school.
Finances reflect the earnings and expenditures of the school. Some may think a school does not have bills to pay, but unfortunately, they do, power, water, Xerox copies, toilet paper, cleaning supplies, wax and stripper, yard maintenance, etc. This responsibility takes knowledge in what will profit the school most but also weighing in on the needs of the maintenance of the school. Facilities must be kept-up by the school. Major work would be addressed through the superintendent’s office. Additionally, the school must keep budgets of various programs used in the school. Most of the budgets must be approved by the faculty or a team from the faculty.
This article addressed many highlights of a principal’s responsibility. The content may have been lengthy, but I feel it is important that we learn roles and responsibilities of key players in the school system. The more questions we ask, the more we will learn.

I hope everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday this past week. We all have so much to be thankful for whether it’s our family, health, job, or life in general. So often we take things for granted. Things can change so quickly. Living without regret and having forgiveness in our hearts is not always easy but is a necessity.
I would like to continue the series I began last week with “Education is the Key”. The roles and responsibilities of a superintendent was the first focus. I hope everyone gained knowledge is that area. This week, I would like to shed light on the roles and responsibilities of a principal. According to
Alabama Code 16-24B-4. a principal and contract principal shall supervise the daily operation and management of personnel, finances, facilities, and other matters of the school or campus for which the principal and contract principal is responsible. A principal and contract principal shall assume the administrative responsibility and instructional leadership, as directed by the chief executive officer, consistent with the policies of the employing board, for the planning, management, operation, and evaluation of the education program of each school or campus under the responsibility of the principal and contract principal.
All principals in the Coosa County School System are contract principals, because they were hired after July 1, 2000 reflective of the Teacher Accountability Act. Principals do not earn tenure under the Teacher Accountability Act. A first year principal with no previous experience in a particular system is considered a probationary principal. A principal candidate can be hired on a probationary contract for one or two years dependent upon the Board’s desire. If a newly hired principal has had experience in another Alabama system, the principal can only be hired as a one year probationary principal according to the law. It is the responsibility of the superintendent to evaluate the principals, however, there is no requirement to evaluate probationary principals under the Act. There is also no consequence for failing to annually evaluate probationary principals. Unlike probationary principals, contract principals must be evaluated annually using the evaluation instrument approved by the State Department of Education. If the contract principal is not properly evaluated at any point, his contract shall be extended one year for every year the evaluation is not completed, up to a maximum of three years. All contract principals must be evaluated each year. Without an evaluation, a year extension must be given for every year not evaluated. An employing board may cancel the contract of a contract principal for cause at any time for any of the following reasons: immorality, insubordination, neglect of duty, conviction of a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude, failure to fulfill the duties and responsibilities imposed upon principals by this code, willful failure to comply with board policy, a justifiable decrease in the number of positions due to decreased enrollment or decreased funding, failure to maintain his or her certificate in a current status, other good and just cause, incompetency, and failure to perform duties in a satisfactory manner.
Supervision plays a large role in the day to day operations of the school. Principals must ensure the buildings are safe and free from harmful situations. Holding all employees and staff members responsible for their delegation is an absolute in supervision. There is no way possible a principal can physically oversee students and potential situations. It is necessary that a principal sets the expectation of how, when and where each employee supports in supervision as described in Board policy. Having dependable and accountable employees help to make the responsibility of a principal less taxing. Well prepared teachers allow for less discipline and more learning. As the instructional leader, the principal sets the expectation for being well prepared and well versed in the standards and curriculum. The principal supports teachers in becoming well versed in management, instruction, communication and other areas pertinent to the vision of the school. The principal is primarily in charge of evaluating all teachers. The principal must also work with teachers in order to improve in “areas of concern”.
Continuous improvement should reflect the needs of the school based upon assessments and other data. An instructional leader spends the majority of their time in the classrooms, collecting data and supporting instruction. The instructional leader should be an effective use of resources. It isn’t sufficient for principals to just know their faculty’s strengths and weaknesses. If specific resources can benefit the staff, the principal should be ready and prepared to provide them. They should also clearly recognize that teachers thrive on being appreciated and acknowledged for good performance. Principals must have strong communication skills. Of course, instructional principals should be excellent communicators. Interpersonal or people skills are crucial to the success of a principal. They must be able to communicate their beliefs pertaining to education, including the conviction that every student is capable of learning. These skills inspire trust, spark motivation and empower teachers and students. Additionally, instructional leaders must serve as an instructional resource. Teachers rely on principals and other administration officials to be sources of information related to effective instructional practices and current trends in education. Instructional leaders should be tuned in to all of the pertinent issues and current events related to curriculum, effective assessment, and pedagogical strategies. Lastly, good principals should be a positive, vibrant and visible presence in the school. Modeling behaviors of learning, focusing on learning objectives, and leading by example are crucial to the success of an instructional principal. In addition to these four qualities, a successful instructional principal should also have excellent planning and observation skills as well as proficiency in research and evaluation of both staff and student performance. Principals, like teachers, spend hours after school, planning, preparing, documenting, organizing and problem-solving. Their job responsibilities are critical to the success of the school.
Finances reflect the earnings and expenditures of the school. Some may think a school does not have bills to pay, but unfortunately, they do, power, water, Xerox copies, toilet paper, cleaning supplies, wax and stripper, yard maintenance, etc. This responsibility takes knowledge in what will profit the school most but also weighing in on the needs of the maintenance of the school.

A Note from the Superintendent of Education
I have Thanksgiving on my mind since the schools had their annual Thanksgiving meal this week. Thanks so much to the Central Cafeteria staff that began working a week in advance to have everything just right for this meal and the guests who come to visit. In reality, Thanksgiving should be every day. Sometimes we take for granted things that we are thankful for but quite often, we show thankfulness rather than verbally mentioning it.
Speaking of verbally expressing thankfulness, it is not often that the Superintendent’s office gets a call from parents expressing how much they appreciate the school system and what the school system has meant to them and their children. I can attest, calls like this do happen and I cannot express to you how meaningful the positivity is to hear when those calls occur. I would like to let this article reflect this phone call and the gratitude shown to the school system by this single mom.
A couple of months ago, a parent calls and tells me who she is and begins sharing with me how upset she gets when others begin downing the school system. She proceeds to remind me of how the school system has supported her children through special needs, regular classes and college courses. As the conversation continues, she shares that one child was in pre-K classes and needed supports through speech and other special supports. Because the child received interventions early, these supports were not needed for a long period of time. She continues on as her children progress through elementary school and how they worked hard to earn good grades. But the accolades did not stop there. She continues through middle and high school as well when she mentions her children both being on the Advanced Diploma, working and participating in dual enrollment classes. She discussed her oldest child graduating and how he has worked and is doing well in college along with holding down a job.
Her youngest has been participating in college activities and classes since the summer prior to his ninth grade year. This student was asked to participate in the summer STEM camp held at CACC. I called the mom and explained the opportunity for STEM camp and thought her child would be an excellent candidate. Actually, several students were recommended by me to participate and other participated as well. Mom allowed her son to participate and from that experience on, other opportunities opened up for her child through dual enrollment. One opportunity was being contacted by one of the deans on the Alexander City Campus asking her son to participate in a project competition called Project MFG, Make, Focus, Grow, Shaping the Next Generation of American Manufacturing. This student was one of three students selected for the competition and he happened to be the only dual enrollment student, a Central High School, Coosa County student. For this recognition, this dual enrollment high school student from the Coosa County School System won $500 and a scholarship from Auburn University. Additional recognition includes letters of Academic Achievement for being named to the President’s List for Central Alabama Community College. This student is also pictured on the MFG website showing off his welding skills gained through dual enrollment. The Coosa County School System is so proud of one of our many STAR students, Cody Bussie, for all he has accomplished in high school. Just think he will be graduating in May and still has time to accomplish even more. Attached, you will find a picture of the Project MFG website featuring Central High School’s Cody Bussie, Coosa County’s own award winning dual enrollment student in welding attire.
Not only do I want to express thankfulness to Cody for helping the Coosa County School System shine in areas of strength for him but I also want to show thankfulness to his mom, Shana Bussie, for stepping up and sharing with others what the Coosa County School System has to offer. It would be so easy for everyone to listen to negativity and even chime in at times but Shana was bold enough to share what truly happened in the Coosa County School System the past 15 years with her children, bold enough to call the superintendent’s office and share the positive things. I hope they do not mind me using this story to share with everyone but this story needed to be told and at a time of thankfulness, I believe this was the perfect time.
Once again, as the Instructional Leader of the Coosa County School System, with the support of all stakeholders: administrators, faculty, staff, students, businesses and community, I will promote an environment that supports the diverse needs of all students. This will include, but not be limited to, effectively planning for system improvements by collecting, analyzing and interpreting data, problem-solving, and allocating resources to address the most critical needs identified. Additionally, I will seek supports to enhance the unique and diverse characteristics of the county by creating and sustaining opportunities for more school-community relations. I am proud to call Coosa County my home and especially proud to lead the efforts in moving the Coosa County School System forward. Stay tuned…",0.0,"Coosa County Students are Better than Yours!!

She proceeds to remind me of how the school system has supported her children through special needs, regular classes and college courses. As the conversation continues, she shares that one child was in pre-K classes and needed supports through speech and other special supports. Because the child received interventions early, these supports were not needed for a long period of time. She continues on as her children progress through elementary school and how they worked hard to earn good grades. But the accolades did not stop there. She continues through middle and high school as well when she mentions her children both being on the Advanced Diploma, working and participating in dual enrollment classes. She discussed her oldest child graduating and how he has worked and is doing well in college along with holding down a job.
Her youngest has been participating in college activities and classes since the summer prior to his ninth grade year. This student was asked to participate in the summer STEM camp held at CACC. I called the mom and explained the opportunity for STEM camp and thought her child would be an excellent candidate. Actually, several students were recommended by me to participate and other participated as well. Mom allowed her son to participate and from that experience on, other opportunities opened up for her child through dual enrollment. One opportunity was being contacted by one of the deans on the Alexander City Campus asking her son to participate in a project competition called Project MFG, Make, Focus, Grow, Shaping the Next Generation of American Manufacturing. This student was one of three students selected for the competition and he happened to be the only dual enrollment student, a Central High School, Coosa County student. For this recognition, this dual enrollment high school student from the Coosa County School System won $500 and a scholarship from Auburn University. Additional recognition includes letters of Academic Achievement for being named to the President’s List for Central Alabama Community College. This student is also pictured on the MFG website showing off his welding skills gained through dual enrollment. The Coosa County School System is so proud of one of our many STAR students, Cody Bussie, for all he has accomplished in high school. Just think he will be graduating in May and still has time to accomplish even more. Attached, you will find a picture of the Project MFG website featuring Central High School’s Cody Bussie, Coosa County’s own award winning dual enrollment student in welding attire.
Not only do I want to express thankfulness to Cody for helping the Coosa County School System shine in areas of strength for him but I also want to show thankfulness to his mom, Shana Bussie, for stepping up and sharing with others what the Coosa County School System has to offer. It would be so easy for everyone to listen to negativity and even chime in at times but Shana was bold enough to share what truly happened in the Coosa County School System the past 15 years with her children, bold enough to call the superintendent’s office and share the positive things. I hope they do not mind me using this story to share with everyone but this story needed to be told and at a time of thankfulness, I believe this was the perfect time.
Once again, as the Instructional Leader of the Coosa County School System, with the support of all stakeholders: administrators, faculty, staff, students, businesses and community, I will promote an environment that supports the diverse needs of all students. This will include, but not be limited to, effectively planning for system improvements by collecting, analyzing and interpreting data, problem-solving, and allocating resources to address the most critical needs identified. Additionally, I will seek supports to enhance the unique and diverse characteristics of the county by creating and sustaining opportunities for more school-community relations. I am proud to call Coosa County my home and especially proud to lead the efforts in moving the Coosa County School System forward.

I have Thanksgiving on my mind since the schools had their annual Thanksgiving meal this week. Thanks so much to the Central Cafeteria staff that began working a week in advance to have everything just right for this meal and the guests who come to visit. In reality, Thanksgiving should be every day. Sometimes we take for granted things that we are thankful for but quite often, we show thankfulness rather than verbally mentioning it.
Speaking of verbally expressing thankfulness, it is not often that the Superintendent’s office gets a call from parents expressing how much they appreciate the school system and what the school system has meant to them and their children. I can attest, calls like this do happen and I cannot express to you how meaningful the positivity is to hear when those calls occur.

I hope everyone is faring well with the cold wintery blast we have had this week. I heard someone say, “only in Alabama can you experience spring, summer, winter and fall all in one day”. I think we all can attest to that statement. If this is a sign of what the winter will bring, we had better get prepared.
In the last article, I focused on Veterans Day but today I would like to focus on community support. This past Friday, not only did the schools celebrate our veterans but we also supported the students at Central High School with many thanks to the Children’s Policy Council. A job fair has been held the past few years with the support of the Children’s Policy Council headed up by professional “volunteer”, Marty Rittmann. Mrs. Rittmann, a former teacher in the Coosa County School System, leads the Children’s Policy Council.
Some of you may have never heard of the Children’s Policy Council but is an Alabama Law Section 26-24-34 (Acts 1990, No. 90-674, p. 1304, §17; Act 2000-612, p. 1226, §1; §12-15-134; amended and renumbered by Act 2008-277, p. 441, §28; Act 2015-160, §1.) plays a very important role in data collection of children per county. The County Children’s Policy Council reviews the needs of children in the county and how local agencies and departments can work together more efficiently and effectively to serve the children in their area. Local teams submit an annual report to the Department of Children's Affairs by July 1 of each year on local services provided to children, local needs of children, and recommendations of the county children's policy council based on data from the previous fiscal year ending September 30. The local resource guides are used by the State Children's Policy Council in compiling a state resource guide which is distributed to the general public and to agencies and organizations serving children.
The project for Coosa County the past few years has focused on a job fair for Central High School students. Different agencies, such as Head Start, Altapointe, Coosa County School System, SAFE, United Way and the local Juvenile Judicial System, just to name a few, work together to bring in not only job resources but higher education options as well. These entities showcase what they have to offer students and in-turn, the students collect information and resources of interest, seeking options for future opportunities. Events like this cannot be carried out without the partnership of others. The school system could never create an event like this without hours of planning, extra personnel, and time getting things together. I cannot express the appreciation the school system has for this TEAM effort that occurs in COOSA COUNTY. This is what makes community support so great for the school system. As the Superintendent of Coosa County Schools, I have felt that it is important to become a part of each community in the county by participating in as many events as possible over the past years. As I have mentioned in a couple of previous articles, a school system is only as strong as it’s community, and with only one feeder pattern in the county, the school system depends upon many services the county can provide the school system.
Again, this group effort that has occurred in Coosa County over the past few years is a testament to the commitment the citizens and resources in and around Coosa County have toward the school system. The support shown is overwhelming and with the small staff in the school system, an event like this would not be possible without the support. Thanks to all!

I would like to begin this article thanking the veterans of Coosa County. I attended the Town of Rockford’s celebration last Saturday. It was such an honor to not only be among five World War II Coosa Countians, but also many other veterans who made sacrifices for our country. The depth of sacrifice truly cannot be measured. I wonder if many of us truly think about ALL of the sacrifices that are made in order to serve our wonderful country. Many have lost time with families; families that may not have been the same once the time served had ended. Parents passed away. Spouses no longer were spouses. Children became young adults. Siblings may not have that close knit connection as before. Communities changed. Neighbors moved away. Many things changed during the time of sacrifice.
And then there is the veteran; aged, with possible physical, emotional, mental and spiritual differences trying to put life together where they let off before the sacrifices began. Some were able to put life back together as they never left, but others, although back in the saddle at home, the sacrifices continued because things were not the same, they were not the same. Some took a little time to become the same and, yet others never were the same. The depth of the word sacrifice really did not strike me until I spoke with Mr. Joseph McKinney this past year about his time in the service. He and his wife Betty live here in Coosa County but his children live in several places across the United States, thanks to his career in the service. As a child of a close-knit family, this tugs at my heart-strings. Not that having children living across the United States is a bad thing at all, but because so much is missed out on as the family grows and establishes roots in other areas. I feel that the sacrifice of service life continues.
My father served time in the Army but not during a time of war or as a career military person. I often think of how my life would have been different had he made a career out of the service. My sisters and I may have had lives that look totally different than our lives today. The sacrifices I have made as an educator may not have been sacrifices I would have made had my family been a military family. I am thankful for the stories my father has shared with our family about his time in the military but I am also thankful for the stories the veterans of Coosa County are able to share with their families and others, especially during a special time of year when we honor the men and women who have served.
Our plans in life may have been very different, but the appointment of our paths crossing was definitely purposed, if just for an introduction. Share your stories with family and friends. Leave a legacy that reflects a story of sacrifices, a labor of love and a tribute to the best country in the world. Today, Central Elementary will celebrate the veterans of Coosa County and surrounding areas. We would love to have all veterans who are able to attend the program in the Central High School gym beginning at 9:00.

This will include, but not be limited to, effectively planning for system improvements by collecting, analyzing and interpreting data, problem-solving, and allocating resources to address the most critical needs identified. Additionally, I will seek supports to enhance the unique and diverse characteristics of the county by creating and sustaining opportunities for more school-community relations. I am proud to call Coosa County my home and especially proud to lead the efforts in moving the Coosa County School System forward. Stay tuned…",2019-11-13 16:37:27,,

A Note from the Superintendent of Education
I would like to begin this article thanking the veterans of Coosa County. I attended the Town of Rockford’s celebration last Saturday. It was such an honor to not only be among five World War II Coosa Countians, but also many other veterans who made sacrifices for our country. The depth of sacrifice truly cannot be measured. I wonder if many of us truly think about ALL of the sacrifices that are made in order to serve our wonderful country. Many have lost time with families; families that may not have been the same once the time served had ended. Parents passed away. Spouses no longer were spouses. Children became young adults. Siblings may not have that close knit connection as before. Communities changed. Neighbors moved away. Many things changed during the time of sacrifice.
And then there is the veteran; aged, with possible physical, emotional, mental and spiritual differences trying to put life together where they let off before the sacrifices began. Some were able to put life back together as they never left, but others, although back in the saddle at home, the sacrifices continued because things were not the same, they were not the same. Some took a little time to become the same and, yet others never were the same. The depth of the word sacrifice really did not strike me until I spoke with Mr. Joseph McKinney this past year about his time in the service. He and his wife Betty live here in Coosa County but his children live in several places across the United States, thanks to his career in the service. As a child of a close-knit family, this tugs at my heart-strings. Not that having children living across the United States is a bad thing at all, but because so much is missed out on as the family grows and establishes roots in other areas. I feel that the sacrifice of service life continues.
My father served time in the Army but not during a time of war or as a career military person. I often think of how my life would have been different had he made a career out of the service. My sisters and I may have had lives that look totally different than our lives today. The sacrifices I have made as an educator may not have been sacrifices I would have made had my family been a military family. I am thankful for the stories my father has shared with our family about his time in the military but I am also thankful for the stories the veterans of Coosa County are able to share with their families and others, especially during a special time of year when we honor the men and women who have served.
Our plans in life may have been very different, but the appointment of our paths crossing was definitely purposed, if just for an introduction. Share your stories with family and friends. Leave a legacy that reflects a story of sacrifices, a labor of love and a tribute to the best country in the world. Today, Central Elementary will celebrate the veterans of Coosa County and surrounding areas. We would love to have all veterans who are able to attend the program in the Central High School gym beginning at 9:00.
Once again, as the Instructional Leader of the Coosa County School System, with the support of all stakeholders: administrators, faculty, staff, students, businesses and community, I will promote an environment that supports the diverse needs of all students. This will include, but not be limited to, effectively planning for system improvements by collecting, analyzing and interpreting data, problem-solving, and allocating resources to address the most critical needs identified. Additionally, I will seek supports to enhance the unique and diverse characteristics of the county by creating and sustaining opportunities for more school-community relations. I am proud to call Coosa County my home and especially proud to lead the efforts in moving the Coosa County School System forward. Stay tuned…",0.0,"Please read and share!

Leave a legacy that reflects a story of sacrifices, a labor of love and a tribute to the best country in the world. Today, Central Elementary will celebrate the veterans of Coosa County and surrounding areas. We would love to have all veterans who are able to attend the program in the Central High School gym beginning at 9:00.
Once again, as the Instructional Leader of the Coosa County School System, with the support of all stakeholders: administrators, faculty, staff, students, businesses and community, I will promote an environment that supports the diverse needs of all students. This will include, but not be limited to, effectively planning for system improvements by collecting, analyzing and interpreting data, problem-solving, and allocating resources to address the most critical needs identified. Additionally, I will seek supports to enhance the unique and diverse characteristics of the county by creating and sustaining opportunities for more school-community relations. I am proud to call Coosa County my home and especially proud to lead the efforts in moving the Coosa County School System forward.

I would like to begin this article thanking the veterans of Coosa County. I attended the Town of Rockford’s celebration last Saturday. It was such an honor to not only be among five World War II Coosa Countians, but also many other veterans who made sacrifices for our country. The depth of sacrifice truly cannot be measured. I wonder if many of us truly think about ALL of the sacrifices that are made in order to serve our wonderful country. Many have lost time with families; families that may not have been the same once the time served had ended. Parents passed away. Spouses no longer were spouses. Children became young adults. Siblings may not have that close knit connection as before. Communities changed. Neighbors moved away. Many things changed during the time of sacrifice.
And then there is the veteran; aged, with possible physical, emotional, mental and spiritual differences trying to put life together where they let off before the sacrifices began. Some were able to put life back together as they never left, but others, although back in the saddle at home, the sacrifices continued because things were not the same, they were not the same. Some took a little time to become the same and, yet others never were the same. The depth of the word sacrifice really did not strike me until I spoke with Mr. Joseph McKinney this past year about his time in the service. He and his wife Betty live here in Coosa County but his children live in several places across the United States, thanks to his career in the service. As a child of a close-knit family, this tugs at my heart-strings. Not that having children living across the United States is a bad thing at all, but because so much is missed out on as the family grows and establishes roots in other areas. I feel that the sacrifice of service life continues.
My father served time in the Army but not during a time of war or as a career military person. I often think of how my life would have been different had he made a career out of the service. My sisters and I may have had lives that look totally different than our lives today. The sacrifices I have made as an educator may not have been sacrifices I would have made had my family been a military family. I am thankful for the stories my father has shared with our family about his time in the military but I am also thankful for the stories the veterans of Coosa County are able to share with their families and others, especially during a special time of year when we honor the men and women who have served.

A Note from the Superintendent of Education
If you are in education or know anything about Halloween week in a school setting, you know this can be a challenging week, especially for elementary teachers. Many students begin bringing and eating candy throughout the week due to all of the outside festivities they attend. There is nothing like a “sweet” challenge during school week. However, our teachers survived, as they always do, and students were instructed. I’m sure there will be some review time built in for next week just to ensure the students understood the information.
I read an article this week about the six takeaways from Alabama’s school report cards. Based on the article, Alabama is showing improvement. That is a good sign. For Coosa County, we definitely gained in the area of academic growth. This is an exceptional sign. Some students in the system are not performing at grade level, but the growth that is reflected is encouraging for our system. I have always been a believer in meeting the student where they are and moving them forward. With standards being rigorous, it has been difficult to see how much students are moving toward grade level because growth has not been a part of the report card until recently. With the growth measure, students who may not be performing at grade level reflect the hard work that is put into instruction on a daily basis by the teachers.
In the past, the elementary school used a visual to place student names on various colored sticky notes indicating as to where the proficiency was for the student who entered a grade level at the beginning of the school year. For each benchmark session, the student’s sticky note was moved according to the growth shown in the visual chart. As teachers, the conversation was always “WOW, I wish everyone could see the level where this child entered my classroom and how they have grown”. Now, the hard work is definitely reflected in the reports for the state. Neither the instruction nor struggles end, but I feel teachers can have more gratification through the growth model addition. As teachers, we all appreciate confirmation of the hard work that is put in to each day. One of my favorite quotes is from a Dr. Seuss book. “And will you succeed? Yes, you will indeed, ninety-eight and three fourths percent guaranteed.” The next portion of the book says “KID, YOU’LL MOVE MOUNTAINS!” I would like to add “TEACHERS, YOU MOVE MOUNTAINS DAY AFTER DAY SO THE STUDENTS CAN SUCCEED NINETY-EIGHT AND THREE FOURTHS PERCENT GUARANTEED!” With an overall county academic growth of 80.73%, gaps are closing but of course there is more to work to be done.
The ACT scores were released this past week. This past year, 48 students were tested with an overall composite of 17.1 reported for the Coosa County School District. The state composite score for 2019 was 18.9. The five-year trend for Coosa County reflects a variance from 15.9 to 17.2. While the state five-year trend has been steady at 19.1 until the drop this year. All Coosa County eleventh grade students are tested in the spring on ACT plus writing. Students planning to attend college take advantage of other national testing days and work to improve scores in English, Mathematics, Reading and Science. ACT has recently changed policy to include students taking only one area on the assessment, if desired. This will be a great opportunity for students to focus on one area of improvement at a time. Benchmark for each area includes English Composition: 18, Mathematics: 22, Reading: 22, and Science: 23. I look forward to seeing the results of this change for our students.

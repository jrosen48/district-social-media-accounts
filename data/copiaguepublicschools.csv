It may have been cloudy skies and heavy rain, but the weather didn’t dampen the mood of the students and staff at Copiague School District, who were still in good spirits as they entered their respective buildings for the first day of school on Sept. 10.

Faculty, staff and administrators were on hand to welcome students back to their buildings as the buses pulled into the circle. Loaded with back-to-school supplies and ready to kick off a new school year, students made their way to their classrooms and met their new teachers. Incoming kindergartners and sixth graders had the opportunity to explore their new buildings and navigate the hallways.

Many students were happy to reconnect with old friends and classmates. Whether learning in-person or remotely, students settled back into a routine by the end of the school day.",0.0,"Copiague Public Schools added 22 new photos.

The parades celebrated the many successes of the Copiague students, while also giving them a chance to have a proper send-off for the summer months.

Teachers and administrators, dressed in blue and white and showing off their school pride, lined the sidewalks of their respective schools. As the teachers were waving, cheering and holding signs, the cars filled with students lined up down the street to catch a glimpse of their teachers.

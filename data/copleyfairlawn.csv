The Copley Engineering Team worked with Weaver ProPak, a non-profit organization, to create a system of devices to assist employees with disabilities in their assembly of brackets and bolts. The B.T.A.S. (Bracket Tightening Assembly System) allows almost every employee at Weaver ProPak to assemble brackets with less fatigue and stress. In addition, the system allows each bracket to be completed seconds faster, ultimately enabling the employees with disabilities at Weaver ProPak to gain employment.

Happy Friday Everyone. If anyone wonders how our animal friends from the Animal Care and Science Program (@ Copley HS) are doing -by the looks of these photos -they are doing just fine! Poof the Chinchilla is under the care of Madison Miller. Bean and Oliver (Kitties) are with Ashley Payton, and Poppy the Hedgehog is with Rachel Roberts. As well as being cared for (and maybe pampered a bit) the animals help the students by providing an opportunity for continued hands on learning. Program teacher Rachel McClenaghan still oversees the general care for the animals and is providing lessons to the students that allows them to continue their studies in the field. Thanks for all the good work students!!",0.0,"Four Cities Compact

Students receiving Gold Keys, Silver Keys, Honorable Mentions, or American Voices & Visions Nominations are celebrated within their communities through local exhibitions and ceremonies. Gold Key works are then judged nationally by an impressive panel of creative–industry experts to receive National Medals, including Gold Medals, Silver Medals, American Voices & Visions Medals, Gold Medal and Silver with Distinction Portfolio Medals, and Special Achievement Awards.

As thanks in these unique times, weekly we are spotlighting a community member for their hardwork. This week’s Community Spotlight is an educator from Arrowhead Elementary (Copley-Fairlawn City Schools) in Copley, OH. First grade teacher, Jesse Smith, has been going above and beyond for his students.

Some of the wonderful things Mr. Smith is doing for his “classroom” include daily greetings, weekly motivational video messages, read-alongs with book page screenshots, and personal shout-outs to students staying on track with remote learning.

Thank you, Mr. Smith! For this commitment and dedication, we are gifting the Smith family a $100 gift card to Buehler's. Keep up the great work!",5.0,"Congratulations Mr. Smith.

A new addition that will be more conducive to the care Emma will need when she returns home is being built with donated materials and labor. Students and teacher Chris Kallai were even over volunteering on the project last weekend before braving the weather this week to keep the project moving.

Today is National Law Enforcement Day and the perfect time for a shout out to the Compact's Criminal Science Technology Program (@Barberton HS) and Teacher Jeremy Milford. The program provides students opportunity to learn about and experience various aspects of the career field while still in high school. Program graduates move on to a wide variety of jobs related to the field including law enforcement, security, forensic sciences, dispatch, and corrections just to name a few. The program is also a good start for students who want to enlist in the military after graduation especially if they want to be in the Military Police. With so many directions to branch off into after high school it's no wonder the program continues to be one of the Compact's most popular options.",0.0,"Four Cities Compact is feeling proud.

Dr. Owen learned about our program and the skills our students are learning. Dr. Owen offered to guest speak for our students and also offered to show our students around his veterinary clinic and maybe even watch a surgery. If you are looking for a Veterinarian consider Dr. Owen at his new clinic, Yellow Creek Animal Hospital located at 799 Wye Rd. Thank you Dr. Owen",2019-12-18 15:20:11,,

An update on the Four Cities Compact's brand new Animal Care and Science Program (@Copley HS).

The Doggie Daycare ""Copley Barks"" has been a big success! Every day CHS staff members are dropping off dogs which are providing opportunities for the students to learn and interact with a variety of different canines. There are dog baths, simple grooming, exercise and social interaction periods that often lead to some pooped out pooches at the end of the day!

In addition to this the lab continues to grow and develop. New small animals -kitties- chinchillas- rabbit- guinea pigs are there with more to be added.

At the Compact's recent Showcase to sophomore students teacher Rachel McClenaghan and WHS Sr (and CTE Student of the Month) Sami Shaffer talked about the program and gave info to interested students.

All soccer athletes in grades 7-12 should report to the first practice on August 24th from 700-7:30 am at the varsity field behind the elementary school. There will be no physical practice that morning. This will be an opportunity to pass out paperwork and to look at the numbers. Having all soccer players present that morning will give us a better idea of how many athletes we have to work with. If the numbers don't warrant a modified boys team, there is the possibility we could again combine with the girls to form a modified squad. Remember to try to schedule physicals for your children. A waiver has been granted to schools regarding physicals. Your child must have had a physical in the 18 - 19 or 19-20 school year.

From our district website:

On Thursday, April 30 at 11 a.m., the Regional Food Bank of Northeastern NY will sponsor a drive-thru Food Pantry at the Corinth Elementary School for all families in need. A drive-thru pantry is a safe way to provide food to households struggling to access sufficient amounts of healthy foods during the pandemic.

“This effort complements the wonderful work already being done through food pantries and the School Food Service feeding efforts,” says Susan Lintner from the Regional Food Bank.

This no-contact, no-cost, food distribution event was set up to provide residents with an additional opportunity to receive fresh produce, dairy, and frozen meats along with non-perishable items.

Hi friends, we thought it'd be fun to show how much we appreciate our CES teachers by making a special post for them to see Monday. On Monday, we will make a special Teacher Appreciation Day post for parents and students to comment on. Please post a picture of your child holding up a thank you sign or picture for his/her teacher to see. It'd be great to see pictures saying:
Thank you for...
I appreciate you because..
I am glad you are my teacher because....
Thank you & please share!",2020-04-29 17:56:55,,

Final update from the NYS Championships:
First a little perspective. There were over 10,000 student athletes competing in the sport of wrestling this year. Only 5% make it to the state championship tournament. Or, put another way, the competitors are among the top 16 athletes in their weight class in the entire state of New York.￼￼￼ It takes a lot of hard work, dedication, perseverance, blood, sweat and tears to get there.￼ So, kudos to our two competitors- Johnathan Freebern and Alec Richards.
John ended up going 1-2, losing only to the third place and eighth place wrestlers in a highly competitive weight class. ￼￼
Alec went 4-2 and took fifth place! His only losses were to the state champ and the third place wrestler. What a great tournament for these two athletes. And what a great year for the whole Tomahawk team!",4.0,"Congratulations to Johnathan, Alec and all of our Wrestling Coaches on a phenomenal season!

COVID-19 UPDATE: The Corinth School District was notified today of one student at Corinth Elementary School testing positive for COVID-19. This student had not been present since the second week of school so no one was quarantined.

The state does not require Mississippi schools to inform the public when teachers and students test positive for COVID-19. The CSD has made the decision to continue to keep reporting this information to you. Please keep in mind that other schools not making public announcements doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt have positive cases.

The District remains in contact with the Mississippi State Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control to help ensure that we are creating as safe a learning environment as possible.

COVID 19 Statement #5
CAMBRIDGE AICE EXAMS CANCELED
MARCH 24, 2020
The Covid-19 outbreak is changing rapidly in countries around the globe, including and especially in the United States. Many countries have decided to extend school closures into May and June, making it impossible to hold examinations. Cambridge has made the difficult decision not to administer the international paper-based examinations in the May/June 2020 series in schools in any country.

All certificates from Cambridge International, including the Cambridge AICE Diploma, will be awarded to qualified candidates. Every entry for the May/June series will receive a grade, and if they have fulfilled the requirements, students can still receive the Cambridge AICE Diploma. Cambridge will release further guidance on how students will receive these grades later this week.

The Corinth School District will share this information as soon as Cambridge makes it available.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1852335381567545&id=384914964976268,,0.0,"CORINTH SCHOOL DISTRICT

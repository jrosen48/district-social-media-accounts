The Cornell School District is happy to announce the continuation of the Cornell School District’s afterschool PRIDE program, but now in a virtual setting! This program is open for all students in grades 3-8, and we hope this program can provide some fun, enriching activities that kids can do for fun when time allows.

The Cornell School District knows that online, remote learning can be difficult. The goal of moving the PRIDE program to a virtual setting isn’t to, “add more to your plate.” The goal is to provide some engaging and fun activities that students can do at night, or when the weather is bad, and is also a way to continue a sense of normalcy for your children. We wish we could open this up to all students, but unfortunately grant guidelines only allow this to be available for students in grades 3-8. Parents, please be on the lookout in the near future for activities that PRIDE teachers have put together! The program officially will restart on Monday, April 27!

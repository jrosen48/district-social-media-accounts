It takes knowledge of words and courage to stand in front of the school to spell fancy words. We are SO proud of each and every one of you!
üêù
‚¨áÔ∏èDrop your favorite word. The one that looks cool when you doodle or makes you feel good when you say it. Words have power so let‚Äôs share some to inspire, create a laugh or be reminded we are made for this moment. (Keep it clean, influencers, for our school community. We love when our young, new Instagram users participate on the page, too.)

However, here's where I ask you for something more. We want to make sure that we are continually improving our CAPTO events, so taking the following survey would help us SO much! If you want your voice heard, you have to say something! It's relatively quick and painless, so I hope you'll consider. We especially want to hear from people who did NOT come to our Holiday Breakfast so we know why and how we might change that.

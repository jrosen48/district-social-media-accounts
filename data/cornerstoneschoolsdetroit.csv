Last night a friend sent me a link to a beautiful version of a long popular hymn…amazingly produced and sung through cell phones. It consists of 31 voices from Nashville’s Studio Singers using their own cell phones. If you look carefully you will even see one of the singers wearing a Motown shirt. This recording was produced when everyone was at home as a result of the Mayor of Nashville issuing a Safer at Home Order....a stay at home Order similar to our situation in Michigan.

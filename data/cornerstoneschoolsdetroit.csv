It consists of 31 voices from Nashville’s Studio Singers using their own cell phones. If you look carefully you will even see one of the singers wearing a Motown shirt. This recording was produced when everyone was at home as a result of the Mayor of Nashville issuing a Safer at Home Order....a stay at home Order similar to our situation in Michigan. The Nashville singers wanted to record and lift their collective voices to share a message of hope and encouragement to all people during these challenging days. It is well they did so, and I share their hope and encouragement with you. I hope you enjoy it as I did last night. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDIJz6zzHNU

I was delighted by the response to yesterday's posting of Shakespeare's Sonnet 116, and it has led me to undertake what follows. When I was a child in the 1940s, my mother would cut up slices of fruit for me (there wasn't much) and as she put it in front of me she would say: ""An apple a day keeps the doctor away."" How about, “A sonnet a day keeps the doctor away”? So...here we go: Sonnet 1",0.0,"Perhaps some students would be interested in Shakespeare’s sonnets!

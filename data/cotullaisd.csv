On behalf of the faculty and staff of Encinal Elementary, we would like to wish Mrs. Louisa Franklin a great, well deserved retirement!

No one has ever worked so hard for our little school, all the long hours spent after school didn’t go unnoticed. There are no words of gratitude we can say to your dedication and commitment to our school.

We will miss you tremendously, but we know this is your year to sit back and relax.

Changes have been made and addressed by the UIL regarding sports/band physicals for the upcoming 2020-2021 school year:

ALL students/parents must complete the Medical History portion of the Pre-Participation Physical Exam Form return it to the Athletic Trainer. If any of Questions 1-6 are answered ""YES,"" then the student will need a new physical from their Family Doctor or Primary Care Physician. Forms will be compared to the previous year to maintain accuracy. If the student has a previous physical on file, and answers “NO” on Questions 1-6, they will NOT be required to get a new physical for this year.

The Updated UIL Form must be used for the Physical Exam.
Make sure to take it to your Doctor’s Office.

Good morning Cotulla ISD! I know that your body may not be feeling like its usual self from sitting at the computer desk or couch for too long. I created a list of my favorite stretches to do when my neck, shoulders, or back feel stiff. Click on the link to view them in your web browser with instructional videos, or save these pictures to your phone. Don't forget to get moving a little throughout the day. Feel free to reach out to me if you need any recommendations, elizabeth.lutz@cotullaisd.net.

At this time, it has been declared by the County Commissioners Court that schools are not to be copying packets. Therefore, packets will discontinue until further notice.

I know this is difficult on some. But, this time is difficult for all of us. We must come together as one community family to protect each other, as well as ourselves. Online instruction and curbside meal service will continue. We will collect packets at a later date.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation as we weather this virus storm. We will come out on the other side of this storm with the sun shining bright and be strong because of it.

Please pray for the leadership at the federal, state, and local levels during this difficult time.

It is the intention of the District to have this available either Friday afternoon or Monday.

The CISD Board of Trustees also adopted a resolution regarding the student instruction during the COVID-19 Pandemic. A copy of the resolution is attached for everyone to review.

Please be checking the District's website and Facebook Page for further information. We are rowing through uncharted waters, as is every district. Thank you for your patience.",2020-03-25 19:10:52,,

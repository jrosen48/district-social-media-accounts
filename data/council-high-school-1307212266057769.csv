Hello everyone!

Since doing school at home was a new experience for many of us, I thought it might be fun to make a video of what we are thankful for during this pandemic. Maybe it's that you get to spend more time with your family or you are thankful that through online school, you have become more responsible. When you have decided what you are thankful for, please wear something that signifies you are a Council Lumberjack and have someone take a video of you saying what you are thankful for during this pandemic and why. You could take the video in front of a woodpile or something else that would give your video a Lumberjack feel. Mrs. Cook is helping me with this project and has organized that for each person who sends a video in, a tree will be planted. Please email your video to me, ieppich@csd13.org by June 12th. Have a great summer!

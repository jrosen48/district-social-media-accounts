We are so grateful for our crossing guard, Roger Bonham!! It's not an easy job. We received feedback this week from a parent who witnessed Roger save two students from potentially getting hit by a car. Roger is serious about safety and noticed a car in the left lane was not slowing down despite the light being red and him holding up his stop sign. Two boys started to run across and Roger stopped them, nearly getting hit himself. Thank you, Roger!! And thank you to all the N Broadway drivers who are patient, slow down, and respect the crosswalk! #rogerrocks",12.0,"Hoover Elementary School

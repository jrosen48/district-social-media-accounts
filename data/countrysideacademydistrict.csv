ALL HOGS HAVE SOLD. Thank you to all!

Due to the cancellation of the Berrien County Youth Fair, our FFA students, who have been raising hogs since they were farrowed on our campus in early February, now need a new outlet for selling the hogs. If you wish to purchase a hog, they will be sold for $250 per hog; but the buyer would be responsible for paying the processing fee. The processing fee is approximately $1/lb of the cut weight. Our best estimate would put the processing fee at an additional $170 (a grand total of around $420). If you would like to choose your own processor, we would be happy to transport the animal to your place of choice. All buyers will be responsible for picking up their meat. If you‚Äôre interested in purchasing a hog, feel free to leave a comment below, or contact Steve Rigoni at srigoni@countrysideacademy.org.

We asked her:
What was it like going through the LMC nursing program?

‚ÄúIt's a journey that is for sure. A lot is expected of you, and with good reason, too. People's lives are going to be in your hands.

It was great to see so many of our families today! Our staff continues to miss our Cougars and it was great to get the chance to connect, even if it was just from outside your vehicle. We served 4,438 breakfasts and 4,438 lunches today, as every child 18 yrs old and younger were given 7 days worth of breakfast, lunch, and milk.

These grab-and-go meals will be available again next Wednesday. Please stay tuned as there will be changes made to the schedules so that we can best serve as many families as possible. Thanks to all of the staff members that helped out!",2020-03-25 15:32:58,,

Dear Countryside Families,

As you may have seen in recent news reports, there have been three confirmed cases of Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) in southwest Michigan - two in Kalamazoo County and one in Berrien County. Other cases are being investigated. The Michigan Department of Health & Human Services (MDHHS) reports, ‚ÄúMosquito-borne diseases can cause long-term health effects in people and even death. These cases, along with confirmed cases in horses and deer in the state, stress the importance of taking precautions against mosquito bites.‚Äù

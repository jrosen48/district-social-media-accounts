We are SO grateful to the awesome boys and families from Cub Scouts Pack 655 Benton Harbor! They came out Wednesday night, in the 90 degree heat, and cleaned up Millburg's Classroom in the Woods! They pulled weeds, spread mulch, opened up the pathways and did it all with a smile.

Millburg students, and Countryside staff are in awe of their hard work and dedication. Our outdoor classroom is now ready for learning again!

If you are interested in joining this Pack, please come by for their recruitment night on September 18th, at 5:45pm, and then stay for the meeting from 6 -7:30.",2019-09-13 16:10:52,,

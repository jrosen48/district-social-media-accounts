I’m posting this to look for some feedback. I am expecting it to be a June-July season at best. That allows for very very little if any practice time. It is also my concern that it is going to cut into time for 4H/FFA kids with their projects, as well as vacations and kids schedules who have to go out of town to mom/dads for summer. Ultimately the board will be voting on this, but what is everyone’s thoughts on cancelling this season?

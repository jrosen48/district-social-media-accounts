If you would like to attend Coupeville Schools, but you are in a different school district, you have the CHOICE to attend Coupeville. Coupeville schools have many great advantages including small class sizes. Also, because we are a small school district with a very caring staff, our students develop great connections with other students, staff, and our supportive and involved community.

At our School Board meeting on Monday some of our Transition students and their teacher, Melissa Casey, came and presented to the board and the public. Our Transition Program is for special education students who are 18-21 years old and are learning job skills to prepare them for life as adults. The students did most of the talking as they explained many of the things they do during the day to help other students and staff. These students are also learning job skills for future employment. We then honored them for their hard work on campus by giving them certificates from the School Board.

We were so thankful to have our students with us at the meeting and for all they do. They are connected with the rest of the students and staff in the schools and they are an important part of our school district.

Last night our Coupeville School Board honored Danny Conlisk who served as our student School Board Member for 2018. Having a student representative is very important as we want to hear from our students as we make decisions regarding our school district. Danny did a fantastic job of not only representing the High School but also representing all schools in the district. You will see some of the staff members that played a role in Danny's life here in Coupeville Schools. For the next calendar year our School Board has selected 11th grader, Christiane (Tia) Wurzrainer and we look forward to working with her.",0.0,"Coupeville Schools is with Duane Baumann and 5 others.

On Saturday December 8th, our Elementary and Middle School Robotics teams competed in the First Lego League event in Mount Vernon. We are thankful for our Coupeville Education Foundation for supporting this event by paying for the entry and registration fees. We are also thankful for our community support through the levy which funds enrichment programs like this. This is all part of our Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, & Math (STEAM) initiative to provide hands on and activity based learning experiences for our students.

We are so thankful for our students, staff, and great community support. Go Wolves!",0.0,"Coupeville Schools

At our November 26 school board meeting Mr. Noste, our Coupeville Elementary School robotics teacher, recognized some of our fantastic 5th grade students who are giving up their lunch recess time to help younger students in robotics. These students are: Chase Anderson, Teagan Calkins, Caroline Eckardt, Kiefer Mead, Jeann Nitta, Heidi Schroeder, Frankie Tenore, Merrill Walther, Noelle Western, and Adrian Cunningham.
Mr. Noste, and principal Dave Ebersole, also highlighted some of the projects our students are doing in our robotics program. This is a program for all of our elementary students K-5 and provides hands on or applied learning opportunities for students. It is a great example of our districts work to incorporate more STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, & Math) into our student school day. This program is only possible because of our community support as it is a levy funded activity that our voters approved. Thank you to Mr. Noste, to our wonderful leadership students, and to our community for your support.",0.0,"Coupeville Schools

Coventry Parks and Recreation would like to express our utmost gratitude to Cranston Christian Fellowship for volunteering their time this past Saturday to help make Coventry a better place to live and play.

(Trash removed from the greenway, sections of the community center painted and stained, Rice Field building painted with the Coventry Rams' colors, and the Babe Ruth dugout roofs at Paine redone.)

The Department would also like to THANK Save the Bay and Tiogue Lake Association for Spring cleanup at Briar Point Beach. 139 pounds of trash were collected! The PawSox even stopped by to show their support!

Sincerely, thank you.

**Please share this good community news with your neighbors.**",2019-05-06 11:21:17,https://scontent-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-4/60027178_1281460452011033_5696433885101948928_n.mp4?_nc_cat=100&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6InN2ZV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=F22V3bwMDPwAX9rVWFu&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.xx&oh=ee51971fe27a977d573a04b914a95793&oe=5F650B4F,

BREEZY LAKE BEACH ADVISORY---SWIMMING IS PROHIBITED
The results from yesterday's test at Breezy Lake Beach came back at 770.1. A significant increase from in the 60s. RI Analytical (the testing company) said that the numbers could be skewed by both the rain and heat. Additional testing will take place on Monday.

That being said, and hearing from RIDOH, I recommend that the Town post an advisory that swimming at Breezy Lake Beach is prohibited. That the two elevated results came from samples that were taken only in the Town owned area and no where else in the lake.

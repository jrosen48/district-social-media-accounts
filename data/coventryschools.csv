Another wonderful member of the senior class #2020 is Noah Williams.

Noah is a wonderful student-athlete who provides tremendous leadership in and out of the classroom. He always goes above and beyond. His Creative Writing teacher, Mr. Jamison says, ‚ÄúI've known Noah for two years, and he's always managing to do something that surprises me. Last year, I really enjoyed hearing his insights into a novel we read about Vietnam. Later in the year, he and Malik Shaver delivered one of the best presentations of an Emily Dickinson poem in any of my classes. It was a joy to watch Noah take something so academic--a 19th century poem, no less--so seriously. This semester Noah signed up for Poetry, and his work has really progressed. I got the chance to have Noah help me with some of my fitness goals for a few weeks before everything shut down, and he really impressed me by being so serious and focused. He's just an all-around terrific human being.‚Äù

Congratulations Noah! Good luck in everything!

Coventry‚Äôs senior class of #2020 has a true gem in Lacie Hailey.

Lacie is hard working, driven and dedicated. She shows greatness every day. Her English/Poetry teacher Mr. Jamison said this, ‚ÄúLacie has literally been a fixture in my teaching life for the past two years. She's taken every class I offer and knows the ""writing tricks"" better than almost anyone. (I feel bad for her sometimes, because there were days when she had ""noun-ing clauses"" two period in a row.) She is is just so absolutely special to me. When I needed a horror story to go with the Stephen King story I had already chosen for Creative Writing, I went to Lacie, and she came up with a great companion piece by H. P. Lovecraft. That's how it's been with her since day one. She's my go-to person for eye-contact, or a laugh; she's been like a touchstone for me. Her writing has matured so much, especially her poetry. And she loves books as much as I do!‚Äù

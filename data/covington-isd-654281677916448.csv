Covington ISD is extending the Summer Feeding program through July 31, 2020. Historically, the Summer Feeding Program has ended at the end of June, however, due to recent circumstances and our understanding that many of our families are hurting due to the effects of COVID-19, we have made the decision to continue to feed our students through July. It is our sincere desire that this will be a source of help in time of need for our students and community.

Meals for the week will continue to be picked up curbside on Monday of each week (unless Monday falls on a holiday) just as we have done the last few months.

A huge thank you goes to our food service staff for their willingness to put in the extra effort so our students will have meals this summer!!

Dear CISD parents and students:

Per the Governors order today, all schools will be closed for the ‚Äúforeseeable future‚Äù. This is not the news we were hoping for, however, our current plan is to continue what we have in place regarding meals and distance learning through the last day of school.
We know that there are many unanswered questions especially regarding graduation. The staff and admin will be finalizing plans next week. I have a conference call with the commissioner early next week where we expect more guidance on what types of graduations will be allowed. We have several alternate plans in the works and will be notifying seniors as soon as possible. We also have plans for some very creative ways to honor our seniors!
Please be patient as we work through this monumental task.

Thank you for your support! We will get through this with everyone‚Äôs help!

Valedictorian Josie Kate Schaurer is the daughter of Diana and John Schaurer. Josie will attend Indiana Wesleyan University with a major in Art Education. Josie is looking forward to being an art teacher, as she envisions that “art teachers get to be immersed in something they love all day, and they get to teach others how to love and appreciate something so important to our world.”

Josie’s school activities include participation in Art Club, Drama Club, Key Club, Spanish Club, Jazz Band, Marching Band, Student Council, the PLUS Overnighter Team, and National Honor Society. She also attended the Hugh O’Brian Youth Leadership Conference and volunteers often in the community, church, and at Covington Elementary School.

One of their favorites was the story about Pete and his favorite yellow shirt, with its four groovy buttons. The preschoolers helped Pete count his buttons. To celebrate Pete, they also made Pete's yellow shirt during snack time by spreading yellow icing on a graham cracker and adding m&m buttons. The students got to spread their own icing and then counted out the number of buttons that they wanted. During Center time, each student cut out Pete's yellow shirt and then added sticker buttons to spell out their own name. These fun activities helped the students with their cutting skills, their fine motor skills, counting, letter recognition, name recognition, and more. Well done preschoolers!

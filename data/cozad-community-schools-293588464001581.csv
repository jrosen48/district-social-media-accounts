You didn’t ask COVID-19 to turn your world upside down. If you need help, please ask! We are in this together and want everyone to be ok. If you’ve never used our food pantry, or have a question on finances please let me know. We have a community filled with people that can help, but nothing will happen if you don’t ask.

Teachers at Cozad Community Schools are going bananas without their students 🍌🍌

So much, that a group of teachers took it upon themselves to organize a parade of their own!

On Wednesday, about 30 teachers, including para-professionals, drove through their students’ neighborhoods eager to see their smiles and say “hello.”

Some students made signs to hold with messages such as “Hugs.”

Families were instructed to practice social distancing by standing outside their homes or parking and staying in their cars along the route.

Teachers say not only did they have “tears of joy,” but it was also difficult to stay away and not “hug each and every single person!”

School officials say the parade helped promote the school’s Social Distancing and Staying Safe at Home Rules.

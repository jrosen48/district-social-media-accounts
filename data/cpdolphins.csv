March 18, 1964 – Bonnie Blair is born. She is a five-time Olympic speed skating gold medalist and the most decorated female Winter Olympian in U.S. history.

Blair’s greatest success came at the Olympics, though she started slowly. At the 1984 Games in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia (now in Bosnia and Herzegovina), she could finish no better than eighth in the 500-metre event. At the 1988 Games in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, she was a favourite in the sprint events and earned a gold in the 500-metre event and a bronze in the 1,000-metre event. At the 1992 Games in Albertville, France, she captured the gold medal in both the 500- and 1,000-metre competitions, a feat that she repeated at the 1994 Olympic Games in Lillehammer, Norway",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1143655825966530&id=880705755594873,,0.0,"National Women's Month

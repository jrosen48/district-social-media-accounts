Corning Hawks: This Friday night, May 1st, the Corning Memorial Stadium will again have the lights on! We will light up the stadium from 8:20 to 8:40 pm. We want to honor all our students, parents and staff who are currently missing all the activities and community events that the school provides. We want everyone to know we are thinking about them, we miss them, we love them and we are all anxious for their return. In light of the current conditions we must follow all social distancing rules to help in this endeavor: we will not allow congregating on Corning-Painted Post High School grounds. We advise that you drive by the stadium or drive over the bridge to view the stadium. Do not congregate together. Remember to follow all social distancing rules and to wear your mask when in public, no matter where you are.

Drive by and celebrate our students, parents and staff as we light our stadium!

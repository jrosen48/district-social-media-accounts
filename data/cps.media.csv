After consultation with Panhandle Public Health District and COVID-19 Unified Command, it has been determined that Chadron Public Schools along with the other ESU 13 schools in the Nebraska Panhandle will be closed for the next two weeks. The State of Nebraska has elevated the risk assessment this evening and schools are engaging in preemptive dismissal to try to decrease the spread of disease.

We ask that students and community members immediately begin engaging in social distancing. There will be no practices or school activities during the 14 day period. Unified Command and Regional West have asked that anyone who has traveled to areas with community transmission of COVID-19 to self-monitor and self-quarantine. At this time there are still no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Panhandle. Additional information will be forthcoming.

""We will hold school here – unless there's a blizzard warning or something like that – even though it might be -20°. We'll have school because people don't understand that school, for a lot of our kids, like at 40 percent, school is the safest, warmest place where they're going to get two full meals, plus a snack if they stay for after-school. So, [if] it's -20°, the wind's blowing, we'll have kids, even though we don't start until 7:45 a.m. They'll show up at 7 a.m. because they're looking for that warm place to be. Our school is going to be the warmest place that some of these kids have.""

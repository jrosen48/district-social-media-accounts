Judy went to work for the district in September of 1984 as a Secretary to the Supervisors at the School Board Annex in Jonesville. She worked her way up and became the Secretary to the Superintendent and was still in that position at her passing. Judy was a loyal and faithful employee who was loved by everyone that worked with her. As one of the longest-term Central Office employees, she had worked with many different people over the years and befriended all of them. Judy was not just a co-worker to us at the office, she was family. She will be greatly missed.

Arrangements are as follows:
Visitation, Thursday, Jan. 16th from 5 PM to 8 PM
Funeral, Friday, Jan. 17th at 2 PM
All services will be held at Young's Funeral Home in Jonesville

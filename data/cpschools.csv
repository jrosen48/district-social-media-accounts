1. We have many upcoming events that were previously planned for late April, May and June. Events that involve seniors, such as Honor Society and Academic Awards, are my initial concern since they will be graduating in June. Decisions regarding these events will be made during the week of April 20th when we return from our spring break. I will make every effort, if we are still closed, to honor these students in some remote or virtual way.

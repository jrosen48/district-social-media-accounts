Bond Update
Ground breaking for the student and event parking lot. Due to social distancing and safety, we decided to make a video of the ground breaking and have a bit of fun.

The student and event parking lot. is finally being paved, thanks to our amazing community for passing the bond. We can hardly wait to be able to hold events again, to welcome our community to join us &
have a beautifully paved lot for you to park in. The students are going really enjoy not having to navigate the large potholes and dust when they come to school. #D6Strong #D6proud #D6BetterTogether

Bond Update
Ground breaking for the student and event parking lot. Due to social distancing and safety, we decided to make a video of the ground breaking and have a bit of fun.

The student and event parking lot. is finally being paved, thanks to our amazing community for passing the bond. We can hardly wait to be able to hold events again, to welcome our community to join us &
have a beautifully paved lot for you to park in. The students are going really enjoy not having to navigate the large potholes and dust when they come to school. #D6Strong #D6proud #D6BetterTogether

I simply explained what “advice” was and then filmed their answers. What resulted, was the best 6 minute video of the year. *See video from last year attached.

This year I can not visit your children at their schools and I am so sad not to be able to be there to film them, but I am hoping with your help we can still make this video for our graduating seniors.

If you are willing, you only need a smart phone and a quiet area to simply ask your K-11th grade child “What advice they would give to the seniors who are graduating and leaving school to start their new adult lives?” “What do they think those seniors need to know?” (Best if their answers are under 20secs.)
Then hold your smart phone horizontally and film their responses and upload that video to this link in my dropbox.

This one is for the parents of the Crater class of 2020!

Now is your chance parents, send me your favorite photo of your 2020 Crater Senior when they were little. Let’s see if we can figure out who they are in the next video celebration of the class of 2020.

Just think parents, you can now dig out that photo you loved so much, but had to hide. 😅😂. We all have one. The one your senior threatened to destroy. As long as they are young, and of course “dressed”. 😂, not a good time for those baby nudes.
I’ll make a video montage of senior fun. No names, just a guessing game. Deadline for submissions is May 20th, 2020 midnight. Email photos to D6Social@district6.org

The party is still on for 6pm today, but because “DJ Kelly Kell is in the house” when actually he will be in his house and not at the same location as I am, the live stream will be coming from DJ Kelly Kell & I am not able to schedule the event. So to join us live at 6 today, visit our main D6 Facebook page @cpsd6, scroll down our news feed or go to the “Live” tab and join the party.🎉🎉.

Remember to take photos and share with us in the comments after the live event ends at 7pm. DJ Kelly Kell loves to read all the comments and see the dancing when he’s all done making the magic. See you tonight for the Fancy Dance Party & celebrating moms.

Special things are happening between students and teachers still during this COVID-19 closure! This is an example of the commitment our teachers have for D6 kids. Mrs. Rees noticed during a zoom meeting that one of her students really needed a ""pick me up."" She contacted the parent and asked if she could come do a social distant teddy bear picnic outside their home gate. The kinder student brought her brother, wore her princess dress, they met in the driveway, soaked up the sun, read a story, had a little treat, and filled her empty tank back up!

Again, this is just one example. We have been scheduling individual zoom meetings to offer help, we have been helping families in need, we have teachers going the extra mile to connect with kids. Our goal is to meet kids where they are and provide that individual attention to meet their needs. I am so proud to say we take care of our little hawks! #hawkssoar #D6BetterTogether #d6strong #svecpsd6",10.0,"#D6BetterTogether ! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

CraterWorks will host a live Q&A session next week with ShopMaster Rick Evans on how to find and harness your own creativity during this time, where to look for materials and how to use what you have.

Craterworks has been working with our Central Point School District teachers creating makers kits for students that are directly related to their curriculum and we hope to have them available to the public soon. Thank you Brian Pike for your inspiration on these projects.

PLEASE REMEMBER I need your help....

Teacher Appreciation week is May 4th - 8th, 2020

With classrooms closed, not being able to see their students in person daily, quarantine & our world tilted. We appreciate our teachers & staff more than ever. We want them to know that we appreciate all their efforts to stay connected with their students, that we see how hard they have worked to develop a new way of teaching. That we appreciate how they have gone above and beyond to make D6 Connected work.

Can you help us collect media “thanking the teachers, telling them how awesome they are, ect?”
1. Make a short video
2. Send them a handwritten thank you note, even an email works?
3. Share a Thank you photo?

We’d love to see the students & even the community tell these amazing teachers they are appreciated.

If you choose to accept this mission.... 😃
Below is the media needed to complete this project, if you choose to submit media for the montage video.

Of course you can send media or notes directly to your teacher if you wish.

Deadline for media & video clips submitted is April 30th 9pm.

Final video will be edited and premiered May 6th, 2020.

Tips to submit a photo with a sign or a photo of a note….
Make sure sign is written with a big enough font to easily read.

Tips to film a video clip.

Film horizontally & clips can be 17 seconds maximum.

Any smart phone with video capabilities is acceptable.

If possible, go to camera settings and change settings to 1080i although 720i works as well.

Tips & tricks to filming.
1. Try to find natural light facing subject. Best if the sun is not directly shinning through the window, on face or outside. Even lighting is best. Look out for shadows and avoid overhead lighting and back lighting.
2. Set up so that subject is slightly off center in the camera frame, left or right.
3. Aim camera lens just slightly above subjects eye line.
4. Place subject in the camera frame to fill one third of the frame. leaving approx 6” showing above subjects head.
5. Remember to check your background space. Keep your background as clean and simple as possible or use nature outside.
6. Audio.... try to find a quiet space with out a lot of ambient noise. Encourage strong voice when speaking.

Once photos & video clips are ready, email me at D6Social@district6.org with a subject line of “D6 Teacher” or upload media to this link.

With classrooms closed, not being able to see their students in person daily, quarantine & our world tilted. We appreciate our teachers & staff more than ever. We want them to know that we appreciate all their efforts to stay connected with their students, that we see how hard they have worked to develop a new way of teaching. That we appreciate how they have gone above and beyond to make D6 Connected work.

Can you help us collect media “thanking the teachers, telling them how awesome they are, ect?”
1. Make a short video
2. Send them a handwritten thank you note, even an email works?
3. Share a Thank you photo?

We’d love to see the students & even the community tell these amazing teachers they are appreciated.

If you choose to accept this mission.... 😃
Below is the media needed to complete this project, if you choose to submit media for the montage video.

Of course you can send media or notes directly to your teacher if you wish.

Deadline for media & video clips submitted is April 25th 9pm.

Final video will be edited and premiered May 6th, 2020.

Tips to submit a photo with a sign or a photo of a note….
Make sure sign is written with a big enough font to easily read.

Tips to film a video clip.

Film horizontally & clips can be 17 seconds maximum.

Any smart phone with video capabilities is acceptable.

If possible, go to camera settings and change settings to 1080i although 720i works as well.

Tips & tricks to filming.
1. Try to find natural light facing subject. Best if the sun is not directly shinning through the window, on face or outside. Even lighting is best. Look out for shadows and avoid overhead lighting and back lighting.
2. Set up so that subject is slightly off center in the camera frame, left or right.
3. Aim camera lens just slightly above subjects eye line.
4. Place subject in the camera frame to fill one third of the frame. leaving approx 6” showing above subjects head.
5. Remember to check your background space. Keep your background as clean and simple as possible or use nature outside.
6. Audio.... try to find a quiet space with out a lot of ambient noise. Encourage strong voice when speaking.

Once photos & video clips are ready, email me at D6Social@district6.org with a subject line of “D6 Teacher” or upload media to this link.

Feel free to email me with any questions as well. 😊
Thank you in advance for helping make this extra special this year.

Teacher Appreciation week May 4th - 8th, 2020

With classrooms closed, not being able to see their students in person daily, quarantine & our world tilted. We appreciate our teachers & staff more than ever. We want them to know that we appreciate all their efforts to stay connected with their students, that we see how hard they have worked to develop a new way of teaching. That we appreciate how they have gone above and beyond to make D6 Connected work.

Can you help us collect media “thanking the teachers, telling them how awesome they are?”
1. Make a short video
2. Send them a handwritten thank you note, even an email works?
3. Share a Thank you photo?

We’d love to see the students & even the community tell these amazing teachers they are appreciated.

If you choose to accept this mission.... 😃
Below is the media needed to complete this project, if you choose to submit media for the montage video.

Of course you can send media or notes directly to your teacher if you wish.

Deadline for media & video clips submitted is April 25th 9pm.

Final video will be edited and premiered 6th, 2020.

Tips to submit a photo with a sign or a photo of a note….
Make sure sign is written with a big enough font to easily read.

Tips to film a video clip.

Film horizontally & clips can be 17 seconds maximum.

Any smart phone with video capabilities is acceptable.

If possible, go to camera settings and change settings to 1080i although 720i works as well.

Tips & tricks to filming.
1. Try to find natural light facing subject. Best if the sun is not directly shinning through the window, on face or outside. Even lighting is best. Look out for shadows and avoid overhead lighting and back lighting.
2. Set up so that subject is slightly off center in the camera frame, left or right.
3. Aim camera lens just slightly above subjects eye line.
4. Place subject in the camera frame to fill one third of the frame. leaving approx 6” showing above subjects head.
5. Remember to check your background space. Keep your background as clean and simple as possible or use nature outside.
6. Audio.... try to find a quiet space with out a lot of ambient noise. Encourage strong voice when speaking.

Once photos & video clips are ready, email me at D6Social@district6.org with a subject line of “D6 Teacher” for a link to upload & share media.

Feel free to email me with any questions as well. 😊
Thank you in advance for helping make this extra special this year. -Kimbra LeCornu

1. Staying home doesn’t just protect you, it protects your loved ones. Who are you staying home for?
2. What are you doing to stay connected at home? (Examples could be virtual watch parties, virtual book clubs, online games, and more!)

Week 2 of #distancelearning in Oregon. Not gonna lie, I was feeling pretty beat up yesterday after getting the {inevitable} news that public schools would be closed in Oregon through the end of the school year; my first year of teaching 💔
But, you know what hasn’t changed?? How the kids always make it better 👏🎉👌 We had our daily class @zoom_video_communications meeting today and I came out feeling re-energized and even more PROUD to be their teacher 😭👩‍🏫🥰 We have been focusing on #perserverance this week. And yesterday’s writing assignment was to explain what positive self-talk has to do with perseverance. I gave some examples and have loved using the @characterstrong & PAX Behavior curriculum to help continue navigating emotions with my students through this historical time. Their challenge was to write their favorite positive affirmation on their mirror where they could see it and say it each day. Shout out to my girl @msrachelhollis 💛
All this being said, my students never cease to amaze me with their creativity and their spirit! They *crack* me up 🤪
🌟✨💛
So, in order to continue to keep the positive energy alive, I wanted to send some #easterseason home! The kiddo that gets the #goldenegg is next week’s online Class Leader!! 💛
Thanks for reading this far & sharing in the #smalljoys educators have during this #Eggstremely crazy time! 🤪

Sending you all love & light! Remember to stay on the *sunny side up* ☀️🍳🥚and stay safe & healthy my friends! 😘

Hello Doodlers! Just wanted to let you know there will be another FREE lesson on Facebook Live right here on the page tomorrow (Tuesday, April 7) at 3 PM!. We will be doing watercolor Easter eggs! You will need watercolor paper or a heavy multimedia drawing paper, watercolor paints, a small water dish, paper towels, a pencil, some salt, and some Crayons or oil pastels. A black sharpie or permanent marker or pen is optional but great to have as well. If you don’t have paint, you can do this with crayons or markers and just draw & color in the eggs. If you have markers, I will show a trick to make them look like watercolor paints! We will be learning three new techniques… Texture with salt, wax resist, and ink patterns over watercolor. I present this lesson courtesy of Deep Space Sparkle, you can find this and many other free lessons listed at their website. More info can be found in the handouts I will include tomorrow. Let me know if you have questions, I hope to see you there!",0.0,"The Doodle Place has agreed to invite you to join a free art lesson tomorrow. Thank you for sharing Doodle Place.

These kids are enjoying their “new normal”. To say that it’s easy would be the wrong words. Don’t get me wrong, the Central Point School District 6 has killed it in terms of preparing everything for this new way of learning. I can honestly say, they miss their friends, their normal routines, seeing their teachers, and actually being IN the schools. Yes, my kids really do love school! 🥰🙌❤️
I’m thankful for the school district and the teachers, staff, aides, and volunteers who have put a lot of time and effort into getting this all put together. 📚

I just felt it necessary to let our teachers know this:

Hey teachers, I just wanted to let you know that however this week goes down - it's all good. We're on your team. This wasn't what you signed up for, and I sort of can't believe you're actually going to attempt do this. Your life is about to become one giant conference call with two dozen nine-year-olds who have no set bedtime, and are hopped up on Captain Crunch and whatever their parents have been stress-baking for the past 12 days. What could possibly go wrong?

In light of this, our family is giving you blanket permission to do this however the heck you want for the next two months.

Your kid wants to sit on your lap while you teach long division? That's great.
Need to stress eat half a bag of Cheetos while you're trying to explain how to calculate Experimental Error? Go for it.
Feel like having morning meeting in your pajamas - all month long? It's a judgement free zone here. Lord knows that's what I'll be wearing until at least noon.
Having a panic attack because you need to check in on your parents and wanna point that Zoom camera at three straight episodes of Sponge Bob for an English assignment? Excellent plan.
Want to just sit there and ask them how their days were for 40 minutes without mentioning a single thing about MLA formatting? Please God do that.

See, I don't care if you teach my kids one more thing this semester, and this is why: Just by showing up, by checking in, by caring enough to do this freaking IMPOSSIBLE job - you've already taught them the only things I really wanted them to get out of school.

You've taught them that people are flexible - they adapt to new things.
You've taught them that people will show up for them even when it's hard.
You've taught them that communities work together for the greater good.
You've taught them the world is a good place. That even when circumstance are scary, people are good.
You've loved them enough to be there - and that's all any of us can do, is love each other through this.

Our kids will be ok. Take care of yourselves too. We love you. You've got this - and if you don't, I'm not telling.

Thank you again for all you do for the community!",8.0,"❤️❤️❤️❤️ #D6BetterTogether

And here we go. Online school.... my thoughts... so far:

Thank Goodness to our amazing D6 Central Point School District 6 Team(s) for getting control and good communication and going way above and beyond for our kids. I have been paying attention to how other kids are doing their online school in other states and I can noticeably say we are extremely blessed with an attentive and action-oriented school district. Beyond school itself, they have created resources for our kids that not many other schools are able to or are not doing.

So as overwhelmed as you might feel, feel blessed to be in this wonderful district! :D

Scenic Middle School has put together virtual teaching blocks. No parent needed -- teachers are handling EVERYTHING via video classrooms. This is a relief. And they have help at the end of each day during open pod meetings.

Grade School is a little more ""wild west"" so far. haha! Which I totally get. Is anyone struggling with how to block schedule your grade-schoolers tasks for school?

I keep hearing of people stressing out about juggling work and school and kids being home. I'll share by Friday how I have laid out Serafina's school and home-life. #D6Connected1stDay",2.0,"❤️#D6BetterTogether

If you have a stuffed animal 🧸 who lives in your home, place them in a window for children & families to spot when out on walks (keeping a safe distance of course) or out on drives through neighborhoods.
Be kind and respectful of our bears and stay on the sidewalks.

Snap a photo & share what you find on your bear hunts in our comments below. For those who live rurally, you can play too. Send us photos of your bears living in the county. 😊🧸

Share your wild stuffed animals on display in the comments below. Stay healthy & safe as you go on a bear 🐻 hunt. #D6BetterTogether

Oregon State University shut down the OSAA 5A tournament in the Gill Coliseum after the boys consolation game that morning.

We packed up our NFHSnetwork.com gear and went back to the hotel. There we saw the Crater Boys and Girls team in the lobby after their team meetings, it was heartbreaking to see their suffering.

Student athletes at the peak of their careers and performances denied the opportunity to further their goals with their teammates. Coaches, parents, and fans disappointed that the potential of these teams stopped, not by their own demise, but of extenuating circumstances.

Yes, that are greater concerns of health and wellness of the human population of Earth, but that doesn't diminish the significance of the impact of the events at this grass roots level to those we know and love.

I’m the head coach of a middle school wrestling team in Southern Oregon. For the past 2 seasons, I have had the honor to work with a Pioneer in the sport of Women’s Wrestling. Not only did she help pave the way for the sport on the mat, she now is breaking down the walls as a coach.

As a wrestler at Red Bluff HS, in Red Bluff, California, KT Grissom was the only girl on an all boys team. As she battled the stereotypes of women wrestlers, she earned herself a spot on the inaugural Southern Oregon University Women’s Wrestling Team.

As life directed her to chase her dream of becoming a police officer, I was lucky enough to have her join my coaching staff.

KT Grissom who is currently a 911 dispatcher, has truly earned the title of coach. She has impressed me with her leadership and fearlessness as she works to break some old school hurdles.

Scenic Middle School Drama will present its musical of the school year, “Legally Blonde the Musical Jr.,” on January 30th-February 1st at the Crater Performing Arts Center on the campus of Crater High School in Central Point, OR. Admission is $5 for students/seniors and $8 for adults. Children five and under are free. Reserved tickets can be purchased at https://app.arts-people.com/index.php?show=111390. Tickets will also be available at the door.

Based on the award-winning Broadway musical and the smash hit motion picture, “Legally Blonde the Musical JR.” is a fabulously fun journey of self-empowerment and expanding horizons. The show’s instantly recognizable songs are filled with humor, wit and sass, leaving cast members and audiences alike seeing pink!

“Legally Blonde Jr.” follows the transformation of Elle Woods as she tackles stereotypes, snobbery and scandal in pursuit of her dreams. When Elle’s college boyfriend, Warner, dumps her and heads to Harvard Law School, claiming she’s not “serious” enough, Elle takes matters into her own hands, crafting a showy song-and-dance personal essay and charming her way into law school. Befriending classmate, Emmett, and spunky hairdresser, Paulette, along the way, Elle finds that books and looks aren’t mutually exclusive. As Elle begins outsmarting her peers, she realizes that law may be her natural calling after all.

“Legally Blonde JR.” features large and energetic cast of 36 students and is a fun romp for people of all ages. The designation JR. at the end of the title indicates that though the movie was rated PG13 this version of the play is “G” rated and is appropriate for young people.

The cast features Kenna Lujan as Elle Woods, Casey Denny as Emmett Forrest, Gavin Snow as Warner Hunington III, Mia Brewer as Brooke Windham, Baylee Tiller as Paulette Bonafonté, Aleena Austin as Vivenne Kensington, and Deegan Carlson as Professor Callahan. Other cast members include Kenzie Kauzlaurich, Vanessa Brewer, Grace Davenport, Mary Norton, Madison Johnson, Ava Kerley, Penelope Spires, Shylah Fleury, Claire Davenport, Rowen Miller, Echo Smith, Daisy Ruiz, Janelle Luckaszewicz, Aesha Luckett, Zachary Mireles, Owen Caster, Ella Rose Harriman, Isabelle Montalvo Jada Harding, Savannah Herbst, Logan Kennedy, Stephanee Watkins, Josephine Montalvo, Alexia Thompson, Akira Howard, Cassidy Kerby, Hannah Veach Kaidence Kennedy, and Day James. Direction and choreography is by Scenic Middle School Drama/Dance teacher Rebecca K.

Scenic Middle School Drama will present its musical of the school year, “Legally Blonde the Musical Jr.,” on January 30th-February 1st at the Crater Performing Arts Center on the campus of Crater High School in Central Point, OR. Admission is $5 for students/seniors and $8 for adults. Children five and under are free. Reserved tickets can be purchased at https://app.arts-people.com/index.php?show=111390. Tickets will also be available at the door.

Based on the award-winning Broadway musical and the smash hit motion picture, “Legally Blonde the Musical JR.” is a fabulously fun journey of self-empowerment and expanding horizons. The show’s instantly recognizable songs are filled with humor, wit and sass, leaving cast members and audiences alike seeing pink!

“Legally Blonde Jr.” follows the transformation of Elle Woods as she tackles stereotypes, snobbery and scandal in pursuit of her dreams. When Elle’s college boyfriend, Warner, dumps her and heads to Harvard Law School, claiming she’s not “serious” enough, Elle takes matters into her own hands, crafting a showy song-and-dance personal essay and charming her way into law school. Befriending classmate, Emmett, and spunky hairdresser, Paulette, along the way, Elle finds that books and looks aren’t mutually exclusive. As Elle begins outsmarting her peers, she realizes that law may be her natural calling after all.

“Legally Blonde JR.” features large and energetic cast of 36 students and is a fun romp for people of all ages. The designation JR. at the end of the title indicates that though the movie was rated PG13 this version of the play is “G” rated and is appropriate for young people.

The cast features Kenna Lujan as Elle Woods, Casey Denny as Emmett Forrest, Gavin Snow as Warner Hunington III, Mia Brewer as Brooke Windham, Baylee Tiller as Paulette Bonafonté, Aleena Austin as Vivenne Kensington, and Deegan Carlson as Professor Callahan. Other cast members include Kenzie Kauzlaurich, Vanessa Brewer, Grace Davenport, Mary Norton, Madison Johnson, Ava Kerley, Penelope Spires, Shylah Fleury, Claire Davenport, Rowen Miller, Echo Smith, Daisy Ruiz, Janelle Luckaszewicz, Aesha Luckett, Zachary Mireles, Owen Caster, Ella Rose Harriman, Isabelle Montalvo Jada Harding, Savannah Herbst, Logan Kennedy, Stephanee Watkins, Josephine Montalvo, Alexia Thompson, Akira Howard, Cassidy Kerby, Hannah Veach Kaidence Kennedy, and Day James.

Late this afternoon, we started having some issues with our pump on our well. Maintenance worked diligently throughout the evening and determined at 8:00 PM that the pump needs to be replaced. I have been assured that the well will be fully functional by Thursday.

This will leave us needing to function for part or all of the school day tomorrow without the well, but we will have water. While it will be slightly disruptive to some of our normal routine, there will be very little change to the classroom environment. We believe that attendance at school is vital for student learning and the staff is committed to minimizing any interference with the normal schedule. Besides drinking from water bottles, washing their hands at hand sanitizing stations, and possibly using portable toilets, students will have a normal day at school.

Our storage tank is currently partially full (and filling at a very, very, slow rate overnight) and in the event it runs dry we will have 12 portable restrooms and multiple hand sanitizing stations delivered in the morning. Bottled water will be available for staff and students and the food service staff will be able to bring in water to serve both breakfast and lunch.

As always, we believe you know your child best, so please proceed as you feel comfortable. If you feel it’s best to keep your child home, we respect your decision. If you feel like your child can handle these accommodations, than we would love to see them here in the morning! For those children that still attend tomorrow, they are welcome to bring their own water bottles, but please know we will have bottled water available for them. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact the school office at 541-494-6870.",0.0,"Sams Valley Elementary School

While it will be slightly disruptive to some of our normal routine, there will be very little change to the classroom environment. We believe that attendance at school is vital for student learning and the staff is committed to minimizing any interference with the normal schedule. Besides drinking from water bottles, washing their hands at hand sanitizing stations, and possibly using portable toilets, students will have a normal day at school.

Our storage tank is currently partially full (and filling at a very, very, slow rate overnight) and in the event it runs dry we will have 12 portable restrooms and multiple hand sanitizing stations delivered in the morning. Bottled water will be available for staff and students and the food service staff will be able to bring in water to serve both breakfast and lunch.

As always, we believe you know your child best, so please proceed as you feel comfortable. If you feel it’s best to keep your child home, we respect your decision. If you feel like your child can handle these accommodations, than we would love to see them here in the morning! For those children that still attend tomorrow, they are welcome to bring their own water bottles, but please know we will have bottled water available for them. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact the school office at 541-494-6870.",2019-11-06 07:58:52,,

Senior Night...another heavy reminder of how fast life moves. One moment you’re a freshman in high school, experiencing the adrenaline of your first match. The next moment...you’re listening to an announcer queue your parents and teammates onto the court to proudly hand you a bouquet of flowers, honoring the years of hard work and dedication to your sport. And suddenly, you’re on the other side of it all as the coach. Reflecting on all of the teammates, parents, and coaches that have given more than you thought a sport could offer. Priceless memories. Meaningful relationships. Cherish ALL of it! 🙌🏼

Scenic Middle School launched their FIRST SPARROW CLUB in 15 years today!!!! 🎉 🎊 🎉 🎊🎉🎊🎉
Because of a compassionate and determined group of young leadership students reaching out to Sparrow Clubs, the Spartans will have this amazing opportunity to serve others in honor of their Sparrow, Miya.

You could hear a pin drop today during this emotional and inspiring assembly. Students were moved to compassion as they learned about the journey 6-year-old Miya has been on since birth. This sweet little girl gained a whole lot of family today.

Special thanks to the club sponsor Medical Eye Center for making this possible. Your sponsorship is providing the opportunity for young people to KNOW they matter.

A HUGE thank you to Ellie Misner-Smith for being the club advisor this year. We appreciate you and your leadership students.

This afternoon Fire District 3 celebrated the construction progress of the new Scenic Fire Station in Central Point.

Partner agencies including, Central Point School District 6, Scenic Middle School, City of Central Point (City Hall), Housing Authority of Jackson County, Adroit Construction Co., and Soderstorm Architects were present to answer questions pertaining to the station which will be operational in June of 2020.

The Scenic Middle School 7th and 8th grade Leadership classes were also there to help us celebrate the new build. Take a look at the photos below, maybe one day some of those faces will be working at Fire District 3! #furefirefighter #construction #partnership #community",2.0,"Fire District 3

The students are now actively using the makerspace! Mrs. Gentry's class has been learning about food, gardening, cooking, and nutrition. They took a visit to wandering roots and expanded upon their learning with a kitchen utensil woodburning project. They had to make a prototype drawing of their design, and then transfer that design to a wooden utensil. The students not only learn to use a woodburner, but they develop core values such as patience and persistance, and learn that sometimes success comes with appropriate struggle.

CESPN helps make GAMEDAY happen! Students work hard to bring #CraterNation a live event to be proud of. Last Friday, we were fortunate to have Andryanna Sheppard - Journalist for KDRV NewsWatch 12 come out to The Dutch and do a short feature on rising sophomore and CESPN superstar, Ayden Merklein pregame. Then the rest of the crew came and did a fabulous job filming, producing and creating an exciting game day.",2.0,"Such an awesome opportunity for these students and such a treat to watch their work.

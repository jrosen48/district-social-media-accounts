Guest Teacher Training at RIU6 – Substitutes needed for RIU6 Region Schools

If you have a College Degree, an Emergency Teaching Permit can be issued for you to do day to day subbing in our schools as much or as little as needed. This training is a small preparatory program with some virtual videos, lots of paperwork, a few key special education topics, and a $25 processing fee, and you can get your emergency teaching permit to substitute in our schools and make some money on off days or every day as our schools are desperate. Email mlaverde@riu6.org or call 814-297-5103.

Annual Santa Shop
By Brooke Whitling | 12/17/19

On Monday, December 16th, Cranberry Jr./Sr. High School hosted its annual Santa Shop.

Designed to allow select students the opportunity to give back to family members, the event entered its 8th year.

“We created this in an effort to spread cheer in school before students go home on Christmas break,” Paula Turk, one of the event’s organizers, stated of the Shop’s original purpose.

Students invited to participate shop from items donated by Cranberry staff and community members. This year, the event allowed fifty-three students to select items for their loved ones.

Turk says that she gets many grateful emails from families, thanking her for presenting the students with this opportunity.

The student feedback is also extremely positive, explains Turk, “They are so full of smiles and happiness on that day, and it makes the entire preparation process worth it.”",2.0,"CranNews JPub

Girls Coding at Cranberry
By Nick Richar

This year Cranberry has added a brand new club, Girls Who Code.

The club is run by Mr. Colin Milne, the school librarian.

When asked about Girls Who Code, Milne explained, “This club is a national club. It focuses on getting females involved with coding.”

He also made notice that anyone can join this club, it is just more girl centered, but the coding lessons are the same regardless of gender.

“I want everyone to have an opportunity,” he stated.

He mentioned that most of the workers in the coding and software designing fields are men, which is why the club is more focused around girls.

Milne finished the interview with a positive outlook on the future of the club. He plans on getting more girls involved with coding so that it balances the ratio of both men and women in the coding field.",2.0,"CranNews JPub

White Cane Day
Written by Ady Carter and Natalie Sandrock
Photography by Cara Andres

The Venango County Association for the Blind came to Cranberry High School on Tuesday, October 15th to share and do an interactive lesson with the junior class on White Cane Day.

Black canes used to cause problems because they weren’t easily visible. The white canes came about in the 1930s. Then, in 1964, the national day was organized and signed by Lyndon B. Johnson.

The association taught the students how to properly assist the blind. The tips they were given included making sure to ask before they try to assist someone, as not everyone may want or need help, and to remember to use verbal cues.

Students were also told about challenges the blind have locally. These challenges include having to wait months to learn how to properly use a cane, along with something such as a grocery store being rearranged. To a sighted person, this is mildly disruptive, but this can be very significant to the blind.",2.0,"CranNews JPub

Ava Ferringer is our new Athlete of the week. She has been in the spotlight recently with her performances in volleyball.

Ferringer helped the team with a 2-1 record for the week plus an 8-1 record overall. Ava lead the team in kills each of the three games this week with 9, all while maintaining a 3.9 GPA.

Ava snapped a quick picture with Mr. Earp and gave some insight on being the Athlete of the Week.

“It’s an honor” She said.

She listed off a couple of accomplishments she had this season.

“I am proud of our team this year; being able to defeat keystone was insane for us.”

Ava will back on the court tonight for Senior Night. JV starts at 6 with Senior night and Varsity to follow.

Athlete of the Week: Cameron Russell
Written by Zoe Albert

This week’s Athlete of the Week is Cameron Russell.

When asked how it felt to receive this honor, Russell responded, “Feels good, feels rewarding, really proud of myself.”

Russell plays for the Co-Op Oil City Oilers Football team and has already begun an extremely fruitful season with 9.5 sacks, 74 carries, 640 rushing yards, 6 touchdowns, and 5.5 tackles.

Russell also competes with the basketball team, the track and field team, and the wrestling team.

Receiving this award proves to be especially motivational for Russell.

Athlete of the Week: Matt Woolcock
By Brooke Whitling and Gabe Dresbach

Leading by example and attending every practice are just two reasons Coach Siverling gave when speaking of the newest student of the week.

In recent weeks, Woolcock won 1st place at a dual meet with North Clarion and Brockway, and 2nd place overall at the Commodore Perry invitational.

“He is hard working, very goal oriented, and is always motivated; he‘s just a very kind person in general,” says Oliver, assistant boys cross country coach.

When asked how it feels to be the Athlete of the Week, Woolcock said, “It feels good. I really like the recognition.”

Receiving this honor, Woolcock hopes it encourages him to do well and that it inspires others to keep up the hard work.

Walk to School Day
Written by Jacob Umstead and Hunter Redfield

Several students and staff participated in “Walk to School” day, an annual event at Cranberry High School.

Hosted by the CRANA club, “Walk to School” day is a great opportunity for students to get extra exercise to start their day.

Students were dropped off at the intersection of Education drive and Big Egypt road and walked up the school’s scenic back drive.

During the walk, the back drive was blocked off from traffic to provide safety for students and staff.

CRANA club members unloaded backpacks from the buses then students picked them up after the walk before entering the school. Club members also handed out water bottles to all participants.

The main focus for “Walk to School” day is to encourage students to be more active not only during school, but outside of school as well.",2.0,"CranNews JPub is with Jessica Guth.

FEATHERS FLYING IN THIRD GRADE
By: Carly Wice and Rachael McCauley - Cran News Reporters
4-15-19

Mrs. Findley´s third grade class at Cranberry Elementary recently hatched a few different breeds of chickens. The students hatched Ameraucana, Golden Polish Laced, and Silver Polish Laced chicks.

Nine chicks hatched all together and the class has not yet determined the gender of all of the chicks. Mrs. Findley has been teaching the children how to determine the sex of the chicks based on their rows of feathers and the curves of their beaks.

THE PUPPY POST: A COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP
Crannews Staff

Journalism tells stories and speaks for those who sometimes don't have a voice. In searching for a community partnership, our Journalism class decided to join with the efforts of our local Humane Society in Seneca, PA.

We think it is important to promote dogs who are surrendered for various reasons: neglect, surrender, or stray, sometimes found wandering around in terrible condition.

The Humane Society takes them in, helps them heal, and finds forever homes for these animals.

Each Wednesday, a student team of journalists goes to the shelter to take pictures and get information on the dogs. The information is then transferred to the ""Puppy Post"" in hopes that more people will see these animals.

Visit our page to see the dogs who need a home, and, please, continue to adopt, not shop!

Eggs started incubation on March 4th and they are expected to hatch April 1st. Sources say that they are expecting at least 30 eggs to make it. Once the ducklings hatch, staff members will be taking them home.

Cranberry Student Earns 2nd in Academic Bowl
By CranNews

One of our very own journalists, Dylan Lu, participated in the Academic Bowl on February 5th at the IU6.

Competing against students in grades 9-12 from 6 different schools, Dylan won 2nd place as an individual scorer!

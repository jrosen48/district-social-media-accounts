Each campus held a staff meeting where the attached video was shown thanking them for their dedication, their hard work, and their willingness to serve our students. At the conclusion of the video, staff were surprised with a performance pay check to start their holidays.

Thank you Pirates. We appreciate everything that you do. Happy Thanksgiving to our hardworking staff of 550 employees!

At our pre-game ceremonies tonight, two incredible Pirates were awarded the coveted title of King and Queen. Travis Stevens and Shaylee Wickersham have both been a part of Crandall ISD since they were in Kindergarten.

Shaylee and Travis demonstrate our three values of Character, Compassion, and Community every day. They are a friend to others. They show kindness and acceptance. They are eager to lend a helping hand, show love and there is no shortage of love surrounding them.

It's a privilege to earn your Varsity decal and be a part of the team. On Thursday, August 29, 2019, Coach Joe Dale Cary led his Varsity football team in the second annual tradition of having educators help them decal their helmet in preparation of football season.

Each Varsity team member was instructed to choose a teacher who has made a difference in their lives. The students and teachers worked together to get the helmets ready for the game tonight.

Worried about parking or transportation? Don't forget that our shuttle will run constantly from Crandall High School to Pirate Stadium beginning at 6:00 p.m.

Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the stadium rules that we shared out this week. We look forward to a wonderful game celebrating the Pirate Nation tonight as they take on Tyler Chapel Hill.

Press Release

On 02/21/2019 at approximately 12:00 pm the Crandall Police Department was dispatched to Barbara Walker Elementary School in reference to a 911 call referencing a possible Bomb Threat at the campus.

Using information obtained from the recorded 911 call that discredited a threat to the campus, the direction for Building Confinement of the campus was given to Crandall ISD staff instead of evacuation.

For precautionary reasons, with the Assistance of the Kaufman County Sheriff’s Office, Crandall Police Officers searched each room of the campus and gave the all clear at approximately 1:30 pm. The Crandall Police Department transitioned into the investigatory process to track the caller.

We want to thank the ISD staff and parents for their assistance and patience during the Crandall Police Department response.

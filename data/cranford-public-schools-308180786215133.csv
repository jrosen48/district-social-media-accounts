Students reported to administration that another student had brought a knife to school. The administration immediately reached out to the Cranford Police Department who investigated the issue in partnership with the school.

A knife was discovered and appropriate measures have been taken. No threats were made and no student or staff member was in any danger.

The safety of our school community is a shared responsibility. We continue to encourage our entire community to please say something if you hear or see something.",2019-06-18 15:40:59,,

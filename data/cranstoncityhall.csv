Good morning Cranston!!

We would like to give a big thank you to Chris Herren and Herren Talks for coming to speak to the community last night! The Cranston East auditorium was left with standing room only! We would also like to thank everyone that came tonight and all those that helped make this possible. The message Chris brings is an important one and we are glad it got to reach so many.

The State Opioid Response grant is funded by the RI Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities & Hospitals and the SPC Regional Prevention Coalition. This competitive grant was awarded to our department who partnered with the Cranston Substance Abuse Task Force to educate and bring awareness on the opioid epidemic to the community.

Thank you again and what a great night!",0.0,"Cranston, RI Police Department

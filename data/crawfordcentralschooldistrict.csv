Happy Earth Week 2020, Crunchies! This year is the 50th Earth Day! ❤️🌏 In addition, Allegheny College has officially reached its goal of Carbon Neutrality! Thank you so much for all your hard work, Allegheny College Sustainability!

Although we couldn't celebrate together in person, we collaborated with ECO People at Meadville Area Senior High and the PA Green New Deal Coalition to organize this campaign, #QuaranCleanUp! Clean up your room, home, lawn, street, or neighborhood (whichever needs it and whichever you can access safely), fill out this Bingo Board, and share it with us using the hashtag #QuaranCleanUp. Then, challenge 5 (or more) friends to do the same. 💪😎 ALSO! Check out our friends at Green Shoppe PA; Julie is offering a special prize for anyone that successfully scores a bingo! Thank you so much, Julie. ❤️❤️❤️

This campaign starts TODAY and will be celebrated/summarized on the last day of Earth Week, this Sunday, April 26 -- but it can keep going after that. ✌️😉 Hope to see you all posting!

This time of year we typically have a coloring contest for kids in grades K-5 in Millcreek as well as Crawford Central and the winners get a pizza party for their class. Since school is cancelled we are going to open this up to ALL kids grades K-5 in Erie and Crawford County!

All drawings can be emailed to Andrew Lincoln at alincoln@lincolnrecycling.com, and we will post the Top 20 drawings. Then we'll leave it to Facebook to vote for their favorite drawing by the number of ""likes"" each drawing gets.

The top 3 will get a pizza party for their family and the winner will also get to choose a hospital listed below to have a lunch donated by Lincoln Recycling to support the healthcare workers during COVID-19.

Hospitials: UPMC Hamot, AHN Sain Vincent, Meadville Medical Center

Hello everyone!

We miss seeing your smiling faces on a daily basis and it was so nice to see those who came to get their instructional packets! It was a time to share a smile during these trying times...I was hoping to get to every car, however for efficiency reasons, I missed a few. This leads me to wanting to thank Mrs. Lockwood and Mrs. Redden for making our pick up time very smooth. Given that we were handing out instructional packets, fundraising chocolates and instruments all at the same time, we couldn't have asked for better results! Thank you to all the families for their patience while in line!

Stay tuned for our next step regarding instruction!

UPDATE: Several kind people have asked how they can donate food to the Caring Cupboard. We will offer a no-contact, drive-by, drop-off from 2-4 pm on Wednesday, April 1. Carts will be located outside in front of the MASH main entrance. You may leave non-perishable items on the cart. Thank you!

The MASH Caring Cupboard provides 26 weekend food bags to our students in need. Each bag costs $5-$6 to prepare which includes breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack options, as well as toiletries, if available.

When the bags were packed this morning, it became very apparent that the Caring Cupboard will only be able to provide this service for approximately 2-3 more weeks unless it collects donations to sustain this much needed service to the students. We are aware that many community agencies and families are financially strapped right now, but if you feel compelled to donate, please mail a check to The MASH Caring Cupboard, Meadville Area Senior High School, 930 North Street, Meadville, PA 16335.",19.0,"Meadville Area Senior High School

Under the new timeline, school buildings would reopen on April 7 for two days to allow school administrators, teachers and other staff time to prepare classrooms, set up cafeterias, schedule transportation and arrange other business operations. Students would return to school on April 9th, unless extending the closure is needed in response to the situation with the virus at that time.

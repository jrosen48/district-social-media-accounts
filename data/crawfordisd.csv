We hope you will participate in our Virtual Teacher Appreciation Week! Please see the event we posted earlier and share pictures and videos throughout the week for the staff to enjoy.
In addition to that, we are asking parents to sign up to Adopt a Teacher/Staff Member. Since PTO can't provide our staff with the luncheon that we usually do, we need your help providing a little treat for each staff member. See the sign up below.
THANK YOU to everyone for helping us spread the word about this and most importantly showing our gratitude to Crawford ISD!

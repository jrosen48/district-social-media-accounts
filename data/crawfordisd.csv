Make sure you swing by the football fields Thursday for dinner to support your local PTO. Papi Taco and Gelu Italian Ice will have their food trucks out to serve and a portion of the proceeds goes straight to PTO!

The trucks will be parked behind the concession stand for spectators to order before going in the gate, but also be accessible to tailgaters and open for the town to utilize. Spectators inside the gate will also be able to place orders directly through the concession stand.

We hope you will participate in our Virtual Teacher Appreciation Week! Please see the event we posted earlier and share pictures and videos throughout the week for the staff to enjoy.
In addition to that, we are asking parents to sign up to Adopt a Teacher/Staff Member. Since PTO can't provide our staff with the luncheon that we usually do, we need your help providing a little treat for each staff member. See the sign up below.
THANK YOU to everyone for helping us spread the word about this and most importantly showing our gratitude to Crawford ISD!

I’m so so proud of this team & honored to be a part of it. They are so deserving of a State Tournament trip in basketball but it just wasn’t in the cards. They are truly Stronger Together and our whole was greater than the sum of our parts!

They worked hard and loved each other well! Sometimes life throws unexpected hurdles at you and you just have to move forward as best you can.

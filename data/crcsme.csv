Lewiston city officials will decide the future of the former Martel Elementary School building this month, with three redevelopment offers on the table.",0.0,"CRCS and other schools in Maine have greatly benefited from furniture and supplies from the Auburn Share Center. Schools that belong to the organization are able to pick up donated furniture and supplies that businesses and other organizations would otherwise dispose of.

This week the Lewiston City Council will hear and discuss three possible proposals for the use of a former school building, including the Auburn Share Center!

Any educator that has benefited from the Share Center should definitively attend. The Share Center‚Äôs plan for the building would be wonderful for schools and allow them to continue accessing this rich resource and the at the same time helping the environment!

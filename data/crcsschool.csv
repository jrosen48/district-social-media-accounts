Why do you like working at CRCS?
I like working at CRCS because our students are great and they are always excited to learn new things. I enjoyed watching them grow last year and am excited to see what the next year brings all of them. We also have a great new staff and I am looking forward to working with all of them as we move forward.

What do yo love about being a Behavior Interventionist?
Last year as a Physical Education Teacher I loved seeing how excited the kids were to come into my class. It was so rewarding to see them grow as the year went on and their love for activity continued through the entire year. As I move to Behavior Interventionist I am excited to be able to help the students in a different way. I am hoping to continue the positive relationships that I have created with the students to help them stay in class and love learning in all areas of education just like they did in the gym. #innovateCRCS",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2419949848237965&id=1382960895270204,,0.0,"Welcome back Ms. Kerry Huset (but in a new role as a Behavior Interventionist)!

I like working at CRCS because I have the BEST kids ever! The families are supportive; they want what is best for their children.

What do you love about being a Kindergarten Teacher?
Not only do I have the BEST job in the world, I get to keep my kiddos for 2 years. I worked with them as Pre-Kindergarteners and saw how much they grew academically, socially, emotionally, and physically. I now get the opportunity to take them to the next level.

Join us for The M.A.S.K. Project: Meet Us, Ask Us, See Us, Know Us, a performance created by young adults from YouthLink and youth residents of Minneapolis’ Cedar Riverside neighborhood. The group grew their writing and acting skills with Guthrie artists over the past two months, and is ready to come together and share a performance inspired by their personal stories. Building upon last summer’s Be You, Be Seen, Belong event, this one hour performance will feature scenes, music, movement, spoken word and more. https://www.guthrietheater.org/shows-and-tickets/2017-2018-season/the-mask-project/

Choose one idea to do at home and post a photo in the comments. One student/photo will be randomly picked as the winner! All grades are encouraged to participate!

The winner will get to choose a silly talent (lip-singing, dancing, playing piano, jumping on one foot, etc.) for Mrs. Trelstad to post a video of her doing on Facebook. 😜

Thanks to the generous donations from our Gala sponsors, we are able to sustain and increase the number of children in our DanceSport Education program. Even better, we are able to reduce class size to improve instruction!

@ Create Academy, we will continue the program with the 3rd grade students! We are so excited to share the joy of ballroom dance with the 1st graders, too!!!

We bring ballroom dance directly to the students-in their schools, at their classrooms! www.dancesported.org

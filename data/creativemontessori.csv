This week kindergarteners are encouraged to visit
https://www.gpb.org/salsa/episodes/episode-103-the-new-chair with their parents and review the colors rojo, verde and azul.

1st-3rd graders are challenged to visit rockalingua.com and log on with their first name, last name (no spaces, capitals or special characters). Password is: spanish. Once logged on you can go to content, and play the color/number game.

4th-6th are encouraged to log in to rockalingua as well, to review los números or días de lasemana.

Middle school students, choose your own path on duolingo. If you have forgotten your login, or haven’t set one up yet as the trimester just started, email me.",2020-04-02 11:00:42,,

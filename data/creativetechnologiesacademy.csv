We have gotten positive feedback from our CTA staff, students and our CTA virtual students and families! What a great job everyone has done adapting to the many new things we have had so far this school year.

As I walked around campus today I was inspired by our staff and students and how adaptive they are.
This week I also appreciated hearing from some of our virtual students and families.

Today’s mystery reader is Mrs. Cone, and she’s reading “The Day the Crayons Quit” with a special someone. 🖍😉

Here are some optional activities to consider that accompany the story:

- Write a letter to your favorite color. Tell them why they’re your favorite and why we need them! (For example, what do we need that color to draw and create?)

- Talk about if you were a crayon. What color would you want to be? Why?

- Make a list of all the things you could imagine, create, or draw with your favorite color.

- Create your own recycled crayons with the help of an adult. For example, instructions follow this link: tiny.cc/crayonrecipe

Have a good weekend, Chargers.

The Day the Crayons Quit",0.0,"Happy Friday!

Today’s mystery reader is Mrs. Cone, and she’s reading “The Day the Crayons Quit” with a special someone. 🖍😉

Here are some optional activities to consider that accompany the story:

- Write a letter to your favorite color. Tell them why they’re your favorite and why we need them! (For example, what do we need that color to draw and create?)

- Talk about if you were a crayon. What color would you want to be? Why?

- Make a list of all the things you could imagine, create, or draw with your favorite color.

- Create your own recycled crayons with the help of an adult. For example, instructions follow this link: tiny.cc/crayonrecipe

Have a good weekend, Chargers.
I hope you’re able to get outside today and enjoy this beautiful weather! ❤️

Some of you guessed correctly yesterday; Mr. George is today’s mystery reader!

He’s chosen to share a book with us called “I Am Love”. ❤️ He has also provided some discussion and activity prompts to further our thinking around its message:

1. Talk with someone you love. Tell them why you love them.

2. Draw a picture of what that relationship looks like to you.

3. What phrase or page in the book meant the most to you? Why?

Thanks for sharing that story with us, Mr. George!

Tomorrow’s mystery reader loves ice cream. Before this person became a teacher, he or she was a bank teller. They even have a child who is a 5th grader at CTA.

Who might this be!?

Have a great Thursday, everyone.
We miss you all more than you know!

Here are some fun, optional activities she has provided for further engaging with today’s story:

Select a critter that you currently fear; write a few of its superpowers in sentence form. (e.g. “Spiders have eight eyes”; “Spiders spin webs to capture pesky prey.”)

Illustrate the critter you wrote about above. Mimic Bethany Barton’s creativity in your illustrations by way of color and humorous text and captions.

Research your critter and create a tool that teaches others about it! Knowledge increases empathy and empathy lessens fear!

I am the oldest of 10 children.
I played college basketball.

Day three of CTA Cyber Mystery Readers is here.

Some of you guessed our reader for today; it’s Ms. Lane! She is here sharing a silly favorite of hers, “No More Water in the Tub”. 🛁 (Clues for the next Mystery Readers are listed below.)

Optional Extension Activities:

-Your challenge today is to tell, draw, or write an imaginative story using a “general routine”, like taking a bath, brushing your teeth, eating a meal, or going to bed.

- Listen to this story and pick out where you hear rhyming words!

- With help from an adult, make this three-ingredient shower or bathtub paint for your own artistic adventure: tiny.cc/bathtubpaint

Your next reader left us some hints as to who they might be!
This person is allergic to shrimp, but don’t worry... they’ve never had a reaction. They played college basketball too. Cool, right? She was even a “Red Flannel Queen!”

Who do you think it is?

A teacher’s first time having students in their OWN classroom.

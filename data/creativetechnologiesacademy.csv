Here you'll find draft information around our K-12th CTA Virtual option for the 2020-21 school year as well as tips for getting the most out of At-Home learning and how to stay happy and healthy.

With the uncertainty of school closures and at-home learning, it's normal to be concerned about your child's education or even be a bit overwhelmed.

While keeping our school community safe continues to be our number one priority, making sure that our students continue to learn and grow is also a top priority.

I'm filled with gratitude for the support you have shown and the culture you have helped us build. The relationships we have built with families, staff members, teachers, administrators, board members, and the communities we serve mean the world to me. Now I ask you to give the same level of support to Mrs. Mattson and her team. ""Keep getting better."" Fiercely defend and grow the culture of your Academy and keep doing what is best for kids. There are politicians and some ""educators"" who have a different agenda, who would destroy what you have built. Don't let it happen. Know who they are. Make your voice heard at the ballot box. Go change the world! - Dan George",2020-06-30 13:26:14,,

Today was to be your day. A day to celebrate with family, friends, and teachers. A day to walk across that stage and step into the next phase of life by pursuing a vocation immediately, or heading off to college in the fall.

Life throws us curve balls sometimes, but you are major leaguers. You have learned how to hit a curve and we are confident you are ready to face pitches like this. Just remember, you have coaches and cheerleaders back at CTA that are rooting for you and available to deliver wise counsel and encouragement.

Today’s mystery reader is Mrs. Cone, and she’s reading “The Day the Crayons Quit” with a special someone. 🖍😉

Here are some optional activities to consider that accompany the story:

- Write a letter to your favorite color. Tell them why they’re your favorite and why we need them! (For example, what do we need that color to draw and create?)

- Talk about if you were a crayon. What color would you want to be? Why?

- Make a list of all the things you could imagine, create, or draw with your favorite color.

- Create your own recycled crayons with the help of an adult. For example, instructions follow this link: tiny.cc/crayonrecipe

Have a good weekend, Chargers.

Some of you guessed correctly yesterday; Mr. George is today’s mystery reader!

He’s chosen to share a book with us called “I Am Love”. ❤️ He has also provided some discussion and activity prompts to further our thinking around its message:

1. Talk with someone you love. Tell them why you love them.

2. Draw a picture of what that relationship looks like to you.

3. What phrase or page in the book meant the most to you? Why?

Thanks for sharing that story with us, Mr. George!

Tomorrow’s mystery reader loves ice cream. Before this person became a teacher, he or she was a bank teller. They even have a child who is a 5th grader at CTA.

Who might this be!?

Select a critter that you currently fear; write a few of its superpowers in sentence form. (e.g. “Spiders have eight eyes”; “Spiders spin webs to capture pesky prey.”)

My favorite part of starting the school year is the opportunity to start over.
To reinvent yourself, take risks, try the same but with a new twist… it gives us all the opportunity to be better then we were last year!!

I was thinking this morning of all the first that can happen on the first day of school:

A student's first day EVER.

A student's first day in a new grade.

A student's first time in a new school.

A parents first time dropping off a kid at school.

A parents first time realizing their kid is growing up too fast!

A parents first time their child drive themselves to school.

A teacher’s first time having students in their OWN classroom.

A teacher's first time in a new grade.

A teacher's first time with a new principal.

Lots of first happening today and it’s so exciting to be a part of this!

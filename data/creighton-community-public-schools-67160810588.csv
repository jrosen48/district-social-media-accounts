So far things have been going well up in the weightroom at CHS this Summer. Kids have been coming in from 6-10 AM in hour increments and have been making the best out of the situation. Recently I've had a few people reach out about Junior High lifters. I'd like to offer an introductory program starting in July that would run on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7-8 AM which would be the best fit within our current lifting schedule. Junior High students would need to sign the same waivers as the high schoolers in order to have access to the building. If you are an interested parent, please e-mail me at my school e-mail, zackliment@chsbulldogs.org, so that I can plan for numbers and answer any other questions or concerns you may have. I look forward to working with these kids and teaching the benefits of weight training!! Go Dogs!",0.0,"JH kids interested in lifting?

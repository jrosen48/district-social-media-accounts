We are so glad to be back! We are excited about being able to offer a virtual education path for our students. If your child has enrolled in virtual education, please be sure to stop by the school library and pick up your computer and information packet.

We would like for this transition to be as smooth as possible for our students. However, it is a new process for us and like all new processes, has a few kinks to work out. Thank you for being patient during this time. We are committed to providing the best educational experience possible for all of our students.

This Friday, August 28th will be a virtual day for all students. Students should have instructions from their teachers for classwork on this day. You can also visit the website for more information or email your teacher. If you are having trouble connecting with your teacher, please call the school with contact information and we will get right back to you. Thank you!

In an effort to be exceedingly cautious with the safety of our students, the School Board met this evening and has voted to change the school calendar. The first day of school will be delayed until August 18th. Meet the Teacher will be Monday, August 17th. To make up the time in the days that were originally scheduled before August 18th, the school day has been extended for 10 minutes and will now release at 3:30 pm.

We are scheduled to attend JH basketball camp in Kingfisher on Wednesday June 24th!

$10 per player with checks payable to Crescent Schools or cash.

Unfortunately, there are no other camps in the area this year so one day is all we will get. Kingfisher is asking that parents do NOT come and have limited this camp to just a few local teams in order to keep our kids as safe as possible.

Please send me a text message letting me know if your daughter is playing so I can have an idea of numbers. Please help spread the word on this as well!

We are scheduled to attend JH basketball camp in Kingfisher on Wednesday June 24th!

$10 per player with checks payable to Crescent Schools or cash.

Unfortunately, there are no other camps in the area this year so one day is all we will get. Kingfisher is asking that parents do NOT come and have limited this camp to just a few local teams in order to keep our kids as safe as possible.

Please send me a text message letting me know if your daughter is playing so I can have an idea of numbers. Please help spread the word on this as well!

Mrs. Tammy Payne has been an educator for 20 years. During that time she has taught 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th and 6th grades, as well as music. She has also spent a few years as an assistant principal and a reading coach, but her heart is in the classroom, where she currently teaches 5th and 6th grade math. She loves to see kids ""get it"" when they are working on math problems.
Tammy is married to John Payne and they have five children. Jerod and his wife Shelby, Zach, Mason, Sadie and Addison. She has one amazing grandbaby, Maddox. Her favorite places to be are in the mountains, at the lake, by the fire, at church, shopping in Stillwater (Go Pokes!) or anywhere she can hang out with family and friends and soak up some quality time with them. Her favorite drink is coffee with sugar-free french vanilla creamer, and she is a fan of dark chocolate as well.

We will be rearranging the school schedule to accommodate the beginning of the FEMA building. The crane is scheduled to arrive on Wednesday the 25th of this month. The crane is 230 feet tall, which requires a safety zone (no students or staff) of more than 230 feet. Due to safety concerns, there will be no after school program on the 25th and NO SCHOOL ON SEPTEMBER 26th. We will go to school on Friday, October 4th to make up the day of school.

On the 25th, as soon as school is out Coreslab will begin erecting the building. The wall panels are roughly 20 feet tall and 10 feet wide. The roof pieces are 100 feet long and weigh around 80,000 pounds. If the weather cooperates, the FEMA structure will be standing by the end of Saturday. There is a small chance that the start of the next week could be impacted.

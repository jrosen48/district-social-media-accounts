Today we honor Crescent Senior
Timothy Ward. Timmy has attended Crescent for twelve years and has earned the respect and admiration of every member of this school. He was a three sport athlete, participating in Football, Basketball and Track. He is a coachable, hard working and dedicated young man. Growing up in Joyce and so close to wild areas to fish and hike, he has no interest in a desk job. After graduation, he plans to join an electrician apprenticeship program, and this seems like a perfect fit! We wish you all the best!

Students are still investigating instruments as most of them are true beginners. The district does own some instruments, but they have not been out of the cases for many years. We do have a friend of the music program lined up to come in and help us figure out what it will take to make them useful to a beginning band student. My goals is that all students who want to participate will have the opportunity without cost being a barrier. If you happen to have an instrument in working order, might be interested in sponsoring an instrument rental or some ability to evaluate instruments to get our students started please give me a call.

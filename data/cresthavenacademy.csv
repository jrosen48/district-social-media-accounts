At Cresthaven Academy, we believe that all children, regardless of race or economic status, can succeed when given equal access to a high quality education. Now, more than ever, the tools to access education are of critical importance as our school community navigates the challenges of remote learning. We know that many families are facing daily hardships that make learning from home nearly impossible. Cresthaven remains committed to educating the #WholeChild in the midst of these uncertain times by providing daily meals, tablets and chromebooks, emotional and mental-health support, as well as meeting basic needs like diapers and toilet paper wherever we can.

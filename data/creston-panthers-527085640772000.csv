2020 Graduate Banner Salute! We are all in this together!

In an effort to celebrate our 2020 Creston Seniors, and to inspire hope and unity, I have ordered these 5'x2' banners for all the graduates. My hope is that you will proudly display them on your house, barn, window, fence, etc and take a photo of your Senior by the banner. Then, share the photo on Facebook & send in a message to Creston High School FB page (I think that's how you do it!). Let’s flood social media with positive, optimistic signs to celebrate our Senior’s success! Banners will be located outside the Creston Realty Office at 118 West Union Street in Creston from 9-3, they are all labeled, so grab yours! Those not picked up by Wednesday 4/22 will be delivered! Congratulations Creston Seniors!!

Please share with other graduates and parents!",6.0,"Send SR. pictures to Creston Panthers fb messenger & we will post them.

Dear Rebel Nation,

The spread of the Corona-Virus has many people extremely concerned across the globe . I am old enough to remember other infectious diseases that have caused community and global concern. They have ranged from Swine Flu, H1N1, Legioneer's disease, Meningitis etc. What has changed since those diseases visited the globe is the growth of information through apps and social media. However, the most reliable medical information will come from the CDC.I have included a direct link that is updated daily.

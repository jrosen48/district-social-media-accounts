I want to inform you that we will be adding a third lunch distribution site. Beginning tomorrow, Wednesday March 18th, we will be serving lunch at the Slocum Township Fire Hall from 11:00am until 1:00pm.

The Fire Hall is located at 1923 Slocum Rd, Wapwallopen, PA 18660.

Please assist in getting this word to all our families who live in proximity to this additional location. We will continue to serve our lunch program at our secondary campus as well as at the White Have Library.

Like so many of you, the Crestwood School District is attempting to do anything we can for our community to be safe and well; and at this time, what I know we can ensure is that no kid will go hungry.

I thank you for your support of our wonderful district.

Congratulations to the Mountaintop Odd Waffles on their performance at the FIRST LEGO League’s PA East Regional Championship on Saturday. This was our rookie year and we are extremely proud of the team. We have learned so much since September. The team constructed LEGO missions to exact specifications, learned basic EV3 Mindstorm programming, designed and built an autonomous robot, troubleshot design issues, and developed an innovative solution to a real-world public space problem. The team members had to present each aspect to a panel of judges, complete with four interview sessions, and run their robot under the pressure of time and an audience.

The real reward was in watching the Odd Waffles transition from six individuals that talked over each other and emphasized self-interest to a dynamic team that embodied the STEM, communication, and perseverance qualities valued in today’s world. I cannot wait to see what they will do next!

Thank you to the parents of the Odd Waffles for all your support and time and snacks!",0.0,"Congratulations to our Rice students:

In Maggie's first year running she quickly became a star of our varsity squad in cross country. She continued to make strides her senior year and developed into a strong leader. Her senior year she decided to run track. Training all Winter, Maggie led her team by both word and action and would have been a top distance runner this season. She is a true leader both inside and outside the classroom. Congratulations Maggie!

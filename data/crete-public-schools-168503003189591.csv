So far we have 33 High Schools we will have represented on this site. We wanted to give the family a chance to recognize their seniors during this unusual school year.

The tshirts on the site are the same for every school in their school colors, in hopes of uniting the state as a whole.

I would appreciate it if you would be willing to share the site with any families who may have a senior this year!

We will be open on this initial run until May 4th until 9am, but we will run a second time after that.

The plants and flowers will already be pre-sorted by orders, to make it easy for pick-up.

CPS continues to collaborate extensively with public health officials, NDE, the Governor’s office (DHHS), and other area school districts about COVID-19. Classes and CCLC are canceled for Monday, March 16 and Tuesday, March 17. High school extra-curricular activities will continue as originally scheduled. All staff will report both days to prepare for a possible extended closure, based on information from our partners. We continue to monitor this rapidly changing situation and will keep you updated. At this time, classes will resume Wednesday, March 18.

A detailed update is available via our website, email, and social media outlets.

Thank you for your patience and understanding as we work through this dynamic situation.

Sincerely,

Dr. McDowell",2020-03-15 18:27:25,,

Footloose -
When Ren and his mother move from Chicago to a small farming town, he is prepared for the inevitable adjustment period at his new high school. But he’s not prepared for the rigorous local edicts, including a ban on dancing instituted by the local preacher, who is determined to exercise control over the town’s youth. When the reverend’s rebellious daughter sets her sights on Ren, her roughneck boyfriend tries to sabotage Ren’s reputation, with many of the locals eager to believe the worst about the new kid. The heartfelt story that emerges pins a father longing for the son he lost against a young man aching for the father who walked out on him.

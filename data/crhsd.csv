Good afternoon, Cumberland Regional family.

As most of you know by now, Governor Murphy has mentioned that a statewide school closure is inevitable due to the threat of coronavirus. We want you to know we are prepared to continue providing educational and nutritional services, should we need to close our school. We will send messages to you regarding how to access school work and food services, and that information also will be posted on our website and social media feeds. We are working with the State and Department of Health to determine if, and when, we must close. We also are communicating with our constituent elementary schools to remain unified in our decisions when possible.

Please know that we are not pleased to be anticipating a closure, but if we must close, we have a plan ready, and school will continue at home until we can re-open safely. Notification time for a closure could be less than 24 hours, so please be prepared just in case. Thank you for your patience in this uncertain time. We will stay in touch.

Thank you.

This morning, Governor Lamont, made an executive decision to close school for the remainder of the school year. CPS students will continue to participate in the Phase 3 Virtual Learning Plan for the remainder of the school year. The last day of Virtual Learning will be on June 15, 2020.

More information regarding graduation and promotion ceremonies along with other end of year activities will be forthcoming from school principals.

Thank you for all of your support during this very challenging time. We miss our students very much but understand that the governor’s decision to close school the remainder of the year was based on the safety of our students and staff.

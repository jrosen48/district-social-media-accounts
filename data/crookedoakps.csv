This year, instead of putting out a supply list, we are putting out a wish list. If your student is coming to in-person school this year (or if you’d just like to help), please send as many of the items from the list as you feel comfortable donating. Thank you for your help!

1. Disinfectant wipes (Clorox wipes or other brands)
2. Hand sanitizer
3. Disinfectant spray (Lysol or other brands)
4. Bottle of hydrogen peroxide (mixed with water, it can be used as a disinfectant)
5. Box of Kleenex

We appreciate everything you as parents do to support us! We are looking forward to this coming school year!",2020-09-16 07:46:42.272893,,

We are so excited to announce that beginning Monday and for the next two weeks we are going to do an in person summer school. We will have the students come in for summer school Monday-Wednesday-Friday from 9-12:30. We will continue the Tuesday-Thursday play at the park at all lunch sites. Lunch will continue to be delivered each day. We will be taking the opportunity on Tuesday-Thursday to deep clean the spaces we use in summer school. As we navigate the current situation, at this time we will not be running buses. Therefore, all in- person summer school will be parent drop-off and pick-up only. Breakfast will begin at 8:45. Lunch will be served from 12-12:30.
If you are already enrolled just show up on Monday. If not you can go to the STREAM website and enroll. If you can’t find that we can get you enrolled Monday morning.

We have had a few questions. I did an online meeting with seniors, but I wanted to clarify here.

There WILL be a graduation ceremony. We just do not know when. As soon as it is ok for people to gather in bigger groups again, we will start planning. When we have a date, we will let everyone know.

Seniors will get everything they paid for with their senior fees. All seniors will receive a yearbook, a cap and gown, and a T-shirt. When these things come in, we will set up schedules to come and pick them up. The caps and gowns should be scheduled by next week so that you will have them.

We will have a senior activity. I will be doing another zoom call in the near future to decide what exactly that will be. However, date will depend on when we are allowed to gather in groups larger than 10.

As always, if you have any questions, please feel free to message me on here or through email at LKnight@crookedoak.org

Graduation—we will do everything in our power to make graduation ceremony happen! It most likely won’t be on the same day. It is our belief that the seniors deserve this ceremony and deserve being celebrated. As we get information or anything set up, we will let you know.

Senior activities and Prom—same with above. It might not look exactly the same and they won’t be on the scheduled days, but we will provide the opportunities to make wonderful memories!

I have had lots of questions regarding State Superintendent Joy Hofemister’s announcement. From what I’ve read, she will be recommending to the State Board of Education on WEDNESDAY, to close all school buildings for the remainder of the year. Her plan will include some type of “distance learning”.

First, none of this will be official until after the board meeting on Wednesday morning. The board will have to vote to approve her recommendation for this to take effect.

Second, what will distance learning look like? We do not know. I am sure that the state department will provide us guidance if this is approved. When that happens and we have a plan, we will let all students and parents know.

Finally, please know that we care about each and every one of you! We will continue to provide information as we learn. Don’t forget, we will be at the 4 designated spots handing out lunch every day this week. If that schedule ever changes, we will let you know!

First, I am very proud of our girls and boys for taking home the W and becoming district camps!!!!

Second, this is for all of those that have seen the video. I heard it in person. It was shocking. The mama bear was coming out in me! I love these kids with my whole heart. But I say this often and will say it here. Always give the appropriate people a chance to handle things. Their administration removed him, replaced him with a person that went to lengths to ensure that everything else was announced correctly. Their administration sought out ours to apologize.

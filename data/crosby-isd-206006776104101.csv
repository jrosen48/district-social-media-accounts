CHS Scheduling Info:

You may now view your student schedules in Skyward. Keep in mind the following:

-The following groups may not have full schedules: New Students, Dual Credit

-New Student Logins - Please refer to an earlier post on our FB page for guidance on the new login format for students.

-Some students may be in an elective they did not choose because of the following: They may have failed to select an alternate OR the alternate did not work in their selected schedule. Also, the state (TEA) has designated programs of study for Career and Technical classes. This may have caused some student's schedules to change in order to move through a pathway and take the sequential courses within that pathway.

With these considerations, there is a schedule change request form located on the CHS webpage and on the Counselor’s site.

This team will lead us through our Federal Inspection next year so congratulating them for rising to the absolute top of our program and preparing now to lead us through our Federal Inspection.

Also included in this announcement is a flashback video that highlights our year before the pandemic. Congrats to our outgoing commander of all cadets, Cadet Major Lexi Johnson.

Second to None - Never Quit even in the middle of this Pandemic Shutdown.

Crosby Jrotc added 2 photos and a video to the album: CONGRATULATIONS: JROTC 20-21 Senior Leaders Announcement.

Cougars,

We just got permission to do one more show. We are excited about the response and many are asking for one more show to see it again or they missed it. If you have time, please come out and check it out. In the past 21 years that I have been here, this is our best show. It's the perfect storm and our company would love for everyone to see it.

Feel free to use of the photos to help us promote Godspell.

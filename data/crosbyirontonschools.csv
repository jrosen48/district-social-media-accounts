As we begin a new school year, there are a few last minute reminders. When children board any bus starting tomorrow, they will be required to wear a face covering. They will also have to stager themselves on the bus. See the diagram. Dots on the disgram, indicate where students should be seating.

Remember, if your child must cross the road to enter the bus they must wait for a signal from the driver, indicating all traffic has stopped and it is safe to cross.

Be smart, be safe.

We are preparing School Bus Routes for for a 50% capacity restriction. (which means 38 students on a 77 passenger bus) Due to the plan set forth by MDE, we will no longer have the flexibility to provide multiple pickup and drop off locations.

We will ONLY be able to provide student(s) one pickup/drop off location.
Example: Home AM /Home PM, Daycare AM / Daycare PM, Mom's AM / Mom's PM, Dad's AM / Dad's PM
We believe we will be able to accommodate split custody along with routing that does not require a change in bus route.

Please understand we are looking to provide consistent transportation to as many students as possible and would like your students to ride on all scheduled days, which allows us to keep buses at their 50% capacity.

We want you to be aware of this transportation change to allow you time to make a decision that works best for your family.

Here at C-I Transportation we are planning for a Better school year.

Since March 18th, there have been very few school buses on the road and we wanted you to have this important reminder about your responsibilities regarding slowing and stopped school buses.

Take a minute to watch this important message. Watch until the end. https://youtu.be/AwKQ2GpsNFE

Note, If school starts with a hybrid model or only distance learning. School buses maybe on the roads delivering some distance learning materials (DLM) and/or meals, as we did in the spring. During these bus stops, we are required to use the yellow and red lights to control traffic. So, keep your eyes on the road, as these deliveries maybe made at unusual times of the day.

As we prepare School Bus Routes for this fall, we are preparing for a 50% capacity restriction. (which means 38 students on a 77 passenger bus) If this does happen, we will no longer have the flexibility to provide multiple pickup and drop off locations.

We will ONLY be able to provide your students one pickup/drop off location.
Example: Home AM /Home PM, Daycare AM / Daycare PM, Mom's AM / Mom's PM, Dad's AM / Dad's PM

As we begin dropping of distance learning material today. It is important for families who live in Crosby, Ironton and Deerwood to understand, we will be stopping at your assigned bus stops. We will be leaving CRES at the regular time.

For those of you who live out of town, we will meet you at the end of your driveway. we will do our best to be there a the normal time. This will be challenging, we have fewer bus stop with Distance Learning Materials than student stops when school is in session.

Last but not least. SAFETY of your children is our number concern. Since we are not transporting children to bus stops we are NOT able to use our 8-lamp traffic warning lights when dropping off the Distance Learning Material. Use extreme caution if you must cross the road to meet the bus. Look Left, Look Right and then Left again to make absolutely sure it is safe to cross the road.

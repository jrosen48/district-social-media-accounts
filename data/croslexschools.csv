This evening the Cros-Lex Community School's friends and families voted in support of the Sinking Fund Proposal with an unofficial vote of 1155 yes, to 666 no.

We are obviously pleased with the positive election results (still unofficial) and are grateful to everyone who voted to keep our school district and our community strong! We are also indebted to our parents, school staff, and others in the community who volunteered their time to help residents understand the benefits passing the sinking fund proposal will have to the future of our school district.

All of us in Pioneer Country look forward to beginning the work on the sinking fund proposal projects, and we will continue to keep you updated on the timeline, progress (once we can begin), with timely and transparent communication.

Dear Cros-Lex Families:

It is with tremendous sadness that I am sharing with you that Croswell-Lexington High School Long Term Substitute Teacher, and assistant to the athletic director, Zack Lanctot, lost his battle to recover from a serious car accident that occurred on Wednesday January 30th on M-53 Highway. No words can express how sad we all are with Zack’s passing.

Monday morning the district crisis team comprised of community mental health, school counselors, social workers, local counselors, and local clergy, will be at the high school to provide students with additional counseling support as long as necessary.

We will keep you updated as we receive information from the family.

We ask that you keep the Lanctot family and close friends in your prayers during this extremely difficult time.

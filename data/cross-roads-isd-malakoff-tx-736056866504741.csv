If you are going to be a New 3rd grade FFA member, going into 6th grade, or coming to the high school as a 9th grader and you might be interested in showing animals or even just a maybe, I'm thinking about it. We should go ahead and get our Quality Counts done!

If you took it last year you will be fine except if you are going into those grades list above. You change levels and have to retake it. But thank goodness when you become a freshman you don’t have to take it again! Whew!

Please do this before school starts it will save time, and it will be done!

This is a special banquet that honors the top 10 seniors in the class. Each senior invites a teacher (past or present) that has impacted them during their education here at Cross Roads. During the banquet, the student and teacher have the opportunity to speak about one another. With all that has gone on, our seniors did not get to have this opportunity. So we felt that we could do this a little different.
We would like to give all the teachers, coaches, employees and administrators the opportunity to address these students and share a memory of them, or what stood out about them, or just good wishes to these seniors. So if you taught one or all of these special kiddos, please feel free to comment on their photo.

These ladies earned their spots in the band against over 60 other Trumpet players. WOW! 😲
Natalie placed 9th in the Region Symphonic Band and Donna placed 8th in the Region Concert Band. This is such an honor that was only achieved by an immense amount of hard work, and dedication. Again, I encourage ALL students to audition, and keep auditioning year after year.

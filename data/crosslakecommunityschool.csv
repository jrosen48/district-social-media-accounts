Mrs. Refsland comes to us with many years of experience in both public and private school settings. “Math equals games. Can anyone think of a game that doesn’t involve math?” is what her students will hear. She teaches mathematics from an investigation approach.

Mrs. Refsland is completing her master’s degree in mathematics education at Bemidji State University. When she has some free time, she enjoys gardening and traveling to new places with her husband, Larry. The furthest they have traveled to is Khabarovsk, Russia. She and her husband love love the outdoors and all the joy visits from their grandchildren bring them. Mrs. Refsland looks forward to meeting our students and having a great year!

The adjustment to distance learning has been pretty crazy for me. When we found out that we would need to make the switch to distance learning, we were in a ukulele unit.

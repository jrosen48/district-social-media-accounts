CET Music Teacher Marlena Horton believes that is true - and that music can be made anywhere.

Ms. Horton has challenged CET students to combine their love for music and passion for sustainability to create an instrument out of recycled materials. Have a look at the great creations n shared so far - Owen & Rory with guitars and MJ with percussion.

Ms Horton wants to remind students that music is all around them and that they do not need an expensive instrument to be a musician.

She says: ""Having the students make their own instruments makes them think about how the instrument makes it sound, why it is in the family it is in and what materials make for the best instrument. I also feel it is important to reuse items to create them, it reinforces the idea of helping our environment and that trash can be a treasure.""",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3712205688830020&id=912422682141682,,0.0,"It is said that music soothes the soul.

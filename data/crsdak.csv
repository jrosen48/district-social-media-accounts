The Board of Education had an emergency meeting tonight to address several comments and concerns that have come from administrators, teachers, and staff.

The first change was to the school calendar. The change included a delay of the school start date to Monday, August 31st and will add an in-service day to Friday, September 4. This will allow our quarantined staff to be back full time, and will allow for additional time for training and getting the classrooms ready.

The Board also voted to designate the Copper River School District as a critical infrastructure. This allows for additional guidelines and protocols to safely ensure our students can get back into the classrooms.

As a reminder, situations as they relate to COVID-19 are ever-changing. Please make sure you ask questions and communicate through your school administrators.

School zoom meetings will continue to occur on Tuesdays at noon. Please visit the CRSD website for meeting details.

***Application deadline: midnight on Monday, March 16, 2020***

The Association of Alaska School Boards is proud to announce its 29th Annual Scholarship Award Competition. The June Nelson Memorial Scholarship is named in honor of the late June Nelson, longtime school board member from Kotzebue. June contributed much to the cause of education and will be remembered for her outstanding service on behalf of Alaska's children.

This 2019-2020 school year, AASB will award fifteen graduating seniors each with a $1,500 scholarship to apply toward their post-secondary education. The scholarship may be applied toward the student's choice of a business, trade, or a college institution.

I come to you with sad news as today, we have lost a beloved member of Crutcho Public Schools.

Cindy Alexander started her service at Crutcho Public Schools 7 years ago, spending several years in the elementary school working with the STEM program, before joining the middle school team this past August as middle school teacher. Soon as funeral arrangements are made available we will share them.

We understand that many of you may have upsetting feelings and questions about Ms. Alexander‚Äôs death. We will try to answer any questions that we can. At times like this, it is okay to have many different feelings, including sadness, anger, and disbelief. It is okay to cry.

Together, we can talk about your feelings and we will have counselors on hand available to talk. We recognize that we‚Äôve just started our winter break, if you would like to talk or be referred to a counselor please contact me at (405) 445-9705.

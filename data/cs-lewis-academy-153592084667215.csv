Bike Rodeo 2017 was a success! The kids (and officers) had a good time. We were able to register nearly 800 bikes between all three elementary schools in Santaquin. Now we'll have a much better chance of being able to get your bike back to you if it gets turned in! A huge thank you to all who helped make this event a success. And don't worry- if you didn't get a chance to register your bike, scooter, or skateboard, feel free to bring it on down to the Santaquin Police Department during our business hours.

Also, congratulations to our three lucky winners! We had a brand new bicycle and helmet giveaway at each school. The lucky winners were Hyrum, Tegan, and Livvy!",0.0,"Santaquin City Police Department

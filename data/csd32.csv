Emotionally exhausted and frustrated with social isolation?

Now that weeks have turned into months, we have to come to terms with some complicated emotions and let ourselves feel. Our feelings are just information and trying to ignore them shuts down mindfulness. “When you numb one feeling, you numb them all.” -Brené Brown. So there is a cost to ignoring our feelings. We lose the wisdom of what we are experiencing now. In fact, getting in touch with our emotions helps us have more empathy and allows us to connect better with others.

Our feelings are just information and trying to ignore them shuts down mindfulness. “When you numb one feeling, you numb them all.” -Brené Brown. So there is a cost to ignoring our feelings. We lose the wisdom of what we are experiencing now. In fact, getting in touch with our emotions helps us have more empathy and allows us to connect better with others.

Take a few minutes to view a video about emotional exhaustion and emotional intelligence, feeling our feelings, whatever they are.

Being in nature, or even viewing scenes of nature, reduces anger, fear, and stress and increases pleasant feelings. Exposure to nature not only makes you feel better emotionally, but it also contributes to your physical well being, reducing blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tension, and the production of stress hormones. Natural sunlight can reset our natural clocks and improve our sleep.

IDEAS:

1. Stand barefoot in the grass, take a deep breath, and focus on how the Earth feels on your feet.

2. Exercise outside! Even just a walk around the block can boost your mood. Listen for birds, crickets, the wind, what sounds do you hear? Even better, walk with a parent and catch up.

3. Can’t get outside? Take a live virtual tour of Yosemite National Park tonight at 6 pm.

There are 8 dimensions of wellness.
1.Emotional
2. Spiritual
3. Intellectual
4. Physical
5. Environmental
6. Financial
7. Occupational
8. Social

One idea about the 8 dimensions of wellness is if you can change your habits, you can change the quality of your life.

Today we will focus on physical wellness. Physical wellness is not just about exercise, it is also about incorporating activities that improve your physical health overall. This includes learning about nutrition, eating healthy food, moving our bodies, and avoiding tobacco, drugs, and alcohol.

Here are some steps for improving your physical wellness:

* Exercise three times a week for 20-30 minutes
* Walk whenever possible
* Get consistent sleep
* Limit or reduce sugar

What is one way you would like to improve your physical wellness, even just a little bit?

We are working to get students' personal belongings ready for pick up at the school, or drop off from buses, over the next few weeks.

We will continue to provide meals daily on bus routes and at the school until June 5th as well.

As we've said many times before, we very much appreciate your cooperation, understanding and hard work through this unique time. Please contact Tom Stack tstack@clintoncougars.com or Amanda Cyr, acyr@clintoncougars.com with any questions you have concerning your child's education for the remainder of the school year.

Thank you and take care,
Tom Stack & Amanda Cyr",2020-04-28 13:36:30,,

What is gratitude and why is it important?

Gratitude is a feeling of appreciation. You recognize that something is valuable to you which has nothing to do with its monetary worth. It’s looking for the good in our lives.

One way to encourage gratitude and change negative thinking is by changing a few simple words. Instead of saying
“I have to…” try
“I get to….”

“I GET to do school work today.”
Instead of
“I have to do school work today.”

“I GET to do chores today.”
instead of
“I have to do chores today”

When we turn our obligations into fortunate events, we can start to appreciate what we have. WE GET to do school work because we have teachers who care about us. WE GET to do chores because we have possessions to take care of and parents who provide for us.

Get mentally strong with mindfulness.

Mindfulness is the practice of constantly redirecting our attention to what we are doing at the moment. Being able to redirect our attention gives us more control over our thoughts. When we feel more in control of our inner world, we feel less pulled and controlled by our outer world.

“Wellbeing flourishes from the inside out.... We can’t chase it and we can’t buy it. It’s a form of happiness that is not dependent on external outside circumstances, or on what someone else does or says. It’s an internal state where you’re continuously reminding yourself that you’re okay as you are” Daniel Goleman

According to Goleman, mediation can help strengthen the circuits in your brain that help you react less, be triggered less, and recover more quickly, this is resilience. Additionally, meditation helps students by helping them learn, have better attention, and perform better on tests due to their improved long term memory.

There are 8 dimensions of wellness.

1. Emotional
2. Spiritual
3. Intellectual
4. Physical
5. Environmental
6. Financial
7. Occupational
8. Social

One idea about the 8 dimensions of wellness is if you can change your habits, you can change the quality of your life.

Today we will focus on spiritual wellness. Spiritual wellness is related to the values and beliefs that help you find meaning and purpose. Signs of strong spiritual health include having clear
values, a sense of self-confidence and a feeling of inner peace.

To improve spiritual wellness, some people volunteer, some pray,
some meditate, others find comfort spending time in nature. You may be helped by finding a quiet space where you can be alone
and think or it may feel like a space of playful curiosity. It is about allowing experiences that offer you hope, purpose, and meaning. Think about what makes you feel purposeful? Is it prayer? Is
it helping others? Caring for animals? Being kind?

1.Reflection question: What do you do that helps you find meaning and builds up hope?

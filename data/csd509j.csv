What is social distancing?

You’re going to keep hearing the term “social distancing” as we work together to slow the spread of COVID-19. Put simply, it means keeping your distance from other people in order to keep from catching or spreading a virus.

COVID-19 is in our communities, and now our primary goal is to slow its spread. Review the Governor's prevention strategies for COVID-19 at: http://ow.ly/eec150yLhOh",0.0,"Benton County, Oregon

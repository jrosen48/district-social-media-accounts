He is capable of lazar focus, spending countless hours refining his Illustrator project work. Yet, on-camera he is free to innovate and develop many engaging and entertaining roles that are uniquely his own. This is a capacity gifted to only a few.

I'm writing this to my 5th grade math teacher Mrs.Fernandes.

I wanted to thank her for helping us through all of her work and helping us stay strong along the way. Even when things got hard online she still stayed strong and always gave us challenges so we would stay smart and healthy.

Dear Mr. Bellinger,
Happy Teacher Appreciation week! Thank you for being such a cool teacher this whole year. I really like doing science in school and I am upset we didn’t get to finish what we started. You are doing a great job with online teaching and I love our zoom meetings each week. I am still learning new things each day even if we aren’t in the school building. I hope you are staying healthy and safe and I hope I can see you in person again soon. Enjoy this week being celebrated because you deserve it.

Although Madison excels in her haircolor techniques, her real passion is Skin Care and Makeup. Her determination and ambition to learn and conquer the newest techniques was the driving force that earned her a 2nd place in the SkillsUSA District 2 Esthetics Competition. She was one of the lead makeup artists for the SkillsUSA Halloween Fashion Show and is always there to volunteer her talent when the cosmetology class works with the local elementary and middle schools doing makeup for their plays.

Madison is currently employed in a salon and is planning to pursue her passion for a career as a stylist and makeup artist. With her sweet smile and caring personality adding to her talent, Madison is destined for success.”

You are definitely making sure that we have the education we need!

I was disappointed when I could not race for Girls on the Run. It would have been a challenge that I was excited for.

It also saddens me to know that I could not complete my 5th grade in school and to say goodbye in person. You are an amazing Teacher and I am very thankful that I had you this year.

Special thanks to you for giving me the Strength, Courage, and Confidence and believing in me, with that I will always appreciate.

Mr. Dan Hughes and Ms. Megan Lutz have been having daily office hours and weekly chats with the kids to keep everyone in the loop. It is great for my son to see his classmates every Friday on Zoom! They are always available for any questions we have with assignments. My son has been able to adapt along with their support.

His weekly speech sessions with Melanie Iuliano are looked forward to by my son.

We also appreciate all the hard work from the Nutrition staff and Ms. Stone arranging all the food deliveries to everyone!

Everyone has stepped up to work in these unusual times. We look forward to seeing all the staff in September!!!

Today, we received notification from Secretary of Education Pedro Rivera that all public schools will remain closed for the rest of the 2019-20 school year. Until we receive additional information and guidance from the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the Centennial School District will continue to provide its continuity of education plan, which will resume on Tuesday, April 14.

Davis Elementary had a great time at the BCIU STEM Challenge. Both teams completed their projects within the two hour time limit. They did a wonderful job with their presentations to the judges.

While the students were waiting for the judges to decide on the winners, they enjoyed a lovely lunch. After lunch they announced the winners. Mitchell, Max and Ernie got nominated for Best Teamwork. Even though they did not win that category, we were proud of them for being nominated. All the students received a certificate for participating.

The tradition continues…this year marks the 55th annual Black and White events at William Tennent High School! What started 55 years ago as one day in the gymnasium has exploded into a three-day, competition-laden extravaganza preceded by five weeks of planning and preparation. Divided alphabetically into two teams, Black (A - K) and White (L - Z), the participating students will face each other head-to-head in various challenges that will test their minds and bodies.

Our Academic Competition will be held on February 26 at 7:00 p.m. Doors will open at 6:15 p.m. No tickets are required for Academic Night, and family and friends are welcome to attend.

Pool Night is February 27 at 6:15 p.m. We will conclude the events with Gym Night on February 28 starting at 6:15pm. Both Pool & Gym Nights require tickets which can be purchased during all student lunches.

Unified Track & Field at William Tennent
The Special Olympics Unified Champion Schools program is aimed at promoting social inclusion through intentionally planned and implemented activities affecting systems-wide change. With sports as the foundation, the three-component model offers a unique combination of effective activities that equip young people with the tools and training to create sports, classrooms, and school climates of acceptance. These are school climates where students with disabilities feel welcome and are routinely included in, and feel a part of, all activities, opportunities and functions.

Here at William Tennent, we offer Unified Track during the PIAA Spring season. Next school year, we will also offer Unified Bocce in the PIAA Winter season.

Any students interested in being a partner or athlete for Unified Track this year can sign up in the Athletics Office or see Mr. Mulville (Room - C102).",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2627702814011027&id=817088005072526,"YOUTUBE.COM

STOP means STOP

Did you know it is illegal to pass a school bus when its red lights are flashing, and the stop arm is extended? In the state of Pennsylvania, if convicted of breaking this law, you could get a $250 fine, five points on your driving record, and a 60-day suspension of your license.

The Centennial School District bus drivers who observe this violation do prepare a written and signed report describing the incident. This statement is forwarded to local law enforcement to act upon. Many of our buses now come equipped with stop arm cameras. These cameras are automatically activated when the stop arm is extended and will record the violating vehicle's license. The recording is shared with local law enforcement.

Motorists risk children’s lives when they fail to stop for the school bus as it loads and unloads its passengers. Yet it’s estimated that over 10 million drivers illegally pass school buses every year. To keep children safe, start by learning the laws in your state.

It’s illegal to pass a school bus within the roadway as it drops off or picks up passengers—regardless of the direction of approach. Remember that there is no “safe” way to illegally pass the school bus, so be cautious when sharing the road with it. Finally, let others know that putting kids’ lives at risk is not OK. Report aggressive drivers and spread the word by sharing material found at www.schoolbusfacts.com.

Yesterday USPD investigated the report of a suspicious middle-aged female who was operating a maroon minivan that had briefly stopped at a bus stop at approx. 0825 hours and told several juveniles “The bus has already come and you missed the bus.” The female then drove away and did not engage the juveniles in any more conversation.

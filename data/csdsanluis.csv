There are two other sites that will be important as we progress through this period of remote learning. First, check in with your student that they are completing their assignments in Odysseyware. Then, check your child's grade in Alma to see how they are doing. It is also helpful to check attendance in Alma since attendance is maintained by your student's daily activity in completing assignments and joining Zoom class sessions.

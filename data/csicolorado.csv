""At Montessori, teacher Jessica LeBlanc described the routine — beginning with ringing a bell and several deep breaths. Then a song and a book. Sometimes, they brought guests, like an art teacher who demonstrated a real-time drawing, and someone from Yampatika, who taught the kids about the water cycle. One dad played guitar for the sing-a-long portion.

At the end of the class, LeBlanc said the children had the opportunity to share whatever might be going through their little heads at that moment.""

As school districts across Colorado announce school closures to help minimize the spread of the novel coronavirus, the Colorado Department of Education is working to mitigate food insecurity among youth.

Colorado received a waiver from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that allows students to take meals away from meal sites to be consumed elsewhere, allowing for social distancing. The goal is to provide meals to children while limiting interaction and proximity to other schoolmates, therefore, decreasing the risk of COVID-19 exposure.

Families are encouraged to check with their local school district for the school meal sites available in their communities.

Even more impressive…their startup was profitable within 2 weeks of being open for business. Not bad for a couple of 14 year olds!

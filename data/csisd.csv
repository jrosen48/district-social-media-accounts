The COVID-19 pandemic has changed a lot of things. But one thing that it has not changed is the generosity of others. College Station I.S.D. - its administrators, teachers, counselor, students, parents and of course PTO members made another HUGE impact on the Brazos Valley Food Bank this year.

Every year, CSISD conducts a very competitive City-Wide PTO Food & Fund Drive. All of the College Station schools participate, collecting canned goods and raising money. Because of the pandemic, and students sheltering in place, this event was impossible to do in the same way as the past. We were not even sure if it would happen at all.

But, Dawn Ament and so many others charged forward. And, look what you accomplished together? OMG😲

We've been able to ""flip the switch"" to fully online learning from our blended learning model, but we couldn't do it without the participation of our students and staff. We're reaching out to each and every student on a daily basis, asking them to remotely attend their courses, respond to emails, keep on top of their work, and be engaged with their learning. We're a family and we do not want to leave any student behind. https://www.nextechhigh.org/lansing/about/superintendents-welcome-message",0.0,"NexTech High School of Lansing

When Teachers Go The Extra Mile...

Shout out to Ms. Griffin, Tiffany Williams(Kindergarten) Ms. Bell, Mrs. Pasillas, and Mrs. Sauceda (Pre-K) for going the extra mile for their students. Both students are working hard on Razkids and logging onto Google Hangouts everyday! We appreciate you young ladies for working so hard. And one is celebrating her birthday. 🎉🎊
Also our Daycare Staff is making sure their students are safe. Great job Mrs. Hairston, Ms. Parker, Ms. Gleen, Ms. Reece and Ms. N. Hairston and Ms. Milton. 😃😃",0.0,"💙

What a day for our CSA district as our Middle and High School students participated in our 4th Annual Hike for Heat!!! This event really showcases our dedication to nurturing the Whole Child. Our students are practicing Kindness and Care during an event that is designed to benefit others. They are hiking with friends and connecting socially. Finally, they are walking between 4 to 6 miles in the falling snow, a true physical/sensory experience! Thanks to all who participated in some way:)",0.0,"Charyl Stockwell Academy District

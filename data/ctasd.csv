Thank you for your patience this morning with the dropping off of students prior to the start of school. To alleviate some of the congestion in the morning:
1. McIlwains will have the drivers adjust their AM pick up times so that their arrival is closer to 7:30 AM.
2. Should buses arrive prior to 7:30 AM, they will not sit idle in the parking lot. Instead, they have been assigned that half of the buses will report to the back of the school and the other half will report to the front of the school by the courtyard.
These two changes will allow parent drop-off to move along much faster. We will still have two mini-bus drop offs in the breezeway area.

They will then head west on Elk Avenue, turn left onto 18th Street, and then left on Market Street toward Centre Street.

We would love to have a show of support for them and are inviting you to place yourself along the route, socially distanced of course. You can be located on 18th Street or Market Street (or even Centre Street) to help celebrate our seniors. If you aren’t able to be here in person, you can listen on T102 as the ceremony will be broadcasted live in its entirety. It will also be livestreamed on the PAHS Tidelines page.

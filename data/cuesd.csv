On Saturday, March 2, 2019 the Gifted and Talented students (GATE) from Anderson Heights competed in the Creative Competitions Program called Odyssey of the Mind. The California North Association Regional Competition was held at Mt. View School in Redding and was open to all North State GATE Teams. Team “Shining Stars’ comprised of Sophia, Alison, Melina, Carly, Ayvin, and Tyler placed first in the Division I section where they acted out an original skit in front of an original backdrop wearing original costumes. The program promotes creativity by challenging teams to solve divergent problems with more than one solution. The participants learn teamwork, the appreciation and understanding of others, and that a group is a more powerful thinking force than an individual. They develop a sense of self-respect for others through preparatory activities such a brainstorming and role-playing. All work must be done by team members only.

This morning, I was welcomed to the schools in the Cascade Union Elementary School District by Superintendent Jason Provence. We were able to visit classrooms at each school, including the Learning Center at Meadow Lane, the Interactive STEAM Room and the 4th-grade classroom of Mrs. Quibell at Anderson Heights, and 8th-grade students in both Honors Math with Ms. McLean and goal setting with Ms. Morey at Anderson Middle School. It is great to see all they are working on to build a common language of expectations and the positive impact it is having on their environment.

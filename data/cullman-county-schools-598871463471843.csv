To prevent widespread flu in the schools, please keep in mind times when your child should stay at home:

-Vomiting (even once) should stay home at least 24 hours

-Diarrhea should stay home at least 24 hours

-Chills

-General malaise or feelings of fatigue, discomfort, weakness or muscle aches

-Frequent congested (wet) or croup cough

-Lots of nasal congestion with frequent blowing of nose

Ways you can help us prevent the flu and other colds:

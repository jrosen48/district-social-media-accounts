That means each and every student!

Paid and reduced students will also all be FREE for BREAKFAST AND LUNCH!! This will be in effect until December 31 or until USDA says otherwise.

VERY IMPORTANT! Please continue to fill out the household application for free and reduced form as we need those for our schools to continue to receive their federal funds. As of now, your child will go to their regular approved status in January, so this form is still very important.

Be sure to join us for breakfast and lunch for the rest of the semester at no charge!

We are excited to begin the new school year though we will have many challenges ahead of us. Our primary goal is to provide a safe and instructionally sound plan for reopening the Cullman City Schools. We are providing parents two options for their child to receive the best education possible. The Traditional option allows students to return to the school campus and receive face to face instruction, although the school day will look different than in the past. The Tradition option includes a remote opportunity transitioning from campus to online work at home as needed following guidance from the ADPH and CDC to ensure a safe learning environment. The Virtual option allows students to work from home through the Schoology learning platform. Attendance is tracked daily requiring students to log in daily to complete assignments. Grades will be given to determine promotion/retention (same as with Traditional option). With the Virtual option, instruction is directed by a virtual teacher not the classroom teacher.

We all must work together to help ensure safety by following guidance from the ADPH and CDC.
We ask that parents:
check your children’s temperatures and do not send them to school if 100.4 or greater.
Monitor your children for symptoms daily, including cough, congestion, shortness of breath, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Any positives should be kept home from school.
Our attendance policy will be revised and shared at a later date.

The CCS Central Office has sent out parent surveys via email to determine which educational option parents feel is best for their child. Parents are asked to register for one option by July 17, 2020. You will need to complete a separate form for each student in your family. This form can be accessed at https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSemX-yuiL-SB8xMs_riyJxIjDm4UfWqCmE0yAUKzM7HIYa-cg/viewform?usp=sf_link

Re: School Closure due to COVID-19

Governor Kay Ivey and State Superintendent Dr. Eric Mackey announced that students will not be returning to traditional school during the 2019-20 school year in an effort to protect our students, staff and all Alabamians as we continue to fight the spread of COVID-19. Cullman City Schools is well prepared to transition our student learning and we are actively engaged in the development of a plan that will ensure the continued success of our students.
We will be receiving additional guidance from the Alabama State Department of Education and will wait until we have that guidance to complete our plan. Our primary focus will be to ensure that students have the necessary resources to effectively move their learning forward. This will include, but not be limited to, quality meals through our child nutrition program, access to learning devices and programs, and distance learning options.
It is critical that we all do our part in adhering to the social distancing and other guidelines being emphasized by the CDC and ADPH to help stop the spread of COVID-19. Please be on the lookout for more communication via our school system’s mobile app, phone call system, and social media platforms.

Good morning Facebook Friends! The Mackey household is working at full-speed this morning with questions coming from lots of folks. I am helping to get information out and respectfully request that you share this across your networks. For the folks who get this as a share, Eric Mackey, my husband, is State Superintendent of Education.

As you can imagine, there are basically three groups of people reaching out to both Eric and myself:

1) People who are scared that the schools aren't closing until Wednesday afternoon. We can understand why folks are concerned.

2) People who are upset that schools are closing at all. We can understand why folks are concerned.

3) People who are desperately trying to figure out how to help. These folks make my heart sing.

To address situation 1: All school absences in Alabama public K-12 schools will be excused Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Parents and caregivers should make the decision that is best for their family. AL.Com posted the excused absence information earlier today.

To address situation 2: School closings are a serious hardship for parents. It's a great thing that the Federal Government is working to ensure that folks who miss work will get paid. I don't know how this will work or what the limits of this are, but there is an article on VOX.com that provides details on the bill that has come out of the House and will considered by the Senate on Monday. Whether they have paid time off or not, many parents and caregivers need time to make child care plans. Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday provide a time ""cushion"" to help families plan.

Additionally, many children will go hungry during school closings. The extra time allows for local schools and communities to make plans to feed children during the closure period. There is a Federal Waiver which will allow school feeding programs to continue during the closure. The waiver applies to school in high poverty areas and for students who are eligible for free and reduced lunch.

There has not yet been a waiver for after school and community based organization feeding programs. We will keep you posted on this.

To address situation 3: Schools, communities, churches and individuals are rushing to the front lines to make sure children are taken care of. For instance, one school we know of has the gym open this morning for people to bring food to be packed and sent home with students next week.

This is a local community challenge and, for coordinating purposes, each community is different. You know the folks in your community to connect with to make sure children's needs are met. If you want to help, reach out to those folks. Having been a social worker for 27 years, I want to remind you to expect some chaos as your local efforts come together to help students. Some communities have a natural connection that people will automatically know to reach out to while other communities will not and plans will have to be made and implemented.

This is a local community challenge and, for coordinating purposes, each community is different. You know the folks in your community to connect with to make sure children's needs are met. If you want to help, reach out to those folks. Having been a social worker for 27 years, I want to remind you to expect some chaos as your local efforts come together to help students. Some communities have a natural connection that people will automatically know to reach out to while other communities will not and plans will have to be made and implemented.

39,0.0,,0.0,http://vox.com/,,"Good morning Facebook Friends! The Mackey household is working at full-speed this morning with questions coming from lots of folks. I am helping to get information out and respectfully request that you share this across your networks. For the folks who get this as a share, Eric Mackey, my husband, is State Superintendent of Education.

As you can imagine, there are basically three groups of people reaching out to both Eric and myself:

1) People who are scared that the schools aren't closing until Wednesday afternoon. We can understand why folks are concerned.

2) People who are upset that schools are closing at all. We can understand why folks are concerned.

3) People who are desperately trying to figure out how to help. These folks make my heart sing.

To address situation 1: All school absences in Alabama public K-12 schools will be excused Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Parents and caregivers should make the decision that is best for their family. AL.Com posted the excused absence information earlier today.

To address situation 2: School closings are a serious hardship for parents. It's a great thing that the Federal Government is working to ensure that folks who miss work will get paid. I don't know how this will work or what the limits of this are, but there is an article on VOX.com that provides details on the bill that has come out of the House and will considered by the Senate on Monday. Whether they have paid time off or not, many parents and caregivers need time to make child care plans. Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday provide a time ""cushion"" to help families plan.

Additionally, many children will go hungry during school closings. The extra time allows for local schools and communities to make plans to feed children during the closure period. There is a Federal Waiver which will allow school feeding programs to continue during the closure. The waiver applies to school in high poverty areas and for students who are eligible for free and reduced lunch.

There has not yet been a waiver for after school and community based organization feeding programs. We will keep you posted on this.

Way to go Cullman City Schools! Thanks to your community's generosity, the IMAX movie project is FULLY FUNDED so now all 72 1st graders at Cullman City Primary School will get to see an IMAX movie at the McWane Center. The screen is huge and these first graders will be amazed for sure. So congrats!

And don't forget that there are lots of other great ways to help your kids on Cullman City's site (http://bit.ly/SupportCCS). The cool thing is that it doesn't take a huge donation to make a difference - every dollar truly counts. So find a ""need"" that inspires you and think abut giving a few extra bucks today.. The kids will win and you will feel good too!",0.0,"LEANSTREAMRP.COM

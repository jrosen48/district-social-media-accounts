The livestream show will showcase the creative work students have been producing while in quarantine. “Though we may not have been able to collaborate in person” said Tony Spano, AVPA’s executive director and creative director of music, “we’ve been Zooming, rehearsing, recording, and creating our work within each department and finding ways to work across subjects.”

For the first time since the inception of AVPA in 1996, there won’t be a live “Java” production to celebrate the end of the school year. After 13 “Java Drama” shows and 11 “Java Gala” productions, AVPA will present the first Virtual “Java” – JAVA GALA 2020!

The livestream show will showcase the creative work students have been producing while in quarantine. “Though we may not have been able to collaborate in person” said Tony Spano, AVPA’s executive director and creative director of music, “we’ve been Zooming, rehearsing, recording, and creating our work within each department and finding ways to work across subjects.”

Metro Los Angeles is hosting a contest to ask residents to help name the two machines that will be responsible for digging tunnels from the VA hospital campus in West LA to Westwood/UCLA on the Westside for the Purple Line Extension Transit Project-- a huge part of my #westsidefastforward initiative.

Metro’s machine naming contest has two parts. The first contest is to name the machines and is open to U.S. Veterans affiliates (veterans and VA employees) and UCLA affiliates (university employees, students and alumni). The second part of the contest is an art competition that is open to all Los Angeles County residents who will compete to illustrate their ideal community on the Purple Line Extension route.

Dear Culver City Middle School Community,

This week we have become deeply concerned about one of our teachers, Ms. Brianna Capillo, who has been missing since January 12. While her family works with authorities to locate her, we know that you will join us in sending our sincere thoughts for a safe and quick return to her family. Due to the ongoing nature of the search, there are few details that can be shared and we ask that you respect the privacy of Ms. Capillo’s family during this difficult time.

We will continue to work with Principal Villafranca and the Language Arts team to make sure Ms. Capillo’s classes are covered and that instruction continues as planned. In the case that your child has heard the news and is struggling, CCMS counselors will be available to offer support for our CCMS students.

If and when we find out more details, we will share as appropriate. For now, we send our support and prayers to Ms. Capillo’s family as they wait for her return.

Dear Culver City Middle School Community,

This week we have become deeply concerned about one of our teachers, Ms. Brianna Capillo, who has been missing since January 12. While her family works with authorities to locate her, we know that you will join us in sending our sincere thoughts for a safe and quick return to her family. Due to the ongoing nature of the search, there are few details that can be shared and we ask that you respect the privacy of Ms. Capillo’s family during this difficult time.

We will continue to work with Principal Villafranca and the Language Arts team to make sure Ms. Capillo’s classes are covered and that instruction continues as planned. In the case that your child has heard the news and is struggling, CCMS counselors will be available to offer support for our CCMS students.

If and when we find out more details, we will share as appropriate. For now, we send our support and prayers to Ms. Capillo’s family as they wait for her return.

Sincerely,

Leslie Lockhart, Superintendent",2020-01-18 23:36:33,,

She stands behind the current research and has helped her classroom families to step outside of the traditional ""box"" of assigning homework in exchange for a fresh perspective.

Diana Fannon and Chris Cole

Today, we are proud to thank the incredible team of Diana and Chris!

They are a compassionate team who are helping redefine how special education looks in CCUSD. They are on the front line of bringing inclusive practices and Universal Design for Learning (UDL) to classrooms around the district. Their belief in the potential of all learners is shown by the respect and consideration they give every day to their students and families. They lead by example, and we’re lucky to have them.

Chris received a special nomination: ""Mrs. Cole has worked tirelessly for over 25 years in the special ed department making the department run smoothly and trying to meet the diverse needs of all special ed students in the district. She works behind the scenes putting in late hours and weekends. She knows the special ed families and teachers intimately and is always available to all of us.

Delmy Pineda

Comments from just two of the many people who truly appreciate Delmy's efforts in the El Rincon Elementary School cafeteria ...

Delmy has increased breakfast participation by encouraging the inclusion of second and third graders in our Second Chance Breakfast program during recess. It's working, and participation has increased by approximately 30 meals a day. Next step – first grade!

Delmy runs a bright, clean, and welcoming kitchen at El Rincon. Students are greeted with her positive and kind presence, she knows and connects with the kids, and always has a smile on her face. The cafeteria is always decorated with welcoming pictures and signs, and everyone is excited to see what fruits and vegetables is in the salad bar.

Fallon Perdue-Smith

“I am not a teacher, but an awakener” said American Poet laureate and Pulitzer Prize winner Robert Frost.

His message: Teachers can awaken a student’s belief in themselves. Frost encourages the idea of inspiring curiosity and sparking the desire for knowing in students, and some teachers simply get students curious about discovering knowledge for themselves. They focus on their interests and inherent skills and natural talents.

CCHS's Fallon Perdue-Smith is one of those special educators.

Fallon Perdue-Smith

“I am not a teacher, but an awakener” said American Poet laureate and Pulitzer Prize winner Robert Frost.

His message: Teachers can awaken a student’s belief in themselves. Frost encourages the idea of inspiring curiosity and sparking the desire for knowing in students, and some teachers simply get students curious about discovering knowledge for themselves. They focus on their interests and inherent skills and natural talents.

CCHS's Fallon Perdue-Smith is one of those special educators.

She goes above and beyond and does everything for her students to be the best they can be.",2019-11-13 15:07:55,,

CCUSD Wants to Hear Your Thoughts

Over the last decade or more, scientific research has demonstrated that adolescents have difficulty falling asleep sleep before about 11 p.m., and need as much as nine hours of sleep per night.

In response, the American Medical Association recommended in 2016 that secondary schools begin the school day no earlier than 8:30 a.m. Some high schools that have changed to a later start time have reported initial improvements in both mental health and academic performance, although it is unclear at this time if that data is ongoing/sustained. Those sites have also had to address logistical issues to accomplish the change.

Here in California, Senate Bill 328, if passed, would require high school classes to start at 8:30 a.m. or later. CCUSD has initiated a survey to explore the idea of later start times at Culver City High School.

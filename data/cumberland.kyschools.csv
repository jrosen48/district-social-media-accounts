However, the district then received notice from the KY Department of Education and Governor’s office that stated in-person classes should not begin before August 14 due to increased spread of Covid-19.

Therefore, the decision was made to keep the original start date of August 13 and begin the Virtual Instruction Program (VIP) for all students.

The goal of the school district is to provide a safe return for students to in-person classes as soon as state and public health officials permit. It is not known at this time when that date may be.

Nonetheless, the district is hopeful that resumption of in-person classes may occur as early as the third week of August or soon thereafter.

VIP will also remain as an option all year.

Please remember that another update will be posted no later than April 3rd for determining the closure for the rest of the year or not.

Dear Parents:
The Board of Directors of the Cumberland and Leadership Academy’s met yesterday to decide on extending school closure. As you are aware the Governor of Texas made the decision to close all Texas Public Schools through April 3. After reviewing current information on the COVID-19 virus in our city and nation, the Board believes it is too early to see what effect the virus will have on Smith County to make any decision on a more extended closure. However, seeing the effects of the virus on other areas of our country, the Board believes that it is unlikely we will be able to open again before the end of this school year and you should plan accordingly. A determination for long-term closure will likely be made in the next two weeks. What we are doing and will do will make a difference; and, we will all be safer.

Yours Thoughtfully,

Jim Cotton, MD

We would like to invite you to join us at the cafeteria entrance from 7:35-7:55 to provide a warm welcome to our students as they walk into the building to test. We will be greeting our students, giving high-fives, offering warm words and smiles as our students walk into school to show them how much we care about their success, and try to help them remain as calm and positive as possible. Please join us next Tuesday and Wednesday morning at the cafeteria entrance! We look forward to seeing you here!

Chinese Economy Global Locomotive but Significant Risks

China’s early success in combating the coronavirus, along with positive results from China’s policy stimulus measures, have reversed the drag on the economy.

Early in the year, government spending was increased substantially, in part because of massive public health material and equipment needs. There were also VAT and income tax reductions, accelerated disbursement of unemployment insurance payments, waived social security contributions, and increased public investments. In sum, discretionary fiscal measures equal to 4.1% of GDP were provided in the first half. Looking ahead, significant further infrastructure spending is likely.

by Bob Eisenbeis

During the pandemic we have seen both a drop in aggregate demand as well as a shutdown in supply, resulting in a precipitous drop in capacity utilization. To many economists, this convergence means that inflation will be benign in the foreseeable future. We know that excess demand serves to bid up prices, but is there reliable information on the supply side in terms of capacity utilization that also conveys meaningful information about price pressures as well? To address this question, it is useful to look at the long-run relationship between capacity utilization (blue) and inflation (red).

At the same time, the Federal Reserve has stepped up to bolster financial markets, having announced, in addition to its ongoing support of the repo market, a series of 10 loan programs, some old and some resurrected from the 2008 financial crisis.

So far, markets have responded relatively favorably to the announced programs and have backed up from their lows. But aside from the injection of funds to support business in the first congressional stimulus program, the markets’ response has been based only on hope rather than tangible evidence that the programs are having the desired effect.

Short-Term vs. Long-Term VIX
by Leo Chen Ph.D.

As the equity markets rally from the March 24th bottom gains steam, the VIX volatility index has more than halved since its all-time high on March 16th. VIX hit the 80 level for the first time during the financial crisis. Unlike a decade ago, it only took a month for the VIX to drop below 40 from the peak. Not only was the absolute level of VIX in March unprecedented, but also the velocity of VIX change was unparalleled in the history of the index. Even though the equity market has rebounded over 30% since the March low, a 30-handle VIX is likely to stay as long as the large daily swings remain.

In our opinion, investors should not be deceived by any promise of a definitive Trump Trade War settlement. It isn’t in the cards. The best outcome is a truce, and even that will be more like a ceasefire. As of this writing, U.S.-China tariff talks continue, and a phase one trade deal is still expected to be passed. Global equities (excluding China, HK) have rallied on improving growth outlooks, assuming that trade talks will lead to a ceasefire and not to the imposition of more Trump tariffs on December 15.

US financial markets may celebrate a ceasefire as an alternative preferable to an economic shooting war. So it may be that less tariff shooting is better than more tariff shooting. But we must remember that Trump likes the money from the tariffs. The US is collecting those tariffs from American firms, and the amount they produce is now paying about one fourth of the interest bill on the US net debt.

We offer this week’s short video discussing current market conditions and how we are positioning portfolios. This week, we talk about how we trade news and noise.

These are not revised assessments, and circumstances may have changed in the market from the time of original publication. Your feedback is always welcome.

After 3 years of BREXIT worry and 18 months of China negotiations, we’ve got a little resolution. However…
-We don’t trade BREXIT
-We don’t trade GDP
-We don’t trade economic numbers
-We trade securities – Matt explains

We look at charts, SPY, our cash levels, sectors showing good relative strength vs SPY, International, Bonds (Fixed Income) and more.

So, how do we trade news and noise? We have to look at, not what the news is, but how the market trades on that news.

In our opinion, investors should not be deceived by any promise of a definitive Trump Trade War settlement. It isn’t in the cards. The best outcome is a truce, and even that will be more like a ceasefire. As of this writing, U.S.-China tariff talks continue, and a phase one trade deal is still expected to be passed. Global equities (excluding China, HK) have rallied on improving growth outlooks, assuming that trade talks will lead to a ceasefire and not to the imposition of more Trump tariffs on December 15.

US financial markets may celebrate a ceasefire as an alternative preferable to an economic shooting war. So it may be that less tariff shooting is better than more tariff shooting. But we must remember that Trump likes the money from the tariffs. The US is collecting those tariffs from American firms, and the amount they produce is now paying about one fourth of the interest bill on the US net debt.

#TradeWar #China #Tariffs

The United States has gotten itself into a trade war negotiations mess.

Will it manage to dig its way out of the hole and will ETFs play a role? David Kotok, chairman and CIO, Cumberland Advisors examines.

China: the enemy?

There is an old adage: “When you’re in a hole and it’s getting deeper, stop digging!” Trump and Co. know they’re in a mess but don’t know how to stop digging, so they have been floundering while the adversary (China) outplays the US.

Now, we don’t defend China. It is an authoritarian regime without electoral-calendar constraints. And the United States has clear competitive and security concerns.

That said, we think the US picked the wrong type of fight and must change its terms to win. We would simply separate intellectual property from soybeans and lobsters and washing machines.

Be very precise on targets. And don’t punish Americans with a sales tax masquerading as a tariff.

While Washington (politics and baseball) dominates the headlines, the American farmer continues to be bludgeoned by the Peter Navarro-designed and Donald Trump-approved trade war. The last two years have seen a significant erosion in US agricultural exports, and farmers have been badly hurt.

We have written many times about time lags in trade policy. It takes a year or more to get from tweeting threats to actual and measurable destructive outcomes. So here’s an update on outcomes of Navarro’s advice for the broad-based tariffs, which advice Trump followed. In doing so, Trump invited retaliatory tariffs on Agriculture and Aquaculture. Nearly every economist I’ve met advised against Navarro’s policy prescription. At this summer’s gathering in Maine, only 1 supported Navarro; 36 opposed; 3 were unsure.

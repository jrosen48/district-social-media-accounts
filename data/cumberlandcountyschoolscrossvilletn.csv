Pre-K - 8th grade student supply list

High School:
Because there are many different teachers and possible class combinations, it is difficult to have one specific list per grade. Once your student has his/her schedule, they can check the individual teacher's list on the school's webpage which can be located here: ccschools.k12tn.net . Most high school lists contain the basics such as binders, paper, pencils, etc.

Pre-K - 8th grade student supply list

High School:
Because there are many different teachers and possible class combinations, it is difficult to have one specific list per grade. Once your student has his/her schedule, they can check the individual teacher's list on the school's webpage which can be located here: ccschools.k12tn.net . Most high school lists contain the basics such as binders, paper, pencils, etc.

HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS/PARENTS:
☑️If you would like to pick up a high school packet from Staples, please CALL 931-707-0533 first and give them your name, school, your teacher’s first/last name and the name of the class.
☑️Calling ahead will cut down on your wait time drastically as well as help Staples get an idea of how many packets need to be printed. High school packet 1 will still be available. Since some high school teachers did a larger packet 1, they did not submit a new one for packet 2.

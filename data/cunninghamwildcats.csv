We've learned a better option to receive this info is through the actual PowerSchool App. If you download the app (from your app store search ""PowerSchool"") and login that way, it will:

1) keep you logged in so you don't have to keep logging in and attempt to remember your username and password

These high schoolers are wrapping up their basketball regular season games, and also their youth coaching seasons! Trey, Isaiah, Holly, Morgan, Lane, and Nathan played Friday nights (sometimes getting home pretty late!) and then gave up their Saturday morning sleep-in to coach our younger Wildcats ‚ù§üêæüèÄ Coaching also required practice and planning time, and for some even jersey laundry duty. I'm pretty sure they have FANS FOR LIFE with their players! I'm thankful for the role models they are providing for the younger kids ‚ù§ Thank you to each of them!",2020-02-19 23:03:17,,

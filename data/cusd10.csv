One Book, One School is a school-wide family reading event. Each family reads the same assigned chapter; the school and individual teachers share activities based on the book.

Principal Dr. Julie Haake says ""Every family in the entire school is reading the same book at the same time. This is an amazing remote learning literacy project that brings our whole school community together."" #KahoksStepUp #ILSCHOOLSSTEPUP #thekahokway #proudtobeakahok",2020-04-17 09:08:19,,

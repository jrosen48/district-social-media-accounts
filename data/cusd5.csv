There are more than 10 districts/schools within a 40 mile radius of Oakland that either started the year full-remote or have had to go full-remote for at least two weeks due to positive cases.

Our first two weeks here at Oakland CUSD #5 have been GREAT!!! We couldn't have asked for a better start.

Everyone wants to continue with in-person learning. When dropping your child off in the morning or picking them up in the afternoon, please remember to maintain 6 feet of social distancing if you aren't wearing a mask.

We don't want to start a mask vs no mask conversation .... we simply want to keep seeing our students in-person.

In order to make all these decisions, we have to have registration.

Mr. Welch, Industrial Technology teacher, recently received this email from freshman OHS student Krayten Willison .....

Good Afternoon Mr. Welch

I am responding to let you know that I am receiving your emails.

I also wanted to share with you want I am doing at home. I recently had a request from my aunt who is a nurse at Sarah Bush, and she wanted me to make face mask buckles that go on the back of your head and your facemask straps onto them, to prevent the straps from rubbing on your ears.

I have 3D printed 30 of the buckles and given them to the hospital.

I also wanted to let you know that I EMAILED you my assignment and it is completed.

This is a great example of making the most of remote learning. Not only is Krayten learning about and practicing a skill, 3D printing, that he can use in his future, he is also helping our community in this time of need.

Great job Krayten!!!!

As Mr. Landeck said in his most recent video, in most cases the assignment is simply posted online and you do not need the internet to complete it. For example, the math problems may be posted online, but you can simply do them on a piece of loose leaf paper.

As you complete assignments, please feel free to turn them into your teacher electronically. You can take a picture of your work and email it to them. If you can not turn the assignments in electronically, there are marked boxes in the Lake Crest foyer for completed work. Remember, this week's work is due at noon on Monday, April 13th.

29 veterans and their family members were served a breakfast of biscuits & gravy, hash browns, eggs, & fruit that was prepared by the OHS Culinary Occupations students. In addition to welcoming and seating our guests, the OHS National Honor Society members helped served the meal. While eating, the veterans were entertained by the K-5 students with a few songs.

Following breakfast, a program was held for the veterans. Students have had special lessons about Veterans Day and the branches of the military. During the program, students of all ages shared what they learned with the veterans.

At the conclusion of the program, veterans exited to applause through a tunnel of 6th-12th grade students and teachers.

A special thanks to Mrs. Wright, Mrs.Strader, Mrs. Lee, Mr. Fleckenstein, and Mrs. Pendergast-White for all of their hard work to assure this program is a success.

School Resource Officer Brewer brought in fingerprint dust and supplies to lift prints off several objects. Students made comparisons of prints lifted with their own fingerprints. Students learned that a fingerprint is an individual characteristic-no two people have the same exact fingerprint pattern and that patterns remain unchanged for life

This was a fun lab in which everyone learned the types of prints and what their own prints are. In the US, the most common pattern is the loop-60%, the whorl-35% and the arch-5%.

Next up, Anatomy students will be looking at the individual minutiae on a print and then identify the minutiae on their own prints they have made.

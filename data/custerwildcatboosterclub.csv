Custer School District meal deliveries have been extended throughout the summer. The meal delivery days and times have had to be adjusted.

Tuesdays and Thursdays: CES – Door C pick-up will go from 11:00am-11:20am. The Pringle (11:15am) and 4-Mile (12:00pm) deliveries will remain the same. The intersection of Highway 385 & Highway 16 delivery will be from 11:45am-12:00pm. Aspen View will be from 12:10pm-12:30pm. Triple T will be from 12:45pm-1:00pm. There will no longer be an armory delivery. Those wanting meals will need to come to the drop-off points at the new times. Students will still get breakfasts and lunches for 7 days a week but within the two deliveries instead of the three deliveries, we had been doing each week. Thank you.

We have assembled Reopening Task Force Teams that have already started to difficult task of examining every aspect of our operation in preparation for resuming, in some capacity, this fall.

We have created three surveys. One for parents and guardians, one for 6th-12th grade students, and one for faculty members. The surveys will be used to help the Task Force Teams make decisions about the capacity in which we can reopen.

The parent/guardian and student surveys will be sent via e-mail, will be available on the website, and paper copies will be available at the Board Offices. The surveys do require student ID numbers to maintain authenticity. We ask that the surveys are returned electronically or in the drop-box outside the Board offices no later than Friday, June 12.

While many more questions than answers remain, we appreciate your input and cooperation. Be well, stay safe, and as always GO BLACK TIGERS!",2020-05-29 13:01:09,,

Why does the levy amount appear on the 1st half 2019 tax bill that was just received?

When a levy is passed in a calendar year, it is applied to the entire calendar year in which the levy is approved by the voters and collection begins in the subsequent calendar year.

In this case, the levy passed in November 2019 is applied to the entire calendar year 2019 and collection begins in 2020 which is why the levy appears on current tax bills.

Specifically, real property taxes are paid in January and July of the calendar year following the tax year (TY) for which the taxes are levied. Thus, the county treasurer will collect the first half of TY ’19 real property taxes in January 2020. Collection of the second half of TY ’19 collections will occur in July 2020.

We hope this has been helpful. For more information, visit the county auditor's website:

We have seen posts regarding our district calendar; in particular, the mid-August start date. We have been on the same schedule for at least three years. For example, our Convocation Day was August 14 kicking off the 2017-18 school year. Similarly, Convocation Day was August 13 last year. The BOE adopted calendar for next year, 2020-2021, has Convocation Day on August 17.

Members of the Six-District Educational Compact start on or about the same date. This year, Kent is a week later based on their needs and Tallmadge starts August 22 due to construction.

The calendar has shifted over the last few years due to testing and to get the first semester done before Winter Break. The semester break then aligns with our university partners for the sake of College Credit Plus courses.

As a result of the shift, the school year is complete prior to Memorial Day. We hope this helps explain the reasons why the start date of school has shifted for many districts over the last few years.

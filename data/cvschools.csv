ü§î DID YOU KNOW? All Pennsylvania school buses must be ‚ÄúNational School Bus Yellow,‚Äù which was designated as such by the 1939 National Conference on School Bus Standards. Why yellow? Yellow is an attention-grabbing color that is most noticed over all other colors and is easier to detect in dim light or bad weather. #BusSafetyLawsSaveLives #YellowBus #BusDriversAreSuperheroes #SchoolBusSafety #ThankABusDriver",2019-10-21 11:53:21,,

WHAT IS A PRISM CONCERT? Named for the prism which reveals the varied colors of light, a Prism Concert showcases the many facets of our music department without pause or applause between performances.

The doors close. The auditorium darkens. A moment later a trio of musicians is illuminated and music is heard. As the last arpeggiated chord sounds and the spotlight fades, the opening notes of a choral number ring out. A change in lighting now reveals a group standing on risers in a front corner of the auditorium.

The program continues until the audience has heard from all of the featured performers that evening, concluding with a grand finale!

This concert is FREE and open to the public, no ticket needed. But it is ONE NIGHT ONLY, so be sure not to miss it!

These young people are outstanding representatives of their schools. They excel in the classroom, in the arts, sports and other extracurricular activities, and they find time to volunteer in our community and hold down part-time jobs.

If you weren’t aware, due to the financial responsibility of our district and the lower-than-estimated budget costs of the new high school construction, some funds that (by law) must be used on facilities have been used to resurface our football/soccer field with turf. The process began several weeks ago, and here is its current status.

Without the need for grass recovery in between playing or practice time, we are able to increase the opportunity for student activities by as much as four times (or more) than the current on-ﬁeld time. That's a lot of opportunity for kids in band, color guard, soccer, Lacrosse, football, our middle school teams, youth leagues and more.

All three of our district high school fields will have green synthetic turf branded with their names and logos.

Thanks to Mr. Schmidt for the drone pics. They captured the progress in a way that we otherwise couldn’t have seen!

While the school year was cut short, our leadership classes still created valuable memories through spirit weeks, Bench & Homecoming, Stinky Sneaker, and even the simple day-to-day activities. Ms. Kern put together a highlight reel so that even though we can’t finish the year, we are reminded that we are always Titan Strong.

We want to share something pretty cool with all of you.

Mica Peak High School just learned that the Washington State School Board, the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, and the Educational Opportunity Gap Oversight and Accountability Committee is recognizing us in the area of excellence in growth for students who receive special education services.

Just a couple of years ago, we were recognized by the same committees for excellence in closing the achievement gap.

This is not due to a handful of staff members. This is due to having a true school community: Staff, students, parents, and community partners who all communicate, who all work towards empowering our students.￼￼

If we are going to be remembered for anything as a school community, we’re proud to know that we can stand by the fact that every single student at our school, every single one of them, has a fair chance to work towards chasing whatever dream in life they want to chase.

And we will stay committed to that effort with or without a pandemic.",4.0,"Congratulations Mica Peak High School on this well deserved achievement and recognition!

A wolverine is not just a character, but an animal that has a commanding presence.

She can be a warrior who defends her area, where it is okay to step outside of social norms.

She has the determination to get the job done, and she is confident in her ability to find the strength to carry on.

Some say she is uncompromising to others, but it’s her determination to take care of her pack and help her fellow wolverine.

She has a powerful mind. She is courageous in all of her battles, whether on land, water, or in the classroom.

She is a learner, and she can be tenacious.

She can not only have a ferocious appetite, but she can be ferocious when defending her loved ones.

A wolverine can be a bit of a loner, but here, at her home, she is a part of a big family.

She is willing to put all aside to make sure her fellow wolverines are all taken care of and safe.

She adapts.

She overcomes with the attitude of “Bring It On.”

She perseveres.

She survives.

Our Titan family is at its best when we work together!

World Character Day is a time to come together as a community to make this the best place we possibly can. Our goal is to promote inclusion (EVERYONE has a chance to participate), celebrate differences (it’s great to see all of the different things our students are a part of), and build a community of trust and support where all students feel like UHigh is the place they want to be.

While you might only be in 4 seconds of the video, your full participation in those 4 seconds makes the entire video look great!

You might be only 1 person in a school of 1800, but all of you make our Titan community!

Hey, do you have our new number?

Effective July 1, 2017, CVSD will have a new phone prefix and some phone number changes for some schools.

In order to accommodate our district’s growth, ALL CVSD phone numbers are moving to a new “558” prefix rather than “228” so that we have room to expand for our needs.

Some school numbers will change in entirety, so please check your school or department web site for the correct number. Thank you for your patience with our progress.

Our new main CVSD number is 509-558-5400.

The prefix for ALL CVSD phone numbers are changing from 228 to 558.

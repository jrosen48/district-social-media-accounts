We all miss the students so much, and want to show them we are still here for them and supporting them along this new way of learning. Some staff will also be riding in firetrucks from the NSC Fire Department and the Black Panther activity bus – so be on the lookout for some familiar faces on those as well!

The weather is supposed to be nice, so find the nearest spot along the route and get ready to wave, cheer, yell, and offer encouraging words to each other – we are all in this together!

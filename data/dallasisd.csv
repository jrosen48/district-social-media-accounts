Time is winding down, but there is still time FOR YOU to take action. The streets have been talking heavily about the power of your vote, but if we want full representation in Dallas, we have to let our voices be heard by completing the Census so that we can all be counted. Our community's representation in Congress relies heavily on the number of people counted in each area and by taking the Census you are helping to change the narrative over the next 10 years. YUP 10 YEARS,

This is THE MOST Convenient Census Ever. Take the Census online, by phone, or by mail. Quick and simple.No need to leave home. Whether online, by telephone, or by mail, the only steps you need to take are on the census form.

COVID-19 Remote Learning Survey for Parents.
https://forms.gle/KTkPFffT6jKbQhT58

Danbury Parents:
As we close out the 2019-20 school year and turn our thoughts to 2020-21, we felt it was very important to gather your feedback on your experiences for the past few months. Thank you all for your patience and hard work as we transitioned into an alternative learning format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope to return to school in the fall, but know that this will depend on a close monitoring of the virus over the summer and rely on guidance from state and local authorities.

In order to plan for a full return, as well as a possible blended learning models for the fall, we need your input! Please take a few moments to provide us your feedback. Delivering the best possible educational experience to our Lakers is of the greatest importance to us.

Thank you for taking the time to answer these important questions.",7.0,"PARENTS:

6-7pm tonight (Thursday, May 21) is the final scheduled pickup/dropoff opportunity.
If you have textbooks, library books, school supplies, uniforms, instruments, or anything else that needs to be returned to the school, please plan on dropping it off during that time. Chromebooks will remain home over the summer.
When you come, we'll also return any belongings left in desks or lockers as well as any pictures or awards that have not yet been picked up. Many teachers have special gifts for their students so be sure to stop by!
Have a great summer!

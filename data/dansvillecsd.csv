Over the last few weeks, DHS freshman Maggie Bacon has started baking desserts. She is taking donations for the goodies and plans to donate the money towards the DCSD backpack program. Maggie is planning to donate $500! For Mother’s Day, she prepared and delivered 16 items!

Maggie says, ""During this craziness of the COVID-19 quarantine we are all in, I have discovered a love of baking. Baking has given me an outlet to showcase my creativity and quite frankly has become very therapeutic. I have even started an Instagram Account called the.bacon.baker....feel free to follow!! I have gotten many followers and people are putting in requests for items and they want to pay me. My original intent was not to make money, so I would like to find a way to help others by donating the profits to those in need. As a proud Dansville Mustang, I have seen how the district has gone above and beyond to support the students and I would like to follow that example.""

CONGRATULATIONS! The Livingston County Board of Supervisors and Youth Bureau are pleased to announce the winners of the 2020 Teen Recognition Awards.

These awards are earned by high school teens as young as 15 who are committed to community improvement, demonstrate leadership, or are a role model to others because they have overcome personal challenges. These are the youth in our community who subtly go about making the world around them a little more special by their actions and attitudes. Since 1995, over 1,800 youth have been recognized.

Relationships are the cornerstone of positive youth development; therefore, this recognition is not possible without the support of the nominators. Nominators come from a variety of places: schools, churches, neighborhoods, civic organizations and clubs. We appreciate the time they took to notice the good in these youth. https://bit.ly/3bvYU8D",4.0,"Livingston County, New York

Unless things change, families can come to the school between 8 and 3 on Wednesday to pick up chromebooks, packets of materials, personal items and medication. As Dr. Alioto said in his letter to families - these pickups will be brief and please be mindful of social distancing. If you have your own computers at home, you do not have to take a chromebook but you will want to come in to gather the instructional packets and personal items. Thank you!",2020-03-17 13:09:32,,

Hello Primary School Families,

On Wednesday, March 18th, you will be permitted to come to the Primary School Bus Loop between the hours of 8:00am to 3:00pm to pick up prepared grade-level instructional packets for your child(ren). Teachers have been working hard putting together materials that will be essential to maintaining learning during this extended school closing.

Teachers will have packets ready for pick up in the Primary School Bus Loop. Each packet will be organized by grade level and have children’s names on them. If families need something from the classroom, one of our staff will be happy to retrieve it from the classroom for you. We are only distributing materials at the designated areas at the Primary School Bus Loop.

If you have any questions or need to make other arrangements please call the Primary School Main Office at 335-4040 x. 2004.

The High School Counselors and Honors Academy Advisers are excited to be sponsoring a field trip to the National College Fair in Rochester! This trip is open to all members of the junior class and to sophomores in the Honors Academy. Attending the College Fair will be a wonderful way for you to get information about many different colleges and to talk with admissions officers. There will be almost 200 colleges from around the country represented there, so being prepared will help you make the best use of your time.

We will only have one bus going, so the first 40 students who turn their completed packet (all three items on the checklist below) back into the Counseling Office will be the ones able to join us. Please see Mr. Kastner if you have any questions, or if you need help getting the required information.

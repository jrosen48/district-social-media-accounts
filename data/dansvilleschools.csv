Serving will begin at Door #3 behind the elementary cafeteria starting at 11 AM and running until 1 PM.

PLEASE NOTE THIS CHANGE: we are giving boxes with 5 breakfasts and 5 lunches per student instead of 4! This means on Friday we will be distributing two days of breakfast and lunch meals instead of three.

We are happy to share that we will continue to provide meals and other supplies throughout the month of June, after school is out. We will send more details in the weeks to come, but wanted you to know we are going to make this happen to continue to support our Aggie Family!

This event is near and dear to the hearts of our students, staff and alumni. At this event we present scholarship monies to our graduating seniors. This year we were prepared to present over $27,000. We are going to take some time over the next several days to publicly recognize these deserving seniors.

Our next senior is Jonathan Daman from Dansville High School. Jonathan was in our Engineering Technologies program his junior year and Precision Machining Technology this year. He plans to continue his education at Lansing Community College and transfer to either MSU or FSU to study tooling/industrial design or mechanical engineering.

Jonathan is the recipient of both the Student Success Scholarship and the Capital Area Tooling Partnership Scholarship. Congratulations, Jonathan!

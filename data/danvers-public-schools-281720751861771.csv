Every year the Forestry Department receives tree seedlings and gives them to the Danvers Public Schools to celebrate Arbor Day. Since we can't give them out to the kiddos to bring home this year, we are sharing the seedlings with you! We have placed 12 buckets with seedlings around town in various locations. Feel free to take one! Planting it will make a great social distancing and/or home schooling activity 🌳

The seedlings are #goldrain trees which are a smaller ornamental species with yellow flowers in the late summer. They grow to about 25 feet tall and prefer the sun ☀️

Fill out your 2020 census today!
An accurate count is vital in order to help our schools get needed resources.

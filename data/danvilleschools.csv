After being in contact with the Danville Police Department and the Boyle County Health Department this morning we have updated the plan for tonight's drive-through senior recognition ceremony!

All seniors need to plan to drive in the parade with others leaving from DHS @ 8:30pm.

*It is permissible for each senior to get out of their car and stop for a picture at their own sign during the parade. No group pictures.

Please make sure the senior athletes know that they will not be standing by their sign for the parade. Instead, they will take part in the car parade with everyone else.

Anyone participating should meet in the back parking lot at DHS to caravan through Ave. of Champions together. Please stay in your cars while in the parking lot.

This has been recommended by the Boyle County Health Department to help ensure we are meeting all distancing guidelines.

See you tonight!

Favorite high school memory/memories?
Honestly my favorite memories during high school would just be every time I saw my friends along with the memories of meeting my newer friends. They all hold a very special space in my heart and it breaks my heart knowing that soon I probably won't ever see them again because they're my family and nothing will change that and the last favorite memory I have is when Ethan started a fire in the Engineering room and just sat there not knowing what to do for around 5 minutes, that was pretty great, I'll never forget the look on Mr. Goodwin's face the moment he realized what was going on.

The article discusses how the closure of schools can impact child abuse cases.

“In Danville Public Schools, educators are taking advantage of the few glimpses of children they still get. The school system is delivering meals by bus to its nearly 6,000 students in rural Southern Virginia, where 1 in 4 families live below the poverty line. On those trips, said director for student support services Robin Owens, nutrition staffers make sure to “engage with families” as much as they can and try to catch sight of children.

4th graders at E.A. Gibson visited Jamestown on November 1st. The students went on three tours while there (James Fort Tour, First Africans Tour, Guided Archaearium Tour) and participated in two interactive exhibits (Ed Shed and the Dig Box).

For many of the students it was their first time on a boat (ferry). The students learned about life in Jamestown and how those living there learned to survive in the new world.

Thank you to the following businesses and organizations who made this trip possible for so many deserving students: Davenport Energy, Shields Power Washing, Walmart Danville - Mount Cross Rd, and the Danville Public Schools Education Foundation. A special thanks to Michelle Deighton Carlsen, a 4th grade math/history teacher at Gibson, for organizing this trip!

After the first 8 days of school we are making some changes going forward for our 5-12 students.
Students will still remain with their grade level peers during the school day, be expected to wear a mask and socially distance when possible.
However, starting on Tuesday 9/8/2020 they will have opportunities to leave their homeroom during the week to go to Shop, Art, Music and PE if they have those classes.
This is a change that teachers and administration feel is in the best interest of student learning and our students have expressed excitement to get into those hands-on classes to learn.

Thank you for your understanding and support,

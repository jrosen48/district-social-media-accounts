Every ""Thankful"" Thursday my students get to write a letter to anyone in the whole world to let that person know he/she is thankful for them. A few weeks ago, Chloe Coleman, decided to write Cam Newton, the quarterback for the Carolina Panthers, since the Panthers are her and her Dad's favorite football team. I mailed the letter to the Cam Newton Foundation and Chloe received a package in the mail at FFES from them! The package contained a letter typed to Chloe stressing the importance of working hard in school to achieve her dreams, and she got a picture of Cam with his autograph on it! To make things even more exciting, the package also included a signed picture and another letter for the entire class to enjoy! I love that the letter included ""Cam believes you can do anything you set your mind to, so dream big!""💗 What a great lesson for all!

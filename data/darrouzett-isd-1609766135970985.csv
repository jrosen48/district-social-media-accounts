I have served on the House Public Education Committee since 2013, and currently am one of three House members on the School Finance Commission. This commission is studying school finance issues and working to find a solution, whether that involves reforming the current system or creating a new one. I want to give everyone in House District 88 the opportunity to share ideas, so I will be visiting every school board in the district before school starts in the fall. Our office will be reaching out to each school to schedule a visit. These meetings will be open to the public, and we will do our best to provide notice of dates and times. We have over 50 districts to visit, so we are asking some districts to combine with neighboring districts and hold a joint meeting when possible.

What does this mean?
If you have a child or know of a family that has a child that is four years old, we will be accepting applications starting on FRIDAY!

The PreK/GSRP Program is a free, all-day preschool that will provide quality instruction and meals to 4-year-olds.

Since DEA is operating virtually right now, the PreK classroom will also be virtual, however, once we go back into the building, it would be a full-day program that meets Mon, Tues, Thurs, and Friday, just like the rest of the school.

If you are interested in an application, please complete this prescreening form: https://forms.gle/VhenG8WYM9ATUiUN8

Applications will be sent electronically, beginning this Friday!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10163811779805276&id=497379650275,,0.0,"DEA is pleased to announce the opening of the David Ellis Academy PreK/GSRP program!

In order to ensure that we can adequately prepare for the unknown factors surrounding COVID-19, the David Ellis Academies will be closed on Friday, March 13 for students.

If it becomes necessary to close the school buildings for an extended period of time, Google Classroom will be an instrumental part of the online learning environment. Therefore, staff members will be reporting to receive additional Google Classroom training.

We understand that this may be an inconvenience to some, so we apologize for the late notice. We were planning to be closed on Monday, however, due to the closing of many of the surrounding districts, we have decided to close for students tomorrow.

Dear David Ellis Academy Families,

Please be advised that effective immediately the decision has been made to cancel all after-school activities except tutoring, etc. and non-essential gatherings (field trips, basketball games, karate, drum line, dance, etc) until further notice. We will continue to offer morning and afternoon KidZone service until further notice. Parents are asked to make the necessary arrangements to ensure their children are picked up on time at dismissal.

Thank you for your individual efforts to keep our students, staff, and your families safe. Moving forward our school will make determinations foremost on the safety and well-being of students, staff and our entire school community, and with the input of local and state officials. We thank you for your continued support and partnership as we address this situation together.

As we continue to monitor the Coronavirus' effects on our community, we ask that you continue to do the following:

-Use good hygiene practices to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases.
-Stay home if you are sick, and advise others to do the same.
-Always cover coughs or sneezes with a tissue or sleeve.
-Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
-Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
-Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.
-Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and warm water are not available.
-Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces (computers, keyboards, desks, etc.).
-It’s not too late to get your flu shot! While the influenza vaccine does not protect against COVID-19 infection, it can help keep you healthy during the flu season.

Governor Whitmer cuts charter school funding!

October 1, 2019 at 3:49 PM ·

‼️ In a devastating move, Governor Gretchen Whitmer used a line item veto to eliminate the originally proposed budget increase of $240 per-pupil for charter school students, and charter school students alone. Charter students will be affected as early as Oct. 20, 2019.

Act now to tell your lawmakers this is NOT ok.

As the week's weather forecast has impacted our schedule, our student-led, parent teacher conferences have been rescheduled. Conferences will now take place on Friday, February 15, 2019 from 12:30 p.m. - 6:00 p.m. This will be an early dismissal for students at 11:15 a.m. As the online system will not hold your original time slot due to the date change, you will need to go online and sign in again. The teachers and Mrs. Brown will be available to assist you in making your appointments if needed.

We wanted to start by thanking you all as parents and caregivers for your fantastic support and patience. We are particularly appreciative of everything that you have been doing to support learning from home. We know how difficult it is to juggle working and supporting your own children with their online schooling, and this is of course in addition to dealing with all of the normal challenges of family life. We've received a number of messages of thanks and support from so many of you over these past few weeks, and these are all received very gratefully indeed. Thank you.

Please do remember to contact us if you need any support. In the meantime, we send our very best wishes to you and your families for a safe and successful school year.

The app will monitor temperature and symptom checks. The app will allow them to do a privately recorded video temperature check of the child(ren) and symptom check prior to coming to school. If the child(ren) is fever and symptom-free, the app will show a “cleared for arrival” badge. This badge must be shown upon arrival at the school in order for the student to gain access to the building. If the child(ren) is not fever or symptom-free, the app will notify the parent that the child(ren) must remain home and give them further instructions.

In order to use the app, the parent must have a digital thermometer.

If 1 child is cleared for arrival, but one of the siblings is not, all of the children in that household must remain home and not report to the school. Further instructions will be given at that time.

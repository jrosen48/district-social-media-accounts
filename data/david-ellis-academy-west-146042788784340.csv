We wanted to start by thanking you all as parents and caregivers for your fantastic support and patience. We are particularly appreciative of everything that you have been doing to support learning from home. We know how difficult it is to juggle working and supporting your own children with their online schooling, and this is of course in addition to dealing with all of the normal challenges of family life. We've received a number of messages of thanks and support from so many of you over these past few weeks, and these are all received very gratefully indeed. Thank you.

Please do remember to contact us if you need any support. In the meantime, we send our very best wishes to you and your families for a safe and successful school year.

Yours sincerely,

When they are at school, all students will be assigned to classes of 10 students to maintain proper physical and social distancing.

Hello Parents,

As promised, we will be hosting parent meetings via Zoom to share information about the school’s learning models and action plans. The first Zoom meeting is scheduled for Thursday, August 6, 2020, at 11:00 am and 3:00 pm (Online Learners only). The second Zoom meeting is scheduled for Friday, August 7, 2020, at 11:00 am and 3:00 pm (Hybrid/In-Person Learners only).

There is no need to attend both of these Zoom Meetings days, as they will have different information specific to each learning model. We wanted to give a couple of different times that will work around your busy schedules. The information to access the Zoom meeting was sent to parents via email. Thank you for your participation and support. Stay safe and healthy!

Sincerely,

Summertime is a fun and exciting time for students filled with outdoor activities and sports. But each year some students fall behind other classmates from summer reading loss. Oftentimes, families get too busy and forget to include reading into their busy schedules or children may not even have access to books.

By middle school, children who lose reading skills over the summer have accumulated a two‐year lag behind their classmates.

Due to the winter weather advisory, the decision has been made to close school tomorrow Wednesday, February 26, 2020.

We do not take the decision to close school lightly. We value learning and recognize the impact that canceling school has on our students and families. The safety and wellbeing of our students, staff, and families are paramount in any decision to close the school.

Heavy snowfall and slippery roads will make for dangerous and unsafe travel conditions for our students and families.

Students are expected to log into their iReady and Kahn Academy accounts as well as complete work on their Science fair projects.

Be safe and have a good evening.

Dear Parents,

School is open today! Students may wear their DEA shirts with black or blue (no ripped or torn) jeans.

We ask parents to do all they can to dress students appropriately for the weather conditions, especially students who walk to school or ride the bus.

Parent Decision: Although we do our best in this process, we know that often no perfect decision exists. If parents feel as though it is not safe for their child to attend school, please know that they always have the option of keeping their child at home.

Be safe, drive carefully and have a great day on purpose.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2659255847463009&id=146042788784340,,0.0,"Thursday, February 6, 2020

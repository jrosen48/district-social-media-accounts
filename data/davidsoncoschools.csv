National School Counseling Week 2020 is Feb. 3–7. The week, sponsored by the American School Counselor Association (ASCA), highlights the unique contribution of school counselors within U.S. school systems and the tremendous impact they can have in helping students achieve school success and plan for a career. Take a moment to thank Mrs.Butts and Mrs. Patton for doing so much for our students!

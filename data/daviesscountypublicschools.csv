To all current and former players, parents and fans of the Daviess County Boys Soccer Program. We reached a milestone in the program's history this past Monday by playing our 800th game. We are also just 4 wins away from the program's 500th win. For a bit of history- James Edward Ford was the first coach from 1983-88 and guided it through the first 110 games. Jamie was also the first coach of the girl's program when they began the in 1993. Mick Lyons took over in 1989 and coached 38 games in his two year tenure. Nicholas Brake came on in 1991 and coached the Panthers for 4 seasons and 82 games, capping it off with a 1994 District Championship in his final season. I came on board as Nick's assistant in 1993 and was handed the keys for the 1995 season and have been here ever since. So many players, parents and memories over the years and games that I have been a part of. I'm sure there are other soccer programs in the state who have surpassed the 800 game mark, but I thought this was worth sharing with all who have been a part of the first 800. Here's to many more!",0.0,"Awesome!!!! ⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽

Projects demonstrating expertise in the areas of reverse engineering and robotics will be spotlighted as students describe the learning and implementation processes that were involved in creating these demonstrations.

Engineering and computer science teacher Jonathan Leohr described showcase projects that will be presented by his students: “Every year, students in the Principles of Engineering class are tasked with creating a machine that sorts marbles of different materials using VEX robotics parts. Throughout this project, students learn not only how to design, build and program, but also how to properly execute the engineering design process. Students are also learning how to create web pages in order to present their documentation.”",2020-01-06 10:38:02,,

His contributions to the game of football will not be forgotten. #Legend #riseup #betheone

Houston Hogg, a football player who helped break the color barrier at the University of Kentucky and in the Southeastern Conference, died Thursday, Jan. 3. He was 71.

Hogg was one of four black players — along with Greg Page, Nate Northington and Wilbur Hackett — who pioneered integration at UK. The four men have been memorialized with a statue, erected in 2016, that stands outside of the Joe Craft Football Training Facility, adjacent to Kroger Field. Their trail-blazing story was chronicled in a documentary, “Black in Blue,” which debuted in a program hosted by the Foundation for DCPS. Hogg was also inducted into Owensboro's Walk of Fame in 2018.

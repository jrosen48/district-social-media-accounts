Valedictorian for the Class of 2020.

To put it not so eloquently, in her time at DaVinci, Avery has done ‘all the things.’ From robotics, Academic Decathlon and Envirothon to volleyball, basketball and soccer, Avery has always pushed herself to succeed -- all while maintaining the utmost excellence in the classroom. Perhaps more importantly, Avery has stood out among her peers with her genuine kindness and thoughtfulness. She has proven to be a good friend, a dedicated citizen and a talented student. Avery truly exemplifies the DaVinci ideal.

Salutatorian for the Class of 2020.

Grace has always had a unique and powerful presence in the halls of DaVinci. Grace’s quiet demeanor, however, should never be mistaken for meekness, as she has proven to be a dynamic and influential part of the DaVinci community. Grace is a talented, bright and diligent student, and an active advocate for the environment. She has always been that person to remind us all to appreciate the simple and important things in life. To paraphrase one of Grace’s favorite authors, Mary Oliver, Grace won’t be one “to end up simply visiting this world.”

As students, teachers, staff and administrators we gather to tell our own stories, sharing them with our little community. Part of this work is to bring in Community Heroes who have their own stories to tell.

This year we had the great honor of welcoming, artists, teachers, scientists, political candidates, community activists, entrepreneurs, and inventive thinkers into our little school. They each spoke as to why they have dedicated their lives to others, and to inspire our students to make the world a better place. We feel fortunate to have had the following Community Heros among us: Leah A. Murray, PhD., Holly Morphet, Adam Johnston, PhD., Chris Harris, Kimberly Bowsher and Deana Froerer.

Just a reminder that we will be adding a middle school basketball league for both boys and girls this year. The boys season is from October 29th through December 14. Girls basketball will be January 9th through March 1st.

Middle school boys basketball tryouts will be next week on Wednesday, September 10, and Friday, September 12 from 3:00 pm to 5:00 pm at big DaVinci. Coach Gorton will be running the tryouts. Boys who wish to participate will need an updated physical. We will give the boys all the paperwork during tryouts. All boys can try out without a physical but if they make the team, they will need an updated physical along with the other paperwork before they can practice.

Please contact me if you have any questions.

Cordially,

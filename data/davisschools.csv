Emergency personnel are currently responding to a wildfire on the east side of Bountiful and Centerville.
The fire has not affected our schools, so schools will be open today.
Currently, the area between 400 North to 1600 North and from 900 East all the way east up the mountainside is closed. Because of that closure, school busses are not being allowed in that area. So students in that area who normally rely on a school bus to go to school will not be picked up.
Again, schools are open, but because of the fire, emergency personnel have advised the district to not send busses into the closure area.
The district is also aware of smoke caused by the fire and will monitor air quality conditions throughout the day.
If you, as a parent, feel conditions are unsafe for your child to attend school, please keep them home. As always, teachers will work with your child regarding any work they may miss due to their absence.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10156783694371748&id=84497521747,,0.0,"Parents:

Great news for Dawson High School. Basketball is back as today was the first day of practice for the Dragon Boys.

Layne Sheets, who is Dawson's Superintendent, was the Coronado boys basketball coach last year. He is now coaching the boys.

The last time Dawson had basketball, they played co-ed in January of 2018. With a girls & boys team this season, that's great growth out at Dawson!!!",11.0,"Thanks to a friend of Dawson ISD Pete Christy for coming out today.

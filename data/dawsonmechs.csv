Congratulations to Hope Cunningham from the Dawson Site! Hope plans to finish cosmetology school at Lanier Tech. Hope also received a scholarship for her academic success. She would like to thank MECHS and Mr. Sagona for telling her that her efforts weren’t going by unnoticed and rewarding her for every little step she completed. She would also like to recognize Mrs. Grigsby and Mrs. Hendon for helping her and believing in her. She says, ""They’re a true inspiration to me and I wouldn’t have graduated without them.""

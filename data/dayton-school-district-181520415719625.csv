Just a heads up on upcoming traffic changes Monday-Friday. This article came from ODOT regarding the Hwy 18 Road Closure that will affect some of you.

From May 5 to May 23, the OR 18 (Hwy 18) Ash Road to McDougall Junction Project will require travelers to detour eight miles around the closure. The detour takes eastbound traffic on OR 154 (Lafayette Hwy) , north to Lafayette and east on OR 99W to McDougall Junction. The detour is in reverse for travelers from the Dundee area. Local traffic will be able to travel to and from Dayton on OR 18 from OR 154 (Lafayette Hwy) to the OR 18/OR221 (Salem-Dayton Highway) interchange.

The three week full closure will be continuous (24 hours a day) Monday through Friday at 6 a.m. each weekday. The roadway will be open each weekend for normal travel. Prior to May 5 and after the full closure, there will be periodic night time one lane closures on OR 18 from Sunday night at midnight to 5 a.m. Monday, and nightly Monday through Friday from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m.

Travelers should expect up to 20 minute delays during these lane closures.",2.0,"Dayton Junior High & Dayton High School

At approximately 3:00 p.m. today, March 1st, just as school was releasing, a fire was started in a bin that holds towels. The bin was in the girls locker room in the old gym at the high school. No one was injured. The fire was mostly extinguished with a fire extinguisher, but the fire department was called to check that the fire was completely out. School facilities staff are in the process of using fans to clear out the smoke that collected. The school, fire department, and law enforcement are beginning to investigate the cause of the fire. At this point, we believe that school will be in session on Monday, March 4th.

Hello Everyone,

As you may know, Dayton has been selected as one of 15 schools in the nation to be an MIT InvenTeam. This means a very talented group of our students have been tasked with creating an invention and bringing it to MIT at the end of the school year to present!!!!! We received a grant to bring our idea to life which many of you saw on Pirate Night. However, we can not use our grant to pay for travel and boarding which is our biggest expense. Thus, we are putting together fundraisers including selling vinyl stickers, plasma cut metal art, and putting together a BIG RAFFLE!

We plan to gather donations from new BBQ's to flat screen tv's from local businesses or individuals and host a raffle for any and all to participate.

If you are at all interested or know someone or a business who is, please have them contact Patrick Verdun at patrick.verdun@dayon.k12.or.us and thank you so much.

All supporters will be put down as an official sponsor for our presentation at MIT. If have other ideas for fundraising opportunities as well, please share below.",0.0,"Innovate Dayton

I hope you are all having a great start to spring! It’s been awhile since I’ve posted. I’m out of social media touch lately. My apologies... I need more practice. That said, I want to let you know that things are plugging away here at the school district and going really well.

Check out our latest School Scene, if you already haven’t seen the paper copy. There is information included welcoming our new Business Director, Sean Yoder. Also, huge thanks to Jan Bunn for her 25 years of service to the district! I am so grateful to have been a very small part of her career.

Please keep in touch and let us know how we can better serve our students, schools, and community.

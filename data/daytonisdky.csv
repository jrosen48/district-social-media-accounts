It is without reservation that we say that Linda’s tenure was a service of love and joy. Over the years, she has been “School Mom” to so many. She has also been that person with the right words of wisdom just when they were needed or simply a positive message. She has been the rock that Dayton High School has stood on for so many years.
We wish her great happiness, health, and joy in retirement!

The Summer Meal Program will continue in August. Families can pick up meals on Tuesdays or Thursdays in the high school cafeteria from 11:00 am - 12:00 pm. If you would prefer to only come one of the days - you can get 5 days worth of food. You may want to drive your vehicle or bring a wagon because the bags are heavy! The pick up dates are: August 4, 6, 11,13,18,and 20th. Food Pantry items will only be delivered on August 5th and 11th. If you need additional food, remember we have a food pantry on campus.

It is with great sadness that we report the loss of Mr. Bob Waxler to cancer.
Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, close friends, and of course his Food Service Family.
Bob was a Greendevil from the beginning. He was born and raised in Dayton and graduated from Dayton High School in 1971.
Bob was a great guy who embraced his role as a grandfather to many of our Little Devils and truly loved our kids.
We encourage any student who would like to make/send a card to Mr. Bob's family - please do so! You can drop off the cards to Lincoln Elementary School on packet pick-up day or mail the cards to Lincoln Elementary School (701 Fifth Ave, Dayton, KY 41074).

Dayton School Community,

Yesterday, our Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear extended our NTI (Non-Traditional Instruction) for students through Friday, May 1.

We know this comes as a disappointment to many that our school buildings will be closed to instruction, but we all need to pull together to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. It is essential that we continue to support the governor’s “Healthy at Home” plan and do everything we can to prevent the spread of this virus. Even though our school buildings are closed, learning continues. We will continue to work together to Grow our students.

I am sure you have many questions concerning grades, report cards, graduation and more. Please know that I am working with our school leaders to develop a plan, and we will keep you informed as details become available.

Please continue to take care of yourself and others.

We were informed that Non-Traditional Instruction (NTI) days will be extended through, Friday April 17.

This means at this time we are looking at a total of 15 NTI days.

Spring Break will NOT be NTI days and we will not be in school on Spring Break.

We will update everyone next week as we know more about how we are going to execute these additional days.

“A book is a gift you can open again and again.” - Garrison Keillor

A School Book Fair is a wonderful thing. However, at times it can create sadness for kids who can’t afford books. This is a clear example of differences in opportunities and resources for kids.

Thanks to the Scripps Howard Foundation @scrippshowardfoundation we have the wonderful opportunity to bring joy to ALL kids as they sponsored another FREE book fair for our elementary students! And...this time each student received 4 FREE BOOKS EACH!

580 students receiving 4 Books = 2,320 books gifted to our students!

From Preschool/Head Start to 6th grade...these books help us Grow!

A ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ thank you to the Scripps Howard Foundation for believing in the Power of Books and for believing in our Kids!

The above article is currently in the NKY Tribune. Great job Mr. Wright!

I am very excited about the work being done by our staff to develop and share their personal missions with students and peers.

Mission is at the heart of WHY you do what you do.

Goals are time bound.
Mission last a lifetime.

To live a mission requires that you make a difference in the world!

Here are some other examples of personal mission statements staff members have shared with us:

Be in the game.
Bring a smile to everyone.
Helping others help themselves.
Teach Them Tough.
Fail Forward.
Communicate for life.
Be the Light.
I believe in you.
Lift Them Up.
Realize your potential.
Difference maker – not money maker.
Be Their Person.
Better the Path.
Student has a voice.

Let’s have a great week and live our missions!

Stay Inspired!
Be Engaged!
Always Grow!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2981402458541159&id=594777470537015,"Voices from the Classroom: Dayton Independent Schools on mission — be inspired by these teachers | NKyTribune
This school year Dayton Independent Schools are “On A Mission!” At our staff opening day, Dayton Superintendent Jay Brewer challenged every teacher in the district to articulate their mission, or their “why” they teach, in a personal mission statement of eight words or less.

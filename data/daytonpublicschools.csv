One year ago, Dayton experienced one of the most horrific days in its history. And we‚Äôve had many, many hard days since.

But despite it all, Dayton continues to shine. Daytonians have wrapped arms around one another, disrupted our daily lives to keep others healthy and safe, and stood shoulder to shoulder against injustice. We are a gritty and resilient city, and we have shown time and again that we can face any challenge that comes our way.

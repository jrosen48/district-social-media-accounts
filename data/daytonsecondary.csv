Washington Connection",0.0,"Students in grades K-12 are eligible for Pandemic EBT cards to help with buying groceries while school is closed for the summer. Families can apply by calling 877-501-2233 or online at www.WashingtonConnection.org. The application will be open by June 30th. (application is not currently open).

If your family receives Basic Food through DSHS and your children receive free or reduced-price school meals, you do not need to apply for P-EBT. You will automatically receive these one-time benefits on your EBT card. You will need to apply for P-EBT if your children are eligible for free or reduced-price school meals but do not receive Basic Food benefits.

Students in grades 6-12 who are not receiving Basic Food benefits but are receiving free or reduced priced meals are eligible for an EBT card. If you have had a change of income since school closed in March, families are eligible to fill out a free & reduced form and return it to the District office.

Plant spotlight #2: Petunias!

Always a popular plant! This year we have two types of petunias, sanguna series and headliner series. (See pictures for color options of both types!)

Sanguna series: Easy wave petunias that are very versatile for planting in containers, hanging baskets, or landscape beds! If you want flowers to trail over the edges of pots or baskets this should be your ideal choice!

Headliner series: quickly becoming a first choice for many due to its dramatic colors, medium-vigor and many blooms! More of a mounding growth habit that will still fill pots and baskets!",0.0,"Dayton FFA

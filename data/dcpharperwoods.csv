Wanting to acknowledge and inspire, Ms. Rodgers decided to paint a butterfly in school colors representing transformation and hope. Due to the injustice that recently took place, students wanted to add a black butterfly to represent them—their resilience!

Although the painting is in draft form, Ms. Rodgers decided to leave it “unfinished” as a symbol of the work we all are presently doing and MUST continue to do. (The class will paint/color together this week.)

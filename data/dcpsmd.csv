So says First Class Teacher of the Year finalist Meredith Whitten, a 4th grade teacher at Sandy Hill Elementary School. She says, “I have learned that teaching is by far not an easy profession. I have learned that having flexibility becomes a crucial part of your job every day as you are constantly making decisions to best fit your students’ needs. I have also learned that I am not just a teacher, I am a nurturer in my students’ lives, and their biggest cheerleader in life.” A graduate of North Dorchester High School, Ms. Whitten dreamed of becoming a teacher since she was a little girl because helping students learn and “become the future” is such a joy. And just to show she can’t get enough of teaching, Ms. Whitten also teaches dance at the Eastern Shore Dance Academy, having been dancing herself since the age of three.

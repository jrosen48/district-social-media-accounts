Jessica Wilson, South Elementary Special Education Teacher

Hello DCSC! I‚Äôm Jessica Wilson and I will be a special education teacher at South Elementary this year. I grew up in Greenwood, Indiana, started college at Lee University in Tennessee, and graduated from Anderson University here in Indiana. I spent my first three years out of college teaching special education right next door to my hometown at Perry Meridian 6th Grade Academy in Southern Indianapolis. Last summer, I married my husband Andrew, who works as a physical therapist at Hendricks Health in Danville. He introduced me to some of the things that make Danville so great. I‚Äôm so excited to become a Warrior and to get to know all of my students and coworkers soon!

When I am not teaching, I enjoy doing just about anything that gets me up and moving. Some of my favorites are playing hockey, hiking, golfing, and lifting weights. I also enjoy board games, trivia nights, singing at my church, and a good cup of coffee.",0.0,"Danville Community School Corporation added a new photo.

Jessica Wilson, South Elementary Special Education Teacher

Hello DCSC! I‚Äôm Jessica Wilson and I will be a special education teacher at South Elementary this year. I grew up in Greenwood, Indiana, started college at Lee University in Tennessee, and graduated from Anderson University here in Indiana. I spent my first three years out of college teaching special education right next door to my hometown at Perry Meridian 6th Grade Academy in Southern Indianapolis. Last summer, I married my husband Andrew, who works as a physical therapist at Hendricks Health in Danville. He introduced me to some of the things that make Danville so great. I‚Äôm so excited to become a Warrior and to get to know all of my students and coworkers soon!

When I am not teaching, I enjoy doing just about anything that gets me up and moving. Some of my favorites are playing hockey, hiking, golfing, and lifting weights. I also enjoy board games, trivia nights, singing at my church, and a good cup of coffee.",2020-07-09 09:05:02,,

At the event, we would be honoring the dedication of these students as well as highlighting their future plans and the educators that inspired them.

Luckily, we got this photo back in February of these amazing students. Please join us in congratulating Dahlia Cook, Mackenzie Cline, Maria Magallanes, Charity Oliver, Ava Donaldson, Toby Kult, Natalie Dayharsh, Sarah Schneider, Cameron Hill, Josh Cruz, Kyle Poland, Claire Baker, Callie Sharkey, Mariya Shearin and Kyle Cook for being named in DCHS's Academic Top 15!

Hopefully you were able to get a glimpse of the Easter Bunny as Danville School Resource Officers Matt Oliphant, and Derek Wodtke escorted him throughout Danville, along with the Danville Fire Department! It was a great parade, and the smiles seen on everyone‚Äôs faces were truly amazing! We hope you had a great Easter! We‚Äôd also like to thank the Kiwanis Club of Danville for inviting us to participate in this event! Great work!

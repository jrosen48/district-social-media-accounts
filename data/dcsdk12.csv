""It has been a long road, but I am happy to say we are just days away from the return of Athletics/Activities in the Douglas County School District (DCSD)! Over the last several weeks, we have worked closely with local and state health agencies, the Colorado High School Activities Association (CHSAA), other schools in the metro area, and DCSD leadership to determine when our students could return to athletics and activities. I know all of us - students, coaches/sponsors, and parents - have been looking forward to this day!

Athletics/activities for Summer 2020 will return on June 22. However, things will look a bit different, so I ask you to please carefully review the information.""

We would like to take this week to appreciate all of YOU for YOUR hard work this year, especially these last 9 weeks. You all helped us make the transition to remote learning as easy as possible. There is absolutely no way we could have done this without your support! Please see the video attached. Your child can also complete an activity each day to show their appreciation.

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted schools across the nation and contributed to a general sense of uncertainty and anxiety. As we shelter in place, school is no longer the source of stability and connection that many of our students rely upon. During this time, educators play a critical role in supporting the social-emotional well-being of their students. However, that responsibility carries with it considerable stress and emotional labor for our teachers. In this webinar, we will explore ways to care for our well-being as we support others through this challenging time.

Participants will learn:

~ Strategies for self-care
~ Bite-size resilience
~ Building supportive virtual communities for educators

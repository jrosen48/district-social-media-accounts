Mia plans to major in English and political science. Mia attended a summer program at Harvard when she was 16-years-old. The program gave her the vision to apply for Ivy League schools. Mia chose Harvard because of the university’s diversity. She added that the school reflects the population and socioeconomics of America. Mia’s inspiration comes from her mom, Rolonda Brown. She has been with Mia every step of the way. #TeamDCS",2020-06-18 10:12:39,,

2020 SENIORS…

Congratulations! I know this is not how you always envisioned your last weeks in school and I’m sorry this has happened, but I hope I can encourage you today.

Life is full of disappointments, but they all pale to the victories, happiness, and successes that lie ahead.

This will not be the worst thing that ever happens to you, but life is not about what happens to you, but instead, how you respond to what happens to you.

The pages of life do not turn smoothly like a storybook, but the pen to write your story is always in your hand and the future’s pages are always as white as snow.

Look how far you’ve come and never forget the confidence you’ve built or the lessons you’ve learned, but listen to me, you’ve only just begun.

Wishing you all the best,

Mayor Darren Musselwhite

May would have marked a significant milestone in the lives of high school seniors across DeSoto County. Although their senior year didn’t end as expected, our community still wants to provide graduates with a day of special recognition.

In support of their efforts, I along with the Board have signed a proclamation today declaring May 22 as “Hernando Senior Recognition Day”, providing citizens the opportunity to join together and celebrate Hernando’s class of 2020 and their achievements.

Hernando’s senior parents are now working on the final details of such an event and will be communicating those in the coming days.

Meet Peyton Stallings. This little 4th grade firecracker is at 284% of her 4th quarter AR Goal. Peyton's favorite color is purple and she loves gymnastics, jumping on her trampoline, and her two dogs Kane and Buckeye. She was 3rd born out of 5 children. Her four siblings are: brother, Preston (almost 16 years old), brother, Julius (an Angel Baby), younger sister, Riley (9 years old), and a 3-year old brother named Remy. I asked her mother what makes Peyton so special and she replied, ""Peyton is a Rainbow Baby AND she is an Ohio State Buckeye at heart."" CONGRATULATIONS PEYTON!! Great job, sweetie! We are so proud of you!

Good morning sweet friends! Teacher Appreciation Week begins Monday. I have a few hints to help spoil our clipboard carrying, dry erase marking heroes ! 1. You can contact me if you have gifts for specific teachers at HMS and I will hand deliver. 2. Drop off handwritten notecards, gifts etc at HMS by Monday and I will hand deliver. 3. Join Adopt a Desoto County Teacher page on FB and find any DCS teacher and show them love!

I would be honored to be able to help deliver hand written notes to our sweet teacher friends. Words of encouragement will show our teachers that “their” kids are doing great! Teachers worry and fret over their babies 🥰

And for all of you still homeschooling, high fives and fist bumps! And for all of you (like me) who are moving day by day, you’re doing an awesome job too!! We will all get to the final destination together!

Remember, teachers have your back and will be back in action in August❤️ #TeamDCS",0.0,"We love our teachers! #TeamDCS

Dear Parents: In a news report from Action News 5 today, their reporter misunderstood a situation involving the 180-day requirement for schools in Mississippi. The report stated ""He (Uselton) is hoping the district will get a waiver to delay school 180 days."" The correct information is that Mr. Uselton hopes to receive a waiver so that students do not have to meet the 180-day requirement for the 2019-2020 school year. If districts receive the waiver, this would relieve students from having to make up missed days from this week. Mr. Uselton does not want parents to get confused with the incorrect report.

The report stated ""He (Uselton) is hoping the district will get a waiver to delay school 180 days."" The correct information is that Mr. Uselton hopes to receive a waiver so that students do not have to meet the 180-day requirement for the 2019-2020 school year. If districts receive the waiver, this would relieve students from having to make up missed days from this week. Mr. Uselton does not want parents to get confused with the incorrect report.

Dear Parents: In a news report from Action News 5 today, their reporter misunderstood a situation involving the 180-day requirement for schools in Mississippi. The report stated ""He (Uselton) is hoping the district will get a waiver to delay school 180 days."" The correct information is that Mr. Uselton hopes to receive a waiver so that students do not have to meet the 180-day requirement for the 2019-2020 school year.

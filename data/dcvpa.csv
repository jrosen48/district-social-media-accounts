We started by celebrating our PRIDE ticket winners at our school-wide morning meeting. And then we had a special guest...BIGG B! (Video post coming soon...)

So many students dressed for Culture Friday! Check out how students celebrated their culture!

Then we celebrated No One Eats Alone Day with our cross-grade level kinship buddies. Eighth grade paired up with kindergarten and first grade. Seventh grade paired with fourth and fifth grade. Sixth grade paired with second and third grade. Buddies chatted while eating lunch together and then had some fun together after lunch.

We had TWO guest readers from UNCW! Kerry Robinson came from UNCW Watson College of Education to read with third and sixth grade students. Kimberley Cheatham came back again to read with middle school students.

We closed out with an amazing PBIS celebration! (That's a post all by itself...coming soon!)

The COVID 19 pandemic has affected states, cities, communities, neighborhoods, and households across our entire nation. To speculate or place blame on any one factor is wrong and divisive

On Saturday afternoon we posted factual information provided by the Wayne County Health Department. This public information had already been shared by other sources. Our goal was to inform, educate, and assist in a campaign started by the City of Dearborn to promote habits that will slow the spread of COVID 19.

The post was interpreted in a very different way and took a very negative tone in some,but not all, of the comments and therefore was removed.

The Dearborn Public Schools is proud to be a very active partner in our overall Dearborn community. Our goal is to inform the community on the steps they can take to help slow the spread of COVID 19 not single out any part of our city. We are all in this together as one community and only by everyone working together, not pointing fingers, can we make a difference in slowing the spread of COVID 19.

Please stay safe and healthy.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157843571540889&id=116929680888,,0.0,"Greetings,

I want to share a bit of good news about the staff member who tested positive for COVID-19 at Whitmore Bolles. That staff member is doing very well. In addition, the person who had the positive test that exposed the staff member to the virus is also at home and doing very well.

During this time of international crisis it is important that we stick together and maintain an optimistic viewpoint while trying to maintain some normalcy during this time. As Winston Churchill said “For myself I am an optimist – it does not seem to be much use to be anything else.”

I know that there are still tough days that await us and this crisis will likely get worse before it gets better. However, we will get through this as we unite together and support each other. We have an awesome school community in Dearborn and I see the optimism each and every day as there are so many people that are generous with their time and willing to help those in need.

I wish everyone all the best for safe and healthy days ahead.

Dearborn Public Schools",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157331594525889&id=116929680888,,0.0,"Greetings All,

I want to share a bit of good news about the staff member who tested positive for COVID-19 at Whitmore Bolles. That staff member is doing very well. In addition, the person who had the positive test that exposed the staff member to the virus is also at home and doing very well.

During this time of international crisis it is important that we stick together and maintain an optimistic viewpoint while trying to maintain some normalcy during this time. As Winston Churchill said “For myself I am an optimist – it does not seem to be much use to be anything else.”

I know that there are still tough days that await us and this crisis will likely get worse before it gets better. However, we will get through this as we unite together and support each other. We have an awesome school community in Dearborn and I see the optimism each and every day as there are so many people that are generous with their time and willing to help those in need.

I wish everyone all the best for safe and healthy days ahead.

Regards,

Glenn Maleyko, Ph.D.

September 8,2020

Due to renewed concerns, the administration at North Decatur Jr/Sr High School is putting a stronger emphasis on the requirements set forth by the Governor's Mask Mandate.

Effective immediately:
1). All coaches and workers must have face coverings on at all times.
2) Any player/cheerleader not engaged in physical activity causing them to have an elevated heart rate must have a face covering on at all times. In addition, when possible, the players/cheerleaders are strongly encouraged to remain at least 6' apart.
3) All fans must have a face covering on to be admitted to an event.
4). All fans must have a face covering on to be granted access to restroom facilities or the concession stand.
5) Anyone within 6' of a person not from their household should have a face covering on at all times.

These will be enforced until the Governor removes or changes the mask mandate.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

FREE CONCUSSION BASELINE TESTING
During our FREE the baseline months of concussion June and July, testing.
take advantage of
Baseline concussion tests are taken prior to a sport season when an athlete has not yet had exposure to training and/or competition. In the event a concussion happens during the season, a similar test is taken again, yielding comparative scores from before and after the injury. Each concussion is unique, so it is important to treat individuals on a case-by-case basis. The ImPact Concussion Testing is FREE to Kindergarten through Junior High aged students due to funds through the Hospital Foundation of Decatur County and assesses:
• Reaction Time
• Memory Capacity
• Speed of Mental Processing
• Executive Functioning
To schedule your child’s appointment, call (812) 663-1119. All testing will be performed by DCMH Athletic Trainers at the hospital. If an athlete was tested last summer, their test is still valid.

A journey to Indiana's historic high school gyms
In 2013 photographers Chris Smith & Michael E. Keating began a journey to document Indiana's historic high school gyms. Although basketball was not born in Indiana, the state adopted the game as its own - nine of the top ten largest high school gyms in the United States are located in Indiana. In 1954, the year tiny Milan won the state championship, more than 700 schools participated in the tournament - a story that would later inspire the Hollywood film Hoosiers. As of 2019 Smith & Keating have traveled more than 50,000 miles, shot more than 400,000 digital frames and visited more than 300 gyms. One hundred photos from the project are currently on display at the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame and in 2016 the project was featured in the New York Times and was one of the Indiana Historical Society's Bicentennial Exhibits.

We'd like to congratulate our 2020 Lilly Finalists!

Many have asked us what our Lilly process looks like. Our Foundation prides itself on having one of the most rigorous selection processes in the State of Indiana. The first step is an application that surveys the students' academic history and community involvement. Following the application, they must write a controlled essay at a local high school. These scores are calculated to identify the top five candidates. Then, those lucky five deliver a five-minute presentation on a topic of their choosing and are interviewed by the board of the Foundation. All of the scores and input from our judges are sent up to the Lilly Endowment in Indianapolis for a final decision to be made. We will receive the winner’s name from Lilly later this year.

A huge thank you to each player, cheerleader, coach, parent, fan, and everyone who came out to support our C Team Cougars today! It was a heartbreaking loss against Madison (0-18) especially coming down to a loss in the very last game. With that being said, it was a very successful season and we all look forward to seeing each team member grow and excel in the years to come!

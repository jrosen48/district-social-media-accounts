We thought it may be a good idea to give our college bound students, and those preparing to transfer, an opportunity to research colleges while many of us home. So, Operation Calculus is more than excited to announce a Virtual College Fair!!!!

Parents and students zoom in each day around lunch to meet admissions and recruitment staff from Colleges and Universities across the country!!!! Watch their presentations, ask questions and learn about colleges you may not have heard of or some you may be interested in learning more about.

Register to attend each day, one day or only for the college you are interested in learning about. Those that visit for 5 or more days will be entered into a drawing for a $25 gift card.

We are Zooming In!!!

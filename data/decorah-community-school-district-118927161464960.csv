A case of measles has been reported in Iowa. This is the first case in our state since 2011 and is a good reminder to make sure that your family’s vaccines are up to date. The measles vaccine is highly effective (the patient with measles was not vaccinated) and all school-aged children should have two MMR doses by the time they start kindergarten.

If a case of measles is identified in our school, public health officials will require all unvaccinated students and staff to remain at home until 21 days after their last possible exposure to measles. Please make sure your family is protected. Vaccines save lives.

ROAD CONDITION ALERT: Due to last night's rain, the roadways continue to be in extremely poor condition. The gravels and county roadways are 100% ice covered. Please use extreme caution if traveling and try to stay put, if possible (especially if on a gravel or county roadway).

Update (11:30 AM): Bluffton Road will be closed for a few hours this afternoon while country road crews work on the ice covered hills. It will reopen when the county has completed their work.

Update (6:10 AM): We currently have multiple vehicles stranded in the ditches, including a sand truck. We are working hard to assist motorists and deal with this situation, but calls are coming in faster than we can respond to them.

Robert Frost’s family and consumer science students honored Mother’s Day by creating cards, making breakfast and sending a heartfelt message, artistic drawing or quote to their mothers or special persons. The middle schoolers followed a recipe, maintained kitchen safety and sanitation practices, and used culinary skills while preparing their delicious breakfasts. The FACS students then took educational virtual tours of New York City museums while sharing the experience with their mom or special person.

“Spending time with family members builds a child’s self-esteem, strengthens family bonds, encourages good communication skills and develops positive behaviors, and museum tours engage, involve and connect students with art, science and history,” said teacher Cindy Adriaenssens.

Michelle Cangelosi, the school psychologist at Robert Frost, was named a Babylon Hero on April 10 by the Town of Babylon. She was honored for her work in moving her private practice to virtual appointments while continuing to accept new patients, as well as volunteering her time to field calls on the state’s Mental Health Hotline during the coronavirus pandemic.

Cangelosi has worked in the district for the past decade, serving at JFK from 2010-2019 prior to transferring to Frost. She opened her private practice in Babylon Village, Captree Psychological Services, several years ago.

“I am so grateful for this recognition by the Town of Babylon and grateful to have the importance of mental health highlighted,” Cangelosi said. “I grew up in North Babylon and still live in the same neighborhood, I work in Deer Park, and have my private practice in Babylon Village, so this area is home in more ways than one.

The “Sunshine Squad” of teachers and staff from May Moore came out for a honk and a hello on March 30. A fleet of vehicles decked out with inspirational signs taped to the windows drove around the neighborhood in a heartwarming car parade, waving to students in their yards, front doors and sidewalks.

“We love and care about our students and their families,” said Principal Philip Paniccia. “Everyone at May Moore came together for this car parade because we know how stressful and difficult the current situation is for our community. This was just a chance for us to show our students that we’re thinking about them every day and can’t wait to see them at school again. I am so proud of our faculty and staff for arranging and participating in this, and I was so impressed by the community’s response as well. Just as much as we wanted to be there for our students, our students and the community came out to show the same support. It was an uplifting and rewarding day.”",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1479904818853860&id=1059714047539608,,0.0,"A Happy Honk and Hello Brings Joy at May Moore Car Parade

Robert Frost family and consumer science students Jordyn Haskins and Erin Sullivan recently entered the Long Island FACS Sustainability Challenge and won third place. For their project, the pair collected Doritos chip bags from the school’s cafeteria, washed them, dried them on a clothesline and then sewed the bags together, layer by layer, to make an apron.

“We tried to solve the problem of eliminating chip bags going into landfills, and used the repurposed aprons during our FACS classes,” said Haskins. “To make sure that future generations enjoy what we enjoy, we need sustainability. If we can reuse and make different things out of used materials like rubber and plastic, we can make a better future.”",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1467411730103169&id=1059714047539608,,0.0,"Frost Students Win Third in LIFACS Sustainability Challenge

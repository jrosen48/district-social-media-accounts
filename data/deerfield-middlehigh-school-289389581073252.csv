As a result of the school reorganization law of 1945, several rural schools consolidated with Deerfield Grade School. With added students and overcrowded conditions, Deerfield High School District No. 3 voted to build a new high school. Forty-six students and faculty moved into the $330,000 building on Feb. 7, 1950. Even then, the grade school was still too crowded so the 7th and 8th grades were moved into the high school building. The lower grades occupied the old grade school and high school buildings until 1957 when a $316,000 grade school building was erected to house the kindergarten and eight grades. The all-purpose hall in the new building was dedicated in memory of Rex Miller who was a popular member of the Deerfield community and a member of the school board at the time of his untimely death.",0.0,"Kearny County Historical Society Museum

This white frame building was the first schoolhouse erected in Deerfield. It was large enough to be divided into two rooms when needed. Completed in 1886, the school opened in October that year with Sallie Eastham as the teacher. When a new brick school building was completed in 1912, this building was sold to the Baptists and moved two blocks south of the school grounds where it served as a church. Later it was used for the first grade classroom, then as an industrial arts class room for the high school and finally as a community building and grange hall.",0.0,"Kearny County Historical Society Museum

As our Spanish-speaking enrollment has risen this year, Ana has met the challenge of being the sole ESOL para for middle and high school head on. She has worked hard to make sure our new students have all the resources and support they need, and that their transition into their new school and new homes is a comfortable one.
During this time she has bounced from classroom to classroom without a break (because she also covers lunch duty and has her own Spartan Council). She has also established meaningful relationships with the increasing number of students she works with, and she’s done it all with a positive attitude and smile on her face.

Going forward, starting today and as part of Throwback Thursday (#TBT), our staff has decided to participate in a game we are calling Yesteryearbook (#DLYesteryearbook).

How many people can you name?

Here’s how the game works:

In the morning, we will issue a page with nine images of people you may know.

Around lunchtime, we will issue an updated page which includes their respective alma maters and graduation years.

Finally, at around 2 PM, we will issue the full reveal. Whoever gets the most correct names the fastest wins!

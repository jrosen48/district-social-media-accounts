With graduation fast approaching, we’ve teamed up with Deer Park Community City Schools to honor students as part of our Seniors Celebrating Seniors Program. During the next week and a half, we will highlight several students from Deer Park Jr/Sr High School’s class of 2020 and will hang signs in our front yard celebrating their achievements.

By bringing together the seniors in our community, both residents and students, we are helping support those who have been affected by COVID-19. We are so excited to share this collaboration, and we can’t wait to start highlighting the amazing seniors in our community! #SeniorsCelebratingSeniors #WickshireWay

May 12 at 3:00 PM ·

With graduation fast approaching, we’ve teamed up with Deer Park Community City Schools to honor students as part of our Seniors Celebrating Seniors Program. During the next week and a half, we will highlight several students from Deer Park Jr/Sr High School’s class of 2020 and will hang signs in our front yard celebrating their achievements.

By bringing together the seniors in our community, both residents and students, we are helping support those who have been affected by COVID-19. We are so excited to share this collaboration, and we can’t wait to start highlighting the amazing seniors in our community! #SeniorsCelebratingSeniors #WickshireWay

""Life is 10% what happens to us and 90% how we react to it."" Charles Swindoll

Many students at Amity Elementary are learning about the Zones of Regulation which is a concept of self-regulation and emotional control. The students learn about 4 Zones of Regulation (Blue, Green, Yellow, and Red) where they can categorize feelings.

Blue Zone is when you are sick, tired or bored. Green Zone is when you are happy and ready to learn. Yellow Zone is when you are wiggly or frustrated. And Red zone is when you are angry, yelling or out of control.

Ms. Geselbracht had some volunteers act out the zones. Can you guess the Zone?",0.0,"Deer Park Community City Schools added 17 new photos.

Featured Grade: 4th

Third and Fourth graders practiced bus safety this week. They did a great job!

Students continue to work very hard in our new Bridges math curriculum. These mathematicians get to use a variety of math strategies and math tools in a collaborative environment to become better problem solvers. It’s exciting to see their thinking in action.

Mrs. Soellner’s fourth-grade class earned Golden Cat Cards for safe, respectful and responsible behavior. As their reward, they chose to have lunch with the principal. They loved spending time with Mr. Drouhard!

Mrs. Soellner’s class has also been incorporating acts of kindness throughout the day. They start their day with a special morning greeting to each of their classmates. This has been a great way to start the day in a positive way and grow in our Amity friendships!",0.0,"Deer Park Community City Schools added 30 new photos.

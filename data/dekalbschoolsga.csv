SCHOOL OF THE DAY: DeKalb School of the Arts, DeKalb County School District -- home of the Fire Ants!

DeKalb School of the Arts is a high-performing arts magnet program in DeKalb County, offering instruction in eight arts disciplines. During the COVID-19 pandemic, school leaders have planned a wide array of virtual theatre, dance, and music performances to show on social media, the district TV program, and other avenues.

To best accommodate students during virtual learning, the school distributed Chromebooks and hotspots to students who need them and hosted two drive-through distributions of textbooks for students. Students are still engaged with the school through daily virtual announcements and virtual club meetings. Principal George Greene also holds family engagement sessions on Fridays via Microsoft Teams.

Georgia has more than 2,000 public schools, all unique and working hard to expand opportunities and offer a high-quality education to their students. Through this feature, we'll introduce you to a new school each day. #GaDOESchooloftheDay #GAPublicSchoolsTogether",6.0,"Congratulations to DeKalb School of the Arts for being recognized as the Georgia Department of Education School of the Day! #iLoveDCSD

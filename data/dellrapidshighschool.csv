Anyone ages 0-18 can participate in the Grab and Go meals from 11:30 am – 12:15 pm in the elementary and middle school lobbies.

Mason is from the Dell Rapids FFA Chapter and has been very involved in the FFA organization through his time as a member. Mason has participated in many FFA activities. This includes attending the West-river FFA Leadership Retreat in the summer of 2018 and 2019.

He has also seen many achievements within the organization, one of which include receiving his State FFA Degree.

When Mason was asked why he enjoyed being involved in South Dakota FFA, his response was “I enjoy making a difference in my community and school.” He also said, “I have learned to develop leadership skills and make a positive difference in my chapter by being a chapter officer and motivating my chapter members to achieve success in FFA.”

Mason hasn’t fully decided what he plans to do after high school, but he does plans to attend a 4-year university.

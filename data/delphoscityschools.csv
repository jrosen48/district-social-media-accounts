A few days ago, Jeffrey Caputo Jr. made a slide show of the graduating seniors that we put on the message board. Today, as I was leaving high school, I noticed a young man looking at our sign in front of the school. As we talked, he told me that he wanted to see the senior pictures.

Each year our high school students volunteer to go to Franklin and the Middle School to help teachers and engage with the young Wildcats. The young man, JACKSON OSBURN, was missing them, especially Rafael Montesano, and rode his bike over to find them.

As I left, I was struck by how cool it was and turned around for a picture. Jackson's actions demonstrate the impact our high school students have on the next generation.

Meet Jayla!

Favorite food: pancakes

Favorite movie: The Disney movie ‚ÄúHome‚Äù

Position: Centerfield

Years played: 4 years in high school, 11 years total

Miss the most: I will miss the little moments like inside jokes and practices, but I will definitely miss all of my wonderful teammates and coaches. I will miss everything about it.

Favorite memory: If I had to choose a few out of the many, many great memories I would say getting the first NWC win in 7 years by beating Ada, of course getting my foot stuck under the fence at Lima Senior, all of the Perry days, and playing 7 games in one week last year (best week of the year).

Delphos City Schools will be offering chromebooks to those elementary students in Grades 1-4 (PK and Kindergarten are not eligible to receive a chromebook) in need of an electronic device for the remainder of the covid-19 school shutdown. This is not mandatory. If your family already has an electronic device it is not necessary to use a school issued device. Due to the limited supply of chromebooks, we will limit chromebooks to one per family.

Franklin Elementary will be open Monday, April 6th from 9am - 12 noon and Tuesday, April 7th from 1pm - 4pm. Parents needing to borrow a chromebook will need to also sign the user agreement form. Students are not permitted to sign out a chromebook. Please be patient and practice required social distancing when coming to sign out a chromebook.

Dear Parents and Students,

Teachers will post one daily lesson, however, 2 of the lessons will include gradable assignments with a 24 hour due date. (Upper level courses can assume more than 2 assessments)These grades will be considered 4th quarter grades.

Teachers will make lessons using our acronym CLEAR when planning and assigning.

C = Continuation - the lessons flow with previous learning

L = Learnable - all students learn from the lesson

E = Empathy - reflect on student/family needs and concerns

A = Attainable - resources are available to complete lesson

R = Rigorous - the lesson challenges without overwhelming students

We continue to hold high expectations for teachers and students with a CLEAR understanding that student learning faces unique barriers and challenges. We also want to be aware of the challenges facing families helping with work while facing the overall anxieties during this time.

I ask that you communicate with teachers via email or send feedback or concerns to

cbrinkman@delphoscityschools.com

My office is currently accepting applications for prospective high school juniors and seniors (at least 16 years old) or college students seeking an internship from Jan-June 2019. Interns in my legislative office will participate in constituent service and local community outreach activities. They will also have the opportunity to actively engage in the legislative process by working on policy initiatives and, if schedules permit, they will shadow me for a day at the State House.

Strong writing and communications skills are necessary. Internships are not compensated, but qualify for college course credit at most institutions of higher education as well as community service hours for most area high schools.

If interested, please email your resume (college) or letter of interest (high school) to SenSingleton@njleg.org with ""Internship"" in the subject line by January 2, 2019. Or, please call Jennifer Aydjian at 856-234-2790 for more information.",2.0,"Are you in high school and have political aspirations?

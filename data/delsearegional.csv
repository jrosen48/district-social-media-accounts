We wanted to give you a follow up to the graduation packet that you received.

Friday, July 24th, we will hold graduation practice @ 5:00 on the football field.

Immediately following practice, there will be a short senior gathering that will take place outside right next to the football field. This is NOT mandatory; however you must enter at the start of the event (immediately following practice) if you would like to attend.

Masks WILL BE REQUIRED and proper social distancing WILL BE MANDATORY. You may bring a chair or blanket to sit on.

There will be a DJ and we will provide a few desserts and drinks. The senior video will be played for everyone between 7:30-8:00.

***If you leave the event after you check in, you will not be permitted to return***

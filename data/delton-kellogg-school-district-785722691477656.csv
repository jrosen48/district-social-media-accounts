Now that we've got the first week of school under our belt, we'd like to hear from you on how the week went. The link below is a short survey with just two questions asking what went well and what we can improve on. Please take a moment to speak with your kid(s) to see how the week went for them. We'd like feedback on new procedures, such as our traffic flow, and safety protocols. We'd appreciate the feedback be delivered in this survey rather than in the Comments of this Facebook post.

Some areas of improvement we are aware of and are working diligently to improve, including traffic flow at drop off and getting our online program running, which we're excited to start next week. But it's also important for us to hear from all of you.

Here's the link to give us feedback- https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/6RYBCVM

Thanks for your time and for a wonderful first week of school!

DKS has arranged for a millage renewal proposal to be on the ballot for the August 4 election. The proposal is to renew the non-homestead millage amount of 18 mills. The approval of the millage renewal proposal is critically important to the Delton Kellogg Schools because it provides for approximately $2.5 million in revenue to operate the schools. This funding is the absolute essential funding we receive from the state. Every year it decreases slightly due to inflation, so about every 4 or 5 years we have to ask voters to renew it back up to 18. The ballot language says that we are asking to increase it by .5 mills, but that is to prevent it from going under 18 by inflation. The most the school can levy is 18 and the state expects us to collect that much. If not, we will see a decrease in funds that we use to operate.

Dear Delton Kellogg Parents,
Delton Meet Up and Eat Up program WILL NOT be available for the Tuesday evening drive thru 4:30-6:30 beginning this Tuesday, July 21st. This is due to the lowered amount of participants.
We WILL be at all morning stops every Tuesday and Friday thru August 18th.
This week on Tuesday July 21st we will have art kits and sketch pads available for parents to take for their children. Friday, July 24th we will have dairy boxes and fruit boxes. These boxes are one per family. These boxes are a USDA program and we appreciate the opportunity to hand these out. Delton Schools has requested additional boxes this week but we will not know our quantity until we receive them.
Thank you for allowing us to continue to offer food to our community and your children. We look forward to seeing you in the Fall.
Sharon Boyle
Delton Kellogg Food Service Department

“As you guys go out and go forward with your lives and make an impact in the world￼ remember this, nobody will ever break the record you guys set for the longest senior skip day in history. Congratulations,” said Gilmore Car Museum curator Jay Follis as he welcomed the Delton Kellogg High School Class of 2020 to its long overdue graduation ceremony Friday.

The ceremony, broadcast to the vehicles of friends and family via radio waves across the museum’s western grounds and broadcast around the world on Facebook, finally honored the 77 members of the Delton Kellogg graduating class who ceased face-to-face learning at school in mid-March because of the global coronavirus pandemic.

Ashton Ingersoll and Sarah Barney shared the class history with their classmates before salutatorian Amber Mabie and valedictorian Erin Kapteyn addressed the crowd.

DK Parents,
Tomorrow we will have 2 bags for each child at our food drop off locations. One bag will have freezer food and another will have cooler food.

We have a lot of seeds to give out. There will be baskets at each stop and you can help yourselves to as many as you like.

Also, for the next 5 Saturdays, including tomorrow, we have a produce box to give out one per family. You do not have to have children in your house to get a produce box. This is a special USDA program. If you would like to see a schedule, please check out our website or Facebook page.

We are going to coordinate our “personal item pick up” dates and times with technology collection. If your child is registered and plans to participate in our “online” summer school program then they will need to keep their device. Summer School Registration closes June 4th.

Here is the link to register for summer school. https://docs.google.com/…/1FAIpQLSfBxsByndJJ7ayPmF…/viewform We will collect their device in Mid-August after the completion of summer school.

Thanks for your continued support and we look forward to greeting you and welcoming you into the building to collect personal items or seeing you in the drop off lane to turn in your child's device.

This means that classroom instruction continued but students were brought in from outside and not allowed to leave the classroom. Barry Township Police had pulled someone over in the parking lot of the middle school. At no time were students in danger. Barry Township Police communicated when the lockdown could be lifted.

At approximately 11:30 a.m. today, all of the buildings at Delton Kellogg Schools went into a soft lockdown. This means that classroom instruction continued but students were brought in from outside and not allowed to leave the classroom. Barry Township Police had pulled someone over in the parking lot of the middle school. At no time were students in danger. Barry Township Police communicated when the lockdown could be lifted. The lockdown lasted for about 5 minutes.

Thank you as always for your support of Delton Kellogg Schools,
Kyle Corlett, Superintendent",2020-03-06 12:10:09,,

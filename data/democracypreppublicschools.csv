Today, our CEO, Natasha Trivers, makes this solemn promise. Read her latest blog post and learn more about accountability, reflection, and the path moving forward:

Pride is more than just a parade and stretches far beyond a month of acknowledgement. Pride is about dismantling archaic notions of love and gender, Pride is about challenging the status-quo, and above all, Pride is about establishing equality for all.

It is in times like today that we realize the fight for social justice continues, that though we have come a long way, there is still a long way to go.

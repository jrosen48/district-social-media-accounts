Demopolis City School System still wants to provide food and nutrition to our students even during this time while school is closed, so we’re announcing a new program that will deliver meals at your doorstep for free. This program is called Meals-to-You, and it is a partnership between our district, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and Baylor University. Your student(s) enrolled in the Demopolis City School System are eligible to participate in the program.

When you sign up to get a Meals-to-You, every other week you’ll get a Meals-to-You box delivered to your home for each child 1-18 in your household. Each box will include 10 breakfasts and 10 lunches/suppers—enough food for each kid for two weeks!

All foods are shelf stable, which means you don’t have to worry about them expiring anytime soon. With Meals-to-You, kid-friendly meals are delivered—for FREE—directly to your door, so you don’t have to worry about:
• Extra trips to the grocery store
• Extra money spent on food
• Extra time planning meals your kids will like

If you aren’t home when the box is delivered, no worries. The boxes are packed for security, and because the food is shelf stable, you don’t have to worry about refrigerating the foods immediately. If you will be unable to pick up your box(es) on a given day, be sure to have a neighbor or family get it. And no need to worry; receiving this benefit will NOT affect any other existing benefits.

HOW DO YOU SIGN UP? All you have to do is fill out an online sign-up form and submit it as soon as possible! Access the online form by clicking this link:

April 6, 2020

Parents and Stakeholders,

Let me begin by pleading with you to practice social distancing, good hygiene habits, and adhering to the “Stay at Home Order” issued by Governor Ivey on Saturday, April 4th, 2020. In education, everything we do is based on students and interaction with children and adolescents. The COVID-19 pandemic, that has literally stopped our world, has educators across the nation scrambling to meet the educational, social, and emotional needs of our students in ways that are new and uncommon. Please know over the next 5 weeks, we will do our best to support you and your children in closing out this school year productively and we can only pray that things will be back to normal later this summer as we will be preparing for the 2020-2021 school year. Below are important details from our state approved Academic Continuity Plan that begins on Monday, April 13, 2020.

Remote Learning
Remote learning packets can be picked up curbside at each campus on Thursday (April 9th) and Friday (April 10th) from 8:00 to 3:00. Do not exit your vehicle when picking up these packets.

Each school is preparing five week instructional packets. These packets will include a pacing guide to help families navigate through the learning at a pace that is appropriate for the students. This same information will be available at each school’s website in a tab titled Remote Learning.

In grades K-3 there will be a paper packet for every child. In grades 4-11 (and applicable seniors), paper packets will be available, however on-line resources are encouraged. Google Classroom will be the platform used for on-line instruction. If your child has difficulties entering Google Classroom, you will need to contact his or her teacher.

It is important that students complete and do the best they can with the remote learning. The completion of this 5-week packet, either on-line or paper packet, will help determine placement, intervention, and enrichment decisions we make for the 2020-2021 school year. Remote learning, either on-line or paper packet, are to be completed by May 15, 2020. We will announce a procedure for returning the paper packets at a later date.

Communication and Support
Teachers are available via email Monday through Friday from 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM. General questions can be emailed to questions@dcsedu.com and we will respond as soon as possible. You may also email the principals with questions.

Hours of Operation
Due to the “Stay at Home” order issued by Governor Ivey on Saturday, April 4, 2020, we will be closing all school offices immediately. We will re-open when it is safe to do so.
On behalf of the Board of Education, Faculty and Staff, we appreciate your partnership more than ever. Whereas keeping up with school work is important, you and your family’s health, wellness, and safety will always be the number one priority. Remember, love and faith are our constants and love and faith will get us through these difficult times.

Facing the unknown is frightening for anyone, but even more so for children. At the present time there is much fear regarding the Coronavirus Pandemic. This information is provided to assist with conversations you may have with your children.
Important Tips:
• Take care of yourself first. Children depend on the adults around them to be and to feel safe and secure. If you are very anxious or angry, children are more likely to be affected by your emotional state than by your words.
• Children may need extra attention from you and may want to talk about their concerns, fears, and questions. It is important that they know they have someone who will listen to them; make time for them.
• Talk about the Coronavirus Pandemic with your students if you feel it is appropriate – only provide information that is CORRECT and age appropriate for children. Do NOT repeat information to students that is not factual. Provide specific information: Example: “This is a respiratory illness spread by coughing and sneezing.” “The CDC states these symptoms appear in a few days after being exposed to someone with the disease or as long as 14 days after exposure: 1. Fever 2. Cough 3. Shortness for breath. For some people the symptoms are like having a cold; for others they are quite severe. Your parents will need to contact your health care provider for any specific concerns”
• Advise older children that everything they see/read on the internet is not necessarily factual. Tell them that the Centers for Disease Control and Alabama Department of Public Health provides the most up to date information.
• Reassure children of the steps that are being taken to keep them safe. Provide specific information: “We are all going to be very careful to cover our coughs and sneezes by coughing/sneezing in our elbow”. “We must all wash our hands or use hand sanitizer often”. “Everyone should try to practice social distancing – which is to stay 6 feet away from others when possible.” “We are keeping our classroom clean to decrease the spread of germs at school.”

The leaders and administration of the Demopolis City School System are operating under the guidance of the Alabama State Department of Education and the Alabama Department of Public Health in regards to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). At this time, we are not aware of any Coronavirus cases in our school system or the area which we serve. At this point, we are asking you to take similar safety precautions that one would take during flu season. Below are a few reminders and tips that can help us be proactive and keep our students safe from viruses.

Stay Home When Sick

1. Students and staff who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness should stay home and not come to school until they are free of fever (100 degrees or greater using an oral thermometer), signs of a fever, and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever reducing or other symptom-altering medicines.

2. Seek immediate medical care if symptoms become severe, such as high fever or difficulty breathing.

Use Respiratory Etiquette

1. Cover cough with a tissue or sleeve.
2. Keep tissues within easy reach and use no-touch trash cans.
3. Routinely clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects.
4. Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.
5. Avoid touching face with unwashed hands.
6. Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Flu season is here and we need a strong partnership to prevent a widespread in our schools. Below are some tips recently released from our Health Services Department to help keep the flu contained. If your child is absent due to the flu, make sure they return with a Doctor’s Excuse. If you chose not to go to the Doctor, make sure they return with a Parent Excuse that says, (Student’s Name) was absent due to flu like symptoms. During this flu season we will allow up to 4 Parent Excuses stating that the child was absent with flu like symptoms. These 4 flu like symptom Parent Excuses will not count toward the 5 allowed Parent Excuses per year. We will use a special code when entering the Parent Excuses due to flu like symptoms in our attendance system.

Keep your child at home for treatment and observation if he or she has any of the following symptoms:
· Fever (greater than 99 degrees during flu season) Your child may return to school only after his or her temperature has been consistently below 99 degrees, by mouth for a minimum of 24 hours without the use of Tylenol or Motrin.
· Vomiting (even once)
· Diarrhea
· Chills
· General malaise or feelings of fatigue, discomfort, weakness or muscle aches
· Frequent congested (wet) or croupy cough
· Lots of nasal congestion with frequent blowing of nose

To help prevent the flu and other colds, teach your children good hygiene habits:
· Wash hands frequently
· Do not touch eyes, nose or mouth
· Cover mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing
· Avoid close contact with people who are sick
· Wipe down hard surfaces and door knobs with disinfectant wipes and spray

Colds and influenza are most contagious during the first 48 hours. A child who has started antibiotics needs to be on the medication for 48 hours before they are considered non-contagious and able to return to school. Often when a child awakens with vague complaints (the way colds and flu begin), it is wise to observe your child at home for an hour or two before deciding whether or not to bring them to school. Please do not send your child to school with instructions to go to the nurse or dose them with Tylenol or Motrin to suppress their fever. Please make arrangements to have a caregiver available in case your child becomes ill while in school and keep your child’s emergency contact list current. Your child should be physically able to participate in all school activities once they return to school. Keeping a sick child at home will help minimize the spread of infections and viruses in the classroom.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2860461087356871&id=161514640584876,,0.0,"Parents,

Students and parents need to be commended for this effort. A free public education is one of the greatest opportunities for the children of Alabama. It is imperative that attendance and one’s education are taken seriously and are a priority in all families.

The school administrators and teachers want students to be in attendance on time and all day. Multiple check-ins and early dismissals can add up to missed instructional time. Missed instructional time can lead to students getting behind academically and in need for intervention, private tutoring, or even summer school to catch up. As a reminder, students are allowed 4 parent excuses for check-ins and early dismissals. After 4 parent excuses, check-ins and early dismissals must be accompanied with a doctor’s excuse. An abundance of unexcused check-ins or early dismissals will result in a referral to the early warning truancy program and may lead to a truancy complaint filed with the Marengo County District Judge.
In addition, it is strongly encouraged for parents not to check their children out after 2:00 PM. Late afternoon check-outs cause interruptions in the school day and afternoon traffic flow on each campus. If we can make it to 2:00, then in most cases we can make it all day.

Our area to receive little to no impact from Hurricane Michael...
Hurricane Michael is now a Category 2 Hurricane with sustained 11-plus MPH winds.
Michael now has slightly faster forward speed and earlier landfall…
Main impacts in Alabama still expected near and south of I85 and east of I65…
Hurricane Warning in effect for Geneva and Houston counties…
Coastal Flood Advisory in effect for Mobile and Baldwin counties…
Tropical Storm Warning and Hurricane Watch in effect for Mobile, Baldwin, Covington, Coffee, Dale and Henry counties…
Tropical Storm Watch in effect for Washington, Monroe, Conecuh, Escambia, Butler, Crenshaw, Pike and Barbour counties…
Flash Flood Watch in effect Wednesday for Russell, Barbour, Bullock, Pike, Coffee, Dale, Henry, Geneva, and Houston counties…
Michael will make landfall Wednesday afternoon as a major hurricane with sustained winds of 120 mph with higher gusts. Tropical storm force winds extend 195 miles from the center. The blue shading in the third graphic indicates the AL counties that are currently forecast to receive sustained winds of 39 – 73 mph.
The sustained wind impacts to the state will be from around 6 am Wednesday until 12 am Thursday morning. There could be hurricane force gusts as well. However, tropical storm force wind gusts in rain feeder bands could begin as early as 8 pm Tuesday.
Because of how strong Michael will be at landfall, it will take much longer for winds to decrease as the center moves inland, and will still be a tropical storm after emerging off the middle Atlantic coast on Friday.
2-5 inches total rainfall will occur in southeast AL with some spots potentially receiving double this amount. The bulk of the rain will occur from Tuesday night into early Thursday morning.

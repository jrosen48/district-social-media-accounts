When I send these emails I am using the emergency contact feature to share this information with as many people as possible. I am sorry if I fill up your inbox and you don’t need this information, however, in difficult times I believe such information can be helpful to everyone.

Attached you will find information about the Yarmouth Food Pantry and a list of websites that might be helpful to parents with children. The last link on the information page is for MyTelemedicine in case you need it.

Thank you for staying out of public places. I have noticed that the parks are no longer full. We hope this will make a difference.

We are working on plans to help our students continue learning. As soon as they are ready I will be in touch.

Best wishes,

A message from DENNIS YARMOUTH REGIONAL SD

Good Afternoon,

When I sent out the message on Friday about closing school this week I felt we needed some additional planning time to determine if an extended closure was needed. After a review over the weekend and putting our food service program in place, so our students will be able to get food during this closure, I feel confident that closing for two weeks is the prudent thing to do.

Therefore, Dennis-Yarmouth Regional School District will be closed for the next two weeks (March 16-March 29). The information that I have right now is indicating that the closure could go on much longer. I will continue to update you as soon as more information is available.

No one should come into the schools on Monday, March 16 except for those who have already been directed to do so. I ask that both staff and families check your email for updates.

Stay well, DY! Go Dolphins!

“Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize. Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get a crown that will last forever. Therefore I do not run like someone running aimlessly; I do not fight like a
boxer beating the air. No, I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.”

Funds allocated by the state for pay raises are based upon total revenue increases per Average Daily Attendance (ADA). Due to a decline in local ADA, DCISD saw no increase in revenue, which resulted in no additional state funding to the district for the required pay raises.

As you may have heard, Broome County announced that all schools are mandated to be closed until April 13th. It is my understanding that Delaware County will be making an announcement in the very near future. Our district is unique in that we occupy both Broome and Delaware counties. Many of our students, however, attend Broome County educational programs. Before I make a final statement about closure, I am waiting to hear from Delaware County. I will be attending an emergency meeting at the county tomorrow morning. Once I have done that and have had a chance to meet with the administrative team, I will communicate more information to staff and families. Right now, I appreciate your patience as we gather more information and make plans to address everyone's needs.

Special thanks to Mrs. Sanford for sharing her space and time, Mrs. Wehrli for assisting with planning and preparations, the Senior Class for donating a coffee machine, and Mr. Matthews for building our dividers and assembling furniture!!

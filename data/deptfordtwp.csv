Robin Holmes, Upper School Paraprofessional, rides the bus before and after school. The bus staff she rides with, Deptford Bus #60, both made donations to our Upper School during the holiday season. After hearing Robin talk about the holiday dinner baskets that staff puts together for students and their families, they decided to get involved themselves. Thank you to Pam Cox and Sonia McCloskey for your generosity this holiday season. Collectively they donated turkeys, cases of canned goods and fourteen Walmart gift cards for our older students. Pictured here is Archway’s Upper School Principal Mark Letiziano, Sonia McCloskey, Robin Holmes and Pam Cox.

I am excited and grateful to be the new principal at Derby Hills Elementary School!

This is my 18th year in education. For the past nine years, I have had the privilege of teaching sixth grade at Derby‚Äôs Sixth Grade Center, and most recently, at Derby North Middle School.

My wife, Megan, is a Parent Educator for Parents as Teachers in Winfield, KS. We have three children: NorahKate (12), Cal (9), and Leo (7).

I love to learn and help create ideal learning spaces and atmospheres for all. I have a passion for building teams that create inclusive and welcoming cultures. I have been fortunate to work in high-functioning and dynamic teams, especially within Derby Public Schools. I am excited to be a part of the Derby Hills‚Äô team.

The uncertainty may have students and families unsure and anxious about the upcoming school year; however, it is important to hear this. Whatever the school year looks like, I am certain that there is a building of champions eager to love and learn with your children.

You are smart. You are kind. You are important.

I am thrilled to be joining the Cooper family as Principal beginning this fall. I taught elementary music for 13 years in Derby, Wichita, San Francisco, and Austin, TX. Most recently, I was the Assistant Principal at Seltzer Elementary School in Wichita. My husband and I have been married for 11 years and are the proud parents of Makai, who will be a 2nd grader this coming year. I am deeply committed to supporting all students as they grow academically, socially, and emotionally and look forward to meeting each of you soon. Please know that I look forward to partnering with you as we support your student(s) to reach for their dreams. It is an honor to serve the Cooper community and join your amazing team!

Derby Middle School Bulldog Makeover and House Construction

It was truly an honor to be asked to work on this project with such historical value to Derby Middle School!

The bulldog statue has lived alone in the display case for a number of years until the DMS PAMS-PTO commissioned for the statue to be repainted and have a house built to fill the case.

The statue is painted to be 3D version of the school logo using the same color scheme for the body, mimicking the same facial features including the shape of the eyes, shading on the face and even the number of spots on each side of the face.

The house was constructed using actual floor planks from the original gym floor, customized to size for the case. As well, the case is lined with turf from the football field bringing in many different elements to create this amazing display!

A very special thanks to the members of Derby Middle School PAMS for the opportunity to be a part of this project, and to Derby Middle School and Derby Public Schools for the chance to add to the history of the building!",2.0,"CMDesigning

Acting prudently and with an abundance of caution, we have decided to close Grandview Elementary and have sent all essential employees home through next Tuesday. We have asked that they monitor their health and if symptoms arise they should contact their health care provider immediately. Again the family member has been tested and no results are available at this time. All necessary steps recommended by the CDC and PA Department of Health are being followed.

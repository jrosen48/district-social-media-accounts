Dear DeSoto,

My earliest, fondest memories of my grandmother, Alberta Weaver, occurred in our home in Chicago. It was the home that she purchased almost 50 years ago after saving a portion of her bi-weekly paycheck in a shoebox, hidden under a floorboard in a small apartment located in one of the notoriously unsafe “projects” in Chicago. My grandmother was the first in her family to own a home and she earned the money working the night shift at R. R. Donnelley manually assembling advertisement catalogues. She usually returned home about 7:30 AM and spent the next several hours watching me while my mother went to work. It was during our time together that she would affirm how special I was and how one day, I would “be somebody.”

The teacher of the month for Ruby Young Elementary School is Mr. Marcus Ware, Kinder-5th Grade Behavior Intervention Classroom teacher. Mr. Ware has been in education for two years in DeSoto ISD and on this campus for two years.

Mr. Ware graduated from East Texas State University in Commerce, Texas with a degree in Business Administration. He chose education because he noticed the varying needs of children as he had the opportunity to work with children via other organizational affiliations.

Principal Duren applauded the selection of Mr.Ware because he goes above and beyond the call of duty when it comes to supporting our students throughout the building. Students and parents alike respect his degree of willingness to work with our students along with his extremely caring attitude and concern for the overall well-being of every child on our campus. He is indeed a great professional and highly regarded by all stakeholders at Ruby Young ES.",0.0,"DeSoto ISD added 10 new photos.

December 2019 · DeSoto, TX ·

The DHS Culinary Program and the PTA in partnership with Texas Trust Credit Union hosted its first Chili Cook Off at DeSoto High School.
During the lunch hour, staff and community members were able to sample and vote on the best chili recipe for a small donation. Several DHS staff members were the unknown chefs who prepared some unique variations of this classic dish, such as spicy creole, alarm, all beef, all pork, with queso, etc. The favorite of them all was the spicy Creole version which had many requests for additional servings.

The event hostesses were truly grateful to the community donors who supported this effort, including Texas Trust Credit Union, Chicken Express DeSoto, On-Time Lending, Reppin’ My Kid Fanwear, ElstonAire and the DeSoto PTSA. The team is also appreciative of the uniquely designed trophies created
by the DHS Art students.

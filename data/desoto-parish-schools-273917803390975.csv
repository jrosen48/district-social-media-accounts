The Desoto Parish School Board has been working to ensure our students have access to healthy meals during this pandemic. We are pleased to announce that the Emergency Meals-To-You Program has been extended until August 15, 2020. As a result, qualiﬁed families will continue to receive meals until the beginning of the school year.

The Emergency Meals-To-You Program was set to expire on June 30, 2020. This program serves our students shelf-stable, easily prepared, kid-friendly meals to families in emergency situations. Every two weeks, a box of 10 or more meals that meet nutritional requirements is sent directly to the student's residence.

For families currently receiving meals, August 15, 2020, is the last date meals will be shipped, so deliveries will arrive and overlap with the new school year. It is also possible for individual families to opt out of the program if they no longer wish to receive meals by contacting info@mealstoyou.org.

Dear DeSoto Schools Families,

As you know by now, Governor Edwards has ordered that all public schools across Louisiana remain closed for the remainder of the academic year. Although our buildings will remain closed to students, we will continue to provide online learning resources as well as grab & go breakfast and lunch opportunities through May 22nd. https://dps-la.schoolloop.com/faqclosures

We will also begin reaching out to parents very soon with information regarding the end of year grading processes. Please be on the lookout for correspondence from your child’s principal with detailed information.

We understand these are challenging times, and we remain committed to serving our students and you, their families, to the greatest extent possible. We look forward to the day where all of this is behind us, and wish you well throughout the summer months. Together, we will get through these difficult times because we are #DeSotoStrong!

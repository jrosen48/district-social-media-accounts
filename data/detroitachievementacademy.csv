At DAA, we believe that character development is as important as academic achievement. Growing and learning to be the best people and citizens that we can be is central to everything we do, and we ground this social emotional learning in our six Habits of Character. These traits are talked about and discussed constantly by our students and teachers as we all strive to be leaders in our Habits of Character, and our shift to distance learning hasn’t changed that! Here are some ways you can show curiosity and creativity, whether you’re a student or a parent or just following along.

We also want to thank you for your support - you’ve sent us copy paper, toner, and at home school supplies and we appreciate and will use every single item. If you still want to help, please check out our Amazon list (https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/32PZIC43FXNQP?ref_=wl_share).

Over the next month, we will continue sharing some of our favorite pictures of our students and the incredible work they’ve created. We are so proud of them, miss them to the point of tears regularly, and we want to do our part in spreading positivity and joy during this uneasy time.

Wanted to share a couple of opportunities that will be in our area in March that are worth looking into if you are interested in learning more about the mental health, depression, etc. part of a person's life. Mental health and the focus placed upon recognizing and helping with it has become a major focus for our society these days - please take a moment to check out the attachments as well as the email portion below.
If you are around the Milbank area I wanted to share two exciting opportunities we have coming up (both are free 😉)!

Please share with your
students/parents/community!
BASICS class - for caregivers and parents of children/adolescents with emotional and behavioral difficulties. This is a 6 week course (once a week)

1Degree of Separation: A ""funny"" look at Depression and Suicide. This is a comedy group out of California that we have the privilege of bringing to Milbank (www.1degreeofseparation.life)

As we see more colds and influenza. There are some things that we as parents and staff can do to help control the spread of the viruses.

As per the Center for Disease Center (CDC) there are ways that we can help control the outbreak of influenza in our schools. The flu vaccine is the best way to protect against complications of influenza. Flu vaccines can reduce flu illness, doctor visits, and missing school, as well as prevent flu –related hospitalizations. Other things we can do is covering our cough, washing hands frequently as well as staying home when we are sick.

The CDC recommends keeping your student has a fevers that are greater than 100 F, vomiting, diarrhea, and or severe respiratory symptoms. Please remember that your student should not come back to school until they have been fever free for 24 hours without fever reducing medication.

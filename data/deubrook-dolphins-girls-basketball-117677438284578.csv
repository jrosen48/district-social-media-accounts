Hello Dolphin Nation! I have a fantastic opportunity for you to own a piece of Deubrook history! This past Saturday we held our first ever Don Ray Invitational Cross Country Meet. We made the decision a year ago to change the name of our Invitational to honor Mr. Ray for all he has done for Dolphin Nation and the Cross Country programs. That being said, the Cross country team is selling these shirts. We give the top 20 place winners in each varsity division one of these shirts. We had so many positive comments and questions about the shirts that we have decided to place another order for all that want to buy one or more shirts. Cost is just $10/shirt or $11 for 2XL or larger. If you would like to place an order for any of the colors please text me at 605-695-0020, email me at brad.debeer@k12.sd.us or catch me at a Dolphin event this week. Please let me know size and color! Orders and payment due by Sunday, September 6. Please contact me with questions. Thank you. #GOPHINS #DOLPHINNATION

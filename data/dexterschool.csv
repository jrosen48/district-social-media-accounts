16 years ago, #AISSCampusPartner Marty Apodaca left his hometown of Dexter, NM to head for #LoboLand, where he’s earned a BA in English, and MA in Counseling. Currently, as a PhD student in Counselor Education, Marty’s expanding his #SAPro expertise to empower students to become the authors of their careers. One of the highlights of his role as a Career Development Facilitator with @unmcareerservices is being the Liaison to the #UNM Ethnic Centers and developing programming that best suits student needs. His most recent project “Managing Anxiety Around Career Uncertainty” is focused on helping students manage their concerns & doubts while better understanding the current professional arena. He’ll also be receiving his independent counseling licensure this month!! Marty’s contributed his insight & wisdom to the #AISS Ambassadors Program, Sidekicks, and the American Indian Summer Bridge Program & we’re enthusiastic about continuing our connection & collaboration with such a shining example of #LoboPride!! #UNMRoleModel #LobosMakingADifference",0.0,"DHS alumnus, Marty Apodaca!

UNM - American Indian Student Services
October 2, 2019 at 12:00 PM ·

16 years ago, #AISSCampusPartner Marty Apodaca left his hometown of Dexter, NM to head for #LoboLand, where he’s earned a BA in English, and MA in Counseling. Currently, as a PhD student in Counselor Education, Marty’s expanding his #SAPro expertise to empower students to become the authors of their careers. One of the highlights of his role as a Career Development Facilitator with @unmcareerservices is being the Liaison to the #UNM Ethnic Centers and developing programming that best suits student needs. His most recent project “Managing Anxiety Around Career Uncertainty” is focused on helping students manage their concerns & doubts while better understanding the current professional arena. He’ll also be receiving his independent counseling licensure this month!! Marty’s contributed his insight & wisdom to the #AISS Ambassadors Program, Sidekicks, and the American Indian Summer Bridge Program & we’re enthusiastic about continuing our connection & collaboration with such a shining example of #LoboPride!! #UNMRoleModel #LobosMakingADifference",2020-01-02 14:39:33,,

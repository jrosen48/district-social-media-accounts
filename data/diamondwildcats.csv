We will be having a “Beep and Greet” on Thursday, August 20th from 5:30-7 for students pre-k through 5th grade. Although we would prefer to have a traditional Open House, due to recommendations by DESE, the CDC, and Newton County Health Department we are making some modifications.
Parents and students, please enter South Main off of 59 Highway by the High School. You will then drive north in front of the Middle School and Elementary building. There will be a location set up where everyone will be able to meet the classroom teacher. We will also be handing out Parent Pick Up tags and providing other information in regards to Free/Reduced lunch and Transportation.
Students will need to plan on bringing classroom supplies the first day of school as we will not be able to take them that evening. First day supplies should include pencils, crayons, and paper. All other supplies can be brought to school at a later time.
If you have questions, please call the Elementary Office at 325-5189.

Today, we were notified that we have several student athletes and other members of our student body who attended a party over the weekend and are now exhibiting symptoms that could be related to COVID-19. Those symptoms include fever, loss of taste and smell, diarrhea and vomiting. Those student’s parents have been notified and those students have been sent home.

As a result, we are cancelling this week's JV football game against Woodville on Thursday, the Varsity Football game against Woodville Friday and the volleyball game against Warren.on Friday.

We have disinfected the campus today. Diboll has strict protocols in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and our students and staff do a tremendous job while they are on campus following those protocols. Parents, we ask your assistance in stressing the importance of masking up, social distancing and hand washing while they are away from school to help us be able to continue our extracurricular activities and to keep students in school.

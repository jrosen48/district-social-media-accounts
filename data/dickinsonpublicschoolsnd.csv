As the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, continues to spread across the country, thousands of American businesses and schools are making the decision to move to remote work and online instruction. Consolidated has joined the Federal Communications Commission’s pledge to Keep Americans Connected.

We are working directly with area schools to facilitate a distance-learning environment where needed. Contact your local school for more information.

Even in these times of great uncertainty, Consolidated is here for you. For more information, please contact Consolidated at 701-483-4000

Hello Dickinson,

We believe the decision to close schools to minimize the spread of COVID 19 is the right decision, but we also understand that it may present challenges to some Dickinson families with kids that were planning to eat at school this week.

🚨If you’re concerned about ensuring your children have a hearty lunch, we want to HELP!

This week, Monday (3/16) – Friday (3/20)
We will be providing FREE KIDS meals for take out. Please have the children present.

Between 11:00 am - 12:00 pm
And between 5:00 pm – 6:00 pm.

No purchase necessary for one meal per kid per meal period. 💯

We’re going to get through this together‼

Hello Dickinson,

We believe the decision to close schools to minimize the spread of COVID 19 is the right decision, but we also understand that it may present challenges to some Dickinson families with kids that were planning to eat at school this week.

🚨If you’re concerned about ensuring your children have a hearty lunch, we want to HELP!

This week, Monday (3/16) – Friday (3/20)
We will be providing FREE KIDS meals for take out. Please have the children present.

Between 11:00 am - 12:00 pm
And between 5:00 pm – 6:00 pm.

No purchase necessary for one meal per kid per meal period. 💯

We’re going to get through this together‼

Please join us tomorrow at 2:45 p.m. at Lincoln Elementary Dickinson ND for a brief remembrance and farewell assembly for Mrs. Ross.

The Dickinson Public School District is thankful for Mrs. Ross's years of dedicated service to our students and community and offers condolences to her family and friends.

Remembering Lincoln’s Crosswalk Hero- Mrs. Ross: 🛑
She was the first person to greet our students in the morning and the last smiling face to send them on their way, at the end of each day. Rainy skies or sunshiny days, she loved to greet our students with a smile and a wave to the parents. Mrs. Ross carried her Stop 🛑 Sign with pride and always put student safety first. She loved our Lincoln Parents and Students dearly. ❤️
With the assistance of our district elementary school counselors and social workers our Lincoln students were able to express farewell messages and memories of Mrs. Ross.
Thursday, at 2:45 we will host a brief remembrance and farewell assembly at Lincoln for Mrs. Ross. Parents and friends are invited to attend and may certainly join their students.
Sending hugs to all,
Mrs. Peterson",2020-03-04 10:41:06,,

We are cheerleaders so as exhilarating as it is to hear your team announced each time, it was sobering to see teams around us cope with not moving on. At this level of competition every single team is top notch. Every person there has put in tons of work and heart to get there.
When we finally got to Finals round announcements and they called us, we were crazy excited and honored to be in the top 11 in the nation! All along we wanted to represent ND and our school and community well and to make you all proud.
These beautiful athletes are bringing home some hardware. They earned 8th!!! We couldn't have done it without our parents, community, sponsors, school administration , teachers and friends.

On August 24 we will welcome our students virtually and on September 14 we will welcome face-to-face students back to our campuses. We understand that you and your Gators may be feeling weary about the school year to come. One of our teacher from Gator Nation, Mrs. Doherty from Lobit Middle School, wrote and illustrated this book ""Welcome Back"" with our Gators in mind. It addresses concerns that students may have about coming back to school during a pandemic.

The Dickinson Education Foundation is selling copies of ""Welcome Back"" for $12 at the Education Support Center as well as online. Your purchase benefits the foundation's mission of supporting teachers and students by providing teaching grants and scholarships.

On August 24 we will welcome our students virtually and on September 14 we will welcome face-to-face students back to our campuses. We understand that you and your Gators may be feeling weary about the school year to come. One of our teacher from Gator Nation, Mrs. Doherty from Lobit Middle School, wrote and illustrated this book ""Welcome Back"" with our Gators in mind. It addresses concerns that students may have about coming back to school during a pandemic.

The Dickinson Education Foundation is selling copies of ""Welcome Back"" for $12 at the Education Support Center as well as online. Your purchase benefits the foundation's mission of supporting teachers and students by providing teaching grants and scholarships.

Dickinson ISD has been busy this summer developing plans for Remote Instruction for the 2020-2021 school year.

Lee Courville, Deputy Superintendent for Educational Services, developed five video messages to breakdown the Remote Instruction Model for each grade level in Dickinson ISD.

The purpose of the videos are to provide parents, students and the community in Dickinson ISD with an understanding of the Remote Instruction Model in Dickinson ISD, what it will look like and what parents and students can expect when we return for the 2020-2021 school year.

We understand parents have a very important decision to make regarding the choice of Face-to-Face or Remote Instruction, and we want them to have the the information needed to make the right decision for their children and family.

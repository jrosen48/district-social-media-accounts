""The water issue at the Rehoboth campus has certainly tested the patience of us all. Please know that your children have handled the inconvenience very well. As you know by now that a bacteria was found in our water that has forced us to follow necessary protocols to make sure our water is safe. We are following all of those protocols. The well on the property services both buildings and is as old as the buildings. The process of making sure the water is safe changes day to day. We continue to offer bottled water and hand sanitizer. The water is safe to wash hands but not to drink and not to wash hands if there is an open cut. More information will be forthcoming.""",2019-09-11 15:07:57,,

Another reason that this years golf banquet was special was because it marked the 40th year of DR's great coach, Mr. Bill Cute. Dr. Azar, in his remarks to the gathering said, ""Mr. Cute is the absolute epitome of what and who a great coach should be: someone whom genuinely cares about the student-athlete and one that is totally committed to making each one of his students of the game, better. Tonight we salute Mr. Bill Cute as an outstanding coach and mentor to his players and we celebrate the student-athletes for a remarkable and magical year.""",2016-11-12 21:50:15,,

Reds? Blues? Some of each?
All is ok. Your feelings are ok. 😊

For today, join me! Go snag your current or favorite book. Sit on the sun. Enjoy the moment. ☀️

I’m thinking of you all! And, students, I continue to miss our M-F schedule like crazy. I love seeing you outside, though. Don’t mind my honks and big waves! 👋🏼 😃

Happy Weekend!

If you HAD to choose...which would it be?

Students..Adults....Everyone!
Let’s play a digital-formatted “THIS or THAT” —DES/DLG-themed!!

Here’s how to play:
1. Save the attachment to your photos.
2. Open in photos and “edit”
3. Circle your choice! (Some of them are tough!! 😝)
4. Save your edited “photo”
5. Post your photo in the comments, along with the name of whose it is! Everyone can do their own!
6. Share, Share, Share!

As a team (yes, with you!), let’s continue to spread the DES page! This interactive and informative (& entertaining) Facebook page is one of our many communication sources for the upcoming weeks.

Help us out! TOGETHER, we can be a support to all students & families. 💙💛

From what we learned today we think we will be better prepared for the next time it is smoky outside. Here are a few tools we discovered and want to pass on.

www.airvisual.com is a great website to see what the Air Quality Index (AQI) is. In larger districts when the AQI is above 100 they cancel outdoor events and have indoor recess. (At 7am in Dillingham this morning the AQI was 57. @ 9pm the AQI is 17.)

We also found a nice chart that talks about the levels of AQI. (attached to the post)

Our first priority at DES is children's safety. If you feel as a parent it is to smoky for your child at recess due to asthma or a recent cold/flu please call Ani or Mr. Schollmeier at 842 5642. We will have alternatives options for students who are extra sensitive to the smoke.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2505632402998232&id=1587958894765592,,0.0,"Today @ DES we learned a lot about air quality.

We would just like to confirm that the graduation speeches will begin on KDLG at 6:00pm. The graduates will start driving the parade route 15 minutes after the speeches have finished broadcasting.

The route will start at the High School. The graduates will then drive from the school, past the Post Office, and up to the intersection by the senior center and youth center. From that intersection, the seniors will turn right and drive past the Togiak Wildlife Refuge building and past the Bristol Inn. At the next stop sign, they will drive turn left and pass n&n and then merge onto Kanakanak Rd. The graduates will turn around at the airport Y, and make their way back to the school for pictures.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2680284068850952&id=2193394927539871,,0.0,"Congratulations to the 2020 Senior Class!

First, we hope that this message finds each of you well and seeking different methods to keep up with your active lifestyles and pursuits!

Next, please know that all gym memberships will be extended by an equal amount of months that were impacted due to COVID-19. For example, if the gym is shut down for three months an additional three months will be added to your membership at no cost.

the fitness center to be fully active once again. In short, with the extremely small space, social-distancing and other precautionary measures are difficult to adhere to.

Congratulations to the DLG Lady Wolverines on securing the tournament championship! After battling 3 tough games against YK Region teams, the Wolverines overtook Toksook Bay in the final game, 47-31

Kiley Clouse and Twig Bavilla led the team in championship game scoring with 15 and 14 points, respectively, and both got a double-double!!

Big shout-outs to Senior Abbey Whitcomb, who led the team to three victories and earned All-Tournament Team Honors!

But that's not all... Huge kudos to Senior Reagan Finkenbinder, who earned TOURNAMENT MVP!!

And...the girls did it all on Cadence Dray's 15th Birthday!

There have been several public meetings held in Dinuba Unified to gain input from various groups but additional input is being sought through the administration of the attached survey. This survey will be made available to staff, students, community members, and parents.

It should only take 5-10 minutes minutes to complete so we hope you will take the time and give us your input. It is valued and will be used during the development of the 2020-2021 LCAP.

We are looking forward to the start of school on August 10, 2017.
Following community meetings at our elementary school sites and public comment sessions in the spring of this year, Dinuba Unified established a new set of attendance boundaries for our elementary schools. This action was needed to bring our school sites in line with school site capacities. Parents of affected students received a letter informing them of their new schools. While initial enrollment numbers show a small number of grade levels with large class sizes, as in previous years, we use the first 10 days of school to balance classroom sizes. We will adjust class sizes so they fall within established contract levels.

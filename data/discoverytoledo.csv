My heart is full, and I don’t think I have the proper words to express how proud I am of this staff. Four days into the school year and you would think they have been doing this in-person/virtual hybrid teaching their whole careers. It’s amazing to watch them as they navigate this new normal with grace and poise while keeping student relationships as the focus of everything they do. I’m honored and blessed to work alongside them.

Parents, thank you so much for your continued patience as we work through these challenges together. It truly takes a village to raise a child, and we have the best village around!",0.0,"Principal Campbell

Dear parents,
We know that this pretty much everything about this situation is new, uncomfortable, and overwhelming- especially when it comes to facilitating learning for your kids. If you are able to utilize all the different resources the school has made available, fabulous! Your children will surely benefit from that! If it’s all overwhelming, and you can’t keep up, don’t stress!! The best things you can do for your kids right now are simple things like talking with them about their feelings, playing outside, and reading together at night. Do what you can and don’t stress about the rest. As teachers, we are no strangers to filling in learning gaps. We will get your kids back on track when we return to school. In the mean time, do the best you can with school work, hug them tight for us, and make memories laughing together. We’re here for you! Please keep messaging us with any questions you have.

We weren't sure what we were getting into when we decided to start the Odyssey of the Mind Program. Come to find out, it was several months of fun, laughter, and being able to watch a group of amazing kids grow more than we ever thought possible. Unfortunately, the team did not get to perform at states this year, but we know the hard work and passion they put in is worth more than any award they could have won. Speaking of awards though, the team placed 1st place at the Regional Tournament in March. They are also the very first and only team to be formed in Ohio.
It was a wonderful year, and we thank you for the memories that were made! Until next year!

April 20 at 9:34 PM ·

We weren't sure what we were getting into when we decided to start the Odyssey of the Mind Program. Come to find out, it was several months of fun, laughter, and being able to watch a group of amazing kids grow more than we ever thought possible. Unfortunately, the team did not get to perform at states this year, but we know the hard work and passion they put in is worth more than any award they could have won. Speaking of awards though, the team placed 1st place at the Regional Tournament in March. They are also the very first and only team to be formed in Ohio.
It was a wonderful year, and we thank you for the memories that were made! Until next year!
Congratulations to our 2019-2020 Odyssey of the Mind Team

- Mr. Jacobs & Mrs. Rogers

Please be on the look out this fall for information regarding next year's team !

- If we lose more school days due to this pandemic, we will be sending you information on an online platform where the teachers will assign learning modules for our students to complete. Teachers will also be creating new packets for students, and I will communicate to you when those are ready.

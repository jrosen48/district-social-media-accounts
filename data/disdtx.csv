Do you love to eat and drink on Friday nights while you are watching the football and volleyball games?

Well we need help in the concession stand so this luxury can continue to happen.

Homecoming is the next big game Next week. We will be selling hamburgers/cheeseburger baskets that night and need help badly. We have several parents that work consistently in the concession stand who also have children in the homecoming court and won’t be able to serve during that time .......so we shut it down or try to get more coverage. We need HELP!

We have games tonight and need help during those as well!

Dawson ISD also needs gate helpers. Please come out and help so we can continue to lrovide tou with what you need during the games.

We too work full time jobs, we have children in these sports, and are tired. So we have heard every reason why people can’t but we are looking for those who can!

Free dinner and free entry into the game that day.",3.0,"Dawson Bulldog Booster Club

It is with great sadness that I have to announce that we will not be having a 2020 Dawson Peewee football/Cheer season. However, the NEH LEAGUE has made a decision to allow Dawson youth interested in playing football or cheerleading to participate in other towns programs. If you are interested in playing or cheering in another town please get in touch with Will Dickson, Victoria Dickson or Rhonda Moore and we will help you get hooked up with a town president.

Today was supposed to be your day...your time to show all of the hard work you put in and once again fill our small town with music. Keep your chins up and keep on working hard as we all get through this. If there is one thing I know about all of you in this program and in our district as a whole it is that we will come back stronger and more driven then we have ever been. We don't give up, we don't quit...we push, we fight, and we achieve.

So after a string of just bad days I was feeling the question was I still doing the right thing by continuing to teach? Am I making an impact at all anymore? Today I had a group of students that made all that just go away. They surprised me with a sweet poster of the most caring gestures and notes. These seniors (plus 1 junior) walked into my 8th period class of sophomores and presented me with this. It absolutely brought me to tears. They’ll never know how much I needed this today. I was ready to give up and these kids stepped up without knowing and completely touched my heart.

Lesson learned .....just because I’m the teacher doesn’t always mean I’m the one doing the teaching. 🥰❤️

It impacted the student’s ability to access websites including Zoom, Google Classroom, and SeeSaw. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

Viruses are a common problem. No one likes being sick. These are things that we should always be doing to prevent becoming sick or making others sick.

-Keep your child home when they are sick. Students need to stay home for 24 hours after they have a fever, and after an episode of vomiting or diarrhea. Do not use medications like ibuprofen or tylenol and send your child to school if your child has a fever.

-Instruct your child to wash hands with soap and water for 20 seconds (sing ABC or Happy Birthday twice) after they go to the bathroom, before and after eating, after blowing their nose or coughing or sneezing.

-If they cannot wash their hands, then they should use hand sanitizer.

-Instruct your child to cough or sneeze into their elbow and away from other people.

-Instruct your child to avoid touching their eyes, nose, mouth.

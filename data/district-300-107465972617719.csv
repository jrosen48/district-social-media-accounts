Dear patents and graduates,

Due to inclement weather we have developed a back-up plan if needed. If weather does not permit our scheduled graduation ceremony, we will transition to a dive-thru style ceremony as follows:

1. Cars will be directed by rows to leave their vehicles and follow directions to arrive at the left side ( facing the stage ).

2. Once there, the graduate will exit the vehicle and access the stage via the stairs.

3. Graduates will receive their diploma cover and have their picture taken

4. The family car should pull forward to the other side of the stage to pick up the graduate.

5. Vehicles will then leave the Sears Centre parking lot.

Please note that we currently plan to follow the regular schedule. Please pay attention to emails for updates. For those at the ceremony,

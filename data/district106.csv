I share the following message on behalf of Heather Pilch (Teachers' Union President) and John Corcoran (District 106 Board President):

The start of the school year is rapidly approaching, and we look forward to another great year here at Highlands! At this time, we were hoping to announce a finalized teachers' contract in conjunction with the beginning of the school year. Unfortunately, the Board and Teachers' Union have not yet come to a final agreement. We have utilized the services of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service throughout the negotiation process and have reached tentative agreements on a number of issues. We are now down to the topic of economics (i.e., salaries and benefits). Both parties have been working in good faith with one another and anticipate a resolution soon. We are excited for students' return to school on August 21 and for a great kickoff to the year!

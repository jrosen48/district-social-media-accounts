All scholarships with the due date of April 3rd that do NOT list instructions on mailing or emailing to the sponsor can be held until we return to our normal school schedule. If the date of return ends up being pushed back further we will come up with an alternative plan which will be communicated via this facebook page. In an effort to prevent any materials from getting lost in the shuffle we also ask that any letters of recommendation are held with the application materials.

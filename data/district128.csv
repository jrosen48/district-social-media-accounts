Enjoy this story and video about the amazing work done by the VHHS student-artists who participated in The Memory Project along with art teacher Allison Molloy:

The VHHS Art Department received a video for The Memory Project portrait delivery to Malaysian children on April 1. The children were so excited to receive our students' artwork, and they fully understood that creating the portraits was a way to show them how much our students care about their well-being and their future during uncertain times.

Our student-artists' efforts show these children that their well-being and future matters. Over 5,000 portraits were flown to Malaysia with members of the non-profit team delivering them before borders were closed and quarantine began. In building this international connection through visual art, VHHS students create to fulfill part of the DARING mission of District 128.

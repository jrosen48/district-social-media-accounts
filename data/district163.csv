Good morning...

I would love to see my kiddos each and every day,
So please flood my inbox with tons of pictures...what do you say?

I miss your smiling faces and the laughter in your voice,
Not being at school, was neither of our choice.

So keep practicing your colors, numbers and ABCs,
Learning is important...wouldn't you agree?

I hope this time goes by real fast,
Until we all see each other when we meet again in class!

Good morning...

I would love to see my kiddos each and every day,
So please flood my inbox with tons of pictures...what do you say?

I miss your smiling faces and the laughter in your voice,
Not being at school, was neither of our choice.

So keep practicing your colors, numbers and ABCs,
Learning is important...wouldn't you agree?

I hope this time goes by real fast,
Until we all see each other when we meet again in class!

Be safe and miss you all,
Mrs. Rowland",2020-03-19 10:56:22,,

An estimated 5 percent of kids under the age of five were missed in the 2010 Census.

At about 1 million babies and young children, that’s the largest undercount of any age group.

The #2020Census helps determine which areas qualify for the critical resources that children and families depend on for the next 10 years—basically an entire childhood.

During those years, their communities could receive less funding for schools, parks, SNAP/WIC, hospitals, transportation, and other things kids need.

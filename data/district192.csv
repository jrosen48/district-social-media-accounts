We're very proud to be a part of Farmington's annual Memorial Day program. This year, in place of our traditional performance at Corinthian Cemetery, we are extremely proud to have FHS Band students taking part in ""Taps Across America"" at 3pm.

Thousands of trumpet & bugle players across the nation will step outside their homes today at 1500 local time to perform, but we've gone one step further and invited ANYONE in our band program to be a part of it.

Please pause today at 3 and listen for Taps in your neighborhood. We are proud to take part in this meaningful program in honor of all fallen heroes.

We need this more than ever. Our STUDENTS needed this more than ever. Here is a project that gives us hope!

We challenged every one of our band members to use their passions, interests, and talents to create something new and beautiful and expressive, inspired by our band music. We received everything from digital art and animation to research papers, poetry, and Lego sculptures! They built rockets; wrote passionate reflections; and submitted paintings, drawings, watercolors, and so much more.

Please take a couple minutes to let this video brighten your day. Leave some love for these students who reveal so much about themselves and how they're keeping busy during Distance Learning.

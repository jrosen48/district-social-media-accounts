Honest Game takes students’ transcript/test scores and translates it into a College Athletic Report on Eligibility (CARETM). CARETM tracks all the academic requirements and ensures you know what to do before it’s too late. College coaches love the CARETM, because it does all the calculations for them and shows them you have a plan. There’s also a section where parents can consent for teachers to share their CARE™ with college coaches, so you don’t have to ask for permission every time a request comes in. With this new tool, District 205 will ensure our student athletes are ready for the next level!

Yesterday, school officials were made aware of a threat that was posted on social media directed at Thornwood High School. The person responsible for the posted threat was immediately addressed by both high school and local authorities. There is no further threat to our building.

Last night we learned of a second post. This post “warned” about the original post from yesterday which was already addressed. As a result we have collaborated with local authorities and have a plan in place to ensure the safety and security of our students, and are prepared to have a safe school day.

We will remain vigilant as we are certainly living in different times with the influence of social media.

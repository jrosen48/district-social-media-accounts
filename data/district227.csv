""Here at Rich Central High School in the South Suburbs of #Chicago, Ms. Argue was my Junior year English Teacher. I walked into this classroom shy and insecure, not knowing that I would walk out with purpose and hope. After having our class write a poem for a homework assignment, then recite it in front of the class, Ms. Argue pulled me to the side, she gave me an “A,” then proceeded to ask me to perform at an upcoming talent show. I was too scared to do the show, but Ms. Argue approached me again and “made” me do the next show. As nervous as I was, I performed and surprisingly got a standing ovation my first time ever on stage. Needless to say I’ve been performing ever since. Ms. Argue forever changed my life. Teachers change lives! Love You Ms. Argue."" - J. Ivy, #RecordingAcademy Chicago Chapter President and spoken word artist.

⬩Take time to talk with your child about the outbreak. Answer questions and share facts in a way that your child can understand.
⬩ Reassure your child that they’re safe. Let them know it’s OK if they feel upset. Share with them how you deal with your own stress so that they can learn how to cope from you.
⬩ Limit your child’s exposure to media coverage of the event. Children may misinterpret what they hear. They can be frightened about something they don’t understand.
⬩ Help him/her have a sense of structure. Plan a visual schedule for the day: introduce it in the morning then work your way through it. This helps with anxiety and unexpected change.

Hello world 🌍 as my brother would say😊 I want to encourage everyone to wear their mask 😷 as often as possible. I would be the first to admit I wasn’t wearing one because I wasn’t concerned for me,but then I had an unction of the spirit which allowed me to see I was unintentionally being selfish. I was being selfish because I wasn’t considering that others might have not wanted to be close to me for their own safety, as to where if they would have said something, I would have become offended. So I apologize for my past, and I hope we take responsibility for self,and others. Now go out there and be safe🤩

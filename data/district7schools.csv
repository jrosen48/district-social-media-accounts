Apparently, some people are saying that the schools will quarantine students without the parents knowledge of their location, or call the Health Department to pick up the child instead of the parent. This may be one of the craziest rumors I’ve ever heard. This is 100% FALSE. If a child becomes ill at school, we will call the parent to pick them up like we always have. Children will NEVER be released to anyone other than a parent, guardian or other emergency contacts provided by the parent. We will not be calling the health department to report that children became ill at school. We will not even offer an opinion about what illness your child may have. We are not doctors.

This may be one of the craziest rumors I’ve ever heard. This is 100% FALSE. If a child becomes ill at school, we will call the parent to pick them up like we always have. Children will NEVER be released to anyone other than a parent, guardian or other emergency contacts provided by the parent.

To help everyone understand...the robo-call system is a web-based calling system. All of the school districts use it. When hundreds of superintendents are placing a robo-call at the same time, the system gets crazy. Sometimes calls don’t launch. Sometimes calls are duplicated. It’s the nature of the beast. All I know...it’s better than waiting to see District 7 scroll across the TV screen at 11pm or 5am.

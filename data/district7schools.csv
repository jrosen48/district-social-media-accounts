This may be one of the craziest rumors I’ve ever heard. This is 100% FALSE. If a child becomes ill at school, we will call the parent to pick them up like we always have. Children will NEVER be released to anyone other than a parent, guardian or other emergency contacts provided by the parent.

To help everyone understand...the robo-call system is a web-based calling system. All of the school districts use it. When hundreds of superintendents are placing a robo-call at the same time, the system gets crazy. Sometimes calls don’t launch. Sometimes calls are duplicated. It’s the nature of the beast. All I know...it’s better than waiting to see District 7 scroll across the TV screen at 11pm or 5am.

All I know...it’s better than waiting to see District 7 scroll across the TV screen at 11pm or 5am.

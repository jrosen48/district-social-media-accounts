Mrs. Smith is reading Upside Down in the Middle of Nowhere. She highly recommends this amazing story about one girl’s experiences during Hurricane Katrina. Probably best for 4th grade and up.

A BIG Friday shout out to our very own Mr. Schammert for keeping our Wildcats engaged in such a fun way during Physical Education! Wildcats practiced their underhand toss with a game called ""Make it, Stack it"". As Wildcats make buckets with their underhand toss they get to stack them up. If they miss, they hand the ball to the next player for another try. The goal of the game is to stack six buckets! Kudos to Mr. Schammert for being such a cool P.E. teacher! #D89Bilingual #D89WIldcatsRoar",0.0,"Our Wildcats not only move their bodies in PE, but use their minds as well.

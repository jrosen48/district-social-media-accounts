There is no doubt that COVID-19 has impacted all families in some manner, especially so from a financial standpoint. Many of the nation's education organizations have lobbied both the USDE and USDA to extend the waivers and continue offering meals to student at no cost. Last week, the USDA, which has oversight of the school breakfast and lunch programs, announced an indefinite extension of the waivers. Extension of the waivers means, that ALL Dixon R-1 students, for the indefinite future, will receive FREE Breakfast and Lunch.

We ask that if your child has a negative balance that you use this time to try and catch that balance up. If your student has a positive balance, it will remain in their account until we return to normal and everyone goes back to their regular lunch program. Keep in mind this extension could stop at any time and everyone will go back to what they were on to begin with.

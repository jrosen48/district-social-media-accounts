A huge THANK YOU to all that were able to attend our Second Annual Show Me Afterschool Day at the Capitol! It was a FANTASTIC day to share the good news of afterschool around the state. We are grateful to all the legislators who gave us office time, hallway time, introductions on the floor and stopped by our exhibits in the Rotunda. Thanks to all the programs that brought afterschool youth and showcased their programs with their exhibits! We can’t wait to begin work for our Third Annual in 2021! Please tag your program and any legislators you met with!!

Cant help but become teary eyed when recieving such a sweet card from the DMS SERVE TEAM. These kids show me everyday why I do what I do. They inspire me to be better.

This week, our kids came up with ""Pay it Forward Serve Style"" where they pick one person each week to give a helping hand or to express a kind word to help lift someone up. I think the kids just served me with a dose of this. I HAVE BEEN SERVED, SERVE STYLE!

And big THANKS to Mike Plummer for getting the tree set up for me to come in to set up and finishing those backer papers for the doors. The staff is so lucky to have you!",2.0,"Niki Bascomb

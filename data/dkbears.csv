Our high school days were filled with unforgettable times with friends, lessons learned that you will never forget, and experiences that helped shape who you are today. Unfortunately due to sickness among our high school students and staff, this year's homecoming pep rally will be held virtually. So we need your help to make this years homecoming extra special for these students!

As you reflect on your time at DHS and your own Homecoming memories, we encourage you to share!

1) Send us a photo with a memory of your time at DHS, and we will share some of them on social media and online as we approach the homecoming game Friday night.

Or
2) Take a quick video (30 seconds or less) and text it to 903-276-0168. We would love it include your memories and good luck wishes in our 2020 celebration!

Donna began teaching in Austin after graduating from the University of Texas. After several years of teaching public school, she focused on raising her four children, continuing to teach in the homeschool setting before returning to the traditional classroom. She has dedicated her life to educating children at home, school and church for the last 40 plus years. Upon retirement she is looking forward to being a full-time ‚ÄúGran‚Äù to her grandchildren and taking care of her mother, who lives in assisted living and she hasn‚Äôt been able to see since COVID-19 began.

‚ÄúIt is with much thanksgiving to my Heavenly Father and the people who allowed me the opportunity to be at DeKalb ISD. I am forever a DeKalb Bear.0 My prayers and support for my hometown school will remain.‚Äù

Teachers will report today and are working diligently to prepare assignments and gather resources for students. Depending on the grade level and availability of internet and resources, students have the option of completely paper assignments or online assignments.

Online materials are currently being pushed out and will continue to be uploaded throughout the week.

Paper instructional materials will be ready for pick up by noon on Thursday until 3:00 p.m. on all campuses. Friday pickup times will be 10 a.m. - 5 p.m. on all campuses.

If possible, call ahead of time when coming to pick up assignments. To prevent any spread of sickness, office staff will prepare the packet for you and an employee will meet you outside with the assignments.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the campus office.

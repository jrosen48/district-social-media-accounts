We are extremely excited to be offering our first “Phlight Club” here in Dillingham at the Middle/High School on May 3 - 5.

Phlight Club is a weekend long event which emphasizes the value of positive relationships, building supports and teaches each of us how to see ourselves and others in “Phull Color!”

Throughout the experience our goals will be to bring students, staff and community members together to build our social, emotional and resiliency skills together.

All 6th-12th grade students are encouraged to attend (applications are due no later than April 26th) and we are also looking for interested community members/parents/guardians who would like to join us as well.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to email the Superintendent: Jason Johnson at jjohnson@dlgsd.org or contact the school at 907-842-5223.

We hope to see you there!

Sincerely,

We are extremely excited to be offering our first “Phlight Club” here in Dillingham at the Middle/High School on May 3 - 5.

Phlight Club is a weekend long event which emphasizes the value of positive relationships, building supports and teaches each of us how to see ourselves and others in “Phull Color!”

Throughout the experience our goals will be to bring students, staff and community members together to build our social, emotional and resiliency skills together.

All 6th-12th grade students are encouraged to attend (applications are due no later than April 26th) and we are also looking for interested community members/parents/guardians who would like to join us as well.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to email the Superintendent: Jason Johnson at jjohnson@dlgsd.org or contact the school at 907-842-5223.

We hope to see you there!

Sincerely,

The “Phull Color” Committee.

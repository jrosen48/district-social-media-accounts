An Abbreviated Season",5.0,"Regular season games in 2020 high school baseball and softball seasons are drawing to a close this week. On the one hand, it has been great to see students competing again. On the other hand, it's been an unusual season that saw bigger issues spill onto the playing field, from dozens of teams across the state having their seasons shortened due to COVID-19 cases to players showing solidarity for the cause of racial justice. It was a season for both the history books and the record books. Our communications team had an opportunity to capture some moments from this season, from the first day of practice to late season games, and have shared them in this photo album.

DMPS will be set up each weekday - rain or shine - during the COVID-19 closure at 11:30 AM at all ten middle schools and a dozen auxiliary sites to provide students with a free breakfast and lunch.

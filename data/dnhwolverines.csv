Tonight, Governor Reynolds recommended that schools in Iowa close for the next four weeks. We will continue to evaluate this on a week to week basis.

No before or after school activities tomorrow (Monday, March 16th). From Tuesday through Friday this week, all buildings will be closed and all activities will be cancelled until further notice.

We are confident our preventive measures to clean and disinfect will allow us to hold classes as scheduled tomorrow. That being said, if you choose to keep your child home, we will support that. Simply call your child's building and report the absence.

We'll continue to post information on multiple platforms as it becomes available. Thank you for your patience.

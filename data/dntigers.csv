This morning, on a conference call with Governor Polis, the superintendents in Colorado learned that the State has ended in-person learning for the remainder of the academic year. We will continue to provide our distance learning program, and will continue to work to make it better and more user friendly for all of our students.

We all truly miss seeing our students, and we are so very sorry that all of this could be causing any educational stress for students and families. I'm sure you understand, this was new to our staff as well, and with time we will become better and hopefully provide education with less and less opportunity for frustration.

As information changes, or updates become available, I will provide updates here on our website.

Thanks so much for all you are doing...please call or email with questions,

In Honor of National Volunteer Week 18-25. We would like to thank all our volunteers. One of our many dedicated Senior Angel Volunteers, Joe Cox, making a morning delivery of necessities to Scotty Shevlin of Dobbs Ferry. Joe, who grew up in Dobbs and is varsity football coach here was a perfect match for Scotty, a longtime Dobbs Ferry resident and football game announcer for decades. Many seniors have signed up for the program and even more folks have offered to help. If you’re interested in helping or know someone that is in need, please email us at recreation@dobbsferry.com or call 914-693-0024 #thankful #momentsofcommunity 🖤💙

Congratulations to Gayathri Nair! She won first place in her poster competition at Upstate Junior Science and Humanities Symposium! This state level competition has been held annually in Albany but they figured out a virtual solution 😊 YAY!

Nair's research focused on developing a deeper understanding of Toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic infection. The parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, has been historically difficult to eradicate during infections due to its ability to defend itself against antibiotics. Nair was able to identify a possible genetic approach to disarming the parasite, thus making the illness more easily treatable.

This is the kind of research our world truly needs, these days! Great job, Gaya3!! ❤️❤️

Our 10th graders have been reading Richard Wright's memoir, Black Boy. The memoir chronicles Richard's experience growing up in a time of extreme poverty, hunger and racism in the deep south. As our students discussed Richard's hunger regularly in class, they came up with the idea that they would like to sponsor a Thanksgiving dinner for a local family in need.

As part of this project, our students came up with great ideas (such as printing out word searches and little coloring pages for the children - things that don't cost anything so that everyone could get involved). They brought in items, made little signs, and even went on a field trip to Stop & Shop to shop for the items.

Originally made for her MYP Personal Project in Ms. Cairo’s class, the film is Erika's first claymation short. She personally designed and sculpted all of the characters, props, and sets, and then took over 2,500 still frame photos to create a fluid and engaging stop-motion about a lonely doughnut in search of a friend. Of the thirty-seven films in competition, Erika's stood apart as the only animation and was well received by the judges who remarked on her original vision and hard work. She looks forward to continuing her work with clay and stop-motion animation.",2018-05-01 10:57:29,,

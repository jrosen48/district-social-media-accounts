In addition, students will continue to learn how the English colonists developed a distinct ""American"" identity and how they moved toward the American Revolution.

The first project of the year in 8th grade Design class was a big ""step"" for students! They had to Make-a-Shoe using only the elements that were available on the table at the front of the room.

DFMS teacher JP Kaminski wanted his students to take a chance, so he was not assigning grades. The only criteria for the shoes were:
1. They had to be durable- must be able to walk 45 feet in them
2. They must be comfortable
3. They must be fashionable

Working in teams, the students had to design and build their shoes using various materials including styrofoam, rope, cardboard, cotton balls,glue,colored paper, markers, tape etc. The final ""test"" would be to walk in the completed footwear.

The students are learning skills like drawing a model, following construction plans, thinking our of the box, figuring out the right questions to ask and completing an open-ended assignment successfully.

The results from the recent District Communications Survey clearly indicate that in the event of an Emergency, parents would like to receive Text Messages in addition to the phone and email alerts they already receive.

To facilitate this, we are requesting that you complete an information form for each child that attends school in the Dobbs Ferry School District. Each household can provide up to two cell phone numbers that will receive text messages.

If we do not hear from you, we will assume you DO NOT want to receive emergency text messages.

Your communications’ needs are important to us, and we are responding to parents’ requests for “just-in-time” information via text messaging.

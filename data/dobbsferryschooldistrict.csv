A million thanks to Kathy Weinborg and her volunteer team (Rita Kennedy, Denise Cunningham, Loretta Tularzko and even Dr Brady) who prepared almost 19,000 meals for Dobbs Ferry Students. And kudos to our delivery crew who got meals to families unable to pick up. Thank you to Julie Druker Fischer from the PTSA for helping coordinate this effort. Now that these meals are no longer available, SPRING's partnership with the Dobbs Ferry Food Pantry is more important than ever.

""I have had the privilege of coaching Tommy for the past four years. I say privilege because rarely do student-athletes accomplish as much as Tommy has these past four years. Tommy’s dedication and hard work became quite a legacy for him to leave behind. In the past two years, I don’t think he’s missed a single practice, either in-season or in the off-season. He was not afraid to put in the work to become the best football player he could be. He was a coach on the field because of his extensive knowledge of our offense. He could tell any offensive lineman their responsibilities on any given play, an invaluable asset to have on any team.""

Cabin Fever is affecting us all right now and it is important to find ways to relieve stress, and physical activity is a great outlet. With the nice weather upon us, and in keeping with our neighboring villages, we are happy to announce the re-opening of the Dobbs Ferry School District turf fields and tennis courts tomorrow, Thursday, May 21st.

The playgrounds at Springhurst Elementary School remain closed.

Per Governor Cuomo’s PAUSE executive order, this includes the following expectations:

- Users will maintain social distancing of at least six feet from each other
- Activities are non-contact
- Non-essential gatherings will not take place (this includes organized sports)
- The ongoing status of these facilities is dependent upon responsible use

Tennis Court Rules:

- To prevent long lines, please limit your playing time to one hour
- Singles only games are permitted
- Please wear a mask or face covering while waiting to use the courts
- No private lessons allowed

Congratulations to Gayathri Nair! She won first place in her poster competition at Upstate Junior Science and Humanities Symposium! This state level competition has been held annually in Albany but they figured out a virtual solution 😊 YAY!

Nair's research focused on developing a deeper understanding of Toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic infection. The parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, has been historically difficult to eradicate during infections due to its ability to defend itself against antibiotics. Nair was able to identify a possible genetic approach to disarming the parasite, thus making the illness more easily treatable.

This is the kind of research our world truly needs, these days! Great job, Gaya3!! ❤️❤️

High Touch High Tech is a fun and interactive push-in, hands-on science experience. The program uses discovery style learning and inquiry-based dialogue that dovetails with the students’ curriculum. Thanks to a grant from the Dobbs Ferry Schools Foundation, Springhurst 1st graders engaged in experiments investigating light and sound waves, enriching the Science 21 unit they were studying in class.

During the 1 ½ hour session, the students participated in approximately eight experiments that all have real-world applications. Students used a tuning fork and cup to simulate an artificial eardrum and a slinky to demonstrate how sound waves move. Working with a foot-long ruler, the program’s visiting scientist showed students how to produce noise using different types of vibrations, build a black light tunnel from a paper towel tube and construct rubber band harmonicas. Students loved this STEM enrichment program and in-school “field trip.”",0.0,"Dobbs Ferry School District added 53 new photos.

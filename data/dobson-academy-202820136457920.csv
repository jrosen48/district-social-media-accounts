After having a career in Sales and Finance, I was able to return to a dormant, but not forgotten, dream of teaching. This will be my second year teaching Language Arts to middle school students. I hold a Bachelor of Science Degree in Human Development from Warner Pacific College, in Portland Oregon, as well as a Master of Arts in Teaching Degree from George Fox University, located in Newberg, Oregon. Both of my children attended Dobson Academy, so I am excited about joining staff this year, as we all have fond memories of the school.

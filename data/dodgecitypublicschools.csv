What is SEL?
As we protect our mental health and cope with the unknown, it is essential to learn and practice healthy skills to manage everyday life. Dodge City Public Schools believes in teaching our students social-emotional skills that promote positive wellbeing. Last year, K-12 students learned about the Zones of Regulation, which gave them a common vocabulary to help identify emotions and healthy skills to regulate responses. Students learned self-efficacy and how to trust their abilities to perform and achieve their goals.
This year, our K-12 SEL focus is on self-regulation. Students will learn how to be proactive in their choices to achieve their goals.
Talk to your student about ways they can self-regulate, and what might be a self-regulation goal for their future?

Dodge City, KS – USD 443 BOE votes 6 to 1 for student start date on August 25. Teachers will report on August 17.

According to Dr. Dierksen, “It’s time to start school. We prefer to have face to face instruction, but we also have the option of Remote Live Learning. "" We want our parents to feel comfortable with their choices.""

Making this decision is a tremendous responsibility, but prolonging the start of school will not mitigate COVID -19. It will take our entire community working together and following protocols so that our schools can stay open for the school year. In our homes, we can practice how to wear face coverings, good hygiene, and limit outside travel.

Seventy-eight percent of USD 443 teachers responded to the district survey asking if teachers were able to conduct face-to-face instruction; ninety-five percent said yes. Those who responded no because of health concerns may have the option to teach online.

Basquiat grew famous during the 80s as an expressionist and hung out with famous people such as Andy Warhol. Although he became wildly rich quickly, he states that he could not even hail a cab in New York due to the color of his skin. Jean-Michel had an untimely passing at the age of 27 due to addiction.

God Bless Mr. Willie B. Brown, a true friend. Willie B. worked with me for many years and we were good friends. He stopped by my classroom often to talk and hang out. And eat! We'd sneak snacks. Everyone loved him, his attitude and friendliness were just contagious. One time he even found a drum set that had been discarded and brought it to me! I still use parts off that thing. He always thought of others. Mr. Willie B. would get excited and talk really fast & I'd have to say, ""Slow down! I can't understand you!"" :) Always greeted you with a smile and a kind word. That gets you far in the world and makes it a brighter place. Willie B. is a man that will be missed by the entire Middle Georgia Community, and especially the School System.

So many of you have reached out with more baby pics and we are so grateful. We want as many seniors as possible to be included. So, we are going to edit the senior babies video and put in the others we've received. This is the LAST CALL for baby pictures! If you'd like your senior to be included in the senior babies video, please email a baby pic and their future plans to drogers@dodge.k12.ga.us by this Wednesday, April 15 at 3:00 pm.

We've also had several parents ask about getting it on a cd. We're happy to do this as well.

While we are all practicing social distancing, this is a fun idea for little ones( & big ones)! How about a Bear Hunt? 🐻 The idea is for the community & neighborhoods to display teddy bears in their windows. Then, while families are out walking or riding in their vehicle, they go for a “bear hunt.” Once you or your neighborhood have bears on display, feel free to post a picture with a general vicinity included (no need for specific addresses). 😃😃Happy hunting and we hope that this will bring smiles to our community at this trying time! 😃😃

SOUTH DODGE will be a location for Bear 🐻 Hunting!! So if you are riding around “hunting,” please come check us out BUT there is no need to get out of your vehicle!!

**We are NOT encouraging social interaction through this group. We encourage everyone to STAY HOME, but if you are on a walk in your neighborhood or on a drive confined to your vehicle, this could be a fun & exciting activity. Please remain 6 ft distance from others and do not go onto others’ property without permission!!

Our maintenance and custodians are the best! From the very start they were cleaning water fountains, spraying disinfectant, wiping doors, and this is just to name a few! I hope each and every one of them know how much North Dodge Elementary staff appreciates them! AND our lunchroom ladies have been busy preparing meals to deliver to our students! We couldn't do our job without the dedication and support from these people! Thank you for going above and beyond for our staff and students!❤❤❤❤❤",2020-03-18 12:57:37,,

Eastman area closure at Cochran Highway will last 90 days

Progress on the $45 million Cochran Highway (State Route 87/US 23) Dodge County reconstruction requires a Log Cabin Road closure at its intersection with the main highway Monday, Feb. 24.

For 90 days, weather permitting, Everett Dykes Grassing will realign Log Cabin to meet the new widened design standards. During this period, drivers will use a short detour tracking along Log Cabin Road, Antioch Church Road and the State Route 87 SPUR.

Drivers will still be able to pass through the area on the main highway. This planned closure only affects access at the Log Cabin intersection.

Last year Christian LeCouris was a 5th grader at North Dodge Elementary. He spent his money that he won from the 4-H Georgia Fair to buy toys for needy children in our community. This year he is a 6th grader at DCMS. He contacted our Counselor Scarlett Mark Driggers and wanted to do the same this year. When him and his mother delivered the toys , we were amazed. He had purchased so many toys it took two trips to deliver them to the school. Tonight at 11:00 13WMAZ will air a story about this amazing story. Please tune in and see something good that's happening in Dodge County!",3.0,"Cindy Screws is with Sheila Krum Honeycutt and Scarlett Mark Driggers.

There is nothing I LOVE more than getting to spend time with teachers and students in classrooms! Literally.... NOTHING!!!
🥰🥰🥰

This week, I’ve been in Eastman, Georgia, working with the wonderful teachers of Dodge County! Because everyone attending were from different schools, the workshops were held at the district office, so I didn’t get to visit any classrooms..... and the holidays are my FAVORITE time to visit!

And while the board office WAS beautifully decked out for the holidays, NOTHING compares to the excitement and true holiday magic that you feel at this time of year in the classroom! It’s electric....and I miss it! ☃️🎄🌟🎁❄️

Today, I’m headed out for my last engagement of the year.... #TNReads19 Tennessee Reading Conference!

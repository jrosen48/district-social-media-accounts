Details: You will continue to get 5 breakfasts and 5 lunches throughout the week.—just on a different schedule. On Mondays you will be given 3 days worth of food and on Thursdays – 2 days worth of food.

Please Note: The times for distribution will be 11:00 AM – 1:00 PM Allowing our staff a little more time to assemble meals on Monday and Thursday.

We will still begin delivering meals this Wednesday – Delivery will also be on Thursday this week and then will follow the new schedule beginning next week.

When: Mondays and Thursdays 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM

Why: To limit the contact our Food Service workers have among themselves, as well as with parents and students.

Details: You will continue to get 5 breakfasts and 5 lunches throughout the week.—just on a different schedule. On Mondays you will be given 3 days worth of food and on Thursdays – 2 days worth of food.

Please Note: The times for distribution will be 11:00 AM – 1:00 PM Allowing our staff a little more time to assemble meals on Monday and Thursday.

We will still begin delivering meals this Wednesday – Delivery will also be on Thursday this week and then will follow the new schedule beginning next week.

This information will also be posted on our Website and sent home via School Messenger.

Thank you for your patience as we change procedures in an effort to follow NYS and Federal guidelines.",2020-03-23 13:23:28,,

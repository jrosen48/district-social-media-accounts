The district would like to address questions we have received in regards to the survey.
The district plans to have in-person schooling beginning August 24. The reason for the survey is to determine the number of households that have internet and computers or other devices. We believe the most effective learning should and needs to be at school, in a face to face setting. However, we also realize there may be some who are not comfortable sending their students to school. Therefore, we are exploring the possibility of implementing an online learning program for those students. The district will send out another survey with a couple direct questions in order to gather more information . Please be on the lookout for this survey and complete it as soon as you can. It will be posted no later than tomorrow and can be found on the district's Facebook page and website. If you are unable to access the survey online, please contact central office between 8:00 a.m. - 3:00 p.m. at 573-996-3667 x. 6 to complete the survey by phone. Thank you.",2020-07-22 12:16:56,,

It says students will have to repeat their current grade level next school year. This is someone’s idea of an April Fool’s joke. It is signed by Candice B Fureal (can this be for real). Please also know that no one from the Doniphan School District had anything to do with this letter/joke. It is been shared all over the state.

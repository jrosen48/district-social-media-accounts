In light of the recent surge of COVID-19 cases in Hidalgo County, Donna ISD has made the difficult decision to cancel its in-person graduation ceremonies scheduled for next week. As you may be aware, county leaders have been issuing daily reports of triple-digit numbers of positive cases over the past several days prompting concerns. While it is with heavy hearts that we make this decision, we felt it was a necessary action to take to ensure the safety and security of our DISD students, staff, and community.

Previously, we had offered alternative dates in July and August as options, however, as we closely monitor the rising trends of the virus, the situation does not look as if it is getting any better. Therefore, the district reached the decision to cancel commencement in the best interest of our DISD community.

Donna High School is proud to announce that the following four students: Brayan Cisneros, Rigoberto Jimenez, Chloe Villarreal, and Savannah Villarreal just passed the (CET) national exam that licenses them as certified EKG Technicians!

The need for qualified EKG technicians continues to rise as the overall health concerns among people of all ages in America grows (and with that, the prevalence of heart-related conditions). Earning their EKG certification will help our students launch a successful and meaningful healthcare career that can help make a difference in countless lives. The future is certainly bright for our students.

The Career Technical Education (CTE) Department is proud to announce that DNHS student, Michael Leon, has earned his Class A (truck driving) Commercial Driver's License (CDL).

Now, more than ever, we see the importance of truck drivers as they play a critical part in delivering essential goods throughout the country. The CTE Department and the Donna ISD community would like to wish Michael Leon the best of luck in his future career endeavours.

A big thank you goes out to Mr. Aldo Ortiz, RGV CDL owner, and Mr. Lupe Quintero, RGV CDL instructor, for partnering up with Donna ISD and providing these great career opportunities for our students.

The Career Technical Education (CTE) Department is proud to announce that DHS student Daniel Vargas Jr, has become the first in Donna ISD history to earn his Class A (truck driving) Commercial Driver's License (CDL). Daniel previously earned his Class B (bus driving) CDL during the first semester of this school year. The demand for truck drivers is higher than ever, and having earned both the Class A and Class B CDL licenses, will definitely make Daniel more marketable in a career that opens up an abundance of new opportunities for him. CTE and the Donna ISD community are proud of Daniel Vargas Jr. and wish him well in his future career endeavours.

A big thank you goes out to Mr. Aldo Ortiz, RGV CDL owner, and Mr. Lupe Quinter, RGV CDL instructor, for partnering up with Donna ISD and providing these great career opportunities for our students.",6.0,"DISD Donna High School

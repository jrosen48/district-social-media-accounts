Hello from Dorchester Public School!

To ease the financial burden on families caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, basic school supplies will be purchased by Dorchester Public School this year. Therefore, this year we will not have a typical school supply list. Please refer to our website at dorchesterschool.org and click on the 2020-21 Supply List for the few items that will still need to be provided by parents.

At this time we are not requiring masks, but recommending them. The district has purchased enough premium adjustable, reusable, washable masks for each student to have 2 each. We are scheduled to get more masks from the state, so do not feel like you need to purchase masks as we will provide them. Masks worn at school must follow the dress code, and should be two-layered. Just a reminder that handkerchiefs are not appropriate face coverings.

Again more information will come out the week of August 3rd regarding reopening plans!

Thank you!

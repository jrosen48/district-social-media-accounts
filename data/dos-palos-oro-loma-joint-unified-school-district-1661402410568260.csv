You may see large shade structures going up at Bryant Middle School and Dos Palos Elementary (pictures). These shade structures, which will provide coverage to students during inclement weather, are also equipped with solar panels. These shade structures / solar panels will save the district approximately $200,000+ per year in energy costs.

Although this project has been in the making for nearly 3 years, current School Board Members have been steadfast in their pursuit of going solar and being effective and efficient with district monies.

Along all districts in California, the Dos Palos Oro Loma Joint Unified School District transitions to distance learning for the remainder of the school year. To best support our families, we must ask for information so that we can best address the educational needs of your child. Beginning, Monday, April 6, teachers and school staff will call parents regarding your child's access to computers and internet at home. If you have any questions, please contact your child's school. Our educators are working hard to provide for distance learning opportunities for every student we serve.

Also, as a reminder there will be no meal service during the Spring Break (April 10-17). Meal service will resume beginning, Monday, April 20.

Sincerely,
Justin Miller, Ed.D
Superintendent of Schools

The district would like to thank you all for your patience and flexibility during this unprecedented time in our country and our community. The next few weeks and maybe months, will not be easy. However, we are stronger together. We will get through the COVID-19 pandemic and be an even stronger school community after it passes.

In the meantime, we want to encourage all students to “shelter in place” as recommended by Governor Gavin Newsom. This pandemic will pass, but we must take proper precautions and only engage in “necessary” activities during school closure.

The district has provided a list of online educational and enrichment activities. Please access these programs and continue your educational journey. Although you are not physically at school, your education must continue.

Stay safe and take care of your family. We will see you soon!

Good Morning Marks Families,

Our school site experienced an unfortunate situation this morning. A student brought a beebee gun in their backpack to school today. It was immediately reported to administration by other students and investigated. The beebee gun was confiscated and the Dos Palos Police Department was contacted. Officer Chavez of the Dos Palos Police Department and School Resource Officer for our district immediately responded. The situation was handled by administration and law enforcement and everyone is safe at school.

At this time there is no other information we can share. I want to thank our students and staff for their response to this unfortunate situation. The safety of students and staff are our number one priority.

Attendance Matters!!!

Our district will have a BIG focus on student attendance this school year. We know that if a student is not in school, they cannot learn. Our staff understands there are medical appointments and family emergencies, but we need our students in school everyday possible.

Looking forward to an outstanding 2019-20 school year!

The Marks Elementary Lead Custodian went into a smoke filled classroom caused by an electrical fire from the air conditioning unit on Monday. Battling the smoke, the Lead Custodian went into the classroom and turned off the electrical breaker. By cutting the electricity to the unit, the fire was unable to spread. If it was not for this courageous employee, staff and students could have been injured and classrooms could have burned down. The district is fortunate to have employees like the Lead Custodian at Marks Elementary!

The fire alarm sounded and students were immediately evacuated to their assigned locations for safety precautions. Shortly after the fire alarm sounded, smoke was visibly coming from the A/C unit. A district staff member responded and turned off the A/C unit. The fire went out shortly after the unit was turned off. Then when the Merced County Fire Department gave the all clear, students were returned to class at approximately 2:08 p.m. Over the next few days the district will replace the A/C unit that services room 28.

The safety of staff and students is the highest priority of the district. We want to thank district employees and the Merced County Fire for their quick response.

These construction projects focused mainly on the replacing of asphalt and bathrooms. The district has been conservative with its finances which afforded the opportunity to complete these projects to increase the safety of staff and students. Also, the parking lot at Dos Palos High School should be done by the end of the month ... fingers crossed!

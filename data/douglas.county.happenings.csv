The detour route will be as follows:

Vehicles on Liberty Road headed north to points north of I-20, will be directed to take I-20 east to Post Road, turn left on Post Road, cross over the bridge there and take I-20 west back to the Liberty Road/Mirror Lake Blvd interchange. They can then exit at the westbound ramp at that interchange and turn right to continue northbound on Mirror Lake Blvd.

Similarly, vehicles traveling southbound on Liberty Road to areas south of I-20 will be directed to take I-20 west to SR 61, take the westbound exit ramp, turn left on SR 61 and cross over the bridge at that location, then take I-20 east back to Liberty Road and exit at the Liberty Road interchange then turn right to proceed southbound on Liberty Road.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3866431420065878&id=121610517881339,,0.0,"LIBERTY ROAD BRIDGE CLOSURE

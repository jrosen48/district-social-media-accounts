On Tuesday, Gov. Whitmer announced the ""Return to School Road Map."" Our team is currently updating our plans and will be sharing and seeking feedback from all of you throughout the month of July. Thank you for all of your support during this time of uncertainty and know that we want nothing more than to see each of our students' smiling faces in the fall!

In the meantime, check your Class Dojo because a more detailed letter was just sent out. We are doing our very best to openly communicate and do what is best for our students. Our work will continue in the coming weeks as we utilize the Roadmap.

Have a great 4th of July!

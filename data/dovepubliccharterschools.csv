Dove Schools urge everyone to follow CDC recommendations of putting distance between yourself and others to slow the spread of COVID-19].

It’s Thankful Tuesday! Today, Dove Schools express gratitude for Kimray Inc., a company that does a lot of good in Oklahoma and around the world. A few weeks ago, we presented Kimray with the 2020 Community Impact Award for their support to Dove Schools during the last few years. Their support has included funding for Dove Schools’ character education initiatives. Their employees also collaborated with and provided funding for our OKC High-School solar car project team. #ThankfulTuesday #WhatAreYouThankfulFor?",2020-03-24 14:21:28,,

Ms. Kaysee (ELA) and Mr. Harry (Geography) designed a cross-subject collaborative project for our seventh graders! The project teaches the students about the geographical facts and cultures of countries in the Eastern hemisphere by challenging the students to use skills they have developed in ELA class such as research, analytical close reading, and summary writing. For the project, the students are working in groups to complete an internet scavenger hunt that requires them to research, read articles, and learn about the culture of their assigned country. Today, students began decorating posters in preparation to present information about their assigned country. Presentations will start on Wednesday.

As a character development extension of the project, students will learn compassion and generosity by finding out about specific crises and needs each country has recently experienced. The students will then organize and participate in a fundraiser to raise funds for international aid.

Stay tuned to follow the progress of this project and fund-raiser.",0.0,"Shout-out to our Dove Middle School OKC students who engage in higher-level learning AND develop character! #LivingThatDoveLife #DisciplinedOrganizedVigorousEducation #CharacterMatters

Hello Dove Alumni, on behalf of the association College Adviser Karen Medina will be organizing the 2019 University Visits for ALL alumni enrolled in an accredited 2-year or 4-year college. If you have already met with the adviser, this does not apply to you. Instead of forming big message groups, like we have done in the past, we would like to take a different approach and start by having polls.
• There will be polls in which the Universities will be listed, as well as 2 date options. We will pick the dates and time by majority rule.
• Once we have established a date there will be another poll option with different times.
• Lastly, instead of conducting big message groups on Facebook the participating students will be added to Karen Medina’s phone group message.

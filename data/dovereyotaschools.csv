Please consider taking time to respond to the parent survey below in the message from the Minnesota Department of Education. School districts across the state have been directed to design multiple plans for opening school this fall. The survey is available in English, Hmong, Somali, and Spanish.

With your feedback in mind, MDE will be providing guidance to all school districts on how to best plan ahead with three possible scenarios:

1. Return all students to school buildings following the most current CDC and MDH guidelines.

2. Return students to school buildings, implementing a hybrid model following the most current CDC and MDH guidelines.

3. No students return to school buildings. Implement a distance learning model.

This is a challenging time for all of us. As we begin the process for designing possible schedules, our Dover-Eyota planning team will also invite you to provide us with your feedback.

Staff members made colorful banners for the seniors, which shared positive messages: ‚ÄúWe Love You!‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe are Proud of You!‚Äù Danielle and Diane even painted the windows of the building with more positive messages, including: ‚ÄúWe miss you and your smiles!‚Äù Staff members spread out on the sidewalk, and cheered for the seniors as they stopped by. (We tried to stand six feet apart, and used lots of hand sanitizer!)

Thank you to our staff members, and Paul and Joe from Jostens, for making this a memorable day for our senior students, and to Carrie Frank, for creating this great video.",2020-03-27 10:31:34,https://video-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/91202582_2433876943569833_4493974206228201472_n.mp4?_nc_cat=100&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=nrQq9kFBmjkAX_3dC5w&_nc_ht=video-atl3-1.xx&oh=7320ef166896052cc6108859964b6740&oe=5F5D16DF,

‚ÄúI participated in a webinar with MREA on Sunday evening and they clarified the question about child care.

Child care will be free to health care and emergency provider families. There is a concern about our capacity to serve a large number of children in grades K-Grade 5. We will need to assign personnel such as paras, bus drivers, food service workers to fill in as our child care staff during this emergency time.

I appreciate your patience as we plan the educational needs of our students. We have many other considerations to plan for including how we can support our staff through this process. I will be continuing to monitor advisories from the state. Look for a resource tab on the website very soon.‚Äù

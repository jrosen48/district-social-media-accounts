I'm very flattered by the many invitations to speak a various virtual graduations this year, and very sorry to say I'm unable to accomodate everyone. I did however, want to say something generally to all those men and women graduating from a trade school, and, to those high school graduates, about to enter one. If you know someone in either category, (and even if you don't) I'd be grateful if you'd share this.

Thanks,

You will need:
* a piece of paper
* pens, pencils, crayons, markers
* circle shapes to trace (any jar lids, coffee can lids, rolls of duct tape, masking tape, paper cups, or other circle shapes will work)

Directions:
1. Trace circle shapes with a pen or marker. You can trace the same circle shape over and over for your project or trace different size circles. To add interest, overlap circles. You can make as many or as few as you’d like in this circle project.

2. Now it’s time to color with crayons, markers, colored pencils, or paint. You can use as many or as few colors as you like, create patterns, stay in circles, or color outside of them. There’s no right or wrong way to color your circle art! Just have fun!",0.0,"Feeling artistic? Check out the opportunity the Dover Public Library is offering!

The Dover Teen Center is one of the programs in our Community Outreach Bureau. The Teen Center provides a variety of activities and support to Dover youth in grades 6 thru 12. They are more than just an after school, drop-in spot. The TC is a place where participants can get involved in a number of artistic, educational, adventure and athletic activities that embrace our community values and expectations.

This week staff and students were surprised with a visit from a TC alum and 2018 Dover High School and Career Technical Center, Dover NH graduate, US Army National Guardsman Michael McCall. He returned home from basic training and made sure the TC was one of his first places to visit when he got home.

Pictured here is Steve Pappajohn, the Director of the Dover Teen Center with Michael. Steve remembers Michael as “a Teen Center leader who always supported the staff and helped his peers without asking for anything in return.” We salute his service, and are thrilled to have him back.",0.0,"Dover NH Police

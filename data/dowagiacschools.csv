We are still getting mixed messages from the state regarding if schools are required to move spring break. Due to the confusion, we have made the decision to declare that spring break will stay as our calendar shows. Therefore, DUS spring break will begin Friday, April 3 and last until Sunday, April 12. We are planning and hoping that students can return to school on Monday, April 13.

If the Governor or Legislators were to mandate that schools must change spring break or face significant consequences, we will cross that bridge at that time.

We wish you good health and safety in these uncertain times.

On Tuesday, May 8th, Dowagiac Union Schools will have our non-homestead millage renewal on the ballot for a vote. This renewal only affects second homes and businesses and accounts for approximately 5 million dollars (23%) of our annual budget. This is not a new tax.

In 1994 when the Michigan Legislature passed Proposal A and changed how public schools were funded, a non-homestead millage was part of the proposal. Each school district was required to levy 18 mills from Non-Homesteads to receive full funding (again this affects second homes and businesses not primary residences). This renewal is a very large part of the Dowagiac Union Schools’ budget and necessary for the proper operation of the school district.

Voters have approved the 18 mill non-homestead renewal since its inception in 1994. The last vote was in 2014 and is up again for renewal. Please remember to vote on Tuesday, May 8th.

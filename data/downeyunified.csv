Please note that the time slot for our meal distributions will be from 9am-11am and the Downey High and Gauldin Elementary campuses will NOT be open for meal pick up.

As our top priority is the safety of our students, staff and families, we look forward to serving our families at our six other distribution locations for the remainder of the week.

The theme for this year’s Rose Parade is “Hope” and Downey will be building and decorating a float titled “On The Wings Of Hope.” Celebrating the Japanese tradition of folding 1,000 origami cranes to share a healing wish and hope for a brighter tomorrow, the Downey Rose Float Association has been holding crane-making events with the ultimate goal to fold 10,000 origami cranes.

We want to thank the Downey Rose Float Association for allowing Downey Unified to be a part of such a special venture. We also want to thank them for the 300 exclusive origami cranes that were made with love in memory of our own Sarah Jamison who lost her battle with cancer over the summer.

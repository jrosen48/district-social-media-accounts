GirlPlex is focused on closing the gender gap in computer science and aims to support young females in their pursuit of computer science fields in in high school.

It started as one, in-person class last year at the Downingtown Library with approximately 25 middle school girls. It has grown to a series of online coding camps, serving over 200 elementary and middle school students from 11 different states. They have taught HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby and Python. The team even held a “students in STEM” college application panel to support rising female seniors interested in a STEM major with their college applications.

Ms. Penmetsa and Ms. Dandu plan to continue their lessons throughout the year and expand their organization to include teaching JAVA and adding Python lessons for high school students.

The 2020 DASD Art Gallery At Trestle",11.0,"Annually, DASD's Visual Arts teachers have the opportunity to honor two students by presenting their work in the DASD Art Gallery at Trestle Place. The selected works are digitally reproduced, framed, and placed in the James E. Watson Staff room for a two years cycle, personalizing our space with the talent of our student artists. This work truly represents the best of our district, and we would like to thank these students for contributing their talents to our space, and congratulate them for this unique honor.

We are committed to keeping our school community safe and providing transparent and timely communication. We will be sending parents and staff an email with additional updates by the end of day today.

Halloween Safety

Please Trick-or-treat only between the hours of 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm Thursday evening, October 31, 2019, and visit only those homes with an outdoor light on.

Please be reminded of these safety tips:

· Parents should accompany children on their rounds. If a parent isn’t available, someone the parents trust should go with the children.

· Children should walk on the sidewalk, not in the road, when possible. They should walk facing oncoming traffic, and cross streets only at crosswalks, not between cars.

· Children should avoid wearing masks that obstruct their vision.

· Costumes should be flame retardant and fit properly.

· Children should wear reflective clothing or patches on their costumes.

· Make sure your flash light has fresh batteries in it and use it at all times while walking.

· Parents should check treats before they are eaten.

· Parents should report any suspicious activity to local police.

Vision Screening Program The Lions Clubs in New York State have launched a special program to screen children for vision problems that can lead to Amblyopia, commonly referred to as ‚Äúlazy eye.‚Äù The program focuses on screening children between the ages of 6 months and 6 years. The trained volunteers from your local Lions Club will screen the children‚Äôs eyes with either a Welch Allyn vision screener or a Plusoptix screener.

Our 8th graders have been given an exciting opportunity to participate in a program called ‚ÄúA Single Bite‚Äù. The goal of this program is to give exposure and education of *real food* to the students so they can be aware of making healthier nutritional choices throughout their life. This 4 week program (1 day a week) will introduce the students to new foods, locally grown foods, healthy food choices, appropriate social dining, and introduction to area hospitality professionals. Mr. Sims Foster (seen in the photos) founded this project along with his wife. They have been offering this opportunity to 8th graders in Livingston Manor. They expanded this year and reached out to offer the opportunity to Downsville.

Today was an introductory class where they sampled 4 plates. All they had to do was ‚Äútake a bite‚Äù and articulate what they liked or didn‚Äôt like about it.

The students participated and engaged well. Talked about flavor, textures, and preferences. Next week they get to go on a trip to Northern Farmhouse Pasta.

Strep throat is caused by bacteria, and is passed to one another through mouth and nose secretions. It usually starts with a very sore throat and a fever. Taking antibiotics usually works well. Without medicine, strep can go on to more serious problems, such as rheumatic fever, scarlet fever and kidneys problems. Strep may also cause a skin infection called impetigo, which looks like yellow-crusted sores around the nose and mouth.

If you are unsure, please take your child to the doctor to be tested to be safe! Treatment typically involves antibiotics and a few days out of school.

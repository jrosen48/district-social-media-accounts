""Yesterday, I scheduled a Zoom meeting with my class and I had 6 of my 17 who attended. They were bouncing all around and seemed so excited to see me and each other.

I read a book to them, asked them how they were doing, and talked to them about their Canvas work. I had 2 that didn’t want to use the video on the camera, so I didn’t force it. They could still see us and listen. I shared my screen with them demonstrating how to do different things and access the videos on Canvas that appear restricted.

Today, I received an email from one of my students asking for another zoom meeting.""

Additional resources will be made easily accessible to AP students and teachers through mobile phones and other devices. These include free online AP lessons and review sessions from some of the top AP teachers in the country.

The AP program is finalizing streamlined AP exam options that would allow students to test at home, depending on the situation in May. We’re working to give every AP student the opportunity to claim the credit they’ve earned. The AP Program will communicate the details of these additional solutions to educators and students by March 20.

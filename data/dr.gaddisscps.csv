Lyndi and the rest of our IT Department are hard at work formatting and imaging our 1,500 BRAND NEW H.P. laptops for students in grades 6-12!!!

3rd-5th grade students will be issued our existing school laptops when the year begins, and in October they will be replaced with brand new Chromebooks (they are on back order right now). Pre-k through 2nd grade will be issued Chrome Tablets in October (also on back order).

Thanks to grant funds received from the CARES Act ($1,347,240), our generous County Commissioners ($402,938), and the Governor's Emergency Education Relief Fund ($43,271), SCPS has a device for every student for the 2020-2021 school year! #SmallButMighty #TeamSCPS",7.0,"Great news!

We had an overwhelming amount of support the last few days - so much, that we had to turn people away! With today's additional restrictions placed on gatherings of 10 or more people in Maryland, we sadly cannot accept more volunteers for Friday, March 20. We will be reaching out to staff to notify them if they are needed, and when. Thank you all so very much!

Today was some morning work and then off to the ESMEC meeting in Easton. We met with the Special Assistant to the Secretary of Rural Education from the United States Department of Education. Our conversation was centered around grant opportunities to enhance programs in rural America. It was an interesting meeting and hopefully one that would benefit Somerset County.￼

Getting closer to winter break so hoping everyone stays focused on what they need to do the next six school days so they can enjoy the two week break! Short report tonight.

Everybody have a great night!

What a mentally draining day! There are those days where we sit and we plan and we talk and it truly taxes your brain! The desire to make change in a positive way has to be matched with the same enthusiasm and passion to make it happen. Just looking at the future and what the it holds for our students, our staff and our community.

The ability to adapt, adjust and move forward is essential no matter what field of study, profession or job you hold.￼ Equally important is the ability to withstand criticism, take the positive from negative situations and take the opportunity to grow every single day.

Education has become like so many other fields, in that everything is rushed, everyone is racing to get out of school, trying to figure out what’s next and plan for what we think lies ahead. In doing so are we missing out on an opportunity to not only impact, but enjoy the day we were given?

I will will appeal this day to the State Board of Education and ask that they excuse students for the day. It is ultimately up to them and I will keep everyone informed as I go through the process.￼￼

I want to thank everyone for their patience as we deal with this matter. At some level each of us is shaken by what occurred today. There have been meetings today and meetings planned to discuss a variety of events and topics in terms of student safety. I ask your patience as we move forward.

There have been a lot of questions about what happened and what will happen. Federal law limits what we can say but I want to assure our students, staff and community that student safety is of the upmost importance and I will not tolerate this type of behavior in our school system. We will follow our policy and procedures and handle this to the fullest extent possible. I know that is vague but that is all I can say at this point as this is an ongoing investigation.

We will have supports, as needed, in place for school Monday morning! As this is discussed please stress the importance of “if you see something, say something”. Thank you!

It was a great meeting with a lot of constructive conversation on a variety of topics. We also had a presentation by the United Way as we begin our yearly campaign to support an organization that does an incredible amount to support our community.

After that staff worked on the yearly master plan that is now called The ESSA Consolidated Plan. It is an incredible amount of work looking at data and analyzing the data to establish goals to be met throughout the school year and beyond.

That took the whole day! Hope everyone had a great day and we will see everyone tomorrow.

Today also included a trip to our County Commissioners for some year end transfers between categories to close the books on FY 19.

Tonight‘s meeting was a fairly short meeting as we only had one academic report. It covered the entire summer program. Few people know that we run a summer school, migrant program and a high school summer program. It is incredible the number of students we reach in the summertime and we also offer full services as if we were in session.

Great job tonight by staff as they did a great job with their presentation.

Hope everyone had a great day and pleasant evening. See you tomorrow!

I just look at it as being fortunate that we were not directly impacted by a storm that has caused so much damage and taken human life and it’s not even done yet!

Woo-hoo! We celebrated the end of nine(!) successful weeks of Camp Dexter today with a visit from the Kona Ice snow cone truck! Camp Dexter looked a lot different this year but it was still a lot of fun! Mrs. Paula planned lots of fabulous themes and craft ideas and we enjoyed some of the traditional camp activities, including tie-dye, magic milk, slime day and visits by the birds and reptiles from the Leslie Science Center. Thank you to the 48 families who entrusted us with their children and great job to the campers who continually washed their hands, wore their masks indoors and remained healthy all summer. Thank you to our adult staff, including: Paula, Mandi, Beth, Dawn, Mr. B, Theresa and Michelle for staying safe and healthy so these kids could have a summer camp experience. We'll share more camp photos with you on Monday. For more info on Camp Dexter, call Dexter Community Ed at 424-4180 or email keithj@dexterschools.org",0.0,"Dexter Community Education

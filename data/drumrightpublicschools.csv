I know there is little or no chance that Drumright coaches, players or their fans will see this but I thought it was worth saying and sharing! Setting up for the radio broadcast last night Drumright came out to warm up with only 12 kids in uniform! I was speaking with Jason Reed and Heath in the press box and almost at the exact same time we all said we have been there just a few seasons ago. I watched these 12 young men and their coaches go through their Friday night routine the game got out of hand score wise early these young men could have quit, could have started trying to hurt our players but they didn’t! These young men fought hard and showed class till the end as did their coaches and fans! Following the game not only did Drumright players and coaches come back by for a second handshake coach Hennissey invited them to join the post game spirit ring once again showing the utmost class they joined hands and participated with the Huskies team and fans!!! Great sportmanship and class all around Drumright!!!",6.0,"Kevin Anthony

Today at approximately 1:15p, we placed our campus on lockdown out of an abundance of caution.

One of our students notified the high school principal about a possible threat being made toward them through a fake social media account.
The Drumright Police Department is working with several law enforcement agencies to identify the person who used the fake account to make the threat.

We will be conducting a delayed release. Students will be escorted by law enforcement to their release point: parent/guardian car or their own car.
No students will be allowed to walk home. Parents will be called to pick up any students who walk, to come pick up their child.

Drumright Schools will continue to work with law enforcement and support the prosecution of anyone involved in making threats towards our students, staff or school. We will keep you posted as new information is provided to us.

We take your children’s safety seriously and appreciate your support.
Sincerely,

Ashley Davis, Ed.D.

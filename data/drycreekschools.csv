A: Connections is a year-long distance program blending virtual and independent learning from home. This is a separate program and not tied to a school site. Students will have an online cohort of students in a virtual classroom setting with their own teacher.

Students enrolled in our traditional school program may be subject to pivoting between distance learning and different forms of in-person instruction at their school site based on public health orders throughout the school year.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2872445582864554&id=709075829201551,"DCJESD-CA.SCHOOLLOOP.COM

We’re changing things up a bit for the last several days of school. Instead of posting daily challenges- I have made ONE challenge worth 5 POINTS!! All you need is a computer/chrome book/tablet to access the website: soundation.com

Once your creation is finished, publish it to your profile feed & send me the link! #drydenbandsandmusic #soundationchallenge #proudcardinal",2020-06-03 14:24:03,https://video-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/83312582_661679764388558_758433538767847424_n.mp4?_nc_cat=100&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=cUPknSlDE1cAX87lqHX&_nc_ht=video-atl3-1.xx&oh=dc5af0d5a9c5903814ae556144a6a68c&oe=5F5E1E44,

Bollywood Music Video

World Music Wednesday Challenge: Take some time today & research a little bit about movies created in Bollywood. Find one that seems interesting to you, and choose a video clip of a song from the movie. Why did this movie/song interest you?

Do you know which city makes the MOST movies in the world? For most of us living in the United States, we would automatically think of Hollywood, California, but that’s not the right answer. Mumbai, India- also known as Bollywood- produces about 1,000 movies per year. That’s 400 more than what Hollywood averages! Music takes a HUGE role in Bollywood productions. In fact, most of their movies would seem like musicals to us. Take a listen to the video below to get a taste of what this music typically sounds like! #proudcardinal #worldmusicwednesday

So far, we’ve learned a lot about how the turntable evolved into an instrument all its own, but how did we get to the equipment most DJ’s and Music Producers use now? Take a look at the video below to learn about how Delia Derbyshire helped pave the way for music and sound effects to be created in the digital world we live in today! #turntabletuesday #proudcardinal

World Music Wednesday: Find items you have around your house to make your own ankle bells. Then send me a video of you playing them!

Klezmer is a Jewish style of music that features the clarinet. It is not played in the way that you might be used to hearing it, however. Instead, they move their fingers and mouth in a way that BENDS the pitch. This technique allows them to show emotion in their music in a unique way. Take a few minutes to watch this mini-episode from the Youtube Channel, “Lah, Lah” to learn more about Klezmer, and how to make ankle bells too!

How to Do the 6-Step | Kids Hip-Hop Moves

Dryden Bands and Music
May 19 at 9:56 AM ·

Turntable Tuesday Challenge: Watch “How to Do the 6 Step”, and send me a video of you trying out your new skills!

At this point, we know how DJ’s created beats with their turntables, those without the special equipment utilized beatboxing, AND how rappers brought their stories to life on top of it all. But we haven’t talked about how others created a unique style of dance to bring the hip hop experience to a entirely new level. Just like other styles of music have specific dance moves, hip hop has breakdancing! Take a look at the video below to learn how to do one of these moves yourself!

Listening to nature's music

Dryden Bands and Music
May 18 at 3:24 PM ·

Motivational Monday Challenge: The best music doesn’t always come from people playing instruments or singing powerful lyrics. Many people find that listening to sounds that are created naturally in their favorite environment to be soothing, and gives their mind an opportunity to take a break. Send me a short video clip of your favorite “natural” music. What about it is relaxing to you?

“In surrounding yourself with the natural environment — by going for walk in the forest, paddle-boarding on a lake, or sitting and reading a book in the heart of the woods — you are allowing your body to breathe and slow down. You’re letting your mind relax, while your ears focus on the sounds around you.”
Take some time to read the article below by yourself, or with your family. There are some great ideas to find music everywhere you go!🖤❤️🖤❤️ #motivationalmonday #proudcardinal

Go-Go Beats & Variations: Drum Lesson | Stanton Moore

Dryden Bands and Music
May 15 at 1:22 PM ·

Funky Friday Challenge: Find some items around your house that you could use to create a cool beat. You might choose some pots in the kitchen, boxes in the storage room, or anything else your parents are okay with you making into some drums for a quick video! Send me your creations!

Just like Funk was inspired by a variety of different styles of music, it also served as the inspiration for music that came after it! Native to Washington D.C., Go-Go music’s main purpose was to keep people on the dance floor while other musicians got ready for the next song in the set. In other words, it’s the ULTIMATE dance music! What I like most about this style is that its purpose is very similar to how Hip Hop got started (take a look at our #turntabletuesday posts for more info), but uses live instruments instead of the turntable. Pretty cool! Take a look at this short drum set lesson, where you can see how each element gets layered on top of each other to create that unique dance beat!

Funky Friday Challenge: Find some items around your house that you could use to create a cool beat. You might choose some pots in the kitchen, boxes in the storage room, or anything else your parents are okay with you making into some drums for a quick video! Send me your creations!

Native to Washington D.C., Go-Go music’s main purpose was to keep people on the dance floor while other musicians got ready for the next song in the set. In other words, it’s the ULTIMATE dance music!

Alright- story time! In the fall, I discovered that the High School Band students had never seen the movie “Drumline”. (I know, I couldn’t believe it either!) So of course, the first class period we could afford to have a movie day, that’s what we watched! It did not take Jacob Livingston more than 24 hours to learn the dance, and give a surprise performance for all of us at the start of class. 😂😂 So many good memories with this guy!! I’m definitely going to miss him for many years to come! 🖤❤️🖤❤️ #proudcardinal #classof2020",0.0,"Jacob Livingston is definitely a student I will never forget! 😂🖤❤️🖤❤️ -Mrs. Klann

History of Hip Hop in the Bronx - Arts in the City

Dryden Bands and Music
May 5 at 3:39 PM ·

Turntable Tuesday Challenge: Hip Hop Music got its start by people reusing old music that they already had, and making it into something completely new. In music, we call this “improvising”. Your challenge today is to make an instrument out of things you have around the house! Don’t worry about making it look pretty- as long as it makes sound when you are done, it will work! 😁 Send me a short video clip of you explaining what you made and how it works!

**Siblings and family members working together are encouraged for this one- you each will earn 1 point for your entry!

Here’s a short video explaining how people in New York City got this musical genre started. It should give you a better understanding of what they did!

“I don't know how to fully express what music means to me. Music is an incredible blessing to everyone and everything. The thing that strikes me the most about music is how it's a universal language. Music can be heard worldwide without translation, and that's part of the magic of it. It's also crazy to me that while everyone can listen to music, no matter what language you speak or the beliefs you cherish, the way an individual interprets it can be vastly different. Composers may have a story or something behind a specific song, but the magic of music allows other people to listen to it and create their own story. Music is unique, original. It helps people laugh, cry, vent, and much more. That is why music is so very special to me.” Thank you Jacob Livingston! ❤️🖤❤️🖤#motivationalmonday #proudcardinal",0.0,"Dryden Bands and Music

Motivational Monday Challenge: What does music mean to you? Are you drawn to create and perform with an instrument/your voice, or are you more of a listener? Send me a picture- a selfie, or something else that represents your love for music!

“I have to sing, I have to play. The music, it’s not just in me, it is me. When life gets me down, I play my guitar.” -Miguel from Disney’s Coco

Miguel’s family has a challenging history with music. It goes back many generations, and everyone has vowed to keep music out of their lives forever; but as much as he tries, Miguel just CAN’T stay away. I can definitely relate to how he feels, and it is a big reason why I became music teacher! Take some time today, or whenever you can, to watch this amazing story- you will definitely not regret it! (It is available to stream on Disney+ 😁) #motivationalmonday #proudcardinal",0.0,"Dryden Bands and Music

For this #funkyfriday , I thought we might make a part 2 of our positivity posts! Things are (slowly) starting to become less scary in the world, and I want to see what you are doing to keep a smile on your face. 😁🤪😊 So here’s your challenge: Send me a video clip of something fun that you have been doing! (It DOES NOT have to be music related, but I hope you are finding plenty of musical things that make you smile! 😁)

One thing that makes me smile is playing my clarinet, and I am incredibly thankful that staying home has given me more time to do it for fun! I hope you enjoy “You’ve Got A Friend In Me” from Oliver & I! ❤️🖤❤️🖤 #proudcardinal",0.0,"Mrs. Klann and Oliver are at it again!

Things are (slowly) starting to become less scary in the world, and I want to see what you are doing to keep a smile on your face. 😁🤪😊 So here’s your challenge: Send me a video clip of something fun that you have been doing! (It DOES NOT have to be music related, but I hope you are finding plenty of musical things that make you smile! 😁)

One thing that makes me smile is playing my clarinet, and I am incredibly thankful that staying home has given me more time to do it for fun! I hope you enjoy “You’ve Got A Friend In Me” from Oliver & I! ❤️🖤❤️🖤 #proudcardinal",2020-05-01 10:40:58,https://video-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/95936501_236528614262334_5149380748104433664_n.mp4?_nc_cat=109&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=7mCYnPRmsfkAX8ea6Ll&_nc_ht=video-atl3-1.xx&oh=e93e1488d237242a6616bd42a057c93c&oe=5F5E1E39,

April 29 at 11:15 AM ·

World Music Wednesday Challenge: Search “Mariachi Music” on your favorite music streaming app- Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, YouTube, etc. Listen to a few songs and choose a favorite. (If you really don’t like this type of music, choose the song you dislike the least.) Send me a link/name & artist for your song, and answer the following questions: What about this song makes you like it more than the rest that you listened to? Why do you think this music is popular?

WHAT IS MARIACHI MUSIC AND WHERE DOES IT COME FROM?? The simple answer is that it is a style of music from Mexico. These groups of musicians can vary in size, but are typically 3-20 people playing violins, trumpets, guitars, vihuela (a special Mexican guitar), and guitarron (a special Mexican bass guitar). Take a look at this video to learn more about this style of music, and hear the KAIA quartet perform one! #worldmusicwednesday #proudcardinal

Turntable Tuesday Challenge: What is your favorite Hip Hop song? Why do you like it? (send a youtube link of the song, so others can check it out too!)

Did you know that Hip Hop was created by a Jamaican DJ named Kool Herc? It happened during a NYC Summer Block Party in 1973 that Herc (known as Clive Campbell at this time) and his sister organized to raise money to purchase necessary supplies for school. He had the idea to have two copies of the same album on his double turntable so he could extend his favorite instrumental (or non-singing) section of a popular song. What was originally planned to give his guests a special beat to dance to quickly turned into an opportunity for them to add their own rhymes! And voila- Hip Hop was born! #turntabletuesday #proudcardinal",0.0,"Dryden Bands and Music

Taking some time to meditate when you’re feeling overwhelmed is a great way to practice self-care. A popular musical trend in many meditation practices is the use of singing bowls. Singing Bowls are a type of bell that produces a unique tone when played. Many people describe a deep sense of calm as they listen to the vibrations these instruments create. Take a look at this video of a singing bowl being played. The bowl has been filled with water so you can SEE the vibrations work their magic! #motivationalmonday #drydenbandsandmusic #proudcardinal

Funky Friday Challenge: Think of a band or singer that you enjoy, that has also been making music for a long time. Find a picture of them at the start of their career to the end of their career- or now, if they are still popular. Send them to me, along with the answers to these questions:
-Do they sound the same over time?
-Do you like the old stuff better than the new, or vice versa?

Have you ever heard of a band called the Red Hot Chili Peppers? They have been performing together since the mid 1980. That’s a long time! In their early years, their music was described as funk-rock, but many of their fans think that their sound has changed drastically over time. What do you think? Take a listen in the “Kids react to The Red Hot Chili Peppers” video posted below! 🖤❤️🖤❤️ #funkyfriday #proudcardinal

When You Say Nothing At All

Keith Whitley: https://youtu.be/xNU7iIdw7Ss

Alison Krauss: https://youtu.be/1SCOimBo5tg

“Both versions of this country song are favorites of mine. Both are very country, but Alison Krauss brings a bluegrass sound to it which makes me love it even more. It tells such a great message that sometimes words aren’t even needed. It’s a look or a touch...which can mean so much. And being sung by a man or a woman makes no difference - it still speaks that we all can make a difference just with a smile.” -Mrs. Hall

“There are so many great options for choosing a song that was performed by two different artists, but “I Will Always Love You” came to mind right away. Whitney Houston does an award-winning job with this song, but I prefer Dolly’s version. I have always been a big fan of Dolly Pardon, and I think the way she sings this song is so pure and heartfelt.

Lily Finnigan took the #worldmusicwednesday challenge! She chose two versions of “Somewhere Over The Rainbow”- one from The Wizard of Oz (https://youtu.be/PSZxmZmBfnU ), and one performed by a musician named IZ (https://youtu.be/V1bFr2SWP1I ) “They both use the same lyrics but the movie version is more sad. In the movie Dorothy sang the song right after getting in trouble from her aunt. Her aunt told her to find a place where she wouldn’t get in trouble and Dorothy wondered if there was such a place. In the IZ version, the song is more upbeat. To me, it is a more positive version of people having dreams and going after them,” she says. “I love this song and I really like both versions. To me, it is summed up in the line ‘and the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true.’” #drydenbandsandmusic #proudcardinal",0.0,"Dryden Bands and Music

Turntable Tuesday Challenge: Let’s start preparing for our future DJ careers! First step- make an awesome playlist. 😎 Save the BLANK Cassette Tape Playlist Worksheet in the comments of this post and fill it out with your top 8 song choices. You can print it out and write them in, or add text electronically- then submit it! Mrs. Klann’s choices will be posted in the comments as well if you need an example. 🎵🎶

So far, we have learned that the turntable was originally a vital part of the phonograph/record player- the cutting edge technology of music playing in the late 1800’s/early 1900’s. By the 1970’s individuals called Disc Jockey’s (DJ’s for short) were beginning to discover that these devices could actually be used as instruments in performance. How has this turned into the electronic music we have today? It all starts with our music playing technology! Watch this video to learn more about how our music-listening technology has evolved over the past 100 years or so! ❤️🖤❤️🖤 #turntabletuesday #drydenbandsandmusic #proudcardinal

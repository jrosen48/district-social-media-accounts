On Monday, March 16th, the Oklahoma State Department of Education voted to close all public schools until Monday, April 6th.

Dove Schools administrators for each campus are in contact with their students and families regarding campus-specific information related to closures, academics, educational resources, and any available meal programs.

In addition to the online educational resources our students already have access to, information will also be shared regarding additional optional resources for students and families on campus websites and campus Facebook pages.

The safety and health of our students and families are our priorities. We strongly urge everyone to follow the advice of the Center for Disease Control and local government to limit exposure whenever possible.

Stay safe and stay healthy!",2020-09-12 13:22:52.278122,,

ACTION ALERT - It’s time to make our voices heard at the state capitol on an urgent matter important to our state’s public charter schools.

As you may know, public charter schools do not receive any facility funding. While traditional school districts receive facility funding through local taxes, public charter schools do not benefit from these revenue streams. This is a critical issue for our schools.

Senator Stanislawski has filed Senate Bill 153 to help address this issue. The bill will be heard next Tuesday in the Senate Education Committee and on Wednesday in the Senate Appropriations Committee.

The members of both committees are listed below. Please call and/or email the senators and ask them to support our students and our schools by voting YES on SB 153.

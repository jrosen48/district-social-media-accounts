Cora Samuelson also scored for the Hunters (1-0), who are scheduled to next play host to Duluth East on Sept. 11 at PSS..

""We went hunting and played well,"" Denfeld coach Brandon Sternwedel said after the game. ""We were really strong defensively -- give credit to our defenders who really worked their tails off sometimes with only four players back at some points during the match. Our strong team and individual defensive play allowed our attackers to enjoy more free play in their games, and to have fun.""

Proctor defeated Denfeld 2-0 in the junior varsity opener.

""They’ll socially distance when they’re off the field and use masks when they’re coming and going, all those little things that we’ve got to do.

The hybrid model combines part-time in person and enhanced distance learning, meaning fewer students on buses and in schools at one time. Families can choose all enhanced distance learning for their students instead of hybrid if they wish.

Today is Juneteenth Freedom Day in Minnesota. As we observe this day, we are both joyful for the progress we’ve made and somber for all that is left still to do. Juneteenth is the oldest known regular celebration commemorating the ending of slavery in the United States that is celebrated across the country. It began on June 19, 1865 when enslaved people in Texas learned of President Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation. As the most remote of the Confederate states, Texas was the last state to have the proclamation announced after the end of the Civil War. It was two and a half years after the law had taken effect.

You can celebrate Juneteenth by spending some time learning more about the history and evolution of this holiday. https://nmaahc.si.edu/blog-post/historical-legacy-juneteenth",4.0,"""Today is Juneteenth Freedom Day in Minnesota.

Today is Juneteenth Freedom Day in Minnesota. As we observe this day, we are both joyful for the progress we’ve made and somber for all that is left still to do. Juneteenth is the oldest known regular celebration commemorating the ending of slavery in the United States that is celebrated across the country. It began on June 19, 1865 when enslaved people in Texas learned of President Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation. As the most remote of the Confederate states, Texas was the last state to have the proclamation announced after the end of the Civil War. It was two and a half years after the law had taken effect.

You can celebrate Juneteenth by spending some time learning more about the history and evolution of this holiday. https://nmaahc.si.edu/blog-post/historical-legacy-juneteenth",2020-06-19 11:40:31,,

We’re proud to recognize 67 schools and six school districts for their successful work using Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports (PBIS), a data-driven program that provides schools and districts with training and support to promote positive student behavior, especially for students facing challenges inside and outside of the classroom. Through evidence-based practices, this national program aims to make schools more responsive to the cultures and communities they serve. One important area of focus for the program is on decreasing disparities in discipline, which have historically had negative impacts on educational outcomes for students of color, American Indian students and students with disabilities. The schools receiving recognition are leaders in supporting positive behavior, improving school climate and increasing student achievement.

Sawyer and Hazel are students in Misaabekong at Lowell Elementary and have been mushing sled dogs for three years. This is something that they enjoy doing and take pride in the native culture and history that the sport represents in this region.
In the 2020 Cub Run, Sawyer placed 1st in the 2.6 mile race with Elmer and Earhardt and Hazel tied for 2nd in the 1.5 mile race with Earhardt and Battleship, congratulations!
As part of the Cub Run awards ceremony Sawyer presented (in both English and Ojibwe) the 7 Grandfather Teachings to his 20 fellow mushers (ages 3-12 years old), he did a great job sharing his language and knowledge with others.
Thank you, Edye Binesiikwe Washington, for the information and thank you, Ambers Impressions, for the photos.

Sawyer and Hazel are students in Misaabekong at Lowell Elementary and have been mushing sled dogs for three years. This is something that they enjoy doing and take pride in the native culture and history that the sport represents in this region.
In the 2020 Cub Run, Sawyer placed 1st in the 2.6 mile race with Elmer and Earhardt and Hazel tied for 2nd in the 1.5 mile race with Earhardt and Battleship, congratulations!
As part of the Cub Run awards ceremony Sawyer presented (in both English and Ojibwe) the 7 Grandfather Teachings to his 20 fellow mushers (ages 3-12 years old), he did a great job sharing his language and knowledge with others.
Thank you, Edye Binesiikwe Washington, for the information and thank you, Ambers Impressions, for the photos.

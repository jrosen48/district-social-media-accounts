This year’s Leadership Duncan class can confirm that I have lost my mind, but I blame it on COVID. Yes, I wore a Jason-esque hockey mask during my presentation, but only to illustrate where state or federal central planners could easily lead us when we rely on them for local decisions.

(Washington, DC, August 31, 2020) – Today, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will extend several flexibilities through as late as December 31, 2020. The flexibilities allow summer meal program operators to continue serving free meals to all children into the fall months. This unprecedented move will help ensure – no matter what the situation is on-the-ground – children have access to nutritious food as the country recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.

I am in a terrible position as a superintendent, but so are many others in our state. Like many, we believed that opening school is the best thing for our kids.

Red lights mean stop moving, in both directions! You may need to add more time to your commute, because when buses stop to pick up students, other drivers need to stop, too.

Yellow flashing lights mean slow down — don’t speed up — because the bus is preparing to stop. There are likely students waiting to get on the bus or parents waiting nearby to pick up children.
Red flashing lights mean stop — and wait at least 20 feet behind the bus — because children are getting on or off the school bus. Stay stopped until the red lights stop flashing, the extended stop-arm is withdrawn, and the bus begins moving.
Even when lights aren’t flashing, watch for children, particularly in the morning or mid-afternoon, around school arrival and dismissal times. Be alert as you back out of a driveway, or drive through a neighborhood, school zone or bus stop.

Census participation helps keep state taxes at a lower rate. By answering the census, you protect federal funding for programs such as SoonerCare, Title I schools, as well as for road and bridge construction and maintenance.

Filling out the 2020 Census is easy to do. You can go to https://my2020census.gov/ and respond online.

Dreams of Our Children - DPS 2020 Vision,
February 7, 2020

This Tuesday, Duncan Public Schools kicked off DPS 2020 Vision for the April 7, 2020 ballot. The 10-year student investment program for $27,775,000 is not projected to raise taxes. The ballot will contain two propositions: one for facilities/equipment and one for student transportation. Duncan Public Schools has been recognized as a statewide leader in strategic planning and implementation. If approved by voters, DPS 2020 Vision will help ensure that important work continues.
DPS 2020 Vision addresses four key areas: safety, students, community and stewardship. The Board of Education also worked tirelessly to ensure that every student, every program and every school benefit directly from any additional funding. By avoiding any projected tax increase, Duncan Public Schools district millage rates will remain about 50% less than school bond millage rates (property tax) for neighboring districts.

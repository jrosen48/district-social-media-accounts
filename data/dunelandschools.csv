CHS Alumni Association announces scholarship winners
The Chesterton High School Alumni Association has selected five CHS senior scholarship winners for their first annual 2020 Scholarship program.
The Association had planned to give four $500 scholarships, but because the group had to eliminate their annual banquet due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they decided to add an additional $500 student scholarship in lieu of the event.
The recipients of the first annual 2020 CHS Alumni Association scholarship are CHS seniors Paige Fowler, Hannah Grimes, Isabella Marchetti, Isabel Richey and Grace Whah.
""These students have worked hard and should be recognized for their determination,” said CHS Alumni Association President James Hall. “We are pleased to be able to help these students to defray the cost of their continuing education.”
In addition, these recipients will also receive a complimentary lifetime membership in the CHS Alumni Association

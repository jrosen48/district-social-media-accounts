Thank you to everyone who participated in our first Read-A-Thon. There will be a spot at the end of the Staff Appreciation Parade for you to drop off your packets and donations. If you are unable to drop off at the parade, you can make arrangements to drop off at the school at another time by contacting Lori in the office at 707-795-5050 or LNommsen@Dunhamsd.k12.ca.us. If these options do not work for you, please contact me directly at DunhamPTO@Gmail.com to make other arrangements.
Thank you for your support,
-Dustin King

Yes, there will still be a yearbook! Order your yearbook now and have it shipped to your residence. In addition, in order to replace some of the pages which would have included school functions that were cancelled, we are including a page about this unprecedented time for our kiddos. Comment below with a photo of what your kiddos are doing during this time and we will try to include them in the yearbook. Please include their name and a description of the photo! Thanks!!

I will be taking part in a meeting on Monday, March 16, with the Sonoma County Department of Health Services and the Sonoma County Office of Education. There will be more information to come that I will share within 24 hours after this meeting. Regardless, it seems that a school closure after spring break is highly probable. I share this because I want to give families as much notice as possible so things like childcare can be arranged. These are difficult times and information and protocols seem to change almost daily. Thank you for all of your help and cooperation, stay safe.

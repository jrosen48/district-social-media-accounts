November 15 will mark the official statewide observance of School Board Members Day in Illinois. This honorary day is an opportunity for the district and community to show support for the Board of Education and their commitment to providing a local voice for your educational vision.

School board members serve the public as unpaid volunteers for the benefit of the students and community residents. They dedicate a significant amount of their own personal time to the district, something that is often overlooked. They attend numerous extracurricular events and work long hours to ensure students have access to the educational resources they need to succeed. This dedication often takes them away from time that could be spent with their own family.

Successful communities have high quality public schools which equates to a thriving local economy and a destination community for families. A great school system is a source of
local pride among residents.

Please take a moment to thank our local school board members on this honorary day.

The new school year has begun and we are pleased to report that enrollment is up at Duquesne Elementary. More students are attending our school and riding our buses than in previous years. As a result, this change has caused some delays in bus service on the first few days of school. We apologize if either you or your child have been affected. Please know that we are working as quickly as possible with our transportation provider, PA Coach, to correct these issues. We will continue to keep the community informed as more bus routes and stops are added.

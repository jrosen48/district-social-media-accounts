I hope this letter finds you and your family doing well and looking forward to some normalcy of summer. Needless to say, this spring has been very interesting and certainly a challenge in a number of ways. It seems though in the last couple of weeks I have sensed an uplifting spirit and Governor Whitmer's relaxation of restrictions only added to that feel on Monday. Suddenly more opportunities are available and the timing is right to share some plans that have long been in the works by the administrative team, as well as share some plans made in just the last two days. I'll simply list and explain each area below, but please know things will be evolving quickly in the next several weeks so I'll be able to communicate real information as we complete plans or are given guidance from MDE and the Governor's office. Your building principals will also continue to communicate as things evolve.

I apologize to those that did not receive a box today. I made a request for our distributor to double our delivery so hopefully families that didn’t receive one today will get one on the 5th. Please use the access drive off Lansing Road to form the line. Stay in your vehicles and the food service staff will place the box in your trunk. Also due to the high demand, we will be limiting one box per vehicle. You are welcome to go through the line a second time if you have more than one family in the vehicle but we want to give everyone the opportunity to get at least one box.

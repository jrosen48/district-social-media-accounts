I hope this finds you well and enjoying your summer. As you are aware, we are currently having many discussions about what back to school may look like. There are many factors for the team to discuss and consider as we develop those plans. We will be surveying families again in the near future to get more input as well. One thing we do know for certain is that WE WILL NOT BE OFFERING BEFORE OR AFTER SCHOOL CARE as the 2020-2021 school year begins. It is possible that those services will resume when restrictions are lifted, but as of now, we must focus on the safety of our students and staff during school hours only. We understand that this will inconvenience several of our families; therefore, we wanted to let you know as soon as possible so that you have time to make other arrangements for before and after school care. Please contact myself or Mr. Alberstett if you have additional questions regarding our decision to cancel before and after school care given the current pandemic. Thank you and stay well.

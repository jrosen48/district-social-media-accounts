Mental Health Awareness Month was designed to raise awareness about the importance of a healthy lifestyle and its preventative factors and benefits for the mind and to stop the stigma associated with mental health.

During these challenging times, we could all benefit from a mental health break. The CDC shared some ideas on how to cope with stress during COVID-19:

PAUSE. Breathe. Notice how you feel
TAKE BREAKS from COVID-19 content
MAKE TIME to sleep and exercise
REACH OUT and stay connected
SEEK HELP if overwhelmed or unsafe

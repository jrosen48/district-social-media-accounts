GREAT YEAR AHEAD FOR DEL VAL HIGH

Each spring, Delaware Valley High School asks its sending middle schools to pick out their top eighth-graders and send them to an Eighth Grade Honors Recognition Ceremony in the high school cafeteria. Each spring, that is, except this one.

The event was attended by each honorees' parents, principal and favorite teacher, who would make an introductory speech. This exercise welcomes these promising new students, while reassuring the Del Val administration of a great year to come.

Despite the pandemic, “we did not want to overlook a 30-year tradition,” said Del Val Superintendent Daria Wasserbach, so “on June 1, our eighth-grade honorees were delivered gift bags with some Del Val swag and were presented with a video tribute.”

The video contains the names and photos of this select company of next fall's ninth-graders, along with the written-out plaudits of their favorite teachers.

Handing out the envelopes was Milford VFW commander and Vietnam vet Sonny Silva.

Writing the best essay on “The True Cost of Freedom” was Jessica Huber, winning a $2,500 scholarship; second was Hayden Olcott, for $1,500; and third was MacKenzie Fawthrop, for $1,000.

The VFW also gives $300 to each senior who was signed up for military service. This money is going to Joshua Adams and Andrew Marino for joining the Army, and Andrew Larsen for Army Reserves.

Since Monday, Del Val's board president Ellen Gordon-Obal, Superintendent Daria Wasserbach and Principal Adrienne Olcott have been making house calls -- more precisely driveway calls -- to each Del Val senior.

They are delivering caps and gowns, senior awards, varsity blankets, gifts and other items to each member of the Class of 2020 in advance of the June 12 drive-thru graduation rites. They hope to finish up tomorrow.

At the wheel of the festively bannered school bus is Transportation Director Jerry Ford.

Yes there are masks. No there are no hugs or handshakes. But students and parents were generally delighted by this effort to make an occasion of this year's graduation, despite the pandemic constraints.

After examining his achievements so far, the NSAF named Kyle an “All American” and sent him a certificate and a shirt.

Delaware Valley High School’s musical “Catch Me If You Can” made a strong opening last evening with a preview show, and considering that it was a senior-citizen show, there was a lot of appreciative hollering. A standing ovation, too!

One senior citizen said, “After exposure to so much energy, excitement and talent running riot on the stage, I had to go home and lie down with a cool cloth on my forehead.”

The first regular shows are tonight (Friday) and tomorrow (Saturday) at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. Tickets are available.

The show goes on twice more the following weekend -- Friday, March 13, and Saturday, March 14, both shows at 7 p.m.

CONTINUES WITH SHOWS MARCH 6, 7, 13, 14

Delaware Valley High School’s musical “Catch Me If You Can” made a strong opening last evening with a preview show, and considering that it was a senior-citizen show, there was a lot of appreciative hollering. A standing ovation, too!

One senior citizen said, “After exposure to so much energy, excitement and talent running riot on the stage, I had to go home and lie down with a cool cloth on my forehead.”

The first regular shows are tonight (Friday) and tomorrow (Saturday) at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. Tickets are available.

The show goes on twice more the following weekend -- Friday, March 13, and Saturday, March 14, both shows at 7 p.m.

Admission costs $12. Reserve tickets by contacting theater@dvrhs.org, or buy them at the door.

MARCH EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH

Chris Grand, Del Val’s leave-replacement nurse, was named Employee of the Month at Monday’s faculty meeting by Principal Adrienne Olcott.

Mrs. Grand’s service to the school became conspicuous recently when a student went into anaphylactic shock. Mrs. Olcott said that Mrs. Grand responded to the emergency with extreme calm, competence and kindness.

Mrs. Grand is a Registered Nurse. She has worked in various hospitals, and for 15 years was a school nurse at Hunterdon Central High School. Last year she was a substitute nurse for Del Val, gaining full-time temporary status last November.

EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH

Erin (Critelli) Kraus was named Del Val Employee of the Month at Monday’s faculty meeting.

She is a paraprofessional doing “a fantastic job with special-needs kids,” said Principal Adrienne Olcott in making the announcement. Her positivity and eagerness to help out were cited. Mrs. Kraus started at Del Val in 2016.

Frank Guenther, director of special services, echoed Mrs. Olcott’s sentiments, adding that Mrs. Kraus arrives early and stays late, “making herself available to the kids.” He praised her kindness and her willingness to take on the most-demanding assignments. She never complains and needs very little direction, Dr. Guenther said.

He also noted that she is equally generous with her time and energy outside of school, having been a Raritan Township firefighter for the past 10 years.

Also applauded at the faculty meeting was art teacher Sarah Ruppert, who came to Del Val four years ago and has now achieved tenure.

WILL TRAIN AND PAY WELL

Del Val High School needs bus drivers. If you are licensed to drive a school bus, that’s great. But if don’t have a CDL-B, we’ll train you and help you get it.

The pay is $23.26 an hour if we train you or $24.19 if you already have the CDL-B school bus license.

The daily hours are roughly 6-9 a.m. and 2-4:30 p.m. Drivers are also eligible to drive to athletic events after school and on weekends if they want to.

Transportation director Jerry Ford says, “Our buses are easy to drive. They have automatic transmission, lots of mirrors, and with power steering and power brakes, you'd think it was the family SUV.” As additional benefits, he cites paid sick and personal days, plus beautiful countryside to drive through.

All drivers must pass a physical, be fingerprinted and pass a criminal background check and pre-employment drug test, with Del Val paying those associated fees.

At the meeting, Coach Haughey praised her “great personality” and said she “brings life to our team. She’s a sparkplug for our team. The girls gravitate to her; they’re buying what she’s selling. She works hard at her craft, and plays basketball in season and out of season. Her future is really bright here.”

CONTEST HOSTED BY DIVERSITY CLUB

The Diversity Club’s Dec. 13 gingerbread-house-decorating contest was won by Madi Beyers, Hannah Hirsch, Katie Croasdale and Anna De Leao.

Thirty-eight students came to the Media Center, where each of 10 teams, consisting of two to four students, was issued a small gingerbread house. Each house had been prefabbed by club president Shea Cinquemani and club adviser Lisa Cartwright.

Each team was equipped with gumdrops, frosting and other appropriately colorful material; and given 15 minutes to work their magic. The tight deadline added an element of manic urgency to the process.

Then the creations were evaluated by a panel of gingerbread-house experts from Janice Jones’ class. The winning team was planning to present their house to math teacher Ryan Murphy. Note to Mr. Murphy: Eat around the joinery; the house was glued together.

The old church was packed -- with paying customers, the young vocalists, and choir director Dan Wells, whose enthusiasm causes him to seem larger than his size. Some of the proceeds were from sales by the Performing Arts Boosters of chorus CDs and of refreshments that were all the more refreshing for being served outdoors.

Tomorrow night’s Winter Concert, which is free and starts at 7 p.m. in the Del Val auditorium, is titled ""The Moon of Winter,"" and will take place in the auditorium. It will feature new and old music of the season by Del Val’s many vocal and instrumental music ensembles.

Titania Jordan, Chief Parenting Officer, joins us to share her experience of working for the nation's leading parent monitoring app and how to monitor and supervise while building trust. Titania and the staff at Bark went undercover this year posing as an 11 year old girl to showcase how easy it is for our children to be exposed to explicit content and to persons with ill intent. She will share key insights into their experiment, app, and why parents must be aware of the hidden dangers that exist in technology, while also monitoring and building trust.

Each year, the Deer Valley Education Foundation (DVEF) awards Impact Grants to DVUSD teachers to directly support unique classroom projects and/or school initiatives.

This year’s DVEF Impacts Grants are funded by USAA Foundation, and will be used to impact thousands of Deer Valley students. In local communities where USAA has a significant presence of employees, they provide financial support to causes that address needs that align with the focus of their local areas.

‼️✨We are celebrating each ""A"" school over 24 Days... for 24 Days of A's!📚‼️

🥳🤩Sierra Verde is the only school in DVUSD to be a STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math) Academy. Through the application of STEAM, students are learning and working toward how to answer the following: ‘How do we conserve at Sierra Verde?’ Each grade takes this question and enlists it to explore the many conservable resources such as energy, and the impact of a student’s environmental footprint on campus.

They have also had many Student Athletes of the Year, teachers who have won grants, DVEF Battle of the Books District Champions, and many Math league Competition winners!

Congrats Sierra Verde on your ""A"" rating!",2019-12-19 16:00:57,,

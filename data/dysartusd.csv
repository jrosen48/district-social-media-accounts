Ms. Brown from Mountain View School donned a fun cardboard French Fry costume to get her first grade Kiddos excited for the weekend and the return to in person classes on Monday, September 14. Ms. Brown took the extra time to make sure all her students said goodbye to one another in the virtual classroom. During remote learning, Ms. Brown made sure that the kids felt like they were all one class even though some of them will still be learning from home. The first grade students really got to know each other even in this virtual world. She is truly a wonderful caring teacher. She has handled this new way of teaching with such grace. She is always telling parents that they are doing great and not to sweat the small stuff. She keeps the kids engaged and smiling all day.

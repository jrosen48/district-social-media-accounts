Listen for me in the cheer. I was a little Zoom-shy and didn't speak up into the microphone, but R-Respect was my line! Start learning and practice the cheer, so when we are all back together again, we can show Gryphon Pride loud and proud!

Gus will be checking in on Tuesdays to connect with our community and share how he is demonstrating the Pillars while Distance Learning.

""Good Morning ERA! I have been missing you. I wanted to show you what the space I will be using for distance learning looks like. It's organized, with all my materials, and of course a picture of me! I like to see myself in formal dress and showing Excellence. This will help me show excellence in the work I complete at home.

Post a picture of your distance learning space. I would love to see where you will be showing Excellence in your learning.""

We practice safety drills throughout the year to help our staff and students know what to do in an emergency. These practice drills allow us to evaluate our emergency operation plans and improve our response skills.

During this drill, staff also used a new communication tool called CrisisGo, an app that allows staff members to communicate with each other quickly in crisis situations. It serves as an additional alert to a crisis situation.

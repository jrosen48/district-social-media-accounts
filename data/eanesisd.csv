Tomorrow is International Dot Day! Erin Levy (CCE G/T Teacher) & Shannon Foley (CCE Librarian) put up a story walk of the book in front of the school along the sidewalk on Pinnacle if you are looking to celebrate creativity tomorrow.

August 25 at 3:40 PM ·

In June and July, J.K. Rowling released a serialized version of a new book called The Ickabog. Rowling simultaneously hosted an illustration competition for children to create art inspired by each chapter of the book. There were 42,000 art submissions in the U.S. and only 34 illustrations were chosen.

We learned today that one of our very own own fourth graders, Advika, was chosen as a winner! She will receive a copy The Ickabog signed by J.K. Rowling and her art will be included in all U.S. editions of the book when it is published on November 10th! The contest winners also get to choose a school or public library to receive $650 worth of books from Scholastic. Advika has generously chosen the BCE Library to be the beneficiary of this awesome gift!

Forest Trail 5th Grade - What a Wonderful World

Forest Trail Elementary
April 22 at 2:35 PM ·

When Forest Trail students see an opportunity to make a someone have a better day, they do it!

For the safety of their residents, nursing homes aren’t allowing visitors, and many residents are especially lonely, missing their loved ones during this isolation period. Sing-alongs to the ""Golden Oldies"" are weekly activities at most retirement communities. It's heartwarming to see the joy of all of the residents singing, many knowing all of the words to the songs - even the patients with dementia and Alzheimers. Songs spark memories and lift spirits.

We hoped ""What a Wonderful World,"" by Louis Armstrong would also be an important, positive message for our students during this difficult time - helping them appreciate the beauty that surrounds all of us.

Thank you to all of our students who participated, Mrs. Hitt for her leadership, and Danni Hitt for the video production.

If you have loved ones that might find joy in our video, please share with their facility's administration.

Westlake High School juniors who formed SipSafe as part of the WHS Business Incubator course won $15,000 at the 3rd Annual Pitch Night Friday.

SipSafe is a date rape detection sticker that alerts users if their drink has been compromised. The group worked with mentor Casey Gum as well as scientists and professors to come up with a sticker that attaches to the back of a cell phone and is coated with chemicals that can detect the presence of date rape drugs.

StrawOne was named the People’s Choice winner and received $5,000 for their environmentally safe straw made from hay.

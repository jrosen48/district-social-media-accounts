It is with great sorrow that we announce the death of our beloved staff member
Mr. Larry Thomas. Earle Elementary is greatly saddened to lose such a dedicated hard worker. He was a friend to everyone he met and a source of strength for all who knew him. Your time you invested and love for our students will never be forgotten and hopefully will be passed on to others. We appreciate everything you have done for ESD.

""It was incredible to see my students become the teacher in this engaging lesson. I worked with the Elementary school teacher, David Knight to pair each 6th grade math student up with a senior in AP Computer Science Principles at the high school. The seniors had been given lessons the prior week using the Chibi Chip and the goal was they were to get their Elementary school buddy to understand circuits, simple code, and be able to communicate their knowledge. It was so great to be able to watch my students struggle with the notion that when teaching it to younger students they couldn’t just do it for them and that they had to ask them probing questions to figure out a solution on their own. This lesson went incredibly smooth and we will be sure to look for other ways that the CS class can pair with the elementary school and community going forward!""

Today's Amazing Arkansas Educator is Ethan James, who left his career in photojournalism to join his wife as a fourth grade teacher at Jessieville Elementary School. This first-year teacher has a dimmed classroom with flexible seating and math problems about last night’s basketball games. He uses collaborative groups to reinforce the skills his students need to succeed. Look around his room and you will find students creating fractions with hands-on manipulatives and taking photos with iPads to prove their learning. Students are reading and writing about math while also competing against each other through online platforms like Prodigy. We are so glad that Mr. James changed professions so that he could impact today and inspire tomorrow as an Arkansas teacher! See more photos of his classroom in the comments. #TeachArkansas",0.0,"Arkansas Department of Education

This is where I got the idea to start our annual senior pie in the face auction. This school does it every year, and it is 1 of the 2 biggest fundraisers that the seniors hold. I recorded quite a few examples. This specific 1 raised $400. I believe the lowest that I recorded was for $150. The sheriff's daughter raised $1,000 by herself, but I didn't get it recorded.

This is where I got the idea to start our annual senior pie in the face auction. This school does it every year, and it is 1 of the 2 biggest fundraisers that the seniors hold. I recorded quite a few examples. This specific 1 raised $400. I believe the lowest that I recorded was for $150. The sheriff's daughter raised $1,000 by herself, but I didn't get it recorded. I just want family and friends as well as seniors and future seniors to see how successful this fundraiser can be when everyone comes together, not to mention how fun it is getting to pie them in the face 😁😁😁",2018-10-26 22:50:00,https://video.fbna1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/43679053_1930773770339994_5140565284779720704_n.mp4?_nc_cat=103&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6InN2ZV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=C8X2UKfqX-QAX8icb53&_nc_ht=video.fbna1-2.fna&oh=27b8f8aec9845a1e3d59ec556868d539&oe=5F5D2C1D,

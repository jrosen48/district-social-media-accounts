Good Evening East Brunswick Community,

This is Victor Valeski, Superintendent of Schools.

I know better than anyone that our warmer weather draws us to be outside and I know we miss being around each other. I hope you understand that during this critical time of possible community transmission of the Coronavirus, I must keep our playgrounds and outdoor athletic facilities closed with the exception of our high school track. The track will remain open for public use as long as we can comply with social distancing standards.

This action is for everyone's safety and for our compliance with Governor Murphy's Executive Orders, issued during this pandemic.

Thank you all, in advance, for your cooperation.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3052178674842915&id=109242412469904,,0.0,"April 14, 2020

“All public, private, and parochial preschool program premises, and elementary and secondary schools, including charter and renaissance schools, shall be closed to students beginning on Wednesday, March 18, 2020, and shall remain closed as long as this Order remains in effect.”

What that means is I do not a specific end date to our closure. Consequently, I am canceling all parent/teacher conferences scheduled March 24th-27th. As always, I encourage parents and guardians to email their children’s teachers to discuss individual progress or academic concerns.

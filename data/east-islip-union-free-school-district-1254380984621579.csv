Sponsored by East Islip Music and Arts Program Support, the high school held a celebratory parade on May 29, recognizing the 95 students who were involved in the production of the school’s musical, “Into the Woods,” which was unable to be performed due to the pandemic.

Cast, crew and pit members were provided with a token of appreciation from eiMAPS for their hard work as they were led by the local fire department. The school’s music teachers sang the songs from “Into the Woods” as the students drove past in the car parade, calling out each student’s name and their role in the musical.

The annual Foreign Language Week brought exciting activities and celebrations of French, Italian and Spanish language and culture as well as American Sign Language to the high school during the first week of March, confirming the importance of studying world languages.

For the day devoted to American Sign Language, advanced ASL students interpreted popular songs, taught basic signs and played fun games in the library to spread deaf awareness to their fellow peers who are enrolled in a foreign language.

As part of the week’s initiative, students were asked to participate in a poster contest to encourage learning new languages, with this year’s theme being “Explore a Language, The World Needs You!” The winners, selected by art teacher Daniel Figliozzi, were awarded with Barnes & Noble gift certificates provided by the high school’s former language director, Dr. Janet Hiller. Genesis Madera-Blondet earned first place for her poster, while Ella Centauro came in second, Olivia Zhang took third and Madison Sturtz earned honorable mention.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3057670620959264&id=1254380984621579,,0.0,"Celebrating the Study of Languages at EIHS

After weeks of following the process writing stages, the school’s young authors were proud to finally read their final drafts to each other. They had spent a great deal of time revising and editing their work, adding descriptive language and transitional phrases into their stories, and enhancing their small-moment narratives with emotions and feelings. The writers were also taught to look for “non-negotiables” related to grammar, usage and mechanics.

“It was amazing to read the detailed and complex writing of our students,” said Principal Deborah Smith. “They have had intense instruction for the past four years in process writing procedures, and their final compositions were so descriptive and interesting.

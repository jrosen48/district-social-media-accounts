Begin the registration process for our We Are EJ Preschool Program now! We are EJ Preschool is a Tuition-Free program. Classes are held September through May.

Our preschool balances structured with unstructured activities. In daily free play, children select their own activities from a variety of planned projects. This allows our young learners to explore, improve motor skills, and ready themselves for future schooling.

This fall, Maggie will attend classes at North Central Michigan College. During her time at EJMHS, Maggie participated in tennis, sideline cheer, choir and the Young Americans workshop. Her friends and classmates are what Maggie will miss the most about her days as a Red Devil, and some of her favorite school memories are going to dances with her friends. Mrs. McPherson says,”Maggie has made such growth over her high school years. I appreciate her willingness to try anything and smile as she does it!” Maggie’s advice to the underclassmen is to be patient with yourself, “things will work out just the way they need to.”

During his career at EJMHS, Caleb was actively involved in Student Council, NHS, BPA, Band, and Jazz Band. As a Red Devil Athlete, he was a valued member of both the Cross Country and Track teams. Mr. Peterson says, “I’m very proud of the “growth” Caleb has shown during his middle/high school years. I can’t wait to see what he does in college and beyond.” Neither, can we! We know great things are in Caleb’s future!

During his time at EJMHS, Logan enjoyed participating in band. Some of his best memories from school were exploring the Vietnam Veteran’s Memorial in Washington, D.C. and his band trip to Michigan’s Adventure. Looking back on his Red Devil days, Logan says he’ll miss all the fantastic memories that all the staff created and all the friends/family he made. Mr. Wilson says, “Logan did a nice job in Automotive Technology this year! He is a hard working young man who will do well in the Automotive Field. Logan leaves the underclassmen this advice: Whatever you do, don't argue with your teachers, especially Mrs. McPherson, because she is always right. Also, always do the homework that the teachers give out. This fall, Logan will be attending Kirtland Community College to further his automotive technology knowledge.

She is a perfect example of Hakuna Matata!” It’s not surprising that her advice to underclassmen is,”Don’t let the little things affect how you do in school.” We know Becca’s positive attitude will help her be successful in whatever comes her way in the future.

I love this analogy!

You are holding a cup of coffee when someone comes along and bumps into you or shakes your arm, making you spill your coffee everywhere.

Why did you spill the coffee?

""Because someone bumped into me!!!""

Wrong answer.

You spilled the coffee because there was coffee in your cup.

Had there been tea in the cup, you would have spilled tea.

*Whatever is inside the cup is what will spill out.*

Therefore, when life comes along and shakes you (which WILL happen), whatever is inside you will come out. It's easy to fake it, until you get rattled.

*So we have to ask ourselves... “what's in my cup?""*

When life gets tough, what spills over?

Joy, gratefulness, peace and humility?

Anger, bitterness, harsh words and reactions?

Life provides the cup, YOU choose how to fill it.

Today let's work towards filling our cups with gratitude, forgiveness, joy, words of affirmation; and kindness, gentleness and love for others.

Next year, Augi plans to study early childhood education at North Western Michigan College. During her time at EJMHS, Augi made her mark as a Red Devil Athlete by participating in tennis, color guard, softball and competitive cheer. Augi also was involved in the yearbook committee. Her favorite school memory is growing close to her cheer team members, and Augi says she will miss making memories with all her senior friends. Her advice to underclassmen is, “Don’t give up and make as many memories as you can. Put yourself out there!” Mrs. Walker comments, “Dear sweet Augi!

Jayden has been an important part of the Red Devil Athletic Department. While at EJMHS, she participated in volleyball, softball and basketball. She was also a member of NHS and BPa. Her three top memories from school are getting her 1000th point in basketball, Camp Daggett in the 5th grade, and the Senior Lock-in. Jayden will miss being with her friends everyday and making memories and feels grateful to be a part of such a close class. Mr. Nachazel says, “Jayden is one of the most thoughtful people I know. She is always thinking of others, and she never hesitates to share a kind word.” She advises underclassmen not to take anything for granted and be thankful, happy and kind. She reminds students that life is too short to complain and be mean, and to remember that every day is a blessing. Jayden plans to attend Grand Valley State University to pursue a nursing degree.

I stole this from another counselor but could not say it better and she gave permission to post, so thank you Kim Smith.

As you know we are taking a break from school so that we can make sure everyone stays healthy. I know some of you have questions and may even be a little unsure of what is happening. I want you to know that this will pass and we will eventually be back at school. In the meantime, here are a few things you can do for yourself.

1. Stay Healthy. Practice good hygiene. Cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze and wash your hands with soap and water.

2. If it is pretty and warm outside, go out and play. Ride your bikes, play ball, anything to get some exercise.

Next year, Ellie plans to attend North Central Michigan College where she will study animal science. Ellie was a Red Devil Athlete, participating in softball, volleyball, basketball and sideline cheer. She was also involved in color guard and was crowned Homecoming Queen. Ellie says she will miss making memories with all her friends. One of her best school memories was going down the river with her classmates in 6th grade. Mrs. McPherson says, “Ellie is one of the kindest-hearted students I have ever known. Her empathy and willingness to make someone else's day is something I will always remember about her.“ Ellie’s advice is for underclassmen to be a reflection of what they want to receive. She says, “If you want the truth, be truthful. If you want respect, give respect. If you want kindness, be kind. But remember giving it out doesn’t always guarantee it back and that’s okay.“

Next fall, Alex will be attending Madonna University where he will be studying elementary education and running cross country and track. In fact, those two sports were a big part of his days at EJMHS. One of his favorite school memories was when the CC team won regionals his sophomore year, and “the boys” is Alex’s response to what he’ll miss most about his days as a Red Devil. His advice to underclassmen is, “Do your homework. Just do your homework. Do as much as you can while you're there because you are not gonna know when it ends. “Mr. Nachazel says,” I don't know how to begin to describe Alex. Too many words come to mind.

Next year, Cody will be serving our country as a member of the United States Military. As a Red Devil Athlete, Cody participated in Cross Country. When looking back over the past four years, Cody says it is his family that he will miss the most as he prepares to leave East Jordan. His advice for underclassmen is simple: Don’t hesitate! Mrs. Hardy says, “Cody is the student I go to when I need help: whether it's solving a computer issue, helping organize my cupboards, or building or dismantling a homecoming float, I can always rely on Cody to lend a hand. He will be missed! Thanks for choosing to serve our country!”

Athletics have been a big part of Parker’s life. While at EJMHS, Parker participated as a Red Devil athlete in baseball and basketball. He also enjoyed his time coaching elementary boys basketball and helping with the weekend youth basketball program. Parker states, “I will miss going to basketball and baseball practices, and the fun times with all my friends, either traveling to the games on the bus or on the court or the field.” One of his best memories of his school career was the 8th grade trip to Washington, D.C., “ it was a great experience, and I had the best time”. Mr. Essenberg says, “One thing about Parker: he may bring candy to class when he is not supposed to, but he was always willing to share it.” His advice for underclassmen? “Study hard and don’t ever give up. It will be worth it in the end.” In the fall, Parker will be attending North Central Michigan College to study computer hardware design engineering and then transferring to Ferris State University.

While at EJMHS, Chandler made his mark as a Red Devil Athlete, participating in baseball, basketball and football. He was also a member of NHS, and his favorite memory of his school career was Homecoming Week. If he could give advice to underclassmen, he would tell them to, “enjoy every second because it goes fast.” Mr. Hamilton says, “I always appreciated Chandler's humbleness and quiet leadership. He has been a great role model in our school for the younger kids and his peers. Chandler will be missed in our halls and classes - but I look forward to watching him succeed in the years to come”. Next year, Chandler plans to attend NCMC. We wish him all the best in his future endeavors!

Jorden Elmer plans to enter the the world of work after high school. He hopes to be working in a trade field. Mr. Ferguson says, “Jordan, I'm glad you finished strong your senior year. It was great to see you participate in sports and see you in the hallways every day.” During high school, Jorden participated on the Varsity Basketball team. In fact, his favorite memory of high school is playing basketball. He will miss his weightlifting class the most. His advice to underclassmen is for them to figure out what they are best at and then to pursue it.

Next year Ethan will attend LSSU where he plans to major in Special Education. He will also participate on their Cross Country and Track teams. While at EJMHS, Ethan was involved in NHS, Business Professionals of America, Student Council, Quiz Bowl, SAFE and his church’s youth group. As a Red Devil athlete, he was a member of the Cross Country and Track & Field teams earning 8 varsity letters. Mr. Peterson had this to say about Ethan, “I will always appreciate and respect Ethan’s work ethic, dedication, and sense of humor. He has had a huge impact on East Jordan Public Schools and me.” Ethan said he will miss the bonds that he has created over the years with his classmates. His favorite memory of school was being on the homecoming court and all of the homecoming festivities. Ethan’s advice to others is to make sure to enjoy all the time that you have because it goes so fast.

Also, he has been such a huge part of my family’s life. We will miss him.” On the other hand, Ben will miss running with the same group of guys he has ran with for the past 4 years.

Lily plans to attend Oakland University in the fall to pursue a degree in health sciences. While at EJMHS, Lily was a member of NHS and Student Council. She was also an active member of the Red Devil Athletic Department, participating in cross country, tennis, color guard, and sideline and competitive cheer. Lily loved being a part of such an amazing cheer team. One of her favorite school memories was going to States with the cheer team for the first time ever. Lily will miss seeing all of her, “amazing teachers and friends.” Mrs. Hardy says, “I have loved having Lily in my classes! She is kind, talented, hard working and has a heart of gold! I will so miss her sweet smile in the hallway!” Lily’s advice to underclassmen is, “Don’t be afraid to try something new, talk to someone new or experience something new. The best things in high school and life come from taking a chance and stepping out of your comfort zone.”

Next year Kara plans to attend Central Michigan University to pursue a degree in secondary education with an emphasis on English and ESL. She also hopes to play in the Chippewa Marching Band. While at EJMHS, Kara was involved in concert, marching, and jazz bands. She was also in robotics, honors band and quiz bowl. As a Red Devil athlete she was on the cross country and track & field teams. Mrs. Walker had this to say about Kara, “As I have gotten to know Kara I appreciate how much she has grown through her many challenges. I wish her the best as she moves on to CMU and will miss her witty puns and beautiful smile!” Kara says that she will miss the never ending support that comes with her classmates and tight knit community. Her favorite senior memories were float building and painting the senior parking spots. Her advice to others is to appreciate everything, always say “yes” and keep a kind heart, even when it’s difficult to do so.

She also participated in Red Devils’ Athletics in Volleyball, Basketball, and Softball every year. Mrs. McPherson says “Lauren is one of those “go to it” students you can always count on to step up and get something done. I appreciate her work ethic!” Lauren says that she will miss the friendly environment at school and the feeling of family that came along with it. Her favorite memory was going to Camp Willy and all of the fun she had there with her friends and teachers. Lauren's advice to the underclassmen is to never take anything for granted.

Here is my arrangement of Summertime (with a reharmonization). I was trying to capture how the summer is usually a pretty great time but maybe the living isn't always so easy. Let me know if you think the reharmonization was effective or if it made you think of something else. If you share this video I will give you the audio file for this recording (however please tag me so I can see who has shared it). Also, if you want to see more videos like this go check out my youtube channel.

East Jordan Public Schools have a new display recognizing auditorium donors. The 6x8’ donor wall is created with printed brushed alupanel, along with treble clef and note accents of ½” black PVC. The recognition wall is designed to be updated each year with new donor names. We’re excited to watch it grow in the years to come!

Prior to starting the obstacle course, Mya Arnold and teammate, Caleb Jakobowski, check the ATV to ensure that the on-board camera is communicating with the iPad. The camera will project the image of the course and its obstacles to the iPad. It's the driver's job to watch the iPad screen and maneuver the vehicle using the wireless hand-held remote controller. While watching the iPad screen, the driver sees the road from the perspective of being behind the wheel of the ATV. Other team members are Kendra Behrendt and Harry Hague.These 6th grade students were up for the challenge.

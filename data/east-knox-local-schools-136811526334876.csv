School districts all over the state recognized their graduating seniors by lighting up Ohio football, baseball and soccer stadiums on the 20th minute of the 20th hour of the 20th day of the month for approximately 20 minutes and 20 seconds.

With the novel coronavirus forcing students out of the classroom while shutting down sports and affecting traditional senior experiences like commencement and prom, the stadium lights gesture was intended to create a positive memory the class of 2020 could remember that was unique to them.

The OH.Report asked fans to submit pictures of their favorite team's stadiums lit up during the honorary ceremony and we received submissions from all over the Buckeye State.

Currently, the pandemic has caused no disruption to the educational process at East Knox. Our custodians and maintenance staff take great pride and care to ensure our facilities are clean and ready for our students and staff. They continue to bring this care and concern every day regardless of what is happening in the world around us.

The school board approved working with Class Link at last month’s meeting which as it turns out was a bit prophetic in putting pieces in place soon that will allow our teachers to provide online instruction to our students in the event school operations cease for any extended period of time.

I assure you that the Board and Administration will work with the Knox County Health Department and any other appropriate agencies to ensure our students, staff and the community remain safe as we go about preparing our youth for their adult lives. As always, thanks for your time and have a good evening.

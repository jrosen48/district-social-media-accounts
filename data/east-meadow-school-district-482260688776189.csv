The students designed a paper tile using drawings, pictures, collages and words to express their appreciation to the health care workers.

The messages were then transferred onto ceramic tiles and mounted with others made by the community to make two tile murals. The mural is currently hanging at Mercy Medical Center, serving as a lasting tribute to the team who helped during the health care crisis.

The Memory Project is a youth arts organization that asks high school art students throughout the United States to create portraits for children living in refugee camps, orphanages and similar situations around the world.

Art educator Emily Giglio provided each of her students with a reference photo of the child they would be drawing, along with the child‚Äôs name, age and favorite color. The students could choose any artistic medium for their drawing, from graphite to chalk pastel. The photo was attached to the back of the portrait, along with a photo of the student-artist and a tracing of the artist‚Äôs hand.

The semifinalists were selected from nearly 5,600 candidates.

The U.S. Presidential Scholars Program was established in 1964 by executive order of the president to recognize some of the nation‚Äôs most distinguished graduating seniors. Scholars are selected on the basis of superior academic and artistic achievements, leadership qualities, strong character and involvement in community and school activities.

The Commission on Presidential Scholars will select the finalists, who will be announced by the U.S. Department of Education in May. Congratulations to both on the impressive accomplishment!

Please stop by the front school lawn tomorrow to get your pinwheel with your name on it between 10:00am and 2:00pm to wave during the parade.

We tried our best to create a route that would work well given the large area we need to cover. The route was driven through on Wednesday. At that time, there was construction in parts of Medway that we had to take into consideration for safety reasons. We were planning to go as far as Woodville, but due to the construction, we needed to plan differently.

MPA Delays Start of Spring Sport Season

As you all know, implications from the Corona Virus have hit Maine. This being said, we have been in contact with the Maine CDC, DOE, Governor’s office, and other health agencies in regards to the best way to provide services that people need while keeping them safe.

On March 12, Governor Mills had a press conference stating that they are encouraging “Social Distancing.” By her definition, “social distancing” means groups of 250 or more people attending non-essential events should be delayed or postponed.

Because of this, the MPA Board of Directors and Interscholastic Management Committee voted today, March 13, 2020 to delay the start of the 2020 Spring sports pre-season practice until April 27, 2020. We will continue to monitor the situation and will make the appropriate changes as needed to ensure the safety of all students.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3380108608672486&id=708782099138497,,0.0,"News

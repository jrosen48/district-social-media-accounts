During next week (April 27 -May 1), there will be a box at each of the lunch pick up locations for students and families to return their library books to the schools. You may bring your child’s (children’s) books back to any of the four lunch pick up locations, no matter what building he or she attends. Please put your book(s) in a plastic grocery sack so that it is easy for the lunch helpers to receive it from you. If there is rain, I will not have them pick up books that day.

If you can not return it during this time, there will be another opportunity during the next packet pickup for the elementary and during locker clean out for the middle school and high school students.

If you know that your child’s book is at school in their locker or the classroom, please either email me (tbettin@eastsac.k12.ia.us) or their teacher so that we can try and locate the book in the next of week. If you email me, please include your child’s grade and homeroom teacher (advisor for HS). Thank you.

Thank YOU to everyone who has privately donated to keep the ESC School Food Pantry running during this crazy time. We have doubled the numbers we are serving and the need will most likely grow.

Many have asked how to help--gift certificates to local grocery stores are appreciated as well as monetary donations. They can be graciously dropped off at Iowa State Bank in Lake View.

The Iowa High School Athletic Directors Association (IHSADA) has invited all High Schools in Iowa to participate in a voluntary program as we seek to “Light Up Iowa” by lighting up our stadiums at 8:00 pm each Friday night. At 8:00 on Friday nights we will join together and turn on the lights of our stadiums and leave them on for one minute for each day we have been out of school.

“Light up Iowa” gives East Sac County School District an opportunity to light up the night and let our communities and students know that we miss them and look forward to having them back in our stadiums with the lights on and our communities back together.

The ESC Wall Lake and Sac City football, softball and baseball fields will be lit up starting tomorrow night.
April 10th - 15 minutes
April 17th - 20 minutes
April 24th - 25 minutes

If you would like to enjoy the stadiums ""lit up"" please remember to stay in your vehicles and keep social distancing.

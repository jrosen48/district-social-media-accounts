I'm sure that you are aware, as we are, of several local school districts announcing school closures due to the impact of the corona virus COVID-19.

East Arbor will hold classes as scheduled on Friday, March 13th. We are carefully assessing the ongoing situation, keeping uppermost the safety of our students, families, and staff. We will send another communication tomorrow (Friday) that will update you on plans for next week and beyond. Being open tomorrow provides the opportunity to send home medication, personal belongings, and textbooks/workbooks that might be needed in the days ahead. The book fair will be closed but conferences will run as scheduled with the plan to hold them via phone, unless an in-person conference is requested.

There are many things to take into consideration when making a decision of this magnitude, especially when it is uncharted territory. We appreciate your ongoing support and understanding.

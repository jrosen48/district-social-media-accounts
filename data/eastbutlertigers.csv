We are so proud of everything that you have accomplished. I felt that it is only fitting that as we enter what was suppose to be your graduation weekend, that we honor and recognize you. Did you know that the class of 2020 is a historical class? Here are some interesting facts - the iPhone is older than all of you, you were 3 years old when YouTube was created, you were 2 years old when Facebook launched, 4 years old when Twitter launched, and texting is older than you as well as the college graduates as it was created in 1992. Now you end your high school career in the midst of a pandemic. You have certainly experienced a lot!! I know that I can speak for everyone at East Butler Public schools, that we wish you nothing but the best, and we cannot wait to see what the future holds for each and every one of you.

Stay Safe & Healthy!

I want to congratulate the 2020 Seniors, and we are all very proud of them! We have every intention of having a traditional physical and real graduation ceremony as soon as we possibly can have one. This will be as soon as we can determine a plan that is in compliance with the Governor’s orders, whatever they may be at that time – whether it be inside or out. The virtual graduation at 2:00 on May 10th is intended to supplement, not replace a physical graduation which will occur as soon as feasible. This is so all students have an opportunity to be honored, as invariably some may not be here later in the summer, and then they would have nothing. Again, we congratulate our Seniors!

Thank you,

Saving lives as a Paramedic is everything Casey Welsh wanted in a career. The Future Ready Iowa Last-Dollar Scholarship brings her closer to that goal.

Casey received a $2,500 Last-Dollar Scholarship to cover the gap between federal, state grants and scholarships to pay for her education in the Northeast Iowa Community College Paramedic program.

“Becoming a Paramedic is a way to put others’ needs before my own. I grew up in an EMS (Emergency Medical Services) household. Both of my parents have been EMTs for more than 25 years. It’s a very rewarding job,” Casey said of her career ambitions.

The Last-Dollar Scholarship is making it happen. “This is $2,500 that I don’t have to pay back, and the funding allows me not to be tied down by student loans,” she said.

The Paramedic program is one of dozens of Northeast Iowa Community College programs that qualify for Last-Dollar Scholarship support. www.nicc.edu/scholarships",3.0,"Way to go Casey!

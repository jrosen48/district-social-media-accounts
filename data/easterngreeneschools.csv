This is also a fluid document and can change depending on the COVID situation.

Happy Teacher Appreciation Week! From the bottom of my heart, I wanted to say thank you to all of our teachers. You have done a fantastic job during this most difficult time. At the drop of a hat, you stepped up to the challenge and provided what was needed. There was no training to get ready. There was no notice. You accepted this challenge with professionalism and did what was best for students. I truly believe that the public is truly learning the value of educators in our society. Please take care of yourself during these times and I hope we get back to some normalcy soon. Once again, thank you for all you do for our students! Take care.

Greene County Health Department and the Indiana State Department of Health officials have evaluated and performed additional tests at the elementary and middle school campus again this morning. The tests are all negative for any hazardous air quality issues, as did previous testing. At this time, the campus will remained closed until re-testing is performed Sunday morning. Eastern Greene Elementary and Middle School administration will release a statement on Sunday, August 25 as soon as officials have made a decision to update our community on testing.

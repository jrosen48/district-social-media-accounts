Just got off the phone with the athletic director of Eastern Hancock High School. Some of the best well mannered teenagers I’ve seen in a long time so I felt it was necessary to brag on those boys. Literally 30 of their football players came in last night...I got yes ma’am and no ma’am and please and thank you. They cleaned up their tables AND they all tipped well!! That kind of behavior needs rewarded and the people that are helping to bring such outstanding young men into society need to know that they are doing a fantastic job!!

It is with great sadness that we share that Coach Clayton Shultz has passed away. Clayton was a valued member of our community and a great mentor to students and athletes in our school community. He set a great example for us in how he lived and how he battled during his illness.

High School and Middle School staff members will be available online on Wednesday, April 1st from 3:00pm until 5:00pm for students who need support. Students are being sent instructions this afternoon via email to access those online counseling rooms tomorrow.

Miss Madison will be available in an online meeting room for Elementary students who need support from 4pm to 5pm.

We ask that you keep Clayton, his family, his friends, and his players in your thoughts and prayers.

It is with great sadness that we share that Coach Clayton Shultz has passed away. Clayton was a valued member of our community and a great mentor to students and athletes in our school community. He set a great example for us in how he lived and how he battled during his illness.

High School and Middle School staff members will be available online on Wednesday, April 1st from 3:00pm until 5:00pm for students who need support. Students are being sent instructions this afternoon via email to access those online counseling rooms tomorrow.

Miss Madison will be available in an online meeting room for Elementary students who need support from 4pm to 5pm.

We ask that you keep Clayton, his family, his friends, and his players in your thoughts and prayers.

We had a rainy day for Andrew and Dylan’s graduation but it was still a wonderful afternoon. Thank you to everyone who came and shared in their special day. Also, thank you to Neil, Robie, & Grant for making sure each senior was able to have a memorable graduation moment. I also want to thank my mom, Jeanie Balzer, for her wonderful words of scripture and prayer and how truly special it was that she could be part of Andrew and Dylan’s day. Lastly, a huge thanks to my aunt, Darla Colegrove Mummey for taking all of the photos and shooting the video. It was such a big relief to be able to enjoy the moment and not have to fumble with my camera.

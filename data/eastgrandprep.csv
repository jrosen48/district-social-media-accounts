We are excited to see everyone back at school tomorrow! Please be on time and arrive by 7:40 am. We will allow you to walk your child(ren) to their class/holding area during the first week only. Starting the second week you will have to use the carpool lane. We will have staff members and student helpers assist your child in their class/ holding area at that time.

We ask you not have lunch with your child(ren) on the first two weeks of school so that they may develop an understanding of the routines and procedures for lunch. This typically affects our younger students the most. When mom and/or dad each lunch with them they tend to want to go home!

Finally, please stay in your car during afternoon carpool pickup.

We look forward to another successful year with your student!

We are excited to see everyone back at school tomorrow! Please be on time and arrive by 7:40 am. We will allow you to walk your child(ren) to their class/holding area during the first week only. Starting the second week you will have to use the carpool lane. We will have staff members and student helpers assist your child in their class/ holding area at that time.

We ask you not have lunch with your child(ren) on the first two weeks of school so that they may develop an understanding of the routines and procedures for lunch. This typically affects our younger students the most. When mom and/or dad each lunch with them they tend to want to go home!

Finally, please stay in your car during afternoon carpool pickup.

We look forward to another successful year with your student!

Sincerely,

Mrs. Webb, Principal",2018-08-19 20:22:43,,

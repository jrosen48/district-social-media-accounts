The program is all being done virtually and over the last few weeks we have been continuing to prepare! The competition is set for Saturday and Sunday 4/25/20 - 4/26/20.

We will compete on Sunday morning from 9am-12pm. While outside viewers are not allowed, I will be recording it all and will be able to share it with the public at a later date.

We want to thank all of you for your support and we look forward to representing our community and state proudly.

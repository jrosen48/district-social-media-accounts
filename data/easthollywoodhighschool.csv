to me

One of East Hollywood's very own has a film in this upcoming festival. Good job, Makaylah!

LABELED FEST is a really cool thing. It is a festival for mental health and for ending the stigma often attached to it.

Attending the festival is free! Go support your fellow ManBears who all worked so hard to bring their story to life, and support this totally cool fest!

It'll be playing in the first block during Youth Suicide Awareness screening. May 11th Noon - 2pm at the Salt Lake Library.

A little bit of art from ""Paradise High""!

Post-production is happening as we speak. Be prepared for the most amazing webseries experience you will ever have.

The script, the art, the cast, the crew (minus two of us old fogey teachers, and a couple of supporting adult characters) - all done by high school students. Incredibly talent high school students, might I add.

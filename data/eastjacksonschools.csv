Good evening Trojan Families,

A few major items for EJSS students as we near the start of school.

-Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday are half days and will end at 12PM

- As students arrive to school on Wednesday they will need to check in at their grade level table to receive their schedule- the tables will be located in front of the building. After check in they will go to their locker, and then 1st hour for breakfast.

-Students attending face to face classes need to bring anything they owe the school from the spring (including computers). Students will be getting newly assigned computers during 1st hour.

-Students starting school online will need to stop into the office to pick up their computers. You may do that Wednesday through Friday, 7:30-2:30. Please bring anything your child owes the school from the spring.

If you have questions please call the school at 517-764-1700.",2.0,"Noteworthy items for EJSS

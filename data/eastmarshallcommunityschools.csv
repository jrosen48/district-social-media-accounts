We want to inform you that the USDA has extended a waiver for all students 18 years and younger to receive a free breakfast and lunch.

East Marshall will be starting free meals on Monday September 14, 2020 and will continue through December 31 , 2020 OR until the USDA funds are depleted at which time we will go back to the National School Breakfast and Lunch Program and students will be charged according to their eligibility ( free , reduce , or paid.)

Extra milk and ala carte ( doubles) are not free and will be charged to your student's account.

At this point , no one knows when this funding may run out , so like everything related to COVID , it will be a fluid process and we will notify families as soon as possible of any changes.

If you have any questions please contact Amy Gage , Food Service Director at 641-479-2785 or email agage@e-marshall.k12.ia.us.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3290370944381126&id=415477708537145,,0.0,"Dear East Marshall families,

A beginning of school update was sent to parents last night by email. The two main points of the updates are,

1. The start of school for students has been moved back to Thursday, Sept. 3rd.
2. Updates to the Return to Learn plan have been uploaded to the school district website.

Attached to this message is the letter that was sent to parents last night (beginning of school year update added). Although no Return to Learn plan will be perfect, we have included many mitigation practices to assist keeping all students and staff safe while at school. We ask parents to have their student practice wearing a face mask/shield/covering during the days leading up to the first day of school.

Our Return to Learn plan is designed to be flexible and fluid so updates and changes can be added, when deemed necessary.

We thank our parents, students, and families for being flexible and patient as we move forward into the school year. Working together, we believe we will make it a great year.

Since we can not do a face to face sign up, I am asking prospective players to give me their information by email so we can get some numbers and start a conversation. The Iowa Girls High School Athletic Union has determined that it is not in the best interest of the students to begin open gyms or any other contact until July 1st. That date could be changed to later as this situation plays out. So for the time being, I would encourage all players to find ways in the month of June to work on jump training, agility, and core strength.

I am trying to create a graduation page for the yearbook. As most of you know, I usually take graduation pictures myself because I want the page to be very personal. Since this year is like no other, we may not have a normal graduation ceremony, and I want to make sure it is part of the yearbook.

This is what I want you to do...take a picture of your graduate in your cap and gown. It can be outside (porch picture, in front of a tree, etc.), in their room, anywhere you find fitting. It can be serious or funny. It can be a normal cap and gown picture, it can be with family members, it can be with friends (esp. those with whom the student has been exposed to), it can be throwing the cap in the air, it can be you getting ready in a mirror. Pretty much anything!

Please take a few pictures and email them to me. I would like everyone to do this because I would like to include as many pictures one the two pages as possible. Send me several pictures to choose from. Please complete this task by Monday, May 18th.

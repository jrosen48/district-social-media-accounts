We hope you have enjoyed seeing snippets of just a few of the amazing accomplishments of our Little Muskies which occurred this past school year. Some were face to face & others done remotely, just as our school year begins for 2020-2021.
No matter the location, our students will be engaged in learning information & skills in Academics, Arts, & Athletics which will prepare them for the future.
We appreciate the support of EVERYONE involved in educating our students & look forward to showcasing more Student Achievement in the months to come.

In Memoriam:
During the August Board Meeting, former board Member, Kenny McGee, was remembered with a special Honor Table in his memory. Mr. McGee played a very important role on EM Board of Education, serving from 1984-2013, by providing insights from the community & as an avid Muskie Fan.
A moment of silence was held in his memory and, also, for Dot German, long time EM employee, who was especially endeared by staff, students, & families of Perry Elementary School.
The loss of these folks impacts the entire East Muskingum Family.

Student Art from Larry Miller Intermediate School was displayed at the January Meeting of East Muskingum Board of Education.
In addition, some of these pieces travelled on to Sulens Dental Studio, for the enjoyment of others during these dreary winter days. Visitors are welcome to stop by 750 Princeton Ave. Zanesville, OH to check out the talent of our students. 🤗
How wonderful that EM Students are recognized beyond our own district ...
MUSKIE PRIDE!

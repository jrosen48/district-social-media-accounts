Janelle joined the middle school from South Side Elementary two years ago to help transition sixth grade to the new building. This transition went amazingly smooth with the help of the sixth grade team and Janelle was a leader amongst that team of teachers.

Janelle is a veteran teacher who has impacted Knight Nation greatly. She has honed her teaching craft to create an engaging, active, and loving classroom for her students. Nearly every day you could walk by Janelle’s room and hear her singing to her students, telling stories, or having her students act our lessons.

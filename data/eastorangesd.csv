As part of the adoption process we kindly ask that all central office staff, building administrators, teachers, parents, and students stop by to look at the various programs that will be considered for our middle school adoption in Fall 2020. You will have the opportunity to submit a rubric that will help us decide on the top 3 - 4 textbook companies that will be invited to participate in the second round of the adoption process in January.

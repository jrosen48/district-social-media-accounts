Hello East Quogue!

So I was finally able to look at Jupiter and Saturn with the Meade telescope. No matter what lens I used, I couldn‚Äôt get a solid focus on either planet. I still have a lot to learn!

My next shot of Jupiter WILL include the moons as well. You can just make out at least one moon in these pictures.

These pictures are zoomed in from the original picture (very high resolution).",0.0,"East Quogue STEAM Department

You want to surprise me? You can't. I am unsurprisable (it's not a word but you get the point). I have a tendency to unknowingly figure out any surprise you have planned and spoil it. Or at least that was the case until yesterday.

Yesterday, Mr. Clemensen joined us on the Morning Music Show. 'Joined' isn't really the word, it was more of a 'take over'. He led our games (I cannot believe he doesn't know my least favorite fruit), and surprised me with a video from Michael Franti for my 33rd birthday. What? Where? When? How? Well done, Mr. Clemensen! Excellent surprise and I loved being able to share it with all of you!

Thank you Mrs. Owens for joining us as our surprise special guest on today's Morning Music Talk Show. She spoke with our students about the importance of making a schedule for yourself, 'Just Bee' time, and how we can practice mindfulness through five-finger breathing. We loved having you on the show as well as the strategies you taught us!

Thank you again, Mrs. Owens!

He sang a couple of songs and even stuck around for a little Q&A from our East Quogue students. We loved having him join us! He's got a big, bright future ahead, and we can not wait to see where he goes! Looking forward to seeing him perform locally this summer as soon as our restaurants are open again! So proud of you!

2. Put the cone in a pot - so that most of it stands out.
3. Pour it every day with a small amount of water, as excess water makes the cones rot.
4. After some time, a tiny tree will appear.
5. Congratulations - they just started oxygen production and you have a piece of forest in your own home.üçÅüçÇüçÉ.

Thanks to everyone who was able to be a part of our first Maker Meetup Monday! I have attached a recording of the Google Meet for those that missed it, or want to watch it again, along with links to PDFs of the basic dart paper airplane, the origami paper cup, and the origami paper family.

I look forward to seeing everyone next Monday at 2 pm for our next episode of Maker Meetup Mondays!

Can you guess who won our paper plane competition?
I challenge Mr. Schneider to a rematch! :)

A big thank you to Mr. Schneider (aka Schneiderbot) for coming on our show yesterday! We had a blast learning about how to create a perfect paper airplane!

If you liked Wednesday's shows, you're going to love what Mr. Schneider has coming your way!

On Fridays at 2:00pm, you'll have the opportunity to go on a virtual tour of the night sky, seeing that night's astronomical wonders. There will be fun activities that everyone can participate in!

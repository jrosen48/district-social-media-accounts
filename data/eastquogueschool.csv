Hello East Quogue!

So I was finally able to look at Jupiter and Saturn with the Meade telescope. No matter what lens I used, I couldn’t get a solid focus on either planet. I still have a lot to learn!

My next shot of Jupiter WILL include the moons as well. You can just make out at least one moon in these pictures.

These pictures are zoomed in from the original picture (very high resolution).",0.0,"East Quogue STEAM Department

Friday on our show we had Luke and Travis Hefter, two of our amazing students who performed for the school as musical guests! They did a fantastic job performing their original song 'Six Feet Away' inspired by quarantine. Before we know it, we'll be listening to The Hefter Brothers on the radio!

You want to surprise me? You can't. I am unsurprisable (it's not a word but you get the point). I have a tendency to unknowingly figure out any surprise you have planned and spoil it. Or at least that was the case until yesterday.

Yesterday, Mr. Clemensen joined us on the Morning Music Show. 'Joined' isn't really the word, it was more of a 'take over'. He led our games (I cannot believe he doesn't know my least favorite fruit), and surprised me with a video from Michael Franti for my 33rd birthday. What? Where? When? How? Well done, Mr. Clemensen! Excellent surprise and I loved being able to share it with all of you!

It was another Met Monday as the New York Mets supporters topped the New York Yankees supporters today 174-105! 💙🧡

Tomorrow Routes 3 & 4 can drop off their goods after 2:00 at their bus stops. Drop off boxes will be set up at the school between 12-3.

Thanks to Mia Davin’s huge donation today. She organized an amazing pantry stand in our community. What a beautiful job by this outstanding young lady.

Don’t forget, if the Yankees can rally tomorrow and win the week, Mr. Long will have to wear a Yankee Hat during Morning Announcements next week.

The Yankees lead 3 weeks to 1. The Mets have collected more items overall. Go EQ!

National League Rookie of the Year and Homerun Champion, Pete Alonso, offers his words of encouragement this week. Pete set the record for homeruns by a rookie in Major League Baseball history with 53 last year. He’s a little nervous saying our name.. haha.. Pete, thanks for supporting our students. They are working so hard on this program.💙🧡⚾️

Tomorrow Bus Routes 2,5,6, 7 and Vans 1 and 2 can leave items at their bus stops after 2:00 pm.

Tuesday, May 5 Routes 3 and 4 can do the same.

We will have collection set up at the school on both days between 12-3.

The Yankees lead the competition two weeks to one. Overall, the Mets have collected the most goods. This is an incredible job by all. The drive has supported hundreds of people. Let’s keep up the great work East Quogue.

Thanks to the special people who made this post possible and to our amazing school community for your efforts.

1. Go to the woods. Bring a cone.🌲🌲🌲
2. Put the cone in a pot - so that most of it stands out.
3. Pour it every day with a small amount of water, as excess water makes the cones rot.
4. After some time, a tiny tree will appear.
5. Congratulations - they just started oxygen production and you have a piece of forest in your own home.🍁🍂🍃.

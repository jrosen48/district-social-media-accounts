September 11 at 11:17 PM · East Rochester, NY ·

We’re celebrating the end of the first “week“ of school, and here’s a special treat: A sneak peek of the new 6-8 bandroom! This room is nearly finished, and construction is continuing in the new HS band room, office and practice space, and other areas of the building outside of school hours. Currently set up for a 48 piece band, with room to spare. If you are concerned about how close the seats are – we set up the room just for photos, and will have about 20% of the current chairs and stands when we begin using it with social distancing. Looking forward to the day we can start using this room with students, and especially to the day we can put the entire band in there.",0.0,"East Rochester Music Department is at East Rochester Junior-Senior High School.

Yesterday I sent you my weekly update. In my update I shared that as per Executive Order 202.14 Governor Cuomo directed that school will remain closed until April 29th. Yesterday, April 16, 2020, Governor Cuomo outlined his blueprint to “un-pause” New York, getting people back to work and erasing social isolation without triggering renewed spread of the virus.

Governor Cuomo’s first step is to “Do NO Harm” to continue controlling the rate of infection. As per Governor Cuomo this includes extending the “NY Pause” order until May 15th. This order includes the wearing of masks in public and it also means that our school will remain closed through May 15th.

In closing, I again want to thank you for your support and more importantly your patience.

Sincerely,
Richard G. Stutzman, Jr.

Ina Vento's kindergarten class ended Dr. Seuss Week with a Green Eggs & Ham Day on March 6.

""We compared my chicken eggs with a container of Wegmans white eggs. We noticed the colors and sizes were different and also saw that their yokes were different. Each child cracked an egg, helped to make green eggs and ham and most tried and enjoyed the eggs and ham!,"" said Vento.

Students also put their own twist on Painting with a Twist - using a directed drawing of Cat in the Hat. Students had to listen carefully and follow the directions on how to draw him. They also created their own math equation of red fish and blue fish.",2020-03-09 10:30:52,,

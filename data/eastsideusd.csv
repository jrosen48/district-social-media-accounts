Good evening Columbia families. First off we want to thank you for your patience and working with us as we started the new school year. We have some information for the upcoming week. This Wednesday, August 26th will be our Virtual Back to School Night. You will be able to participate in Back to School Night through your child’s Google classroom. We will be running two sessions, for 30 minutes each session. Session 1 will meet from 5:00pm – 5:30 pm and Session 2 will be from 5:40pm – 6:10pm. During these sessions, you will get information from your child’s teacher about class structure and expectations. General classroom questions can be answered during these sessions. If you have specific questions about your child, you can make an appointment with the teacher. Also, we need everyone to turn in their first day packets. They are a group of forms that were handed out when you picked up your child’s chromebook or tablet. If you do not have them, please stop by the front office to get one.",0.0,"Columbia Elementary School

Good evening Columbia families. First off we want to thank you for your patience and working with us as we started the new school year. We have some information for the upcoming week. This Wednesday, August 26th will be our Virtual Back to School Night. You will be able to participate in Back to School Night through your child’s Google classroom. We will be running two sessions, for 30 minutes each session. Session 1 will meet from 5:00pm – 5:30 pm and Session 2 will be from 5:40pm – 6:10pm. During these sessions, you will get information from your child’s teacher about class structure and expectations. General classroom questions can be answered during these sessions. If you have specific questions about your child, you can make an appointment with the teacher. Also, we need everyone to turn in their first day packets. They are a group of forms that were handed out when you picked up your child’s chromebook or tablet. If you do not have them, please stop by the front office to get one.",2020-08-26 12:54:15,,

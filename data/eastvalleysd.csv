Trentwood 3rd Grade Field Trip to Mobius Science Center
On December 5th, Trentwood 3rd grade students went on a field trip to Mobius Science Center. Students had the opportunity to construct a bridge using toothpicks and gumdrops. They made a plan, created a bridge, tested it, and had the opportunity to make improvements. Students were also able to spend time trying to different activities available at the Science Center. Many students printed money with their picture on it, made race cars, created with blocks, experimented with a ball drop, and many other fun things!

There were 15 students who applied for the Greenhand FFA Degree and 13 were in attendance at our first Greenhand Ceremony. The application is one where the students had to demonstrate their knowledge and get signed off in the following areas: FFA Motto, Creed, Mission Statement, Jacket and Emblem. In addition they had to have a sufficient plan for a Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE) and know the history of FFA, dating back to 1928. These students worked hard in three months to achieve this first of four degrees that can be earned in FFA. In addition to earning a certificate, each member earned their Bronze Greenhand Pin that can be worn on their FFA jacket.

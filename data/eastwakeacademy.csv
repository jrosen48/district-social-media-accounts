What I love about working at East Wake Academy is our endless effort to pursue excellence. I love being a part of a community of practitioners who do what's best for kids on a daily basis. Teachers are given the flexibility to shine in their area of expertise to meet the needs of each student who enters our buildings. Families are engaged in our school and support us wholeheartedly. I also enjoy the fact that parents make the CHOICE to bring their very best to our school and trust us to lay the foundation for their child's academia. We all like having the choice, right? #charterlove",,,0.0,"Why our admin LOVE EWA:

As an EWA board member and EWA parent, I appreciate the community of our school. We have wonderful, caring, and focused teachers and administration that work hard every day to ensure that our kids are getting the best education and support possible. I love that we have a local board of EWA parents and members of our community that all have a vested personal interest in our school's success. Having a local school board that is dedicated just to our school is such a positive thing in my eyes. It is not located in another state or managing a vast number of schools as many other charter schools and school districts are, but right here with people who care.

EWA has been a second home for my kids for the past nine years. A home means that you are surrounded by people that love you and care deeply for your well-being. It is a place that they can grow and learn, taught by committed professionals who guide and challenge them along the way. EWA is that place where students are known as a person rather than just a GPA or a number on the back of an athletic uniform. Through established lines of communication from teachers and administrators, parents are more aware and involved in their child's education, which ultimately builds a sense of vibrant community. We are so fortunate that our family is a small part of the EWA family. #charterlove",,,0.0,"Another message from a parent:

We love the quality education and communication of all the staff of EWA from top to bottom. Mr. Gay is often found at carpool opening doors and greeting us. He’s quick to respond to any concerns we have. Our children’s teachers are very communicative and work to resolve any issues they observe in our children. In a day and time where public school instruction gets a bad rap for poor test scores- EWA feels like a high dollar private school who treats its students as a family.

Section VIII and the East Williston UFSD would like to honor the student-athletes who had their season canceled due to the COVID-19 virus. To honor our student-athletes, we ask that you stay home, step outside and flicker your house lights for a few minutes at 8:20 PM (20:20 pm military time) while wearing Wheatley gear. If you do not have Wheatley gear, red and white will work just fine.

We hope everyone can participate in a show of community spirit while we continue to support each other. If you participate please send pictures to the following twitter accounts (@EastWillistonSD, @WheatleySports, @WheatleySchool, @WilletsRoadMS, @NorthSideEW), depending on where your child attends school.

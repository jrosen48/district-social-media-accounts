Todas las escuelas primarias albergarán una jornada de puertas abiertas de jardín de infantes del 8 al 11 de septiembre para aquellos estudiantes que aún no se hayan inscrito y comenzado la escuela. Para participar con su hijo, llame a su escuela primaria local para programar una cita.
Durante la última semana, cinco estudiantes y seis empleados informaron dar positivo por COVID-19. Continúe examinando a sus hijos antes de que se presenten a la escuela y aisle si alguien en el hogar tiene síntomas. La mayoría de los estudiantes que han dado positivo en la prueba tienen pocos síntomas o síntomas menores, así que controle cuidadosamente la salud de su hijo antes de enviarlo a la escuela. Revise la información de salud publicada en el sitio web del condado de Elmore para obtener información y pautas más específicas si tiene preguntas. Además, los estudiantes han recibido máscaras de sus escuelas y deben usarlas en todos los lugares requeridos. Se puede negar el transporte en autobús si un estudiante sin seguir las pautas de salud requeridas.
Las actividades extracurriculares han continuado con restricciones de asistencia y requisitos de uso de máscaras junto con el distanciamiento social. Siga las pautas y consulte el sitio web de la escuela de su hijo para obtener información específica para que estas actividades puedan continuar.

Soy el Superintendente Richard Dennis de las Escuelas Públicas del Condado de Elmore. Hemos completado la segunda semana del año escolar 2020-2021 y el número de inscripciones ha seguido aumentando. La matrícula de esta semana aumentó a 11.110 estudiantes. Desde el punto de vista de la salud, hubo menos pruebas COVID-19 positivas; dos profesores dieron positivo para COVID-19 y seis estudiantes. Además, los estudiantes y empleados que dieron positivo a principios de agosto ahora se han recuperado, han borrado los controles de salud y están regresando a las escuelas. Por favor, monitor a las personas con las que sus hijos entran en contacto fuera de la escuela, específicamente, aquellas que son sintomáticas o han dado positivo para COVID-19. Además, continúe examinando a sus hijos antes de que se presenten a la escuela y se autoaisla si alguien en el hogar es sintomático. El próximo lunes, el Departamento de Salud Pública de Alabama organizará un WebEx que puede requerir cambios en el diagrama de flujo COVID-19 actual sobre el cumplimiento de los requisitos y recomendaciones. El Condado de Elmore hará los cambios necesarios inmediatamente.
El Programa de Conectividad de Banda Ancha para Estudiantes del Gobernador de Alabama ayudará a financiar y ofrecer acceso gratuito a Internet a los estudiantes elegibles de K-12 en sus hogares este otoño. La carta del estado de Alabama que recibirá sirve como un cupón prepagado del Programa ABC para Estudiantes y cubre el costo del equipo, instalación y servicio de Internet de alta velocidad hasta el 30 de diciembre de 2020. El cupón se puede utilizar una vez, con un proveedor de servicios de Internet, para inscribirse en el servicio durante la duración del programa. Los hogares inscritos no recibirán ninguna factura y no se les cobrará ningún cargo adicional por parte del proveedor de servicios de Internet. Por favor, asegúrese de completar la Solicitud de Almuerzo del Programa de Nutrición Infantil en el sitio web de la escuela o del Condado de Elmore para ser elegible para el acceso gratuito a Internet.
Esta semana, las actividades extracurriculares han comenzado con restricciones de asistencia y requisitos para usar máscaras y distanciamiento social. Por favor, consulte el sitio web de la escuela de su hijo para obtener información específica. Además, el registro del programa virtual de la escuela base ahora se hará sólo a través de las escuelas base. Si desea inscribir a su hijo en el programa virtual de la escuela base, comuníquese con la administración de la escuela para obtener más información. Si su estudiante cambia entre la escuela virtual basada en la escuela y la escuela tradicional varias veces, la administración intervendrá y requerirá que los padres to choicen para el semestre. Por favor, tenga esto en cuenta a medida que toma decisiones para su estudiante.
Continuaremos adaptándonos al impacto COVID-19 en las escuelas y comunidades para hacer todo lo posible para hacer que las escuelas sean seguras y brindar a los estudiantes la oportunidad de aprender y participar en tantos programas como sea posible.
Gracias por su apoyo y tienen un gran día.

Si su estudiante cambia entre la escuela virtual basada en la escuela y la escuela tradicional varias veces, la administración intervendrá y requerirá que los padres to choicen para el semestre. Por favor, tenga esto en cuenta a medida que toma decisiones para su estudiante.
Continuaremos adaptándonos al impacto COVID-19 en las escuelas y comunidades para hacer todo lo posible para hacer que las escuelas sean seguras y brindar a los estudiantes la oportunidad de aprender y participar en tantos programas como sea posible.
Gracias por su apoyo y tienen un gran día.
Cada estudiante empoderado, cada estudiante tiene éxito.

We have completed the second week of the 2020-2021 school year and enrollment numbers have continued to increase. This week’s enrollment increased to 11,110 students. From a health perspective, there were fewer positive COVID-19 tests; two teachers tested positive for COVID-19 and six students. Also, students and employees that tested positive earlier in August have now recovered, cleared health checks, and are returning to schools. Please, monitor the people that your children come into contact with away from school, specifically, those that are symptomatic or have tested positive for COVID-19. Also, continue to screen your children before they report to school and self-isolate if anyone in the household is symptomatic. Next Monday, the Alabama Department Public Health will host a WebEx which may require changes to the current COVID-19 flow chart on meeting requirements and recommendations. Elmore County will make any necessary changes immediately.
The Governor’s Alabama Broadband Connectivity for Students Program will help fund and deliver free internet access to eligible K-12 students in their homes this fall. The letter from the State of Alabama you will receive serves as a prepaid voucher from the ABC for Students Program and covers the cost of equipment, installation, and high-speed internet service through December 30, 2020. The voucher can be used once, with one internet service provider, to sign up for service for the duration of the program. Enrolled households will not receive any bills and will not be charged any additional fees by the internet service provider. Please make sure to complete the Child Nutrition Program Lunch Application on the school’s or Elmore County website to be eligible for the free internet access.
This week, extracurricular activities have begun with restrictions in attendance and requirements for masks to be worn and social distancing. Please check your child’s school website for specific information. Also, base school virtual program registration will now be done only through the base schools. If you wish to register your child for the base school virtual program, contact the administration at the school for details. If your student switches between school-based virtual school and traditional school multiple times, the administration will intervene and require the parent to make a choice for the semester. Please take this into account as you make decisions for your student.
We will continue to adapt to the COVID-19 impact on schools and communities to do our best to make schools safe and provide students an opportunity to learn and engage in as many programs as possible.
Thank you for your support and have a great day.

Good evening. This is Cacyce Davis, Child Nutrition Director with Elmore County Schools. Parents, I wanted to provide you with important information from the child nutrition department as we prepare to start week 2. First, make sure students have lunch orders placed using the Nutrislice app
. The order for Monday’s lunch is still open until midnight tonight. However, starting this week, orders for lunch meals will need to be placed by 10:30 am the day before the meal. For example, to order a lunch meal for Tuesday, the order must be placed by 10:30 am on Monday. Each morning during their breakfast class, teachers will give students the opportunity to order a meal for that day, if needed, and encourage them to make sure they have an order placed for the following day. Please keep in mind, there will only be one entrée choice when meals are ordered the day of service.

Also, I want to provide you with an update on our breakfast program. Due to issues related to food availability, we have made the decision to continue the menu which offers just one breakfast entrée choice per day. At this time, students are not required to place an order for breakfast. Breakfast will be available for all students that want to eat breakfast.
Each student must have their own Nutrislice account. The goal is to enable students to make food choices as they did in the cafeteria…just virtually. We recommend using the student’s school email address when setting up the Nutrislice account. Be sure the student’s name is listed on the account, not the parents. This ensures the meals will be delivered to the correct student in the correct classroom.

Virtual students have the option to pick up meals once a week on Wednesdays from 9-10. Orders for virtual meal pickup should also be placed using the Nutrislice app. There are 5 pickup locations for virtual meals: Stanhope Elmore High School, Wetumpka Middle School, Holtville High School, Eclectic Middle School, and Redland Elementary School.

Remember, breakfast is provided at no charge to students and lunch cost is based on the free/reduced or paid eligibility status of students. No payment is processed when the order is placed. Payments are processed after meals are served in the classroom. Parents, please be sure to maintain adequate funds in student meal accounts to cover the cost of meals. Funds can be deposited into accounts using https://www.myschoolbucks.com/ or by sending cash or checks to school in an envelope labeled with the student’s name, grade, and teacher's name. No change can be provided. As last school year, there is a $12.50 charge limit on accounts. Parents can monitor account balances and activity free of charge using https://www.myschoolbucks.com/.

Finally, be sure to complete an updated free reduced meal application. New applications must be completed each year. The application can be completed using https://www.myschoolapps.com/Application. Visit www.elmoreco.com for updated information and easy access to links for all nutrition apps. You can also visit the Elmore County Child Nutrition Facebook page.

We are so excited to welcome our students back to school and thankful for the opportunity to serve them this school year!

As we finish the first week of school in Elmore County, I want to share information about our experiences and the areas we want to improve.
As of today, Friday, August 14, 10,932, students have enrolled and returned to active participation in our system. Of this total, 6,358 students are attending traditional schools, 4,329 students are participating in the school-based virtual program, and 245 students are attending The EDGE. We expect to continue enrolling students each week and find the appropriate placement for them.
As we prepare for the second week of school and the start of extracurricular activity events that will include spectators, we want to ask that everyone please, consult their child's school website for specific details, guidelines, and requirements covering the events on each campus. There will be COVID-19 health requirements to meet ECBOE Policies and Procedures, ADPH, and current Alabama Mandates. Specifically, masks are required at all events.
The new normal in school is to follow the safe practices to monitor and react to potential COVID-19 cases on our campuses.
First, parents, screen your child before he/she attends school. Check for any fever and any of the following symptoms: fever and chills, fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, headaches, and new loss of taste and/or smell.
Second, self-isolate your child and notify the school's administration if you or anyone in your household come in contact with someone that has tested positive for COVID-19 or is showing signs or symptoms.
Thirdly, if the school nurse contacts you due to your child not feeling well, please, have someone available to pick up the child as soon as possible.
Fourth, face shields can be used instead of masks.
Since the end of last week, seven students have tested positive for COVID-19. These students will be quarantined for a minimum of 10 days to meet ADPH Guidelines. An additional 65 students are self-isolated for 14 days due to direct contact with an individual that has tested positive for COVID-19 or were symptomatic. This includes contact with family members that have tested positive as well.
Since August 4, 7 employees have tested positive, and 29 others have been self-isolated due to being symptomatic or direct contact with a person that has tested positive for COVID-19.
Elmore County will continue to monitor and adhere to ADPH Guidelines and recommendations. We ask that you please communicate any health issues to the local school administration or nurse.
This will be an on-going process that everyone must work together to improve. It isn't easy having to self-isolate a student or employee for 14 days; however, it is part of the ADPH Guidelines and will help to prevent the unnecessary spread of COVID-19. Be reminded that students can continue with their classes while at home using the virtual platform and maintain attendance requirements based on VE-Virtual Engagement.
Please, communicate with your local school on any health issues as we continue to navigate the new normal.

Thank you,
Every Student Empowered, Every Student Succeeds.

This is Richard Dennis, superintendent of Elmore County Public Schools. As we prepare to open schools on August 10, I want to update you on the most current mandates and requirements. The Elmore County Public Schools website is www.elmoreco.com. You may access most Opening of Schools information through the Elmore County Parent Academy link found on the home page along with a Frequently Asked Questions document that will continue to be updated as requirements, mandates, and information changes.
Currently, the Governor has mandated face masks that cover the mouth and nose for employees and all students from 2nd grade through 12th grade. This is required in Elmore County Schools and will remain in effect until further notice. If and when the mandate is lifted, I will consult with the Elmore County Board and recommend a change based on the current sustained Elmore County health status rating from the Alabama Department of Public Health. If your child is in 2nd through 12th grade and cannot wear a face mask, please consider using your child’s base school’s virtual program.
Each Elmore County school has a virtual platform and you may register for it on the school’s or the Elmore County website. The EDGE is a separate 3rd through 12th grade school and requires a student to transfer from his/her current school to attend. If a student starts the year in EDGE he/she will not be allowed to transfer back to the local base school until the end of the first nine weeks. Please consult the local principal if you have questions.
Parents and guardians are asked to screen your child/children daily before sending them to school. If they have a temperature of 100 degrees or higher or exhibit any symptoms that indicate they are not well, please do not send them to school. Elmore County has adopted a blended attendance policy, so students that are sick or have approved absences from school may continue to work on a virtual platform. If the student meets the requirements outlined in the Elmore County Student Handbook posted on the Elmore County website, the student will be counted VE-present – Virtual Engagement. If students arrive at school and are exhibiting health issues or they are determined to be sick, they will be isolated and socially distanced from others and the parent/guardian will be contacted to pick them up from school.
It is our goal to provide the safest possible environment for all students and employees. To do so we must all cooperate and adhere to proper health guidelines. A student or employee who is exposed to the COVID-19 virus and has not maintained the proper health requirements may be asked to self-isolate for 14 days. Elmore County will work to communicate and train all personnel and students on these guidelines.
I understand your concerns as you decide whether your child or children will return to traditional school or virtual school. Please review the 2020 Reopening of Elmore County Schools and Frequently Asked Questions documents for more information.
This will be a very different start to a school year, and we will continue to monitor and respond to the necessary changes. Please be safe as we begin the 2020 2021 school year.

Elmore County has adopted a blended attendance policy, so students that are sick or have approved absences from school may continue to work on a virtual platform. If the student meets the requirements outlined in the Elmore County Student Handbook posted on the Elmore County website, the student will be counted VE-present – Virtual Engagement. If students arrive at school and are exhibiting health issues or they are determined to be sick, they will be isolated and socially distanced from others and the parent/guardian will be contacted to pick them up from school.
It is our goal to provide the safest possible environment for all students and employees. To do so we must all cooperate and adhere to proper health guidelines. A student or employee who is exposed to the COVID-19 virus and has not maintained the proper health requirements may be asked to self-isolate for 14 days. Elmore County will work to communicate and train all personnel and students on these guidelines.
I understand your concerns as you decide whether your child or children will return to traditional school or virtual school. Please review the 2020 Reopening of Elmore County Schools and Frequently Asked Questions documents for more information.
This will be a very different start to a school year, and we will continue to monitor and respond to the necessary changes. Please be safe as we begin the 2020 2021 school year.
Thank you,
Every Student Empowered, Every Student Succeeds.

We have an awesome opportunity to partner with Hands on River Region to participate in the 2020 “Stuff the Bus” campaign on Friday, July 31, and Saturday, August 1!

We will have school buses located at Wetumpka Walmart, Millbrook Walmart, and Prattville Office Depot. You are invited to volunteer to assist in collecting these supplies, all of which will come back to our students in Elmore County.

The Stuff the Bus campaign aims to help meet the needs of children in the community who can't afford school supplies and uniforms for school. Residents are asked to bring school supplies as donations and literally ""stuff"" the bus with the school supplies and uniforms.
FIFTY volunteers are needed at each of the locations listed below to help load and sort supplies. 4-hour and all-day shifts are available on Friday, July 31, 7am to 7pm and Saturday, August 1, 7am to 7pm.
Once the buses are filled, the supplies will be distributed to Elmore County Public schools and given to students in need. The Stuff the Bus campaign will provide relief to administration, educators and countless families who will be touched by the great support of the community.
Supplies being collected include: notebook paper (wide and college rule), spiral notebooks, No. 2 pencils, pens, crayons, scissors, glue, colored pencils, rulers, composition books, protractors, pocket folders, pocket folds with clasps, and backpacks (small and large) as well as teaching supplies such as dry eraser markers, color pens, copy paper, markers, reward stickers and uniforms all colors.

Base School Virtual Option (this is the virtual option through the base school and will be monitored by a certified teacher at the local school)

Each Elmore County Public School has access to a grade-appropriate virtual platform/software.
a. Kindergarten – 5th grade will use Odysseyware.
b. 6th – 12th grades will use Edgenuity.
c. Students that are concerned about returning to school during the COVID-19 crisis may temporarily participate at the base school in these platforms full-time until the pandemic status ends.
d. The base school will manage all aspects of the virtual students that are enrolled with them in this fashion. That means that they will need to have a teacher assigned to instruct, monitor, and supervise as the teacher of record.
e. This is the same process used this past spring, the only exception being not all students will be virtual.

The exception to this policy: AHSAA guidelines require that a virtual student be enrolled at the base school. AHSAA qualified athletes may be instructed through EDGE and participate in required on-campus activities and remain on the base school roll.

The Virtual School - EDGE (this is not through the base school)-

Students that intend to enroll in a virtual school and understand that this does not run through the base school, and are in grades 3 -12, should enroll in the EDGE.
a. The EDGE is an individual, stand-alone school.

ALABAMA (FORMERLY BRIGHT HOUSE) – Elmore County Spectrum Internet Assist: Low-income families and seniors can get unlimited high-speed internet for just $17.99 per month

Sure, $17.99 is $5 per month more than Comcast’s Internet Essential and CenturyLink’s Internet Basics, but Spectrum customers will get extra speed for those extra dollars — speeds of up to 30 Mbps downstream and 4 Mbps upstream.

Even better, Spectrum has eliminated all data caps on this new plan. That means you can use all the internet you want — all your kids can do all their homework, all the Internet they need to download every video they need to succeed in school, and all the Internet your family needs to download films. All without any fear of running out of allowable gigabytes.

EDITOR’S NOTE: The $17.99 offer gives you wired service, but Spectrum offers a wi-fi router for $5 per month. We recommend that you simply purchase your own wi-fi router from amazon.com or RadioShack or any other electronics retailer. They’re easy to set up and it will save you $5 per month.

Are you eligible?
The Spectrum program is aimed at two important groups:

Families with students who participate in the National School Lunch Program, and Seniors 65 and older who receive Supplemental Security Income. That makes it the first program specifically aimed at seniors who so desperately need a low-income Internet plan for which they can qualify.

Qualified applicants will receive a free modem and a self-installation kit that makes the whole process simple.

NOTE: Qualified subscribers will also be eligible to receive Spectrum’s phone service bundle offers. That means you could get this low-cost, high-speed Internet service plus home telephone service in one money-saving package (for example, Spectrum’s “Triple Play” bundle would give you Spectrum Internet Assist/home telephone/cable TV starting at $74.97 per month).

Please keep one thing in mind: You will not qualify if you have had a Charter or Time-Warner broadband subscription within 60 days of enrolling or any outstanding bills with any of the three companies, you will to pay it off before enrolling.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2911799278931494&id=314454191999362,"SPECTRUM.COM

Hello Seniors. It's Ms. Lewis, and I am about to send out the Senior Recognition Video link one more time. There were a few errors that we didn't catch before we published it the first time. I truly am sorry that I didn't catch all of them, and I hope that you each know that I worked hard on this because I love each of you---and I wanted your ""virtual senior night"" to be special. I accept responsibility for all of the mistakes...but please know that I really wanted this to be perfect and special. Now----Senior Video 2.0: New and Improved!

We appreciate your willingness to participate in this event, and provide our citizens with an opportunity to meet and interact with our community partners. We will hopefully be able to reschedule the Preparedness Fair for later in the year, and we look forward to working together with you to make it better than ever before!

Thank you for your understanding, and for all you do to make Elmore County a safe and resilient community!

Good late afternoon,

Here's the latest:
1. We have removed the risk of severe storms that was originally carried until 7PM this evening. The feature that supported this risk is vacating central Alabama at this time.
2. There remains a two-fold severe weather threat for Thursday: Round 1 will affect areas near and north of Interstate 20 during the overnight/early-morning hours. The risk from round 2 (which is conditional on how round 1 plays out) is area-wide and focused on the afternoon and evening hours.

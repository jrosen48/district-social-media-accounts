Today, the State of Oregon released new return to school metrics. These metrics are done county by county, and if your county does not meet these metrics regarding COVID-19 positive test rates, schools in the county may not provided onsite instruction for all students. It is a very detailed plan, although there are still a great number of unanswered questions.
What we do know, is that like all other Umatilla County schools, it does not appear that we will be able to start school with in person instruction this August. On-line instruction will look very different than it did in the spring, and will be much more structured and interactive. Please be patient with us as a district, and be assured that we will be providing more information in the coming days.

""I stopped explaining myself when I realized people only understand from their level of perception.""

Hayden has plans to attend Heritage School of Interior Design to earn her Interior Design Certificate while dual enrolling in an onlined community college to work towards a Bachelors Degree in Business.

Her favorite Echo memory is when there was so much ""drama"" with their class during 8th grade and they had to have a ""therapy"" session with the entire class. None of the teachers knew what to do with them.

Congratulations, Katrina Morrison!!

""Sometimes you can do everything right and things will still go wrong. The key is to never stop doing right."" - The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas

Katrina will be attending Willamette University, studying pre-health and biology in the fall.

Her favorite Echo memory is from her junior year when the volleyball team stopped at Walmart on their way to Joseph for the first round of state. They split into groups and did a scavenger hunt, searching for items like white pepper, a handshake with a superhero, a pineapple scented candle, and more. It was so much fun to run around and relax before a very important game.

Words of encouragement for future Cougars ~ stay focused, but don't forget to get involved in school activities!! You don't want to regret it later!

Congratulations, Katrina Morrison!!

""Sometimes you can do everything right and things will still go wrong. The key is to never stop doing right."" - The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas

Katrina will be attending Willamette University, studying pre-health and biology in the fall.

Her favorite Echo memory is from her junior year when the volleyball team stopped at Walmart on their way to Joseph for the first round of state. They split into groups and did a scavenger hunt, searching for items like white pepper, a handshake with a superhero, a pineapple scented candle, and more. It was so much fun to run around and relax before a very important game.

After graduation, Mya plans to attend a 3-month internship in Hawaii for an organization called Surfing for the Nations, and then attend Oregon Institute of Technology starting in January of 2021 for Emergency Medical Management.

Mya's favorite Echo memory was on an FFA trip when Miss VanderVeen could not get the emergency system on the bus to turn off. For multiple days, the group drove around with the exit alarm going off. Miss V would turn the music up to cancel out the siren sound and all the other FFA Chapters were sure to know when Echo arrived!

It was awesome to see them so excited about the books we have available for purchase! They will be able to bring these lists home to share with you to give you an idea about titles and prices we have available. Money can be sent with them back to school anytime this week.

Our teachers made lists as well. If you’re looking for a way to buy a gift for them, this an awesome option and I know they would love a book or two to add to their classroom libraries for all of the students to enjoy!

Parents and community members, feel free to come shop this week during school hours too!

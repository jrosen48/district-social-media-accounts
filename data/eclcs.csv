Due to the Total Eclipse taking place Monday, August 21st from 11:54 AM to 2:43 PM in our area, to protect students from the possible harmful effects of the eclipse, students will not be released from the LCPA (High School) building until 2:45 PM.

We have determined that the safest option for our students is to delay the release of students onto buses until the eclipse has ended at 2:43. This will result in about a 15 minute delay to bus departure at the high school on Monday. Due to the way busing works in our region, this will have a trickledown effect at all schools. We anticipate that buses will arrive at K2, 3-7 and EC about 15 minutes later than normal and that, in turn, student arrival at bus stops will also be delayed by about 15 minutes.

The week of May 2 - 6, is Teacher Appreciation week. We are in the process of organizing a luncheon for the teachers that will take place on Tuesday, May 3, 2016, starring at 10:30 AM. We are requesting that parents please contribute something. If you would like to contribute, please send food such as pasta salad, fruit salad, chicken wings, enchiladas, tamales or rice to the office before 10:30 AM, so that teachers can enjoy a delicious lunch from our parents. We value your assistance in appreciation our teachers and their dedication to our scholars.
Thank you so much for your help in showing how much our teachers mean to our families. Please call the main office with any questions at 219-378-7450. Thank you in advance!",2016-04-25 11:00:06,,

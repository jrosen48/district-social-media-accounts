This is the sixth year our school district has participated in the Kids Tag Art Program working with the Escambia County Tax Collector. The purpose of the program is to advocate for our visual arts programs while bringing funds for the purchase of materials and supplies to the visual art programs in our elementary schools. This year four high schools participated. Each school submitted their top two winners. The choice awards were personally selected by Mr. Scott Lunsford and Mr. Malcolm Thomas.
Students were presented a plaque and a car tag recognizing their talent in visual arts.
The Superintendent’s Choice Award goes to Daniel Perkins, Booker T. Washington High School. The Art Teacher is Sarah Kelly and the Principal is Dr. Michael Roberts.
The Scott Lunsford Tax Collector’s Choice Award was presented to Amelia Hoffman, Bailey Middle School. The Art Teacher is Tracey Burnett and the Principal is Janet Penrose.

KIDS TAG ART

This is the fifth year our school district has participated in the Kids Tag Art Program working with the Escambia County Tax Collector. The purpose of the program is to advocate for our Visual Arts Programs while bringing funds for the purchase of materials and supplies to the Visual Art Programs in our Elementary Schools. This year four high schools participated. Each school submitted their top two winners. The choice awards were personally selected by Mr. Scott Lunsford and Mr. Malcolm Thomas.

Students were presented a plaque and a car tag recognizing their talent in visual arts.

The Superintendent’s Choice Award went to Amy Lam and the Scott Lunsford Tax Collector’s Choice Award went to Jarvis Blaque. Both students are at Pensacola High School. The Art Teacher is Andrea Cain and the Principal is David Williams.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1705089266233410&id=451659408243075,,0.0,"Sent: May 16, 2018

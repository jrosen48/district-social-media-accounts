We know many will want to attend school in person, and many will want to remain at home and have their school provide teaching online. In order for us to create a daily schedule we need an idea of how many families will participate in person versus staying at home.

Please take just a few minutes to fill out this short survey; your responses are vital for us to prepare for the coming year. Please complete one survey for each of your children who will attend school in ECISD this fall (i.e., 3 children = 3 surveys). This survey will remain open through noon on Sunday, July 12.

Thank you for your continued support of our school district!

We just concluded a school year unlike any other we have experienced. No doubt, we are ready for a break and the chance to relax and refresh ourselves. However, the new school year will be upon us very quickly and we are facing some very crucial decisions in planning for the start of school in August. We need you; we need your feedback to help us shape those decisions. We are considering adjustments to next year’s calendar, to add more days with students and optional time next summer, that will help us support our kids as they work to overcome the loss of instruction and learning due to this spring’s closure and the unknown circumstances the fall semester may present.

Basin PBS is excited to announce its partnership with ECISD for At-Home Learning. Beginning Monday, April 6, from 6am to 6pm, Basin PBS will launch a new daytime lineup of curriculum-based television programming supporting At-Home Learning. This revamped weekday, daytime schedule is being set up to better serve our pre-K through 12th-grade students who are currently in at-home learning situations due to COVID-19 and school closures.

The new weekday At-Home Learning television schedule will be supplemented on the Basin PBS website by digital learning content with freshly curated educational resources for each grade level.

We can't thank ECISD enough for their partnership and support - together we are here to help continue the growth of all our children and families. #AtHomeLearning #WorkingTogether #Collaboration",14.0,"This amazing partnership kicked off this morning. Basin PBS is providing educational programming each day to support our ECISD students and families.

April 3 at 9:21 PM ·

Basin PBS is excited to announce its partnership with ECISD for At-Home Learning. Beginning Monday, April 6, from 6am to 6pm, Basin PBS will launch a new daytime lineup of curriculum-based television programming supporting At-Home Learning. This revamped weekday, daytime schedule is being set up to better serve our pre-K through 12th-grade students who are currently in at-home learning situations due to COVID-19 and school closures.

The new weekday At-Home Learning television schedule will be supplemented on the Basin PBS website by digital learning content with freshly curated educational resources for each grade level.

We can't thank ECISD enough for their partnership and support - together we are here to help continue the growth of all our children and families. #AtHomeLearning #WorkingTogether #Collaboration",2020-04-06 18:35:34,https://video-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/91823099_511142492846162_3117859155512131584_n.mp4?_nc_cat=100&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=gDNSA9n8mNEAX82NH8m&_nc_ht=video-atl3-1.xx&oh=acbc2eb44fd8f1d7e3d926fd8beccb9b&oe=5F63BB7B,

The results will show where communities need new schools, new clinics, new roads, and more services for families, older adults, and children.

A 6-way tie for first place after regulation.

Eventually, the 5-student team from Burnet Elementary - ECISD prevailed as the 2020 champions of the Battle of the Bluebonnets. The members of the winning team are Jared Saucedo, Andrew, Brem, Arron Dameron, Navatiny Berry, Zaylee Lares, and Martin Valencia.
The Battle of the Bluebonnets is a fun, engaging, literacy event that started as an Education Foundation of Odessa grant and involves 26 elementary campuses. This program invites all ECISD students (grades 3-5) to read books on the Texas Bluebonnet Award list and then compete in a quiz-show where they test their knowledge on what they’ve read.

Educating children is a complex, demanding responsibility: ensuring that schools are available, qualified teachers are in place, buildings are safe, and resources are provided. It’s a responsibility that locally elected board members generously accept. Our Ector County ISD Trustees are responsible for an annual budget of $300 million, 34,000 students, 4,200 employees, and 44 campuses. Board members serving Ector County ISD are: Dr. Donna Smith, Mrs. Delma Abalos, Mrs. Tammy Hawkins, Mrs. Carol Gregg, Mr. Doyle Woodall, Dr. Steve Brown, and Mr. Nelson Minyard.

We are approaching the one-year anniversary since our Ector County voters approved a Tax Ratification Election giving our school district more money for day-to-day operations. With guidance from a TRE Committee of community members, we developed a plan for 4 Priority Areas for this first year of that additional money.

At the time of the election, about 1/3 of the district’s fleet of buses was approaching or beyond its useful life (200,000 miles). With the funds from the successful TRE, we purchased 1 new activity bus (for extra-curricular trips), 8 new yellow buses and leased 30 new yellow buses. The new buses are equipped with seat belts and video cameras. All of the buses are in service now.

Hundreds of students and parents strolled through College Night at the Odessa College Sports Center Wednesday evening looking for the chance to visit with representatives from some 60 colleges, universities, military, and technical schools.

From Abilene Christian University to the University of Wyoming, the schools offered information about admissions, areas of study, cost, and financial aid. The event, organized by ECISD’s high school counselors each year, also featured separate financial aid forums in English and Spanish. This year, the Permian Basin Workforce Commission attended with information about jobs and careers in local industries.

If you were not able to attend ECISD’s College Night ask your school’s counselors for information from the colleges and universities that were represented.",2019-10-02 21:53:27,,

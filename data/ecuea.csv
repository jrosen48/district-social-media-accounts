Juneteenth Fact:

Most people are familiar with the celebration and history behind the Fourth of July. However, when the United States became free in 1776, Black people weren‚Äôt freed from slavery at that time.

In fact, Black people were not declared free for another 87 years. And even still, it took an additional 2 years beyond Abraham Lincoln‚Äôs signing of the Emancipation Proclamation for the last slaves to be freed in Galveston, TX.

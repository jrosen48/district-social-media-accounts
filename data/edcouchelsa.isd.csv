Q&A VIRTUAL LEARNING QUESTIONS
By: Destiny Munoz
Jacket Network

We asked ten students a set of questions dealing with the new look 2020-21 school year and these were their answers:

Question #1: How do you feel about starting the school year 100 percent virtual?
Question #2: What do you miss the most about being in school?
Question #3: What do you hope will happen before the end of the school year?

Jackie Garcia (Senior)
1. Virtual learning is a challenge but after you get used to it it’s pretty easy.
2. What I miss about school is seeing my friends everyday, Friday night lights and pep rally’s.
3. And I hope we can be on campus and make more memories before the end of the school year.",0.0,"Edcouch-Elsa Sports Network-EESN

Q&A VIRTUAL LEARNING QUESTIONS
By: Destiny Munoz
Jacket Network

We asked students a set of questions dealing with the new look 2020-21 school year and these were their answers:

Over the next 10 days, we will feature a student per day and get their feedback on the following questions…..

Question #1: How do you feel about starting the school year 100 percent virtual?
Question #2: What do you miss the most about being in school?
Question #3: What do you hope will happen before the end of the school year?

Sara Sumbillo (Senior)
1. I don’t really enjoy virtual learning and I feel like my senior year is being ruined by not being able to experience it with my classmates or do extra curriculars.

2. I miss being with my friends and the feeling of having a normal day without masks and distancing.

3. I hope that we will have our senior walk, prom and graduation at least.",0.0,"Edcouch-Elsa Sports Network-EESN

On September 9th, National Teddy Bear Day 🧸 honors the history of one of childhood’s favorite toys.

In 1902, American President Theodore Roosevelt refused to shoot a bear cub while hunting in Mississippi. The incident made national news. Clifford Berryman published a cartoon of the event in the Washington Post on November 16th, 1902, and the caricature became an instant classic.

The Berryman cartoon of Teddy Roosevelt and the cub inspired New York store owner Morris Michtom to create a new toy. Mitchtom wrote to ask President Roosevelt to ask permission to name the new toy a “Teddy Bear.” 🧸

We have all had a special cuddly Teddy as a child. No matter what kind of Teddy Bear 🧸 you had, the day is a perfect time to celebrate your childhood stuffed toy!",0.0,"Eehs Cheer is with Aalyah Balderas and 5 others.

Lots of learning going on for everyone at LBJ! Students, teachers, paraprofessionals, office staff, administrators and parents have had to learn how to navigate Canvas, Zoom, Seesaw, IXL, Waterford, iReady....not to mention logging on to chromebooks!
But you know what?! That’s what makes us LBJ! We are a learning community that supports each other and will go over and beyond to serve our students and parents. We are so proud of our teachers, students & parents for successfully logging on every day, for not giving up and just pushing forward!

You can make a difference by participating in the 2020 Census. That's because the Census determines how many billions of dollars are allocated every year to health clinics, schools, affordable housing, and hundreds of other critical services and programs that make a difference in our lives every day. It only takes a few minutes, but the impact will be felt for years. When you receive the invitation from the U.S. Census Bureau, complete the simple questionnaire online, by phone, or by mail.

""Shattered Dreams"" is an educational experience that shows the dangers associated with drinking and driving. It reminds us that too many young lives have already been lost and countless others severely impaired because of the tragic consequences of underage drinking combined with driving. It's about living and dying.

The ""Shattered Dreams"" program involves the dramatization of an alcohol-related crash on or near a high school campus, complete with fire, police and EMS response, emergency room treatment, funeral hearse, family notifications, and the arrest and booking of the driver.
The crash scene drama is played out before the student body. To give students a better understanding of the number of DWI-related deaths, an individual dressed as the ""Grim Reaper"" appears periodically as victims start to die.

Meet was a Huge Sucess. Eventful Day! Two New inductees into the Edcouch-Elsa Track & Field Hall of Fame. Coach Jaime Ochoa has dedicated 37years to Polevaulting and 40years to Edcouch-Elsa Isd. Celinda Caceres was a Powerhouse during her days and still holds records in the Long Jump and 200m Dash.

We also witnessed two of our very own, the Dynamic Duo of Albino Rodriguez and Dominic Medrano sign their letters of intent to continue their acadmic and athletic careers at UTRGV.

Like I said, Eventful day, and none of this would have been possible without the Support of our AD, Admin. Staff, and of course our coaching staff for going above and beyond the call of duty to make this day possible.

Meet was a Huge Sucess. Eventful Day! Two New inductees into the Edcouch-Elsa Track & Field Hall of Fame. Coach Jaime Ochoa has dedicated 37years to Polevaulting and 40years to Edcouch-Elsa Isd. Celinda Caceres was a Powerhouse during her days and still holds records in the Long Jump and 200m Dash.

We also witnessed two of our very own, the Dynamic Duo of Albino Rodriguez and Dominic Medrano sign their letters of intent to continue their acadmic and athletic careers at UTRGV.

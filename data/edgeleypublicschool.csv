I thought I would share some behind the scene pictures of what happens in the summer at the school. We have been asked several times by parents. Our custodial/maintenance crew take pride in our work. We strive to have a very clean school that we can be proud of. Summer cleaning involves taking furnature out of the rooms so they can be stripped and waxed or shampooed. We collected almost 60 pounds of wax from just part of a room. We also wipe down classrooms from top to bottom. We have painted walls and replaced white boards. This year we moved everything out the maintenance storage room and Mr Young's room to get ready for the floor project and apply a fresh coat of paint on all the walls. I can say I am very proud of my coworkers and the work they do. RoxAne Swartz, Shannon Augeson, Sandy Anderson, and Dana. We look forward to seeing everyone this next Fall. We have also learned to use the weed eater and the zero turn lawn mowers. That has been quite interesting.",0.0,"Thank you custodians!

Remember that Tuesday and Thursday mornings are garden mornings and we encourage all students to sign up for at least one shift (parents if you would encourage a little, we'd appreciate it). We usually work from 8-10am depending on what needs to be done. Community members are welcome to come out at that time as well.

Today’s STEM project. Create a boat using only 2 feet of tin foil and 1 foot of plastic wrap and 1 foot of any tape of your choice. You are allowed to use 1 mystery material (can’t be a boat already created). Mystery items could include but not limited to a cork, cardboard, material, straw.... Set your boat sailing in some water. Add pennies and see how many pennies it will hold before sinking. Either snap some pictures or video it. Post your pictures/video on the comments to this post to share with everyone. Good luck! I can’t wait to see your boats!

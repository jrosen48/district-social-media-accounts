Last Summer my office convened a Summer Policy Working Group of bright youth from Edina, Lakeville and surrounding areas.

This group of young leaders found that our Minnesota schools did not consistently teach about the harms of vaping in middle school. We drafted a bill and worked with educators, Principals and Superintedent’s to ensure this could be improved and aimed at education as prevention.

The students met with the revisor’s office, surveyed health teachers across MN, made compromises on language and we ensured the bill was bipartisan with Senator Carla Nelson as the chief author in the Senate. Senator Nelson and I have both long been advocates on protecting youth from the harms of nicotine addiction.

I am beyond proud to report our bill passed the MN House and Senate this evening during our Special Session and will be headed to the Governor’s desk to become law!

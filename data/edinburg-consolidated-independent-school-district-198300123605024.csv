Here is what your Mariachi Oro de ENHS had been working on during these quarantine days. Having been inspired by our friends from Roma and McHi, here is our quarantine song.
This song’s original name is “Tu Recuerdo y Yo” by José Alfredo Jimenez. It has been reimagined by Nathan Fernandez with a song title and lyrics:

“La Cuarentena y Yo”

Estoy en el rincón de mi casita
Oyendo a mis hermanos corretear
Me estan volviendo loco, madre mia
Ya déjame salir de este lugar

Yo se que todo el mundo está sufriendo
Y vengo aqui nomas a suplicar
El virus del que hablan es muy feo
Asi que no me toquen que esta mal

Quien no sabe todavía que las manos no se limpian cuando no hay ningun jabón

Quien no llega a la tiendita
Exigiendo su agüita y exigiendo su alcohol
Me estoy aburriendo mas sin mis amigos
Ahorita ya no se si los voy a ver

Ahorita solamente yo les pido
Que se cuiden otra vez, y se bañen bien

Hope you enjoy!

Since we are all eating at home more often, we are buying more groceries, which means you could be earning money for East Side!

Download the free “Box Tops For Education” app so you can help us earn cash for our school.

All you will have to do is open the downloaded app when you buy BOX TOP products and scan your receipt for it to recognize the products, so a portion of it will be sent to our school!

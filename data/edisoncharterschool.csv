The National Championship Chess Team from Thomas Edison Charter School needs your help! The team, which brought home a first-place trophy in 2014 and has placed in the top five for the past four years, is raising money to take students to this year's National Chess Championship in Indianapolis next month. More than 400 students in the school play chess during the school day as part of Edison's First Move Program in the lunchroom and in the after-school program.

Secretary Godowsky had the chance to find out first-hand just how good the kids are during his visit this week!

The cost is about $1,000 per student, including transportation by coach bus, hotel, meals, and tournament fees. For many students at the school, the opportunities to travel outside of Delaware are limited, so this is a special experience for them.

Tax-deductible donations can be made here: https://www.gofundme.com/EdisonChessTeam",0.0,"Thank you for your support!

At Thomas Edison Charter School, chess is a team sport--and a vehicle for life lessons.

Yesterday I visited Edison and was schooled in the art of chess by their award-winning chess team as I dusted off my chess technique. I first tasted defeat at the hands of Madalyn, who recently tied for 19th at the K-6 Elementary National Chess Championship in Dallas. I then held my own (but ultimately lost) in a lengthy game with Cashmere, who placed 2nd in the same tournament. I look forward to the rematches, and to additional coaching from some very savvy Edison students.",0.0,"Bryan Townsend

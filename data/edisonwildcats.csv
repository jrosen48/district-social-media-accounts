I initially saw Amelia Collopy at the Stanton Elementary talent show as a 5th grader and she had me in tears as she sang “How Great Thou Art” so beautifully that it felt like you were transported to heaven. The video of that song went on to garner 16,000 views on Facebook and this young lady is even better now with a voice that is powerful and seasoned well beyond her years. She was the winner of the Mingo Idol competition last year and also was the 2018 Valleys Got Talent Soloist Runner Up as an 11 year old! She is a product of the stellar Edison School district that has produced a number of highly skilled vocalists who have already performed for the Sycamore Sings! Songs of Hope. Amelia will be featured on Facebook “Live” from 7-7:15 PM Friday on her mom’s Facebook page and my page.

The school counseling department is going to start today's challenge and from there it will be up to our Edison students and community to keep the challenge going. We would like to see daily posts from students, families, community members, and teachers challenging other students and Facebook friends in other communities and areas. Remember we are all in this together. #MeaningfulMay",2020-05-01 09:13:52,,

2X Valley’s Got Talent finalist Gracie Phillips will be performing for the “Sycamore Sings: Songs of Hope” Online Concert Series Friday (5/1) from 7:00-7:15 pm. She had the starring role as “Jane” in “Tarzan: The Musical” at Edison HS and gave a performance for the ages😱. She sings beautiful soul stirring hymns, show tunes, country and inspiring Contemporary Christian songs. I’ve taught Gracie a number of times while subbing at Edison and have found her to be not only an able scholar but an all around good girl who is a true asset to her local school. She is a part of the Edison Choral program under the tutelage of Master Choir Instructor Dani Carroll who blew up the internet a few weeks ago with her Sycamore Facebook ""live"" performance with over 1,300 views. I would especially encourage Wildcat nation😺to tune in and support Gracie as well as anyone else that would like to have their heart uplifted by this phenomenally talented young lady.🎤🎼🙌🏻 To view the show go to the Facebook page of Gracie Phillips or Bobbyjon Bauman at 7:00 PM on Friday.",0.0,"Edison Nation,

#InThisTogether Challenge
Social distancing can change how you usually interact with people you care about. We want to help you consider how to build community and support systems, while we are all stuck at home.

Some ways you can connect virtually with friends, family, teachers, and your community:

Plan virtual dinners and coffee breaks; do at-home crafts and activities over a video call; watch a virtual concert together; read the same book or watch the same movie/TV show and talk about it; play online multiplayer video games; or join an online exercise class!

Go to edisonwildcats.org/guidance for more information and a video!

Dear Edmonds School District families,

As we plan for reopening our school buildings in the fall, we want you to know that the health and safety of our students, families, staff, and community members surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic comes first.

This morning, the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) released state guidelines on how schools will reopen this fall. You can read the entire document on the OSPI website. The district is committed to exploring the viability of this reopening plan for in-person instruction.

We want you to know as Dr. Kristine McDuffy steps down from her position at the end of the month, she and our new superintendent, Dr. Gustavo Balderas, are working together with the district leadership to use the new state guidelines to help make specific plans for different school scenarios when we reopen in September.

As of 12 p.m. Tuesday, March 10, 2020, we have no confirmed cases of COVID-19 among our students and staff. Snohomish Health District, which has local health jurisdiction over our community, continues to say that closing schools when there has not been a confirmed case in a student or staff member is not currently recommended. We will continue to take direction from the Snohomish Health District on possible school closures.

Although we are actively responding to this public health issue, we are still in the classroom where teaching and learning continue. Our staff is doing an incredible job remaining calm, staying positive and keeping up normal daily school routines as much as possible so our kids can feel safe and stay focused on learning.

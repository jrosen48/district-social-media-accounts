Exciting news! 🎉 We have partnered with OETA to provide in-home learning opportunities for students. The goal is to bring parents, students and teachers together with content and curriculum to meet educational needs while schools are closed due to coronavirus.

Beginning Monday, March 30, OETA will be adjusting its daytime schedule to provide curriculum-based programming for students over the air on its broadcast channel, OETA WORLD. Programs will include PBS favorites like NOVA, Nature, American Experience and PBS KIDS programming.

Programming changes to OETA WORLD will take place Monday through Friday from 6 a.m. until 6 p.m. until the end of the school year.

Teachers and parents are encouraged to visit OETA.tv/LearningAtHome to view an updated program schedule, OETA’s statewide channel list, curriculum and activities.",2020-03-26 17:13:46,,

We are still trying to find the words to say after today. We are completely blown away and are so humbled by the time and hard work these students have put into making this all happen. Over the course of the last several months these young men and women have worked tirelessly to raise funds on our Hospital’s behalf. Today, at their closing ceremony, they presented us with $568,082 dollars to put towards building our Field of Dreams Adaptive Sports Complex. In the 25 years of the BALTO tradition, this is the highest amount of money that has ever been raised solely by the students. This group of young people are truly bringing light to others. We have no doubt that they will continue to change the world ❤️

To every single student, faculty, alumni and sponsor who was a part of this beautiful journey, from the bottom of our heart, we say THANK YOU!

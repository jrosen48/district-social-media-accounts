Not the throws that he’s making, but the character of the person in him.

A Karr man is a person who’s going to give it their all to the end and find the answer. Play with discipline. Play with pride. Play for their school, play for their family. And that’s what he does.

He’s not a big ‘I’ guy. He’s not the one to look in the newspaper to find his stats. He’s the one who wants the final stat, the ‘W.’ And that’s what makes me more proud of him.’’

Meet Leonard Kelly, 'Karr man,' quarterback extraordinaire",38.0,"“What he’s done and what I’m most proud of about him is that through his maturation process he’s not only growing on the field, he’s growing off of it,’’ Brown said. “That’s what makes me so proud of him, that he’s becoming the Karr man that he’s been taught to be. Not the throws that he’s making, but the character of the person in him.

A Karr man is a person who’s going to give it their all to the end and find the answer. Play with discipline. Play with pride. Play for their school, play for their family. And that’s what he does.

He’s not a big ‘I’ guy. He’s not the one to look in the newspaper to find his stats. He’s the one who wants the final stat, the ‘W.’ And that’s what makes me more proud of him.’’

Come and cheer on the Cougars in the State Championship this Saturday at 3:30 p.m. vs. Easton! Tickets are available for purchase at the school ($16 Genreal Admission, $19 Reserved Seating) through Thursday at 2 pm and online via Ticketmaster:

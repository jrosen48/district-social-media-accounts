Dave and I were alerted of the increase in Covid cases last night in North Platte. We have been constantly looking at the WCDHD website and the requirements for Code Orange would be back to “no gatherings of 10 or more.” With that said, we will unfortunately have to cancel this weekends event.

We will still be handing out backpacks on Saturday and will be requiring anyone that comes to collect one to wear a mask. If you would still like to come out and grab a backpack for your kiddo, we will be there from 1-5 pm to hand them out.

I ❤️ puppets!

For young children who avert eye gaze during therapy sessions, holding a puppet next to my face is usually a game changer!

The puppet can point to pictures in books, or help put toys away, or watch my mouth when I say words.

In essence, the puppet becomes the model for the child 🧒🏽👶🏼👦🏻

I have a wide variety of puppets at my disposal. For kiddos with suspected CAS, I love using a cute oven mitt as a puppet. Why, you ask. Because an oven mitt is like a giant mouth and it shows jaw movement.

I also like adding puppets to story time to keep the young child’s focus and attention on me and the book. I have collected a variety of finger puppets to pair with different books.

During an international pandemic, it is important to add that puppets can be used effectively during Teletherapy sessions too!

Who else uses puppets to support play-based learning? Reply with a ❤️ if you love puppets too!

So, you’ve introduced the open cup but your toddler has discovered GRAVITY.

.
Happens to the best of us – it’s going to be ok! Grab some paper towels and follow my 3 C’s.
.
👉🏻Stay calm.
.
👉🏼Respond in a concise manner – just state the facts.
.
👉🏽Parent consistently and get all the adults on board too! Consistency is key when it comes to establishing positive behaviors in kids.
.
😊Most of all – remember to join in on the fun when it is an appropriate time and place, like bathtime! Kids just want attention and that’s the time to reinforce their delight in pouring, splashing & discovering
all the fun things that we can do with cups!
.
♥️But when we are not in the bath, cups are for drinking.

If this class could teach you how to save money, how to make sure you never run out of money when you need it most, and how to prevent you, your family, and your friends from ever needing GoFundMe, would you attend?

If you answer yes, then join us for one of our upcoming Money 101 workshops, where financial education is free.

This is true for early care and education professionals too. Narrating what we’re doing in front of infants, toddlers and preschoolers is an important early literacy development strategy called “Self Talk”. Similarly, narrating what a young child is doing in real-time is called “Parallel Talk”.

Ok, I’m going to take a deep breath to help me calm down - breathes deeply - I’m feeling a little better now but I’m still a little upset. I could sure use a hug right now...)",0.0,"Richard Cohen’s “Zen and the Art of Early Childhood Education""

Hot Wheels ➡️ My all time favorite toy for supporting early speech and language development!

Here’s how I sound when playing with these toy vehicles:

Beep-beep

Vroooom

Crash!

Ready...set...go!

Go car!

Blue car, red car, green car

1 car, 2 cars, 3 cars

Drive the car

Push the car

Up the hill

Down the hill

Through the tunnel

Stop!

Go!

Go fast!

Zoom zoom!

My turn, your turn

Bye-bye!

Do you love Hot Wheels as much as I do? I have too many to count...but just so you know, I do sometimes share them with my son! 🤣

Good news: A group of early childhood organizations have collaborated to create the Nebraska Child Care Referral Network — a searchable child care database for parents and providers at
www.nechildcarereferral.org.
Many of our friends and neighbors must still report to jobs outside their homes during the COVID-19 crisis. This website can help those who need quality emergency child care find it.
Why is this important?
• Many states already have a child care resource and referral website, so this is historic for Nebraska.
• This is a response to what families and providers are telling us they need
• Child care providers are an essential, but often overlooked, part of our communities
• This database will live on beyond COVID-19 emergency, connecting families who need quality child care with the provider that's right for them.
Thank you to Nebraska Children and Families Foundation for leading this charge and to every statewide partner who helped make it a reality.",0.0,"Check out this new tool to help you find childcare centers near you!

Tomorrow night starting at 6:30 we would like to invite everyone to come to the church parking lot to receive assorted food items. We have purchased a semi trailer load of food and will be distributing it to whoever comes by. It is our desire to try to be a blessing and help during this difficult time.

Please enter from the east end of the parking lot off of Madison. You will not need to park or exit your vehicle. Someone will bring out prepared bags and place them in your cars.",0.0,"This is tonight, starting at 6:30!

Yes I'm still on my soapbox about PLAY!

Redmond is our judgemental, opinionated, middle child who has ZERO interest in sitting and doing ""school stuff."" And to be honest, it would be developmentally INAPPROPRIATE to expect that of him.

Well here are a few of the language and learning concepts we ""worked"" on while building his ""vacuum cleaner"":

Size comparison- tall/taller/short/shorter/long/longer

Colors- red, yellow, blue

Descriptive vocabulary- fast/slow, round, rolling, push/pull, in/on/off, together/apart, same/match/different, broken/fixed

He had to problem solve a way to negotiate a trade with his brother to get the pieces he needed to make it ""roll right""

He had to PERSIST through several breaks (as you can see in the picture)

So if you want some extra tips for young kiddos at home right now...LET THEM PLAY.

Hello, Buffalo families! I’d like to share this resource for local food banks. Please note:

You can visit ONE food bank per month, however make sure you don’t visit the same one more often than once every three months. This helps to make sure all food banks are being used, rather than just one getting hit all at once.

For questions, you can call the numbers listed for the pantries.

A few perspectives to keep in mind over the busy holiday season:

Kids who are melting down over the holidays don’t mean:

“I’m trying to ruin your fun”
“I’m trying to embarrass you”
“You are a bad parent”
“I am a bad child”
“I need you to meet my demands”
“I need to learn a lesson”
“I’m defiant and refuse to listen”
“I hate you”

Kids who are melting down over the holidays may mean:

“I’m really overstimulated and need a break”
“There’s a lot of new people and I’m feeling overwhelmed”
“I need your attention”
“My Brain is feeling flooded right now with emotion, I cant think logically”
“I need you to take me to a safe space to let these feelings out”
“Please help me find a peaceful spot to hang out”
“I feel safe to have these feelings with you.”
“This has been a big day for me”
“I’m hungry, tired, or bored”
“I need you to be my calm right now”
“This is all new for me”
“I love you and feel safe with you” —

Improving early child development

Members of the North Platte community will be coming together later this month to discuss ways to improve early child development through a partnership with the Communities for Kids initiative. “I see the Communities for Kids Initiative as an opportunity for the North Platte community to rally around a common vision that all children will be provided high-quality early care and education programs,” says North Platte Public Schools Superintendent Ron Hanson. “All children deserve the opportunity to grow, learn and succeed in life, and it would be great knowing every child coming to school will have the same opportunities to learn.”

When I placed my order I said, “Regular amount of chromosomes, please!” That’s what everyone else got and what I wanted too. They called me shortly after my order was in production and said “Great news, we went ahead and upgraded you to extra chromosomes for free! You’ll receive the extra chromosomes with your completed order in 9 months.” What?! I was mad! All the other orders I had seen displayed via perfect Instagram posts did NOT have extra chromosomes. Well I decided that receiving my order with extra chromosomes was better than not receiving an order at all, so I settled in to wait for this surprise upgrade to arrive. I have now had my order for two months and am writing this review to let others know the upgrade to extra chromosomes is amazing!! If offered, definitely take it! I posted some photos below of the finished product and you can see the extra chromosome is so worth it - it is extra cute, extra special, and extra-ordinary! So much extra joy. Would purchase again for sure 💛💙💛💙

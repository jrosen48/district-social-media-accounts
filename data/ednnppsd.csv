Look at the differences between a typical younger child‚Äôs hand (left) and a typical older child's hand (right). I have parents asking regularly why their preschool aged child isn‚Äôt able to write yet. This is why! Their hands (and brains) are still developing and are not fully formed. So what should they be doing to support this? PLAY!! Playdough, colouring, cutting, gluing, playing outside, digging in dirt, sensory play, dress up play, science experiments, beading, puzzles, throwing balls, etc. All of these things help their hands develop.

Look at the differences between a typical younger child‚Äôs hand (left) and a typical older child's hand (right). I have parents asking regularly why their preschool aged child isn‚Äôt able to write yet. This is why! Their hands (and brains) are still developing and are not fully formed. So what should they be doing to support this? PLAY!! Playdough, colouring, cutting, gluing, playing outside, digging in dirt, sensory play, dress up play, science experiments, beading, puzzles, throwing balls, etc. All of these things help their hands develop.

I ‚ù§Ô∏è puppets!

For young children who avert eye gaze during therapy sessions, holding a puppet next to my face is usually a game changer!

The puppet can point to pictures in books, or help put toys away, or watch my mouth when I say words.

In essence, the puppet becomes the model for the child üßíüèΩüë∂üèºüë¶üèª

I have a wide variety of puppets at my disposal. For kiddos with suspected CAS, I love using a cute oven mitt as a puppet. Why, you ask. Because an oven mitt is like a giant mouth and it shows jaw movement.

I also like adding puppets to story time to keep the young child‚Äôs focus and attention on me and the book. I have collected a variety of finger puppets to pair with different books.

During an international pandemic, it is important to add that puppets can be used effectively during Teletherapy sessions too!

Who else uses puppets to support play-based learning? Reply with a ‚ù§Ô∏è if you love puppets too!

If this class could teach you how to save money, how to make sure you never run out of money when you need it most, and how to prevent you, your family, and your friends from ever needing GoFundMe, would you attend?

If you answer yes, then join us for one of our upcoming Money 101 workshops, where financial education is free.

Here‚Äôs how I sound when playing with these toy vehicles:

Beep-beep

Vroooom

Crash!

Ready...set...go!

Go car!

Blue car, red car, green car

1 car, 2 cars, 3 cars

Drive the car

Push the car

Up the hill

Down the hill

Through the tunnel

Stop!

Go!

Go fast!

HOW: Bring your non perishable food items with you as you drive around the parking lot when the lights come on! The marching band trailer will be set up! Drive right over to the trailer and we will take your items from the car window! No need to exit your vehicle!

Yes I'm still on my soapbox about PLAY!

Redmond is our judgemental, opinionated, middle child who has ZERO interest in sitting and doing ""school stuff."" And to be honest, it would be developmentally INAPPROPRIATE to expect that of him.

Well here are a few of the language and learning concepts we ""worked"" on while building his ""vacuum cleaner"":

Size comparison- tall/taller/short/shorter/long/longer

Colors- red, yellow, blue

Descriptive vocabulary- fast/slow, round, rolling, push/pull, in/on/off, together/apart, same/match/different, broken/fixed

He had to problem solve a way to negotiate a trade with his brother to get the pieces he needed to make it ""roll right""

He had to PERSIST through several breaks (as you can see in the picture)

All the other orders I had seen displayed via perfect Instagram posts did NOT have extra chromosomes. Well I decided that receiving my order with extra chromosomes was better than not receiving an order at all, so I settled in to wait for this surprise upgrade to arrive. I have now had my order for two months and am writing this review to let others know the upgrade to extra chromosomes is amazing!! If offered, definitely take it! I posted some photos below of the finished product and you can see the extra chromosome is so worth it - it is extra cute, extra special, and extra-ordinary! So much extra joy.

MC RAFFLE UPDATE
Due to the cancellation of the home football game this Friday, we have had to adjust our plans for the Inaugural MC Raffle drawing.

We will be drawing the winning tickets in a FB live event on Friday evening at 6:00pm. From there, we will post the winners on the Booster Club page as well as reach out to them individually.

If you are unable to watch the live event, it will be posted here to view after the drawing.

Thanks for your patience on the changes - especially since COVID has forced us to change direction a couple different times. Thank you all for your continued support and best of luck to everyone!

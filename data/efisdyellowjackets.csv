Dinosaur George was able to identify that it was a part of a triceratops jaw! Dinosaur George said Caden could trade places with him and teach the class, which really tickled him. 😉 Caden prepped for the zoom by getting all his ceratopsian toys and a few of his fossils all around him to show Dinosaur George.

BRANDON BOTELLO
Brandon ""Nunu"" Botello is one of the most likable students that the sixth-grade team teachers have ever had the pleasure to educate. Not only does he know how to tackle the obstacles on the football field, but he flattens them in the classroom as well. Brandon is very charismatic in his peer relationships and is a natural born leader. He has shown much progress throughout this school year and in his new challenge of remote learning. Brandon definitely deserves the EFMS 6th grade student of the week award . He has more than earned it! This is a ""Super Bowl"" moment, Nunu! Congratulations!

Hi everyone!!!

I hope and pray that you all are well and enjoying the time we have been given to spend with our families. I’ve loved seeing everyone’s posts on Facebook and all the different ways our students continue to learn and grow. The smiles and joy on their sweet faces makes my heart happy.
Our wonderful parents are doing an awesome job of working with their kids! So many are helping with the homework packets and then extending the learning into every day lessons. There are so many precious memories being made during this time! Our fabulous teachers have gone above and beyond what we have asked them to do. They are true superheroes! I cannot be any prouder of them! Sometimes we go through situations and we can’t understand why until after we are clear and able to look back. I believe God has a reason for this and one day we will be able to look back and say “Thank you, God.” Until then, just know that I love you all and miss you SO much!!

Dear Students,

Do you remember when Mr. Buddy Ritter visited our district earlier this year? I do! When he came, he shared with us his incredible life story. It was filled with determination and one powerful word. HOPE!

Despite how things are, I encourage you to keep believing and to know you are loved. You have touched the lives of your teachers and make them who they are. Since school has been closed, they have been lost and that is because they do not have you. They miss your laughter, smiles, and antics.

They cannot wait to be reunited with you and neither can I. You make us all complete and happy.

While you are at home though, have as much fun as you possibly can. Sing, dance, be silly, paint, draw, laugh out loud, and most importantly be a kid.

Love always,
Monica Simmons, EFISD Curriculum Director

""I want to thank the school so much for the meals delivered by the buses. My grandchildren have looked forward to and enjoyed them so much. They had all sorts of things that we didn't have at our house. They both went through their bags like they were Easter baskets. I also want to thank the teachers for the homework. Àt least for a few hours life is almost normal."" - Francis Brown

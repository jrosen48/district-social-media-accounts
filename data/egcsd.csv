HELP US TO CELEBRATE OUR SENIOR CLASS

The Education Foundation is helping the District celebrate the Senior Class of 2020. These students will not have a traditional graduation, and we are committed to help create new and special memories.

In early June, we will be placing a sign in the front yard of every senior. East Greenbush school buses will transport us through the district as we decorate our towns to celebrate the Class of 2020. In addition to the yard signs, we will leave a small token for every graduate.

We are happy to accept community donations to help us with this celebration. Please make checks payable to the East Greenbush Education Foundation and mail them to:

This means students will have no school through Friday, March 27.

The district had intended on holding a regular school day tomorrow so students could pick up learning materials, digital devices and other personal items, and have one last opportunity to connect with teachers and staff before the break.

While there are still no confirmed cases in our schools, Superintendent Jeff Simons felt this was the best course of action to put our students, staff and families at ease during this situation.

Parents may pick up any materials this week by calling their school and making an appointment to stop by on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.

The district will continue to provide updates regarding this school break in the coming days. Thank you for your support of our schools and your flexibility during this extraordinary situation.

The intent of participating in this program is to encourage the study of languages in high school, to prepare students with competitive skills in an increasingly globalized society and to set them apart from other applicants when applying to colleges and jobs.

“This is another opportunity for our district’s students that we serve,” said James McHugh, Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction. “Our students that earn the Seal of Biliteracy will receive an additional recognition at the time of their graduation. I applaud the work of our committee that created our district’s NYSSB plan which included the development of our Seal of Biliteracy Handbook that explains the student application process, timeline and requirements.”

Green Meadow Elementary School is currently without power due to an outage in the area. National Grid is working on the situation and has estimated the power will be back on by 2:30 p.m. Because the temperature inside the school is still comfortable (70 degrees), there is running water in the building and all lunches have been served, the school will remain open and dismiss at its regular time.

Should the power not come on by dismissal, students who normally attend GCC after school will be transported by school bus under the supervision of GCC staff to Goff Middle School. GCC will be contacting parents with updates this afternoon.

Green Meadow phone lines are still in operation should parents need to contact the school.

Power Outage at Green Meadow, School Will Dismiss at Regular Time | East Greenbush CSD",34.0,"ORIGINAL MESSAGE - 1:37 p.m.
Green Meadow Elementary School is currently without power due to an outage in the area. National Grid is working on the situation and has estimated the power will be back on by 2:30 p.m. Because the temperature inside the school is still comfortable (70 degrees), there is running water in the building and all lunches have been served, the school will remain open and dismiss at its regular time.

Should the power not come on by dismissal, students who normally attend GCC after school will be transported by school bus under the supervision of GCC staff to Goff Middle School. GCC will be contacting parents with updates this afternoon.

Green Meadow phone lines are still in operation should parents need to contact the school.

Seventh grade students of English Teacher Jessica Delaney have been studying narrative point of view and perspective. They applied their skills by writing their own “two-voice poems.”

“Two voice poetry is performed out loud with some lines spoken by each speaker individually and some lines spoken in unison. Seventh graders were able to choose their own topics and decided how to format their poems to make the two voices clear.”

This album includes poems from Joey Mastrantonio, Garrett Davis, Mayla Falank, Liliana Palmer, Talon LaPlante, Kaleb Podoliak, and one student that wished to remain anonymous but did not mind their poem being shared.

This week we mark Teacher Appreciation Week and safe to say, this year it is unlike any other.

Our teachers are facing unprecedented challenges and, here in the Heights, they have answered the call, finding new and imaginative ways to engage with students and continue to touch their lives despite the distance we are forced to maintain.

We would be remiss if we didn’t also recognize all the others; parents, grandparents, guardians, siblings, everyone who find themselves in the role of teachers, or teachers helpers, in these unprecedented times.

The African Proverb says “It takes a village to raise a child” and here in Elmira Heights we try to live by those words, now more than ever.

Thank you all! You are truly appreciated for everything you do #FortheHeights

Fifth grader Paytn Sincock, a student of Jessica Grant, and her mom made 20 facemasks and donated them to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Arnot Ogden Medical Center. “Her letter to the NICU Department brought tears to my eyes,” Mrs. Grant said.

Dear Arnot NICU:

10 years ago you cared for me when I was born at 28 weeks. My Mom saw that NICU nurses were in need of face masks, so my mom and I went to work on making them. We wanted to help out because all of the nurses took excellent care of me when I was born. Thank you for all that you did for me and what you are doing now. I hope these masks will help you all out.

Love, Paytn Ann Sincock

Good morning: We, as a whole family, wanted to take the time to thank you for bringing us our learning packets and food for us to have a full stomach while we all go through this hard time.

We know that no words could ever explain how grateful we are to have you as a principal and the team of staff that cares deeply for all of us.

We pray that the Lord continue to protect you and the staff from all harm and any sickness. May he always make sure you all have any and everything you guys ever need or wanted for going the extra mile for not only the students but all the families in your whole district.

Thank you sooooo much.

In addition to pre-packaged breakfasts and lunches prepared by the District cafeteria staff, members of the Police and Fire Department’s presented each child with an Easter basket.

For families not able to get to the distribution sites at Cohen Elementary School and the Elmira Heights Village Hall, District administrators and staff made home deliveries and also distributed emergency food boxes provided by the Food Bank of the Southern Tier for families who need additional help.

Regents exams are going to be cancelled as well. Official word and details are expected tomorrow. We do not have any more details then that - but our kids still need to continue working as we will likely have a local final exam in all of those classes originally tied to a Regents.

All students have been given access to, or have been able to have academic packets made available, as a part of our Phase II of learning while on closure. If your student says they haven't gotten any work please contact your student's school. It is available and students are expected to be working! Phase II work has been pushed out over the last few days!

Stay strong and healthy everyone!

Dear Friends,
I’ve missed you sooooooo much since we have been out of school! I know once it is safe, we will all be back together again! I can’t wait. I thought you might like to see what I do in my den during the day. Please watch the video of me!!! As you are watching, see if you can find all the ways I follow the Cohen Cougar Code when I am at home. Also, look and see how my friends are practicing social distancing. Now that’s a very safe thing to do. Until next time..... I miss you!!!!!

Our residents have enjoyed #gramsforgrands so much they have decided to return the favor! 💕The 3rd grade class from EHS has blessed the EP residents all year. Prior to #COVID19, they visited monthly to read 📚 books, bake cookies 🍪, and play BINGO together! Now they will be getting some mail back 💌! Hopefully this is the beginning of a long pen pal relationship! #bridgingthegenerationalgap ￼",2020-05-04 18:07:58,,

Ellendale Public School will be closed Monday, March 16th - Friday, March 20th. The closure was ordered by North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum in response to the Coronavirus pandemic.

Gov. Doug Burgum announced the closures in a press conference earlier tonight. See the full press conference here (https://www.facebook.com/ndhealth/videos/562636674345087/)

Burgum said, ""The strategy around the school closing is to reduce the rate of infection to allow us to have a week to plan, not just for how we deliver school services, but for us to plan to make sure that our health care system can take care of those that are most vulnerable.""

More information will be released as it becomes available.

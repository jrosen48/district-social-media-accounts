Keegan started at Essexville-Hampton Public Schools in the 6th grade at Cramer Junior High School, after attending St. John's Pre-K through 5th grade!

Throughout his academic career, Keegan played Football 🏈 (4 years), Track 👟 (3 years) and Basketball 🏀 (2 years). Garber Athletic Association - GAA

Mrs. Dawn Bromberg has greatly influenced Keegan. She taught him knowledge that he felt he could put to use and her style of teaching kept him engaged.

Keegan's advice to underclassmen would be to not take any high school privilege for granted because you never know when those privileges can be taken away.

One of Keegan's many favorite memories at Garber was making it to the State Track and Field finals in 2019. He competed in the 4 x 200 and 4 x 400 meter relays. 🎉

After graduation, Keegan will attend Delta College and then transfer to a 4 year university to pursue a career in Sales/Marketing.

Throughout her academic career at Essexville-Hampton Public Schools, Alexa loved playing volleyball 🏐. Unfortunately, due to an injury, she had to quit.

Attending the Bay-Arenac ISD Career Center for two years, she found her new passion for HealthCare. After Junior Year, Alexa had obtained her CNA through the Career Center and has been working part-time since. Alexa is also dual-enrolled through Delta College and has an excellent 'jump start' on her pre-requisite coursework. It's easy to see that Alexa is a goal-oriented young woman with an outstanding work ethic. 💙

After graduation, Alexa will attend Delta College to work towards her career goal of becoming a Nurse Practitioner.

Dakota has over come many many obstacles in his life and has learned to be a fighter at a young age.

Throughout his academic career, Dakota has played some sports (Basketball & Wrestling) but it just wasn't for him! His true 'loves' in life are Hunting 🦌, Fishing 🎣, Air Soft and Paintball.

This young man is a very kind and caring person, and he will always be there to help-you can ALWAYS count on Dakota! Friends mean a lot to him, and he cherishes every one he has.

Dakota has volunteered for Camp Quality Michigan as a Camp Companion. This camp is held for Kids with Cancer, and he has attended as a camper for several years. Dakota knew that he could give back to kids going though the same thing he did. 🎗💜

After graduation, Dakota will attend Delta College to begin with his basics and decide which career pathway he would like to pursue afterwards: Small Engine Repair or Law Enforcement.

In January, we had begun to honor each child in our school family by honoring children as School Family Members of the Week.

Upon school being cancelled, there were still 94 children to be honored as such. We wanted to find a way to be sure that each child in our school family is recognized before the year is done.

We did the math and found that we can still honor the 94 remaining children by honoring 4-5 students per day as our School Family Members of the Day. Their photos and All About Me Banners will be posted here daily and in our Bush School Parent group. Mrs. Schingeck will also announce and celebrate School Family Members of the Day on her 11:00 Live Character Education/Music Lesson right here on Facebook Live.

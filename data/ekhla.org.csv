As we are getting our distance learning more under way, our office hours will now be only on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday from 10a-2p. Phone calls will be answered during these times and if any additional technology needs arise, these will be the hours when parents can pick up devices once appointments are set with Ms. Campbell via tech@ekhla.org.

Voicemails and emails will continue to be monitored by administration and office staff from off campus. Please let us know if you have any needs. We're all here to help!

In order to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, EKHLA will be reaching out to you via email over the next two weeks to share vitally important guidance.

This guidance is based on what scientists know about how to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and it is our hope that you will continue doing all you can to follow these practices and share them with your friends and family.

Thank you for what you are doing to educate your children at home and all the efforts you’re making to keep your family healthy and safe. We know this is a difficult time. If we stand apart as a community during this stretch and continue following the public health practices we will be sharing over the coming days, we will be back together soon.

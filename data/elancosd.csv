Since the ELANCO School District buildings have closed, our amazing food service department has served over 60,000 meals to community families. They are outside serving nutritious food to our families every Tuesday from 10am-1pm at GSHS. Please help us HONOR and CELEBRATE them!

A special thank you to our local community business’: Grocery Outlet for donating grocery bags, Yoder's Country Market New Holland for letting us borrow shopping carts, B & G Paper Products for all those last minute disposables we need and CrossNet Ministries for their continued partnership!",2020-05-01 09:52:14,,

We are now accepting nominations for the 4th Annual ""Bee Impactful"" Teacher Award!

This award is to honor teachers that go above and beyond to have a tremendous impact on their students. One teacher will be selected by a committee from the pool of nominations and will receive a $2,500 award.

Students, alumni, parents and ELANCO staff can nominate a deserving teacher. To submit a nomination, please complete the online form at http://www.beeimpactful.com.

A teacher's impact each day goes beyond the classroom. They help shape who our students will become and the impact they each will have on this world. We can't thank them enough for all that they do. We are excited to again offer this opportunity to recognize our great teachers.

Deadline to submit a nomination is May 1, 2019.

Congratulations again to Chris Epler and Angela Landis and Julie Groft, our previous Bee Impactful winners!

“You took me to ancient Egypt and I was spellbound. Kudos!” 🌟 “Your students are to be commended for the emotion they portrayed. I was moved to tears not just once or twice but repeatedly!” 🌟 “The diversity on that stage is inspiring. We left last night feeling so proud to be part of this district!!” 🌟 “That was the most beautiful show I’ve seen at GS.”

Just two more chances to catch this heart-wrenching performance:

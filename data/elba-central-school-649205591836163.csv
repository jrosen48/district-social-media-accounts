Next, I wanted to let you know that the New York State Public High School Athletic Association has delayed the start of fall sports and has cancelled the fall championships.

In an effort to keep our students' food safe, we will be changing our food delivery dates and pick up window starting this Thursday due to the rising summer temperatures. We will no longer be serving on Mondays. Students will be getting three breakfasts and lunches on Thursdays and two on Tuesdays. If you are picking meals up, we will be at the north door from 10:00-11:00 a.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays only. If meals are being delivered on Tuesdays and Thursdays, we are asking that a cooler be placed outside your door to keep the food cold. Our goal is to make sure that all meals do not pose a risk to our students during the summer temperatures.

Stay safe!

Many communities have been participating in the “Adopt A Senior” activity; this allows community members the opportunity to celebrate a graduating senior who might be sad over missing their typical senior year celebrations. It is a way to lift their spirits! This might look like a small care package of their favorite snacks, a special t-shirt, or a fun sign. The possibilities are endless!

We would like to determine if there is interest in our Lancer community. Please email HS principal Gretchen Rosales at grosales@elbacsd.org or HS counselor Alison Riner at ariner@elbacsd.org if you are interested in “adopting” a senior. Once we have a list, we will coordinate with those interested.

I wanted to communicate a change for all of our students and families with regard to our meal distribution program. Starting Monday, we will be serving Monday through Friday. All families are welcome to come to school for a “grab and go” breakfast and lunch every day next week. We are also continuing to deliver as well. There is no cost to families. Please come to the North entrance during the hours of 10:00 in the morning until 12:00. Students will get their breakfast and lunch daily.

We have finished a deep clean of the building. Only essential staff will be on campus for specific reasons. We have made every accommodation for individuals to work from home given the ongoing health crisis. Feel free to leave messages or send emails and they will be returned. Our campus is closed until further notice and this includes both gyms, weightrooms or other large gathering spaces.

Once again, we thank you for your support and will continue to communicate as much as possible.

I wanted to communicate a change for all of our students and families with regard to our meal distribution program. Starting Monday, we will be serving Monday through Friday. All families are welcome to come to school for a “grab and go” breakfast and lunch every day next week. We are also continuing to deliver as well. There is no cost to families. Please come to the North entrance during the hours of 10:00 in the morning until 12:00. Students will get their breakfast and lunch daily.

We have finished a deep clean of the building. Only essential staff will be on campus for specific reasons. We have made every accommodation for individuals to work from home given the ongoing health crisis. Feel free to leave messages or send emails and they will be returned. Our campus is closed until further notice and this includes both gyms, weightrooms or other large gathering spaces.

Once again, we thank you for your support and will continue to communicate as much as possible.

I am writing to let you know that we distributed almost 70 breakfast and lunch meals today and we are ready for tomorrow. All Elba students age 3-18 may get the meals for free. If you need meals delivered, we will deliver. Please call 585-757-9967 Ext 1010. We have updated the front page of our website to provide additional learning resources for everyone to see and access.

It is with an abundance of caution and guidance from the County Health Director that we cancel this year's musical production of Lion King Junior. During our shows, we would anticipate approximately 250 or more in attendance. Specifically, I have the greatest concerns for grandparents and community members that might be more susceptible to the Coronavirus. We are discussing the possibility of having the cast and crew perform at this year's May concert as a showcase, pending clarification from our licensing agent. Please know that this decision was not taken lightly and was done in collaboration with the best information that we have at this very time. Tickets purchased can be refunded at district office.

Today was a great day! It was so fun seeing all of the kids and their excitement to be back in school. With all of the pieces that went well today, we are aware of the challenges that our pickup/drop-off procedure presented today. We are going to make the following changes starting immediately:

1. Buses will stay on the elementary side for both pickup and drop-off. Middle school bus kids will exit the bus in the morning and walk to the middle school. At dismissal, middle school bus kids will walk to the elementary side to get on the bus.

2. With buses staying at the elementary side, the middle school bus lane will now be an additional pickup lane for parents. This will help the congestion on Hesper and 64th.

3. If you are picking up students from both the elementary and middle school, please consider parking at the elementary and having your middle school student walk across to the elementary side.

Dear Elder Grove Families,

After five years as your elementary school counselor, I have decided to pursue the opportunity of being a stay at home mom to our bundle of joy expected in early July. I have been blessed with the greatest opportunity to have been part of such an amazing school, and to have had the privilege of helping guide the students of Elder Grove. It has been a genuine pleasure serving your kids as their school counselor. Thank you for your support of the elementary school counseling program, welcoming me to Elder Grove five years ago, and trusting me with your kiddos.

Although saying goodbye is bittersweet, I am looking forward to the next adventure! I also look forward to the great things to come at Elder Grove School, and plan to help with the transition of the new school counselor.

Thank you, again, from the bottom of my heart!

Have a safe and fun summer!

It is that time of year...cold and flu season! We have had confirmed cases of both strep and influenza here at school. If your child has a fever, please do not send your child to school; please make an appointment to have your child seen by a provider. You and your provider can then make an informed decision whether or not to test for influenza. Antivirals such as Tamiflu and Relenza are most effective when given within 48 hours of symptom onset, so time is of the essence. Students should not return to school until they are fever free for 24 hours without the help of a fever reducer (Tylenol, Ibuprofen, etc), regardless of the diagnosis. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. You can email me at nurse@eldergrove.k12.mt.us or call 656-2893 ext 120. Thank you!

Each parent also received a kindle with math applications to further their skills. We held a reception for them as well. Congratulations!",0.0,"Elementary School District 159 Community

Too often we take for granted how fortunate we are. Among other things, we're very fortunate to have been born in this country, which gives us opportunities and freedoms that people in other countries do not have the privilege of enjoying. Memorial Day and Veterans Day serve as reminders and is only ours because of the many brave people who give of and have given their lives to defend our country.

On behalf of the Board of Education and Superintendent of Elementary School District 159, we would like to honor all those who made the ultimate sacrifice by celebrating them, appreciating our freedoms and esteeming all Veterans and active military personnel. We salute you and give great recognition to all you have done.

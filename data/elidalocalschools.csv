What has NOT changed is the enthusiasm and commitment of the Elida students, parents, directors, and school administration to bring this show to life as soon as we have the “green light”.
The dream lives on! The next projected performance run for the show is planned for the first or second weekend of August. If we are still unable to open in August, the show will be moved into the fall scheduling. We hope to still include all graduating Seniors who were originally part of the show. As soon as we have confirmed dates we will exchange tickets for all those still holding tickets from the earlier scheduled performance run. If you are unable to attend the show at its future time, please contact Rhonda Bargerstock in August and we will refund your ticket purchase.

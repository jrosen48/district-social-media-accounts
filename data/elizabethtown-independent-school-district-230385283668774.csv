Look what was installed today!!!!

“Panther Pages” is officially ready and registered as an official local lending library. There will be more books added - and you can always share your own.

Also, Mrs. Hayes left 20 little treat bags for the first “bookworms” who stop by for a book! 🐛 📚

Panther Pages Lending Library was an initiative of the Hayes family to honor Mrs. Hayes’ late mother, Suzanne Dennis, who was a lover of books and advocate of reading. Thank you Hayes family (especially Mr. Jason) for this amazing gift to our community.

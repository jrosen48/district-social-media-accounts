Our Technology Services Department is currently receiving a high volume of support calls related to Canvas and Seesaw, and specifically parents who are unable to connect their child's Canvas or Seesaw account to their classroom. Please know that it can take 24-48 hours for the PowerSchool management system to transfer rosters (lists of students in a class) into the Canvas and Seesaw learning platforms. Until rostering is complete, your child may not appear to be enrolled in the Canvas/Seesaw class.

If you are trying to connect your child to their class in Canvas and Seesaw, this is likely the issue. Please hold off on calling Tech Support for 24-48 hours about this specific issue while our systems process the roster changes.

Mary Feeser / 11-12
Monger / 9-10
Pinewood / 11-12

Kim has been a teacher at Riverview for six years and a teacher for a total of 24 years.

Kim remembers growing up and loving to write on the chalkboard, which prompted her interest in becoming a teacher. She had a brother who was 9 years younger than her and loved to teach him and his friends.

There have been many special little moments with her students that Kim treasures dearly. It’s those small everyday interactions with her students that she loves the most.

Outside of the classroom, Kim loves going on road trips with her family, playing on the lake in the summer, and spending time with her three amazing children. She is a huge Duke basketball fan, a Chicago Cubs fan, and proudly completed the 2010 Chicago Marathon without walking.

Tracy has been a teacher at Mary Daly ever since she did her student teaching at the school in 1989.

Growing up, Tracy’s mom was a teacher and the church they attended was full of teachers. Tracy liked children and always felt like teachers were good people, so she decided to become an educator. She continues to be inspired every day by her students, saying they help shape them as teachers as much as teachers help shape them as learners. She loves the look of surprise on her former students’ faces when they return for a visit.

Tracy has 2 children, a miniature dachshund, and has been married for 28 years. Outside of the classroom, she enjoys reading, finding new places to shop, watching her son’s swim meets, and loves to travel. She says if she wasn’t a teacher, she would be a professional shopper. :)

We are proud of your academic accomplishments. We are proud of your resilience and grace in these unprecedented times.

We are missing being at Nicholson Pavilion at 8 pm tonight, in a sea of blue. We are missing the pomp and circumstance of the ceremony we host in your honor. Tonight, we are missing you.

No matter where we are, we are so proud you are Bulldogs. While it hasn't been the journey we wanted, we are proud to celebrate you over and over, Class of 2020.

Dear Seniors in the Class of 2020- While we aren't getting to celebrate your graduation in the way we planned just a few short months ago, we still want you to know we couldn't be more proud of you. We are proud of your academic accomplishments. We are proud of your resilience and grace in these unprecedented times.

We are missing being at Nicholson Pavilion at 8 pm tonight, in a sea of blue. We are missing the pomp and circumstance of the ceremony we host in your honor. Tonight, we are missing you.

No matter where we are, we are so proud you are Bulldogs. While it hasn't been the journey we wanted, we are proud to celebrate you over and over, Class of 2020.

Sincerely,

Our list of heroes is long...
From our cooks who get here before dawn,
To the helpers who pack hundreds of bags each day,
To the group who load our buses,
To the bus drivers who transport the meals to our sites,
To the servers who greet you with smiles (behind their masks),
To the custodians who keep our kitchens clean...
We could not do this without them. Thank you!

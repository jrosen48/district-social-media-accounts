Our physical schools are closed, but we know that the learning hasn’t stopped! We realize that transitioning from the classroom to online learning at home has not been an easy task, but we’d love to celebrate our students’ academic efforts. If you have a photo of your child (Grades K-12) working and learning at home, we invite you to send it to the Ellenville Central District Facebook page via Facebook Messenger. Please only send us photos of your own children—by sending them to us you are giving us permission to publish them. We’re proud of our students—and of the parents, guardians, and teachers who are helping them to continue their education during this difficult time. Keep up the good work! The deadline for photos is April 30.",2020-04-17 10:13:25,,

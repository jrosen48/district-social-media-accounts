However, for record keeping purposes and to make things easier for parents, if your child is interested in attending the Little Lancers Preschool program at ECS during the 2020/21 school year please complete this short survey and someone from the ECS team will contact you regarding next steps.

Due to the closure of school buildings we have had to cancel our regular ""Kindergarten Roundup."" For the time being we are asking all potential members of the upcoming ECS Kindergarten class to complete this short survey and a member of the ECS team will contact you to discuss enrollment.

We still hope to have a face-to-face event later this spring/summer, however that is very much dependent on forces outside of our control.

In the meantime, we'd love to start to get to know our future Lancers and get you started on the enrollment process.

Ellsworth Community School",11.0,"Calling All Future Lancers!

Due to the closure of school buildings we have had to cancel our regular ""Kindergarten Roundup."" For the time being we are asking all potential members of the upcoming ECS Kindergarten class to complete this short survey and a member of the ECS team will contact you to discuss enrollment.

We still hope to have a face-to-face event later this spring/summer, however that is very much dependent on forces outside of our control.

In the meantime, we'd love to start to get to know our future Lancers and get you started on the enrollment process.

Good afternoon. As we are midway through the second week of what is now a four-week school shutdown, I'm sure that you have many questions.

• When will school restart?
• Will we come back at all this year?
• Will the school year be extended?
• What about graduation?
• Will students be asked to work from home?

The ECS staff, and all districts throughout the State of Michigan, have many of the same questions. Unfortunately as of this moment there are no answers. As a local school district we are planning for many different possible scenarios, however without concrete answers from Lansing we are unable to effectively plan for the future.

Each spring Ellsworth Community School takes time to highlight each of our graduating seniors in a series of posts called ""Senior Spotlights."" Even in these uncertain times we want to make sure that we recognize and applaud our graduating seniors of all of their hard work and accomplishments.

In this first post we would like to recognize ECS seniors Bill Stevens and Said Esch-Laurent. Congratulations!",2020-03-18 16:16:15,,

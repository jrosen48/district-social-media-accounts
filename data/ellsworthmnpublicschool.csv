Students & Parents!

Within Google Classroom, teachers post due dates of assignments, announcments, zoom meetings, etc. Google Classroom will automatically set a reminder/task on your Google Calendar! You can sync your google calendar up with your cell phone and have it open on your chromebook. When the program is open, you will recieve a reminder notifcation of the upcoming due date, zoom call, etc! You can also create a ""to do list"" and edit it to best fit your needs.

In my adult life, I put almost everything on my Google Calendar- things like when pay day is, what bills are due when, when I have a family event, doctor appointment, second job duties, etc.

You can create a to do list within your Google Calendar, check out this video to figure out how! https://youtu.be/Gj4HG3gry58

Sarah is the daughter of Robert and Daniela.
She celebrates her birthday on February 24th.
The classes she’s taking this year include Medical Terminology, Composition, Economics, and Intro to Microcomputer with Medical Terminology being her favorite.
Sarah’s favorite food is cinnamon bread and her favorite color is army green.
Her favorite teachers would be Mr. Jarvie or Mr. Wischnak.
A favorite high school memory of Sarah’s is hanging out with Kaitlyn and Julia in Mr. Jarvie’s Room.
A favorite memory from elementary is playing 4 square in Luverne, and in Ellsworth, playing football or mat ball with the boys.
If she were to change anything about herself, it would be that she had better self-confidence. Sarah works at the Mary Jane Brown Home in Luverne and the best part about her job is making her residents smile.

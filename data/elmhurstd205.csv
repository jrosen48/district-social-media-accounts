This afternoon, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker announced a decision to extend statewide school closures and the “Stay at Home” order until April 30, 2020.

The extension follows updated guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and an announcement from the White House extending physical distancing guidelines until April 30, 2020.

D205 Superintendent Dr. David Moyer is examining the decision and will share how this impacts district-wide plans beyond our current closure as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience and understanding!",2020-03-31 16:00:34,,

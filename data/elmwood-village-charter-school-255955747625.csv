EVCS thanks Nurse Dana and Nurse Tracy for our successful facemask campaign. Facemasks may help limit exposure where social distancing might be an obstacle.

So many EVCS families at both campuses offered monetary help or donations of fabric and sewing supplies and our sewing volunteers made hundreds of masks. We have distributed almost 500 masks in total and will end up with enough masks to offer to our staff and their families if they are in need.

Here is our predicted route map for tomorrow:

- All streets NORTH OF HERTEL between Elmwood and Main Street

- Some streets in the UNIVERSITY DISTRICT - those that are WEST Of Main Street and just NORTH of Kenmore Avenue

We hope this helps in knowing if this will be your day (YET). We will see how far we get tomorrow and send out updated routes daily.

Thank you all for coming out to see us. Seeing your faces makes us so grateful for the very special school community we have. It has been such a gift to see all of you - and not from behind a computer screen. We love you all, live and in person!

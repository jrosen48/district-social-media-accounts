Dear Stokes School Community,

We are working to maintain a safe, healthy environment within our school community. We reiterate daily with staff and scholars the importance of:
• proper hand washing;
• avoiding touching eyes, noses and mouths;
• sneezing/coughing in elbows or tissue; and
• staying at home when we are ill.
Additionally, our cleaning company follows CDC recommendations for cleaning and disinfecting our buildings.

Despite these steps, there may still be a Coronavirus outbreak in Washington, DC. We are preparing for the possibility that the DC government may close the schools.

As we plan, we are working to ensure that staff has remote access to work and that scholars have access to learning. We ask that you complete the brief survey sent through the listserv about your children's access to technology at home.

To have adequate time to prepare, we ask that families submit responses by 5:00 pm on Tuesday, March 9th. Please feel free to reach out to any school administrator if you have questions.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2800174723411253&id=1782823228479746,,0.0,"Preparing for a Potential Coronavirus Outbreak

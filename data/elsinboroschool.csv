We exercised enough miles as a school over the last two weeks that we made it to both Disney World AND Disneyland! 3,491 total miles! Wow! We almost didn't get there yesterday, but just made it with a couple of late entries logged in. Great job everyone!
Hopefully, everyone has enjoyed getting out with their families and taking extra walks, bike rides, and runs and we keep this great health habit up. The more we exercise, the better we feel and the healthier we are!

[4K] Front Row - Tower of Terror Ride at Walt Disney World - Disney's Hollywood Studios",0.0,"Wow! We are really moving!

Today check out the Tower of Terror- Mrs. Boyle's favorite ride! The plot of The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror follows the tragic night of Oct. 31, 1939, when lightning struck the building. Five people were aboard an elevator as the building was struck, causing the elevator to free-fall. The Hollywood closed following these events, but has reopened, allowing new guests to experience these haunting events. Hold on tight!

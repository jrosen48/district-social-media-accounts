ONE FINAL LOOK AT ELY SCHOOL BEFORE DEMOLITION BEGINS

The signs at Gulf Road & Ohio Street say they “new” Ely School will open in August 2020, while the “old” Ely School sits behind demolition equipment as if to ask, “has the Governor called yet?”

Who all attended the old Ely School? Will you miss it or miss seeing it as you drive by?

Out with the old, in with the new. Progress.

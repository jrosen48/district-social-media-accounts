Prevention can feel boring because we can’t know if the worst could have happened if we were not being proactive, but seeing our community stay healthy tells me it is worth the effort.

Ms. Anderson’s Pathways class will be selling dinner this Wednesday, February 19th at the girl‘s home middle school basketball game. The first game starts at 5:30. Dinner is $5 and includes lasagna, potato salad, soup and Devoney’s yummy fudge. We will have drinks provided too.
The proceeds go towards the making of the bottle cap bench we have been collecting for all school year.

Hope to see you Wednesday night! Go Eels!",2020-09-13 10:14:20.695748,,

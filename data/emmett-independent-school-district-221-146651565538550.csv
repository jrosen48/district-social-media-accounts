Kindergarten registration is going on now. Parents please pick up an enrollment packet and return the completed forms as soon as possible. When you bring the completed forms back please bring your child's birth certificate, updated immunizations, and a proof of residency and the office staff will make copies at that time. Registration will close on June 12th and not reopen again until August 5th. It would be extremely helpful to us if the registration forms are completed before June 12th so we can compile class loads for the 20-21 school year.

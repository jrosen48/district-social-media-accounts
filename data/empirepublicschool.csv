As many of you know our school is experiencing several cases of flu/strep/stomach viruses.

By doing this we are hoping our custodial staff can disinfect more effectively and it will also give our students/staff an extra day to get healthy.

We do apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but we do put our student's health and safety as our number one concern. Thank you for understanding and we hope everyone stays healthy.

Upon returning to school please make sure you do not send your child/children back until they have been fever free without fever reducing medicine for 24 hours to prevent this further.

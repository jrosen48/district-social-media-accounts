To open businesses and to keep them open, we MUST slow the rate of infection across the state.

With that in mind, today we’re announcing an expanded statewide policy requiring customers to wear a mask when interacting with staff at a bar or restaurant.

This new requirement asks a little bit more of our residents dining out in order to protect their health and safety and that of our frontline hospitality workers, as well.

Restauranteurs and bar owners want to remain open for business, and this new requirement will help keep people safe while moving the economy forward – that’s a goal we all believe in.

After careful review and consideration, the district leadership team is recommending to the Board of Education that we slow the start of in-person school at the beginning of the year through the end of the first quarter.

Parents should know that “at home” learning will look much different than it looked in the spring as students will be required to attend class following their class schedule during their school day; students will earn grades as they would in a traditional classroom setting; students will be able to be on campus if they choose at times during “at home” learning; and the schools will hold in-person orientations for each grade level in the first few weeks of school to help students transition to this very different school year and learning environment.

There is a detailed plan available that shares key information and answers many parent questions: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xu6EhJu2K4THxzlHxFcXd0LpPuNi9OKZLaZcBdUbX0A/edit?usp=sharing",0.0,"Maine East families: news you can use.

That means for meal distribution at OK & PEC and then when we return to in-person learning, all students will be able to come through the lunch line and receive free meals.

No paperwork needed, and no checking out at the point of service with pin numbers or IDs (we will simply bee tallying student meals). This will allow us to provide the safest and contact-free meal service possible. It will also help speed up the lunch line, which I know has been a concern. I will send out more details about the meal service for reopening as we get closer.

It's tomato time at FarmLab! We're in peak harvest season, bringing in tomatoes from the field to become future pizza sauce. These tomatoes are picked at peak ripeness, and therefore peak sweetness and peak nutrition!

Conventional tomatoes top the Dirty Dozen Food list with some of the highest concentrations of pesticides. But here at FarmLab we grow everything small scale, by hand, and with local compost and organic fertilizer. We use zero pesticides or herbicides (organic or otherwise) because we rely on building healthy soil to grow healthy plants.

#repost from our friends at @leucadia101mainstreet ... Mark your calendar for LeucadiAID 2020 on Friday, June 26th: an at-home live concert event and fundraiser for Leucadia 101 🤍
Leucadia 101 Mainstreet relies on grants, income from events, and the generosity of the community in order to support local businesses and ensure the ongoing vitality of the 101 corridor in Leucadia. We’re not gonna lie to you: COVID-19 has eliminated opportunities for grants (for now) as municipalities grapple with their own challenges, and our beloved annual events like Taste of Leucadia, Summer Fun on the 101 and LeucadiART Walk will not be the same in 2020 as they have been in past years.
However, ever scrappy, we are bringing you a different way to celebrate the beginning of summer, support our local businesses, and enjoy some awesome summer tunes. Presenting LeucadiAID 2020: ""Keep Small Strong""
Swipe through for how to participate & a special thank you to @dwellsfargo for designing these event graphics for us on the fly 🙌🏽 #leucadiAID #keepsmallstrong @ Encinitas, California",0.0,"Paul Ecke Central is in Encinitas, California.

#repost from our friends at @leucadia101mainstreet ... Mark your calendar for LeucadiAID 2020 on Friday, June 26th: an at-home live concert event and fundraiser for Leucadia 101 🤍
Leucadia 101 Mainstreet relies on grants, income from events, and the generosity of the community in order to support local businesses and ensure the ongoing vitality of the 101 corridor in Leucadia. We’re not gonna lie to you: COVID-19 has eliminated opportunities for grants (for now) as municipalities grapple with their own challenges, and our beloved annual events like Taste of Leucadia, Summer Fun on the 101 and LeucadiART Walk will not be the same in 2020 as they have been in past years.
However, ever scrappy, we are bringing you a different way to celebrate the beginning of summer, support our local businesses, and enjoy some awesome summer tunes. Presenting LeucadiAID 2020: ""Keep Small Strong""
Swipe through for how to participate & a special thank you to @dwellsfargo for designing these event graphics for us on the fly 🙌🏽 #leucadiAID #keepsmallstrong @ Encinitas, California",2020-06-12 19:13:34,,

Hello LCH! I've heard there is a bit of confusion about the childcare situation for next school year after today's webinar. I'd like to clarify!

If we are in a position to need to implement the hybrid model next school year, we WILL be offering Aspire childcare for families on students' off-campus days. The childcare planning committee is working on developing plans and anticipates sending out a parent survey in the next week or two with information and collecting information.

I think the confusion might have come from the information about summer Aspire. Typically we have childcare through Aspire in the summer. However, because the health guidelines continue to keep schools closed at this time, we aren't offering any in-person programs this summer. Our EL Summer Academy and Extended School Year programs will be held via distance learning. And, we will not be offering summer Aspire childcare.

I am delighted to announce Amy Tuvo as LCH's Volunteer of the Year!

Amy is the person you want on your team, exemplifying what makes LCH so special! She has worn every possible hat - room parent, classroom volunteer, field trip driver, winter carnival, CRV recycling program, art show, book fair, jog-a-thon, kinder socials, strawberry sales, PTA board….the list goes on and on.

Amy steps in to help staff and families at a moment’s notice, just because she’s that kind of person. When you meet Amy you are instantly put at ease and simultaneously inspired because of her infectious personality and genuine spirit. Amy hasn’t missed a beat, continuing to support our school and our students, all the way through our school closures.

You can't bring them coffee, but you can show them how much you appreciate them by recording a video for the Fantastic Flipgrid Challenge!

Here's the updated directions:
Flipgrid is accessed on student ipads using student emails. Students should use the code OKConnect rather than their class code to access the Staff Appreciation grid. Parents cannot access the platform using personal emails, so you'll need to have your kids show you how it's done, and join them in leaving appreciative messages for our teachers and ALL staff members! We are hoping to be able to share a link with everyone afterwards so we can see all the appreciative messages. Now get recording and fill that Grid with your gratitude for the amazing teachers and staff of Ocean Knoll!!",0.0,"Ocean Knoll Elementary

Hey everyone, the 50th anniversary of Earth Day is coming up on April 22nd. And while we’re all hunkered down at home, I want to hear about the positive choices you’re making to help keep Mother Earth healthy like avoiding single-use plastic water bottles, composting and planting a garden, etc. We’re asking YOU to share your climate action at home to help inspire and educate each other during Earth month! To participate, share your ideas by posting a photo or video and TAG @robmachadofoundation and #climateactionathome. On #EarthDay, I’m going to pick my favorite submission and the WINNER will get a virtual phone hang with me!

I went again today to collect donations and distribution groceries (and gift cards) to families in need here in our community. The rain waited, fortunately, until families had come and gone. My heart aches and is warmed by both the need and the generosity in our community.

Grateful tears and sighs of relief came from parents, particularly with the receipt of the gift cards (thank you to EEF)! We distributed approximately 190 $50 gift cards (one per family) for basic needs today. Truly remarkable!

Diapers and basic food needs continue to be a huge need! If you would like to contribute, please let me know. We will continue to do this work each Monday and Wednesday for as long as we have donations and volunteers during this time of need.

Now, I’m home, drinking a cup of tea to warm up...about ready to dive into my email. I know how incredibly blessed I am though all of this. And I know that together we can take care of all of our community!",0.0,"La Costa Heights Principal

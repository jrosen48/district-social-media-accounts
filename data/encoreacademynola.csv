Together, they will help breakdown the history & definitions related to race/racial disparities and help caretakers find ways to discuss these inequalities with children. Tips for raising children in a more diverse & multi-cultural environment will also be discussed, and print & online resources provided.

Each week, in addition to daily online assignments, they connect with their class over Zoom to provide help, give feedback, and allow their students to see and connect with their fellow classmates.
They also send out an email newsletter each week shouting out students who have excelled at their online work, and include pictures the students send in of themselves at home- apparently everyone loves seeing photos of each other!

In case you haven’t checked it out yet, our 2nd grade teacher Ms. Amy has set up a youtube channel that parents and students will both love- she has been reading a chapter a week of “The Cricket in Times Square.” Parents- this could mean some extended vocal rest!

She has also been sending weekly newsletters out to her class, the Penguins, helping with our community meal service, posting sweet messages and activities to her instagram, and adding extra content to her Teachers Pay Teachers page! Link to her youtube is below, and her class mascot, Sir Waddles, is available on an as-needed basis for encouragement 😊
Thank you so much Ms. Amy, your students are lucky to have you!

Today, a big batch of our classroom Clorox wipes were taken over to help medical professionals at Ochsner- every little thing you can do makes a difference at this time. If you have any extra cleaning supplies, diapers and wipes, hand sanitizer, non-perishable food items, etc. we are actively redistributing to our families in need at this time. Please email our Student Support Lead Ms. King- sking@encorelearning.org

Not only does Ms. Ann provide ENCORE with vital Special Education Instruction, she also is an advocate for expanding our older students’ access to reading materials. She has transformed her section of the hall into a lending library for our upper grade levels. Her book selection caters to students’ interests, encouraging them to find something that they are genuinely engaged by. Along those same lines, she started an after-school anime club when she noticed how many kids were getting excited about those books. She loves connecting with her students over the books they like, and looks forward to finding the perfect book or series for each of her students!
Pay her a visit for a book, to check out her selection of inspirational posters, or just to let her know how much we appreciate her!

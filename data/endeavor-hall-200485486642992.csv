Meet after school in the art classroom 3:30-5:30pm. Classes may end as early as 5:00, so parents are welcome to come pick up earlier. Parents and friends are welcome to participate in the art activity. Go to the drawinc.org website to register. Walk-ins are welcome. D.R.A.W.

Tip of the Day",0.0,"Responsibility grows when the chores fit the child

Household chores encourage responsibility at school. To help your child get the most out of doing chores, make sure he has the skills and supplies he needs. Next, consider his energy level; if he's tired on school nights, assign weekend chores. Then, let him choose a chore from your list. Expect him to try hard and finish promptly, but don't require perfection. Be sure to thank him for helping the family!

If you don't have alphabet cookie cutters, let your child ""write"" letters on rolled-out dough. You can then cut around the letters with a knife.

Tip of the Day",0.0,"Increase communication with a round of Show and Tell

Show and Tell isn't just for school. It's a great way to encourage family conversations. Pick a night and choose a theme. Good topics include ""something I'm proud of,"" ""something I've made"" and ""one of my favorite memories."" Have family members take turns showing and telling. Your child will get a safe opportunity to practice public speaking, and you'll all learn more about one another.

When illness strikes, you may need to keep your child at home. It's important to make sure that she gets the care she needs. But don't make staying home such a treat that your child will want to miss more school. Instead of watching TV, read together. This is the perfect time to dive into a favorite longer book. If your child will be out for more than a day or two, ask her teacher how to get the work she's missing.

It isn't always easy for busy families to sit down to dinner together each day. Yet experts say that eating meals as a family is an important way for parents to keep the lines of communication open with their children. And when your child helps you prepare and clean up, too, you‚Äôll have even more time for some great conversation. So, if you can't eat dinner together, spend extra time over breakfast!

Here's a great way to encourage your child to write and have fun with him at the same time. Set a timer for six minutes. Then, until it rings, each of you write whatever comes into your head. Keep writing, even if it doesn't make sense. When the timer goes off, share what you each wrote. This technique is also great when your child has to write something and says, ""I can't think of anything to say.""

Young writers often have trouble thinking of words to write. Making a word bank helps your child think of words in advance. To help, ask your child to list, for example, words that mean ""said"" (asked, whined, shouted, whispered, yelled, etc.). Have her write them in a notebook under the heading ""said."" She might also list words about a particular topic. When writing, she can refer to her word bank to find just the right word.

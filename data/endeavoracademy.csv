Dear Endeavor Families,

We miss you and are so excited to welcome you back to school this fall! We are planning for a school year of learning together in an in-person classroom environment. However, we realize things can change between now and the first day of school.

Take a moment to watch the video below to hear more about how we’re preparing for the 2020-21 school year. We created detailed plans around four learning scenarios:

· In-person – a return to our traditional classroom environment.

· Remote – teaching and learning at home.

· Hybrid – a combination of in-person and remote instruction.

· Virtual – teaching and learning in a fully online environment.

""Most of you know who I am since my children have attended Endeavor since the fall of 2009. For those of you who may not know me, my name is Lisa Scovel. I worked at Endeavor as a para in 2017-2018. I left Endeavor in the spring of 2018 to accept a regional manager position with the international student exchange program that I had been a coordinator for since 2014. Unfortunately, due to a change in a law for the State of Michigan, my position was eliminated as of July 2019. It was an interesting time. Here I was 41 and faced with having to decide what I wanted to be when I grew up. I decided I wanted to be back in the schools. For the 2019-2020 school year I worked for Battle Creek Public Schools as a literacy tutor in a 2nd grade classroom. During this time I decided to go back to school and become an elementary teacher through the alternate route to teaching program offered by Michigan Teachers of Tomorrow.

I am excited to share that Michigan has become the first state in the country to gain federal approval of a program that will provide nutritious food to children who were affected by school closings due to COVID-19.

The Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer Program (P-EBT) provides temporary funding to address emergency food needs and avert financial hardship for families affected by the pandemic. Those already receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits will see benefits added to their card.

Families can use their pre-loaded EBT card at any retailer that accepts SNAP EBT benefits. You can find a list of retailers on the SNAP Retailers website.

In order to help secure this overlooked, but highly needed item, Endeavor’s Soaring Eagles Chapter of the National Junior Honor Society is hosting a school wide Sock Drive. Adult sizes are needed the most, but child sizes are also welcome. All socks will be donated to local homeless shelters/organizations.

The Sock Drive through Thursday, December 19th. Socks may be dropped off in your child’s classroom. The class in each wing that brings in the greatest number of new pairs of socks will earn an ice cream party!!!!!

You could cut it out of paper, cardboard, whatever you have and decorate it any way you’d like. Then hang it in a street side window so anyone outside can see it. When the kids are out for walks or riding their bikes, they can “hunt” for eggs around town! Go for a family walk and see who can find the most, each pick a color and see who can find the most eggs of their color, see who can spot the biggest egg.... who’s going to egg their house with me?!",0.0,"Sara McNeely

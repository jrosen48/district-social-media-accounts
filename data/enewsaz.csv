Guitarist and vocalist Mary Kelley has played in a variety of bands: Rock ‘n Roll, Blues, Country, and Bluegrass. She plays mandolin and banjo as well as guitar. Her music hero is gypsy jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt. So many musicians have influenced Mary over the years: Django, Eric Clapton, Melissa Etheridge, Debbie Davies, Joe Bonamassa, Chrissie Hynde…the list is endless. Mary loves to sing and play, and most of all, to entertain her audience. She was given the nickname “Guitar Mary” by fellow musicians some years ago, when they realized she could hold her own playing lead guitar. “Guitar Mary” is the newest member of the Prescott-based band called The Tone Kings.

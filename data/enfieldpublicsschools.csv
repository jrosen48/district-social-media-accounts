We understand that many of our students, especially our black students, are justifiably hurt, confused, scared, and angered about these deaths and the subsequent protests that continue throughout the country. While we cannot meet in school right now, we emphasize that Enfield Public Schools stands with all our students, and we will provide you with opportunities for discussion and counseling. Our goal moving forward will include striving for anti-racism in our schools and community. Our teachers will listen to our black students. We will not dismiss how you feel or tell you to channel your anger in a different way. And to our black students: we stand with you, we listen to you, and we support you. Your life matters.

Subject: Helpful COVID 19 Tips w/ Children

When children and youth watch news on TV about an infectious disease outbreak, read about it in the news, or overhear others discussing it, they can feel scared, confused, or anxious—as much as adults. This is true even if they live far from where the outbreak is taking place and are at little to no actual risk of getting sick. Young people react to anxiety and stress differently than adults. Some may react right away; others may show signs that they are having a difficult time much later. As such, adults do not always know when a child needs help. This tip sheet will help parents, caregivers, and teachers learn some common reactions, respond in a helpful way, and know when to seek support.

Around 10:30 this morning, we were notified of an issue with the water main in front of the school. We have been advised that it is not necessary to dismiss students from school, as the water will not be shut off until 3:00 this afternoon. The school will have normal water flow for restrooms, but we have been asked to not use drinking fountains for the remainder of the day. Because of this, the school has an adequate supply of bottled water for any student that requests it. I want to stress that at no time were any students or staff in any danger, however I wanted to make sure parents were aware of this inconvenience for a few hours.
I want to thank you for your patience in this matter and I will send out additional updates if needed.

It’s here! Connecticut State Department of Education today launched our new “Learn Together, Grow Together CT” initiative. We are highlighting districts who are using innovative approaches, ideas and strategies to address and overcome common issues facing districts and produce successful outcomes.

We will inventory these promising practices on the CSDE website so that district leaders and educators can connect with their counterparts and learn from, adapt and implement these proven models in their own districts and schools. The initiative is part of Education Commissioner Miguel Cardona's major points of focus to leverage the collective capacity and resources already in place around the state in order to better facilitate collaboration around common goals.

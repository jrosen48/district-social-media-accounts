Based on the recommendation from Public Health Dayton-Montgomery County and the Governor‚Äôs Level 3 indicator for our county we will begin the school year remotely.

Northmont will delay the beginning of the school year for students until September 1, 2020. When school begins on September 1, all students will be learning remotely.

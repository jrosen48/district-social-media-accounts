I will be taking online orders until Friday at NOON and those orders can be picked up Saturday still.

Alright people, I know today is a big day in Iowa with State getting ready to beat the Hawks, but this other important EVent has just been brought to my attention!!

It’s DOUBLE BOX TOPS WEEK!!!

This means for every box top item that you purchase, if you scan the receipt, EV Elementary PTO will earn $.20!! (If there is also a paper box top still on the packaging, that would make the item worth $.30 right off the bat!!) This does not include any of the other promos that are being run which you can also see from the app!! (Old El Paso or GM Cereal, for example.)

When you download the app, for the 1st 24 Hours, you can upload the last SIX months worth of receipts!!

After the first 24 hours, you can always upload receipts that are 14 days or less old.

There is also a feature on the app where you can type in the TEACHER name that you want to get credit! We are doing a monthly classroom contest AND a $1,000 contest this year!!

If you have ANY questions, please let me know!! This funds our field trips. I’m told we need $1,000 each year to keep that account going!!",0.0,"DOUBLE BOX TOP POINTS!!!

The New Box Tops for Education App has been released! I updated mine and used it just to see how user friendly, and I'm not gonna lie...it's pretty slick! Added $.10 to EVPTO's account in a matter of about 30 seconds!

The only thing I haven't figured out yet is how to log how much all of you scan so that your student gets credit, but I'll figure out a system by the time school starts in August!!

In the mean time, the App is called BoxTops for Education and it's available in the App Store and on Google Play. Set up an account and link it to English Valleys Elementary, please!!

EV PSA: The next Box Top Submission Date is March 1, 2019! There are many Box Tops that will expire on that date. Please check your cupboards and any that say 3/1/19, tear off and SEND THEM TO SCHOOL!!!
Remember that Box Tops are what funds the field trips for the Elementary Kiddos at EV!! There is also a monthly contest where the winning class earns a choice of prizes! Last months winner was singlehandedly won by ONE Student!! (Some of these kids take Box Tops VERY seriously.)
Again, PLEASE send all 3/1/19 Box Tops to school before 2/26/18!! (Jaidyn will happily tote them home from the High School as well.)",0.0,"FYI!!

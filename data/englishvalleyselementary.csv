Our first ""Remote Learning Wednesday"" will quickly be upon us!

Here's a brief overview of what to expect.

On Tuesday, your child will arrive home with a remote learning packet. It will consist of a few required activities for your child to complete sometime before school on Thursday!

At this point, no onsite student will be required to log into a digital classroom for the Wednesday assignment. All activities will be paper/pencil.

Your child will return the packet on Thursday and that will ""count"" for their Wednesday attendance.

We appreciate your support!

We're asking all students to bring a reusable water bottle each day - and then take it home to be sanitized at night.

We'd like some cases of bottled water for students who forget to bring their water bottles back to school AND we'd also like some new refillable water bottles for students who may not have their own.

2) Travel Sized Tissues - We've always asked students to bring tissue boxes to school on the first day.

This year, we'd like to provide students with travel pack tissues to keep individually in their desks.

A few updates...

1) Have you completed the Return-To-Learn parent survey? It's extremely important that you share your thoughts as we finalize our plans for August.

2) We've pulled the class lists off the website...for the simple reason that we may need to make a few changes. If you've already viewed the class lists - I hope to keep them the same (fingers crossed!) - but I don't want anything floating around that may be inaccurate.

3) Our district Return-To-Learn team meets tomorrow (Tuesday) morning. I'll share an update after we meet.

Stay safe!

2) We've pulled the class lists off the website...for the simple reason that we may need to make a few changes. If you've already viewed the class lists - I hope to keep them the same (fingers crossed!) - but I don't want anything floating around that may be inaccurate.

3) Our district Return-To-Learn team meets tomorrow (Tuesday) morning. I'll share an update after we meet.

Stay safe!

Hello everyone! So, for July, I am doing something a little different at the library. The photo below is my new office companion. He is a Betta fish and I have named him Jules Verne. During July if the kiddos would like to, they can submit to me fun facts about Jules Verne, or Betta Fish. They can put it on paper and put it in the drop box, or you can put the facts in a private message or in the comments section. For every time they submit something, I will add their name into a drawing for a $25 gift card to the EV Malt shop. So, the more times they submit things the better their chances are! I will try to add different things they can research every week. Remember, I will need a fact and their name to add to the drawing. (It would also be helpful to have a way to contact you if they win!!) I will draw a name at the end of the month. Thanks and have a great week!",0.0,"North English Public Library

For every time they submit something, I will add their name into a drawing for a $25 gift card to the EV Malt shop. So, the more times they submit things the better their chances are! I will try to add different things they can research every week. Remember, I will need a fact and their name to add to the drawing. (It would also be helpful to have a way to contact you if they win!!) I will draw a name at the end of the month. Thanks and have a great week!",2020-07-06 13:32:23,,

Hello everyone! Several reminders today! Tomorrow, I will be handing out packets at the kids’ meal at the North English Community Center! Also, a reminder I am still doing curbside pick up of books and materials. I will continue this until June 8th, and we will decide then our next course of action. So please call or email your book requests, the phone number is 319-3725 or email ashannahan@northenglish.lib.ia.us! Be sure to leave your name and number with your message. You can find our catalog on the North English Public Library webpage at www.northenglish.lib.ia.us. One last thing, I will not be at the library on Monday BC of the Memorial Day Holiday, so your requests may be delayed a day. Thanks again for all your support and have a great week!🦉📚🦉📚

Wednesday Wake Up!
There are coloring pages in the lunch bags today. The Student Council (I believe) has asked that the kiddos color these and return them to the center. The student council will then be sending them to the nursing home to brighten the resident's day!!

We have been given additional coloring sheets by the NE Public Library as well. Once we are out of the student council ones, we will be sending these home. You can either return them to us, or send them to Grandma or a neighbor, etc. Spread the sunshine with those that may not be able to see it right now.

This also gives the kiddos a great opportunity to learn about addressing envelopes and maybe they will get a pen pal out of it!!

T-shirt orders are due to Elite TODAY. Remember, the proceeds from this sale will be split between the kids meals and the food bank!

I hope it motivates the Clover kids, 4Hers, & FFA kids to use this down time to plan their projects so when it’s Fair Time, they are ready to go!!!

I also hope this encourages the Fun Days Committee to prep for another great City Celebration!

And most of all, I hope this Coronavirus outrage is over soon so the ISF can go on as planned! I’ve never missed one and don’t want to start now!

Thank you to those who participated with my favorite fair food question last week and to all those that are braving the big city grocery stores to pick up the food I can’t get in town! It takes a village and ours is the best!

See you kiddos tomorrow at 11:00!! Remember we are currently planning for 60 kids, but NO ONE will be turned away Hungry. We appreciate your patience during the crazy times!!",2020-04-19 20:45:47,,

I am SO excited for this week’s theme for the Free Kids Lunch (April 13-17)!!
It’s “The Very Hungry Caterpillar” Please enjoy a 5 year old McKenna (with some help from her annoying mother) reading this book 5 years ago to her Papa for his birthday!
See you tomorrow at the Community Center from 11-12!
Also, it’s supposed to be colder this week so we may have the South door closed, but we are right inside!!!

Sidewalk puff paint!! 🌈🌈

Big thanks to those who joined us live on Amanda's Beauty and made it with us!! This would be great for camping too. Super easy. Made them all in less than 15 mins.

1. In a large mixing bowl stir together the flour and water until there are no lumps.
2. Stir in the dish soap to the flour mixture.
3. Add food coloring of your choice of color until the desired color is achieved.
4. Pour the mixture into your squeeze bottle.
5. Give the kids their new sidewalk paint and let them have fun!

Use up the paint on the same day you make it! (I have ALWAYS been a bit *extra* of a mama... It’s not just the quarantine.😉) ￼￼",0.0,"Amanda Linder

We had 3 times as many kiddos come today for lunch than yesterday!! Remember, this is open to EVERYONE, there is no income guideline. We're hoping that tomorrow the weather will be nicer so people may want to go for a walk!

Also, I received a video from a parent who's sandwich appears to have been half eaten and the bag was popped open. I will try to make sure I eat breakfast tomorrow instead of munching on the sandwiches. I can't say the same for my co-horts. :)

who wants to go on a bear hunt...
Who knows the book “We’re Going on a Bear Hunt” By Michael Rosen
If you haven’t read it or heard someone read it plug it into YouTube and listen!
It’s a fun bear hunt 5 kids go on.
Here’s the challenge:
If you have a teddy bear put it in a window or on the porch so it is visible from the road before Friday, March 27th. If you're out this week(end) enjoying a walk, bike ride or even a drive in the car in your neighborhood, you may notice some bears!

Well, some teddy bears.

With kids out of school and so many families practicing social distancing due to coronavirus, let’s fill the neighborhoods in the EV school district and go on a bear hunt.

The idea is that while you're out on a walk, bike ride or drive in the car, your kids can be on the lookout for teddy bears in the windows of homes. It's something families can do without directly interacting with others.
** if you live in the country and want to participate post a picture of your bear in the window! We would love to see it!**",2.0,"Love this Stacy Axmear! ❤️🐻❤️

This should help those in communities farther away have multiple drop off locations and keep you from having to enter the buildings and go through a screening process!

As always, any questions, let me know!! —Jen Jen Winegarden Rugg",2020-03-18 09:23:25,,

I’m trying to give my kids as many choices as possible to help their disposition (no, they don’t run the house, but they are given limited options on different things.) They usually get to chose if they get school lunch or take their lunch. If they get school lunch, they still get choices within reason as to what they take. So, here is today’s lunch. I chose the complete protein (today is turkey lunch meat), they get to chose their grain, fruit and dairy. (Already out of fresh fruit options. Looks like I’m going to have to face the stores sooner than later.)
Hope this helps someone with more ideas of how to make this fun for our kids!",0.0,"I love all of the tips and ideas that our parents are sharing! Keep them coming!

Most wins since 2001, 1st Postseason win since 2011.

Season came to a rough end last night. Took some time and sleep to properly reflect. We’ve been in the lowest times over the years at EV. Went through a 46 game losing streak and this group broke it last year. Since that game the competitive turn around and fight has been undeniable. To the outside looking in 9-13 looks average.

But there is so many things it took to get just to point: a group of players that allowed me to coach hard, a former player turned into an assistant and a leader, the will to keep going when things continued to be tough, the confidence to believe in your team and school when you’ve never won consistently, being able to play with 6 guys, having a full JV group after not having one for 2 years, having supportive families, playing with class and sportsmanship, and having big crowds this year.

We will push for more in the offseason and next season. We won’t forget where we’ve been and remember what it’s like to be on the bottom. And what it takes daily to rise towards the top.",0.0,"Always exciting to share positive news about our Big Bears! ❤️

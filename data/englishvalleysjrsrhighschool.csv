Here are a few items that we could use:

1) Bottled Water and/or New Refillable Water Bottles - Due to COVID-19 restrictions, our communal drinking fountains will be turned off.

We're asking all students to bring a reusable water bottle each day - and then take it home to be sanitized at night.

We'd like some cases of bottled water for students who forget to bring their water bottles back to school AND we'd also like some new refillable water bottles for students who may not have their own.

2) Travel Sized Tissues - To avoid spreading germs we would like some individual/travel tissue packets.

3) Clorox Wipes - We will be doing a lot of cleaning and the district is supplying cleaning supplies, but we would like to have wipes on hand if needed.

You can drop off any donations at the high school or email hlightfoot@english-valleys.k12.ia.us

You will be required to practice social distancing guidelines and plants will be spaced accordingly. You can pay cash or check that day, but keep in mind it must be exact change. (I do not have any change to give back). I know lots of people like to pick out their own stuff and to be honest the pictures don’t do the flowers justice. I will be taking online orders until Friday at NOON and those orders can be picked up Saturday still.

This money has been split between these two causes so we can continue to keep good food in hungry little tummies and starving older stomachs too!!

Dear Nolan Grove,

Congratulations! You have been named to the Des Moines Register’s Academic All-State team. Only 242 of Iowa’s roughly 40,000 high school seniors achieved this honor in 2020. That’s quite an accomplishment!

I’m writing to let you (and your parents) know the Academic All-State section will run Sunday (April 26) in the Des Moines Register print edition. The articles will roll out online Monday morning (April 27) at DesMoinesRegister.com.

Thank you, and once again, congratulations!

Hello everyone! A reminder that the North English Public Library has online resources available. (You will have to download a free app for this.) There are two ways to access our eBooks. Go to www.northenglish.lib.ia.us and click on the Bridges icon. It will ask for our login, which is the zip-code of North English (52316) PLUS your library card number. So it is a long number. If you do not know your library card number you can email me at ashannahan@northenglish.lib.ia.us and I will send it to you. The other way is to go to http://bridges.lib.overdrive.com and choose North English Public Library and then login the same way. They are currently trying to make more titles available during these difficult times, so check back if you do not find anything you like right away. As a side note-I will only be checking my mail a couple times a day, so I may not get back to you immediately.",0.0,"North English Public Library

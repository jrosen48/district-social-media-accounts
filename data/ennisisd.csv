History was made today with the first day of school being virtual. While this did not bring any students physically into classrooms today, it was so good to see them on their Google Meets with their teachers, introducing themselves and catching up with each other. Another day-maker was seeing the lengths that parents are going to in order to make sure their children are online and ready to learn. We saw it all day today...the endless phone calls coming in to the front office, the concerned emails sent to teachers, the parents dropping by with chromebooks that were not cooperating at home, and families like this one who chose to do school at the shady picnic tables outside of Lummus in order to access the district internet. Thank you for your commitment to your children!

As educators, we were reminded today of our “why”. We long to be the calm in this PASSING storm of uncertainty for our students and parents, show compassion to our students along the way, and provide the best learning opportunities we can as we embark on the 2020-2021 school year.

As you may have heard, Governor Greg Abbott has now ordered all Texas schools closed for the remainder of this academic year. Although this continues to be a difficult time, we will continue to support our students to the best of our ability moving forward.

As he stated, the Texas Education Agency will be releasing more details soon about how this announcement will affect our students, families, and staff. As soon as this information is known, we will share it with you.

With this said, we will continue to provide our students with distance learning activities, free meals, and counseling services for the remainder of the school year.

We understand that this is a difficult time for our families and our entire community, but rest assured that Ennis ISD will be there every step of the way.

Our staff is working diligently on an operational plan to provide meals for our students. The goal is to begin meal distribution no later than Wednesday of this week. Details concerning locations and times will be communicated tomorrow.

According to state officials, the school closure may be only a week, however, there is a possibility of many weeks if the pandemic continues to spread. In the event the closure is extended, we will provide educational resources through online and hard copy platforms. More information regarding these learning opportunities will be provided once there is a determination on the closure status.

Thank you for your recent support of our two ballot measures. Passing our four-year EPO levy will allow us to strategically plan for field trips, Middle School and High School athletics, Pre School as well as many other non- state funded activities for our students.

The passage of the bond proposition will allow us to replace the roof on the Middle/High School, the Elementary and the Gym. The HVAC system for the Middle/High School and Gym areas will also be replaced as well as upgrading to more efficient windows in the Middle and High School.

After the project is complete prior to school starting next fall, the building will be in very good condition for the next 20-25 years.

Thank you again for your ongoing support we are very appreciative.

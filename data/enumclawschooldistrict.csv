In their hands are their AP Studio Art Portfolios. AP art requires a portfolio of 24 works, of which five are physically submitted and the rest are digital. Students must demonstrate their technical skill amidst a unified body of work.

Mr. Berryhill stumbled into beekeeping after he listened to a short presentation then wanted to build a beehive. Once he built a hive, he felt the only logical thing to do was fill it with Italian honeybees. This Buzz Talk is about stumbling into a hobby and taking a path that you haven't considered. Life is full of rich (and sweet!) opportunities! We recommend watching Mr. Berryhill's entertaining Buzz Talk. #esdwonder

After a recent trip to JA BizTown, the students learned about the role of members in city hall as well as the importance of voting. Teachers Brandy Stockwell and Ashley Stuenkel extended the lesson with a visit from Enumclaw's Mayor Molinaro to hear how the mayor campaigned and got to know Enumclaw voters before he was elected. One of the purposes of having the mayor present was to connect the students to local leadership. ""We wanted to show that local decisions are within their reach and that these decisions actually impact their lives"" Ashley Stuenkel shared. The students then asked the mayor questions about his first vote as mayor, working with other mayors, the pool, the dog park, the proposed plaza, and potential restaurants. It was another tremendous day of learning and connections at Southwood! #esdwonder",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2769987963019131&id=451915014826449,,0.0,"Southwood Elementary 5th graders are setting their sights on local government.

For their soon-to-be seventh grader, the switch from brick-and-mortar was a success.

The virtual setting has benefited Rex’s academic performance, as well as the pursuit of his passions: golf and flying.

“EPIC allows Rex to decide when to practice and play. He looks at the forecast each week to decide the best days to practice,” Rex’s mother, Kimberly Arnold, said. “This teaches him to make decisions and self-manage his time.”

Along with the flexibility, the Arnold family appreciates a strong partnership with their son’s teacher.

“Being responsible for your child’s education can be overwhelming at first,” Kimberly said. “His teacher is not only an academic resource, but she also helps navigate National Collegiate Athletic Association rules and regulations in case my children decide to pursue college athletics.

“As a result of our teacher-parent partnership, Rex has straight A’s and is doing well on testing. EPIC has really changed our life as a family,” said Kimberly.",,,0.0,"During a time of transition, the Arnold family decided to give EPIC a try.

Fence is coming out around the track this week! The design that was in the fence by the score board was saved.
Bike path users please be aware that construction of new track will start soon. We have talked with the city, and once construction begins, the path that goes by the track will be closed for your safety. You can still access the path at the end of Franklin street. Thank you for your cooperation.

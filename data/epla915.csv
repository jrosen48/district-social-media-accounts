We hope this message finds you and your family safe and well.

First, a huge thank you and shout out to all of our teachers, staff, scholars, and families who helped us seamlessly transition into our distance-learning program. We look forward to finishing the year strong!

As you know we are continuing to monitor the COVID-19 outbreak and its impact on our school. As we continue to follow orders from government officials, we will be extending the campus closure until Monday, May 4, 2020.

The El Paso Leadership Academy announced today it will continue its policy to operate the Community Eligibility Program (CEP) under the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program for the 2019-2020 school year.

Schools qualifying to operate CEP serve breakfast and lunch to all children at no charge and eliminate the collection of meal applications for free, reduced-price, and paid student meals. This new approach reduces burdens for both families and school administrators and helps ensure that students receive nutritious meals.

For additional information please contact Emily Levario at elevario@epleadershipacademy.org

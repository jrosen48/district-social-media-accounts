It appears that we are in this for the long term, until at least May 4, 2020. The Epping School Board will meet remotely next Thursday, April 2, 2020. Details and Agenda to follow.

A couple of thoughts as we end this week. Teaching children is complex work, even for those people who attend college to do so. Routines will help you and your children. We also realize that many parents are also trying to work while they are supporting their child's academic growth.

We are taking attendance via a student's completion of work, Please be sure that you are checking your student's completion of work. It is essential to their academic growth.

Hey Neighbors!
Over the next few weeks, many of us will be increasing our time spent at home. If you have young children it can be hard to find things to do all day, for potentially 21 days or more. And not lose your mind.

This is a way for the kids in our community to still get outside and do something fun, without touching or coughing on each other.

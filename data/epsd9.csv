Dear Academia Aguilitas Families,

At this time AAP will be operating under the guidelines for Comprehensive Distance Learning (CDL). This means that AAP will not be holding in-person preschool instruction, but will be engaging with scholars virtually through the district-provided iPad. Throughout the CDL process, there may be opportunities for Limited In-person Instruction (LII) at which time we will communicate the plan with families.

Please do not hesitate to contact our front office if you have questions. Table Rock Elementary Front Office 541-830-1350.

Thank you for your continued support throughout this time and we look forward to working with you in the future!

Stadium lights across the nation are coming on to show support and hope for all students. Schools across the country are participating in support of their students.

The stadium lights at EPHS Eagle Stadium will come on at 20:20 hours (8:20 pm military time) in honor of our 2020 graduating class. This class will have endured and prospered in ways that have not been experienced in a lifetime. Lights will be on one minute each night and twenty minutes on Friday.

If you see the stadium lights on you will know that we miss you and look forward to seeing our students again.

HVAC efficiency saves $$$$$ - When the heating system was initially placed into Table Rock Elementary School in 1965, the price for a gallon of fuel was $.25 per gallon. Last year, it cost our school district approximately $35,000 to heat Table Rock Elementary! The physical plant is old and inefficient. Recently, we moved our students from Little Butte School into the brand new Hillside Elementary. The first year we saw a savings of more than $30,000 in heating costs alone. Investing in efficient physical plants in all of our buildings is a wise and conservative expenditure of your tax dollars. Updating the HVAC systems throughout our district will continue to pay dividends year after year!",2.0,"DON'T FORGET TO VOTE!

Those renovations will include upgrades to security, new HVAC systems and modern classrooms with keyless entry to help protect our students.

Many people have asked what will this cost? If the bond passes, property owners will see an increase in their yearly property taxes. If you own a home that has a value of $200,000 it could cost you and additional $15 per month in your property taxes. A $300,000 home could cost you and additional $22 per month.

If voters approve the bond in November, the incremental increase from the projected 2019 rate is estimated to be $0.89 per $1000 of assessed value.

For a property assessed at $200,000, this equates to a $178 annual increase over the current tax levy. (@ $14 per month)

District voters last approved a bond in 2000. The proceeds from this bond were used to build Eagle Rock Elementary School, Eagle Point Middle School, White Mountain Middle School, Shady Cove Middle School and other capital improvements across the District.

The current tax levy rate for this bond is approximately $1.61 per $1000. This bond will be paid off in 2021.

The new Bond, if approved, is intended to be issued over several years to match construction and cost schedules. Only a portion of the new bond would be issued before the current bond is paid off. Using this approach, the full impact of the estimated levy increase won’t occur until 2023.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1394777350653219&id=186288068168826,,0.0,"What would the Bond cost?

First, Andrew was elected to serve as the statewide FFA president. His leadership skills are quite impressive and far exceed most others' his age.

Second, Andrew just learned he has been accepted to Cornell University, an Ivy League school in Ithaca, New York. The acceptance rate is only 14% which speaks to Andrew's high character, academics, and extra-curricular successes.

Former EPHS Assistant Principal and current EPMS Principal Heather Marinucci (pictured with Andrew) has been key to connecting our students with Cornell. Last year EPHS graduate Cole Johnston began his freshman year at Cornell.

We hope that you had a fantastic Thanksgiving break!! Thanks to your time, money, and efforts, we were able to bring Thanksgiving to 115 needy families within our district community. Many of these students are in your classes, and often times their need goes unnoticed or would be surprising.

With your work and efforts we raised over $4000 and were able to fully fund the project this year. Your can drives brought in extra cans that were added to baskets, or donated to families locally. Each basket contained a Turkey, Potatoes, Carrots, Beans, Cranberry Sauce, Pumpkin Pie, and many other food items.

The Jackson County Sheriffs Department delivered 15 of the baskets with the district community in addition to the baskets that were sent to all of the schools.

Sodexo graciously donated enough carrots and potatoes for all 115 baskets!!

Thank you again for all of your support through this process.

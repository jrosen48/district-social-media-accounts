Flag Day has been a major holiday in Haiti since 1803, when the revolutionary leader Jean-Jacques Dessalines tore up a French tricolor and had his goddaughter, Catherine Flon, stitch together the country’s first independent flag. The new banner consisted of just a red and a blue stripe, without the central white stripe of the tricolor.

On this day in 1803, the first purely Haitian flag was adopted on the last day of the Congress of Arcahaie.

It was not until January 1, 1804, that Haiti officially declared independence from France, becoming the first free state in the Caribbean liberated and governed by its former slaves. That revolutionary spirit is still a source of national pride and celebration today.

Elizabeth Public Schools, as part of Haitian Flag Day and Haitian-American Heritage Month, would like to recognize all of its team members and families, as well as all greater Elizabeth community members, of Haitian descent for their tremendous contributions to the culture and vibrance of Elizabeth's schools and neighborhoods.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10163532744350608&id=352311525607,,0.0,"EPS Celebrates Haitian Flag Day

UPDATED NJSIAA STATEMENT - Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (3/12/2020, 10 PM)

“The NJSIAA has canceled the remainder of the boys and girls basketball championships. The games will not be rescheduled.

“We have been making our decisions one day at a time, taking into account the best available guidance from the state health department and the CDC. Now, given the rapidly changing circumstances and uncertainties facing our member schools, our student-athletes, our host facilities, and many others, we no longer see a viable path to the completion of the Group Championships on Saturday and Sunday.

“We understand that our decision will disappoint many, but believe it to be in the best interest of our student-athletes and all those involved with the games.”

Thanks to everyone, for all you do and have done for our student-athletes!

Respectfully,

Al Stumpf and Kim DeGraw-Cole

UPDATED NJSIAA STATEMENT - Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (3/12/2020, 10 PM)

“The NJSIAA has canceled the remainder of the boys and girls basketball championships. The games will not be rescheduled.

“We have been making our decisions one day at a time, taking into account the best available guidance from the state health department and the CDC. Now, given the rapidly changing circumstances and uncertainties facing our member schools, our student-athletes, our host facilities, and many others, we no longer see a viable path to the completion of the Group Championships on Saturday and Sunday.

“We understand that our decision will disappoint many, but believe it to be in the best interest of our student-athletes and all those involved with the games.”

Thanks to everyone, for all you do and have done for our student-athletes!

Respectfully,

Al Stumpf and Kim DeGraw-Cole

It took a long time for others to stand, keep sticking with us and you get the plan.
Not the riots, fighting, looting, and killing, hopefully I can get a meeting with that man in the big white building.
He sees his people are going through it but he still supports his own race, “you loot, they shoot” I’ve had enough of this president in this case.

As of right now all school districts will be using NTI days combined with spring breaks (non NTI Days) through April 17, 2020. This puts the anticipated return date as April 20th for KY students. Therefore, our district will continue with NTI Days March 30-April 3, have Spring Break April 6-10, then have NTI Days April 13-17. Again, the current anticipated date for students to return to school would be April 20th. Our district and our schools will send out more specific information on Monday. We will continue to provide breakfast and lunch to students throughout the NTI days and during Spring Break, Thank you.

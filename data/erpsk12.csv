It is with great joy that we are going to be able to assist families who receive reduced price meals with a free meal instead. What does this mean? If you fill out a lunch application during the 2019-2020 school year and are approved for what is normally a reduced meal price, you will now receive it free. This will be provided through the food service budget.

Please also remember that all students district wide are able to receive a free breakfast regardless of their financial status.

All meals at Greyhound Central are free, breakfast and lunch

Please direct questions to the food service department at 663-4280

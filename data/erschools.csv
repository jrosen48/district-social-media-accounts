Until Fall, Andrew is working at the Argonne National Laboratory...the U.S. Department of Energy's Science and Engineering Research Center. He will then be heading west as Andrew has accepted a full ride scholarship to the University of Oregon's PPD program in Quantum Physics.

On Monday, April 6th, a district leadership team will begin developing the required components of our Elk Rapids Schools Remote Learning Plan. Our goal is to have the Remote Learning Plan approved by TBAISD as soon as the middle of next week. Once approved, communication regarding the details of our plan along with potential start dates will be shared with all district families.

RoboElks win second tournament of the season!

The Cherryland Middle School robotics team RoboElks 41410A, won their second tournament of the season on December 21 at Kalkaska Middle School.

Team members, Xander Rich, Audrey Nicholson, Natasha Beebe and coach Kevin Kalchik have been working since last summer to build, program and practice driving their robot.

The RoboElks moved up through the qualification rounds through the day and were ranked in second place for the finals. During the final run, they scored 93 points and were presented with the Teamwork Championship Trophy.

This last October, the RoboElks put up a final score of 104 and won the competition at Rapid City Elementary. This win qualified the team to attend both the Michigan State Competition held at the Grand Traverse Resort and the US Open National Competition, held in Council Bluffs, Iowa. This is the second year this team is headed to the State Championship.

Congratulations to our RoboElks! And good luck at the championship.",0.0,"So exciting to see how far this team will go!

This week, our #P2PartnerSchools will focus on the character strength of perseverance. The concept of perseverance can most often be found in one’s active pursuit in overcoming obstacles. Perseverance is a uniquely human characteristic that identifies an individual’s ability to spend long periods of time devoted to a single goal or set of goals. Those who persevere are able to set goals for themselves and then take active, calculated steps toward those goals. People demonstrating high levels of perseverance are able to handle significant, sometimes repeated, setbacks in pursuit of goals.

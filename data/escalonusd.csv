Jeremy White, Music Teacher
Everyone has a unique life story, but some stories are ""unexpected"" in the way they take place. One such story involves El Portal Middle School's Jeremy White. Mr. White graduated with the intent of joining the US military as a musician. However, plans changed when he received a scholarship to study music at California State University, Long Beach. After completing his master's degree, Mr. White began a teaching career that eventually led him to EPMS where he is beginning his 6th year as a music instructor.

While traveling with the EPMS band to Disneyland in the spring of 2019, Mr. White connected with the bus driver who was a retired music teacher from the Air National Guard. After a 6-hour discussion on the bus ride and a talk with his wife, Mr. White decided to pursue joining the Army Reserve as a musician.

Every year, teachers nominate candidates for the Escalon Unified Outstanding Teacher of the Year. The nominations are reviewed by a committee and a teacher is selected and presented with an award at either El Portal’s promotion ceremony or EHS’ graduation ceremony. It is Escalon Unified’s honor to share that Susan Heflin has been chosen as the 2020 Outstanding Teacher of the Year.

Sue has served our students and community at both Dent Elementary and Van Allen Elementary for over 22 years. Comments from her peers include “Sue is constantly looking to better herself as an educator. She seeks out training to attend any chance she can get…” Another teacher shared “Sue has dedicated her career to the students of our district and is a truly amazing educator.” Sue has long advocated for teacher training from the UC Davis Math Project and has been instrumental in working with the district to make it happen.

Sue is an excellent example of a fantastic teacher who makes a huge difference in children’s lives.

Congratulations Sue!!!!!",,,0.0,"2020 OUTSTANDING TEACHER OF THE YEAR

Every year, teachers nominate candidates for the Escalon Unified Outstanding Teacher of the Year. The nominations are reviewed by a committee and a teacher is selected and presented with an award at either El Portal’s promotion ceremony or EHS’ graduation ceremony. It is Escalon Unified’s honor to share that Susan Heflin has been chosen as the 2020 Outstanding Teacher of the Year.

Sue has served our students and community at both Dent Elementary and Van Allen Elementary for over 22 years. Comments from her peers include “Sue is constantly looking to better herself as an educator. She seeks out training to attend any chance she can get…” Another teacher shared “Sue has dedicated her career to the students of our district and is a truly amazing educator.” Sue has long advocated for teacher training from the UC Davis Math Project and has been instrumental in working with the district to make it happen.

Sue is an excellent example of a fantastic teacher who makes a huge difference in children’s lives.

Congratulations Sue!!!!!",2020-05-22 12:01:36,,

Starting off the week at Hughson, the varsity soccer boys lost a tough 1-0 decision. They bounced back on Thursday, though, handing Hilmar a setback by the same 1-0 score.
At Hughson, head coach Paul Silva said it was a penalty kick in the 15th minute of the game that proved to be the only score of the night. “Brayan (Barrientos) actually blocked it,” Silva noted of his goalie making the initial PK stop. “But it went right back to the guy and he kicked it in.”
Barrientos had seven saves but Silva said the offense for the Cougars wasn’t clicking and they could never find the net.
“We really couldn’t exploit our speed, we couldn’t get the ball out to the wings and attack,” Silva added. “Credit to Hughson, they really fought and played well. ”Thursday against Hilmar, it was a determined Cougar team that came out looking for victory.

Students with year-long perfect attendance will receive a special perfect attendance medal. Pictured here are the medals our Farmington students will receive.",2020-02-14 14:59:04,,

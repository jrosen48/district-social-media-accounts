Who doesn‚Äôt love to pick out a new book? Thanks to senior volunteers from San Diego Oasis, North Broadway 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-graders were invited to pick out three books during a book giveaway Friday morning. Hundreds of books went home with eager young readers, many of whom sought out something new, while others had their sights set on books about sports, science, Star Wars, and superheroes.

This is the third year that Oasis has presented a book giveaway to North Broadway students, and in just a couple of weeks the volunteers will visit Rock Springs to do the same. Oasis volunteers said they like to plan the book giveaway days as close to summer break as possible, to give children a few extra books of their choosing to take home for summer.

One of San Diego Oasis' many programs is its intergenerational tutoring service, which pairs an older adult one-on-one with a student who needs some extra help with reading. Some 85 tutors are assisting 158 students at 11 EUSD schools every week! The adult stays paired with the same student throughout the school year.",0.0,"Escondido Union School District added 16 new photos ‚Äî with San Diego Oasis at North Broadway Elementary School.

Lots of festive fun this week as our schools celebrated Halloween, as well as D√≠a de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead. We love seeing our students, teachers, and staff members in creative costumes. D√≠a de los Muertos is a celebration of life and death, and is celebrated widely beyond the country where it originated, Mexico. The holiday gained even more understanding and recognition with last year‚Äôs hit Disney film, ‚ÄúCoco.‚Äù And locally, our city‚Äôs own California Center for the Arts, Escondido, has hosted a huge D√≠a de los Muertos Festival for more than 22 years! In addition to its annual festival tonight, the arts center is hosting a showing of ‚ÄúCoco‚Äù on Friday night.

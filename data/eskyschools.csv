Hello families of 1st-6th grade students! Another option for getting some of that ""homeschooling"" in can be reading books online and taking Accelerated Reader tests. The testing is now open so kids can take AR tests any day of the week from 7:00 AM until 11:00 PM. Two sites that have free books for kids to read online are openlibrary.org and getepic.com. (Getepic offers a free 30 day trial.) If your child needs their log in information, I can help with that. PM me and I'll get that information to you asap. Please know we miss your kiddos and can't wait for that old M-F routine to return. Be safe and stay healthy!",2020-03-19 14:51:11,,

Unified Sports is dedicated to promoting social inclusion through athletic teamwork. In this case, our first ever Unified Eskymo Basketball team!

Unified Sports joins people with and without intellectual disabilities on the same team. It was inspired by a simple principle: training together and playing together is a quick path to friendship and understanding.

These student athletes and coaches have spent countless hours training twice a week since mid-November. Special Olympics granted the team $1,200 for jerseys and shorts, and today our juniors and seniors showcased their talents from 1:30-2:25 in the EHS gymnasium.

According to student athlete, Angel, ""We aren't good enough to make the regular high school team, but we want to show everyone that we can still play and have skills."" GO MOS!

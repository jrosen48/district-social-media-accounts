Thank You! We had an overwhelming response when we asked families to submit 1st Day of School photos of their children!
The photos were a great mix of cute, sweet, funny and serious. Most kids seemed happy to have their photo taken, while a few appeared to be reluctant participants...probably because mom or dad insisted! We noticed a couple of stealth photos that parents likely took while their (usually older) children weren't looking! We were excited to see some staff submissions too! We saw a number of pets...cats and dogs are awesome! There were plenty of siblings, twins and a few youngsters that aren't quite in school yet. Reading what our students want to be when they grow up made us smile. Check out the album of what has been submitted so far! Feel free to add your photo in the comments if you haven't submitted one yet!",0.0,"East Syracuse Minoa Central School District added 176 new photos.

That's happening with 13 bus routes that were created by our efficient routing software. Each bus has a driver, a ""runner"" to bring the meals to the door and a ""stocker"" to get the package ready for the next home. Making those meals are the Chartwells K-12 Food Service staff.
We appreciate the hard work being done by everyone to make sure that our children have enough to eat during the State of Emergency. It also gives parents a break from meal prep!

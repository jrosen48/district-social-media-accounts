Ready to “go on a bear hunt”? Or help with a fun (safe) event? Starting today, through March 29 put a teddy bear, or a picture of a bear, in a window visible from the street. Our goal? To create a fun activity that kids and families can do, to relieve boredom, but in a safe way. As they walk the streets of Essex, they “hunt” for bears, or whatever the theme of the week is. A map of Essex so the more devoted hunters can mark their finds, or paths covered, is coming! But the fun doesn’t end there - March 29–April 5 will be “chalk your walk” (get out and decorate your sidewalk in positive or uplifting words. A happy face in a window works too if you don’t have chalk or ability to get out). April 5- 12 will be a “Easter egg hunt” with pictures of Easter eggs in windows. Then April 12-19 brings flowers - real or pictures.

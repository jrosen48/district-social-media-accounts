Today, as #BackToSchoolWeek continues, let’s meet another of our School Resource Officers:

Deputy Jonah Russell, our SRO at Estacada High School!

Deputy Russell takes time to connect with the students at Estacada High in many ways — including running #football drills on the playground. He’s a member of our SWAT team, served in the military, and played college and arena football. He helps out w/ EHS athletics today.

Deputy Russell also made national headlines last year as one of the deputies who helped save Baby Audrey last year after she stopped breathing at a mall photo studio. He later visited the recovering baby at OHSU. You can read this incredible story here:

The City of Estacada Public Works Department will be conducting smoke tests of sanitary sewers in the following communities the week of June 3rd:

Lake Shore Area
Northwest area of Estacada
Ginseng Area

These tests will assist us in locating breaks and defects in the sewer system. During the test, YOU MAY SEE SMOKE COMING FROM VENT STACKS ON BUILDINGS OR FROM HOLES IN THE GROUND. Don’t be alarmed. The smoke has no odor, is non-toxic, non-staining, does not create a fire hazard, and will dissipate in a few minutes.

Before we conduct the smoke test, please pour water into your basement floor drains and into any unused sinks. This will seal the drain traps so that smoke will not enter your building through the drain.

If smoke should enter your building during the test, it probably means that there are defects in the plumbing that could allow DANGEROUS SEWER GAS to enter. Note the location of the smoke and call Tom Seal, Public Works Director at 503-630-8270, x205 to arrange a meeting with our inspector.

WHAT IS YANA??

YANA stands for “You are not alone.” It is a program started by three Estacada Middle School students. They started YANA after they heard hate comments being made to people around the school. The purpose of YANA is to end bullying and promote kindness around EMS. YANA has already received a donation of $100 and won an award from the city of Estacada as “Students of the Year”. They are going to eventually have YANA t-shirts for sale and will be having meetings for the club members, along with surprises and missions for them to help make our school a better place. If your student (who goes to EMS) is interested in signing up, there is a sign up sheet on Ms. Wexler’s office door. Also remind your student that wearing yellow on Friday supports YANA. They accept donations and have jars set up around local businesses to help raise some money to fund our shirts, ect. We openly welcome any student interested in joining and want them to know that they aren’t alone. :)",5.0,"Estacada Middle School students have started a group called YANA (You Are Not Alone), to address bullying and add to the culture of kindness being built in their school.

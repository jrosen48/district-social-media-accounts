""I don’t have a single favorite or most memorable moment as a teacher. It’s a collective. I appreciate every good and bad with my students. I am their all-knowing teacher; they take everything I say as a hard fact, even if it’s not school work-related. It keeps me conscious of the information I’m giving them. I love knowing that I’m planting life seeds in them. Every day I am rewarded!""",2020-05-07 14:06:21,,

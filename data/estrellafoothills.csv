We’re joining together to keep Arizona’s kids, families, and school communities safe and healthy. Arizona is united, and we’ll get through this. Superintendent Kathy Hoffman

This decision is not made lightly, but it is the right thing to do to bring certainty and consistency to all Arizona schools. With schools closing, we are working together to provide assistance during this time and lessen the impact on all Arizona families.

It’s important for families & parents to know that while this will address operational issues, closing schools will not stop the spread of #COVID19. It is the recommendation of public health officials that kids who are not at school remain at home to the greatest extent possible.

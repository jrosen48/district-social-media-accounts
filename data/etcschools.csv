Teachers, retired teachers, paraprofessionals, school board members, the school liaison officer, the secretary, and administrators practiced social distancing while visiting all 23 seniors' homes on a 138 mile loop around the county. A mini marching band was on hand to play the school song for each student. Graduates were left with a ""Graduate"" sign and a bag of goodies.

We have missed our students tremendously and it was wonderful to see them. We are proud of the Class of 2020!

You may have heard of 3-D movies. You may have even seen one. The D in 3-D stands for dimensional. A dimension is a direction that something can be measured. Flat things can be measured in two ways. They can be measured by length and by width. That’s why flat things are sometimes called 2-D or two-dimensional. Three-dimensional things can be measured in three ways. They can be measured by length and width like flat things. They can also be measured by their height. Height is what lets them come up off the paper or the screen.Three-dimensional shapes in math are called solids.

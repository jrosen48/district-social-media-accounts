The students provided two proposals, a skate park in Eudora and a walking bridge over K-10.

Our students have been learning how to have an impact on their community, what it takes to plan these big projects, and how to communicate their proposals to the city council.

We are very proud of our students and thankful to Mrs. Andrews, as well as our city council members, for making these opportunities possible for our students!

Boy Scouts of America (BSA) is one of the few organizations that the U.S. government has given permission to retire flags.

Kenney wanted to complete this project to provide our community with an easy and appropriate process for those who want to dispose of old flags. His second goal was to educate people on how to respectfully retire U.S. flags as they show signs of wear. In addition, he has had family members serve in the U.S. Armed Forces, including his Great Grandfather. This project is a way to honor those family members as well as all military past, present, and future.

Thank you Kenny!

In preparation for the Wax Museum, students were given a person to research and write a biography. At the Wax Museum, students will remain “in character” as their historical figure for the duration of the display, as parents, teachers, and other students walk around and listen to speeches.

In this assignment, students chose an influential person in Eudora History to study. Students used reading and comprehension skills to conduct research and gather information about their person in class over the course of three weeks. When finished with their papers, students wrote, practiced, and memorized a speech to perform at the final “Wax Museum.""

We hope you can join us!

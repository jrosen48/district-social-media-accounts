Next will be the release times and loading. PreK will release at 3:25 and all other grades will release at 3:35. In the cafeteria parking lot you will enter the far in as usual and be directed through the lot in an S pattern then we will utilize two lanes for pick up, see map. In the MS parking lot you will enter the far end and use a pick up lane and exit lane to leave how you came in. Again see map. Also if grades 2nd and below have an older sibling they will be all grouped together and picked up at the MS gym parking lot/awning instead of having to pick up at two spots. Again we will release K-6 at 3:35. Thank you for your patience as we work through this new process. Please look at the map on Facebook and the Livestream before coming this afternoon.",2020-08-20 12:40:19,,

We need you to come and turn-in all of your school issued equipment and clean out all of your things from the building. Your time is Tuesday, May 19 @ 12:30. We will have a class meeting at 1:30. At that meeting we will discuss plans for graduation.

I know that the end of this year did not turn out the way anyone could have predicted, and that you have missed many things. On a positive note, you will be remembered as a class that had a senior year like no other. I hope that you understand how much everyone up here at school cares about you, and we hope that the graduation we have planned is something you will remember forever. I know that I will. I look forward to seeing all of you tomorrow.

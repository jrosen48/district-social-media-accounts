Every year, we try to help the high school FFA club out by buying their remaining greenhouse stock at the end of the season. We then sell those plants to the community at a great price! This year, we have hostas, hanging fern baskets, a lot of succulents, and a few vegetable plants. Hustle to Hobbies & Homestead at 2100 E. Van Buren from 10-6 every day to pick out some beautiful healthy plants. Tricia shows you what we have available in the video below.

The family of Senior Chief Petty Officer (SEAL) Thomas A. Ratzlaff funds this program from proceeds of The Rat Race which is held in Green Forest each year. This event remembers the 31 heroes lost on 8-6-2011 during Extortion 17.

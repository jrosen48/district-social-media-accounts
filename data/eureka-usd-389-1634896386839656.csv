I hope everyone is doing well. I wanted to send you some information regarding the High School Graduation. The graduation date is July 12th. We will be having the graduation on the football field at 9:30am

I would like to practice on Tuesday morning July 7th at 10:00am to run through what we will be playing for graduation. This will include the special piece that we play with the Seniors, so I will need the Seniors there for the first part of the practice.

We will also practice on Friday, July 10th at 9 am at the football field.

Please let me know if you will or will not be able to make it so that I can plan accordingly.

Thank you,

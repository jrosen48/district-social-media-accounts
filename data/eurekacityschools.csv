We greatly appreciate this group of professionals for all they do for our students, families, and communities.

During the ordered shelter in place, bus drivers are working to make sure students have what they need to be successful in a remote learning environment. In addition to school meal pick-up programs, our bus drivers are providing meal delivery service along the bus routes.

Only one of our sites, the District Office site, will be open while Eureka City Schools is shuttered. That site has alternate hours during the shutter, Monday-Thursday from 11 am - 3 pm. During this time an MFRC staff member will be available at the site by phone (707.441.2404) for resources and referrals. You can also access our food pantry, our hygiene supplies, laundry vouchers, and diapers during those hours. However, these services can only be accessed ""curbside,"" as our site will only be open to the public by appointment so that we can ensure social distance and a safe, sanitized space. Both of our parenting classes, Nurturing Parent Program and the Parent Project, will be postponed until May 2020. Finally, on a limited basis, MFRC staff will be available to do outreach to families that do not have the means to access our site or their child's school site. Thank you for your patience during this unique situation.",2020-03-18 17:34:31,,

Greetings Families,

Today has been another rapidly evolving day with issues related to planning for the coronavirus. We are continuing to be proactive in our efforts to plan for potential school closures. At this point, we still have no known students or staff with the coronavirus and we are continuing to work closely with the Humboldt County Department of Public Health. On Monday, we will have no school due to a planned professional development day for teachers. We will use a portion of this day for our planning for distance learning. Things are changing by the minute, so if we are asked to close schools over the weekend by our Governor or Public Health, we will update you as soon as possible. Please work to develop your home plan if we are forced to close schools.

Greetings all,

Guidance for a response to the coronavirus is evolving at a rapid pace. Early today, we were informed of new direction from the Office of Public Health advising the restriction of group gatherings in excess of 250 people for non-essential activities. However, this does not include schools and they are advising Eureka Schools to stay open. We still have no known cases of coronavirus amongst our staff or students. If you or your children have a fever or respiratory symptoms, please contact your primary medical provider for advice. At this point, we have canceled several events through March and school sites will be communicating out the specific events to you and/or your children. Please remember, schools will be closed on Monday, March 16th for staff professional development. As part of this professional development, staff will be planning for distance learning in the event of a school closure.

Stella Saba and Kodiak Drake rep Eureka High DECA at the 2020 California DECA State Career Development Conference. Testing is done, we've had the afternoon to relax...and we're ready to enjoy the keynote. Learned new dance moves (the sprinkler! the lawn mower! ), and totally motivated to go for a stretch goal thanks to Eddie Slowikowski. Wooohooo!!! Go Loggers!! #CASCDC",2020-03-02 12:35:07,,

#WeAreEurekaCitySchools",,,0.0,"This week was Empathy Week at Eureka High School with various events throughout the week, finishing with Lip Sync Battles today. Below is a clip of Redwood Teen Challenge members performing their lip sync challenge after they shared their very personal stories of triumph over tragedy. Around the 2 minute mark, the Eureka High Students spontaneously join the Teen Challenge members on stage for a very inspirational lip sync to ""Keep Your Head Up"" by Andy Grammer: ""I know it's hard, know it's hard to remember sometimes, but, you gotta keep your head up"". Special thanks to Teen Challenge for their inspiration!

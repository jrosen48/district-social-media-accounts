The Class of 2020 banners are going up tomorrow!

Thank you InterBel Telephone for putting them up with the bucket truck. Really happy with how they turned out and I will post pictures tomorrow after they are up.

I really want to thank again, Glacier Bank and Tammy Lawler for making this happen.

The other day I figured out we were going to be way more upside down then our budget and Mike Cole overheard the conversation of me being worried. He came back that afternoon with a check from Montana Market to cover the remaining costs! Thank you so much Sara Rodriguez Sherwood and BeeGee Cole for this help, I am so lucky to be in your care and I am so appreciative of the support on this project.

Thank you to Keith Taylor for setting up a free photo shoot for any senior that needed or wanted a different picture. That was so kind to help like that. Thank you Wade VanNess for helping get the photos to me and double checking my proofs etc.

Looking forward to seeing the banners downtown tomorrow!",3.0,"Matthew Rumble

I hope this email finds you and your family safe and healthy. Tomorrow, June 29th is our meal distribution. You may pick up meal bags at the High School from 9:00 AM until 11:00 AM. If you cannot make it to the High School, we will be glad to deliver the meals to your home. All I need is the number of bags needed and your address.

Also, as new information about the 2020-2021 school year becomes available, we will pass that information on to you. Currently, the first day of school is set for Wednesday, August 19. We anticipate receiving further guidance from TEA on the in-person learning environment.

I was talking to a parent the other day and I asked her had she applied for the P-EBT and she told me no because she knew already she would not be approved because of income . If your child attends a CEP district then your child is AUTOMATICALLY approved. Eustace ISD is a CEP district . EACH child in the household will receive $285.00 to be spent on food . All you have to do is fill out the application . The application is very simple and only takes only a couple minutes . The deadline is June 30th . I highly recommend that you take advantage of this. If you need any help or have any questions , please let me know .

Dear Parents/Guardians,

I want to inform you that we have had a student test positive for the Covid-19 virus and that the student did participate in the summer workout program. Out of an overabundance of caution, we are suspending the summer workout program until Thursday, July 9, 2020. The suspension also includes the summer cross country workouts.

The district will make sure that all inside areas that were used in the summer workout program will be disinfected beyond what is normally done. Parents are urged to monitor their children for signs of the virus, such as coughing and fever.

I know that our students and coaches were enjoying the summer workout program. This is not an end to the program, just a two-week pause. If you have any questions, please let me know.

I hope this email finds you safe and healthy. At this time, I am unsure whether the meal boxes have started being delivered. Therefore, we will proceed under the assumption that they have not and will plan on a meal distribution as we did last week.
We will be doing our meal distribution tomorrow from 9:00 AM until 11:00 AM at the High School. If you need the meal bags, but cannot make it to the High School, the meal bags will be delivered to your home. All I need is your address and the number of meal bags needed. I will be in a meeting from 9:00 AM until around 10:00 AM, so the meal bags will be delivered a little later than usual.
If there is anything else that we may do for you, please do not hesitate to let us know.

Dear Parents/Guardians,

I hope this email finds you safe and healthy. We will be doing our meal pick up tomorrow. The High School site will be open from 9:00 AM until 11:00 AM. The remote sites will be available from 9:30 AM until 10:30 AM.

If you cannot make it to the High School or one of the remote sites, we will be glad to deliver the meals to your home. All I need is your address and the number of meal bags.

A reminder that the baccalaureate service and graduation ceremony have been moved. The baccalaureate service will be Wednesday, May 27 at 8:00 PM at Bulldog Stadium. The graduation ceremony will be Saturday, May 30 at 9:00 AM. These moves were necessary because of the regional bass tournament being on June 6.

Again, I thank you for your patience, understanding, and cooperation in all of this.

If you need anything, or we may do anything for you, please do not hesitate to let us know.

Dear Parents/Guardians,

I hope everyone is having a happy, safe, and healthy Easter. A quick reminder about the meal pick up for tomorrow. Meals will be distributed at the High School awning from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM. Meals will be distributed at the remote sites from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM. If you are unable to come to the school or to one of the remote sites, please let me know and arrangements will be made to bring the meals to you.

I anticipate that we will hear something about the Meals to You Program this week.

If there is anything else that we may do for you, please let us know and we will do our best to help. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

First, I want to thank everyone for their patience and cooperation with yesterday's meal pick up. A total of 1,096 meal bags were picked up.

Second, I want to update you about the school closure. At this time, we have not received word that Governor Abbott will extend the closure; however, I do not believe that we are in a position to even think about opening schools up again. With that, Eustace ISD will remain closed until further notice. I believe that this is the only decision possible to ensure that our students, staff, and community remain healthy.

EISD will continue to provide meals and instructional support for our students throughout the closure. I know that there will be challenges for families because of the extended closure. Please let us know if there is anything we can do to help.

Again, I thank you for your patience and understanding in this ever changing situation.

EMS Students and Guardians,

We will be passing out devices and packets tomorrow (3/30) from 9-11 am. We will be set up under the awning in the bus loop. Please follow the signs, as we have it set-up so you will pull around the bus loop with your driver side door towards the awning. Please do not get out of your car for any reason. All devices and packets have been disinfected and packaged up for your safety. We will be wearing gloves and masks also for your safety. More than likely it will be raining, but that will not stop us.

This is not a time to request a device or packet, all requests must go through your student’s homeroom teacher and we will contact you to set up a time to help you.

Due to meal count numbers, please plan on picking up your weekly meal boxes from your normal locations.

Please be patient as we will get them out to you as quickly as possible.

Thanks,

The Summer Meals to You program is what we participated in last summer where the boxes of food arrived every week at your home.

Good afternoon parents and students! As you know, we were originally scheduled to begin school tomorrow and Governor Abbott has closed schools through at least April 3rd. This, however, does not mean that we will not be providing students with instruction.

As we will have to completely redesign our instructional methods, the state has insisted that we take time to plan appropriately. We will be taking time this week to do just that. As soon as we have a well-articulated plan, we will communicate it to you. We anticipate being able to do so by the end of the week.

Thank you for your patience while we work to continue providing a world-class education to our students!",5.0,"Eustace High School

I know that there are many questions and concerns regarding COVID-19 and the closure of our school. With our Spring Break coming to a close, we will be spending this next week making and finalizing plans to introduce our distance learning platforms. Please be patient with us as we work hard to put plans in place that will serve everyone's needs. We will be sending out a survey to gather information so we can tailor instruction as much as possible. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please email your child's teacher or myself at jgray@eustaceisd.net. We will do our best in answering your questions and addressing your concerns. Thank you for your support as we all learn through this process together.

Governor Abbott has issued an order closing all schools in the state until at least April 3rd. All EISD facilities will be closed for any purpose until we get the clearance to resume.

We also received an email from UIL that states that the earliest any type of UIL activity could resume is Monday, May 4.

Our administrative team and food service team will be meeting today to determine the best way to get food to our students within the guidelines allowed.
We will also be talking about remote learning possibilities for our students.

Kooper has been diagnosed with Periventricular Leukomalacia (PVL) with a second and third diagnosis of Cerebral Palsy and mild to moderate developmental delay. As a child with PVL gets older, seizures are usually part of the deal. While he has had several Grand Mal Seizures, he primarily suffers from silent seizures.

Over the past few days, we have been carefully monitoring the number of absences throughout the district. While we thought we were seeing some improvement at the middle of this week, that improvement did not last. Today, we have 163 students absent. This does not include the ones that have been sent home today for not feeling well. We are also seeing an increasing number of staff members that are coming down with flu-like symptoms. As a result, we are going to take advantage of the three day weekend that was already scheduled and turn it into a four day weekend by canceling all classes for Friday, January 12.
We have GermBlast schedule to be here on Monday. They will be providing treatments to all the buildings in the district, as well as our buses. I apologize for any inconvenience this cancellation may cause. I feel this to be in the best interest of our students and staff.

Some high school students in upper grades may suddenly be unable to login to their district Google account if they are not using the “default” password we routinely assign them. If you hear of a student having this problem please let them know their password is their 2-digit class/grad-year followed by their 6-digit student ID/lunch number.

Recent account maintenance included resetting passwords; however, students in lower grades and campuses should not have a problem, since they cannot change them from default.

Please call or refer them to me if there are still problems or questions.

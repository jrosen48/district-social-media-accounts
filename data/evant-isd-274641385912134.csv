They have been working so hard all year to ensure that each student gets all they need to grow and learn, and nothing is going to stop them now! In case you didn’t know, Evant ISD has the BEST teachers in the whole world!!! A couple days ago, we gave the teachers an incredible challenge to put together instructional packets/online courses in a matter of a few hours and they did it, and did it quite well I might add! Now, we are asking them to do this yet again! Without a single question or complaint, they are jumping in to help students and help each other in whatever way they can - and for that, I am so grateful! Our kids are in the best hands - so THANK YOU TEACHERS & STAFF, you guys ROCK!!!! We appreciate you all so much! I’m super proud to be an Evant Elk!

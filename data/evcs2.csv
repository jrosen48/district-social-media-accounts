My colleagues and I are teaming up with Dave's Christmas Wonderland and the South Line Fire Company to host a contact-free food drive benefiting FeedMore WNY Saturday, May 23rd from 10am-1pm at Dave's French Road Store. FeedMore has seen an increased need for donations lately and could use your help to continue feeding families throughout Western New York!

Items sought include: canned fruits and vegetables, and shelf stable proteins such as peanut butter or canned chicken or fish. Any and all donations would be greatly appreciated!",2020-05-21 14:29:22,,

EVCS thanks Nurse Dana and Nurse Tracy for our successful facemask campaign. Facemasks may help limit exposure where social distancing might be an obstacle.

So many EVCS families at both campuses offered monetary help or donations of fabric and sewing supplies and our sewing volunteers made hundreds of masks. We have distributed almost 500 masks in total and will end up with enough masks to offer to our staff and their families if they are in need.

It was an honor to recently accept the 2020 Breakfast Hero award from the national anti-hunger campaign No Kid Hungry. Being one of just six recipients throughout the United States to receive this award, coupled with the Governor signing my Breakfast After the Bell bill into law earlier this month, made this recognition particularly special.

I am thrilled that we were able to get Breakfast After the Bell across the finish line this session for the thousands of kids across the Commonwealth who are in need of a nutritious start to their days. I firmly believe that we can have the best teachers, facilities, and technology in our classrooms, but if our kids are showing up for school hungry, they simply cannot be ready to learn. Thank you to No Kid Hungry for this recognition- I truly could not have done it without the help and advocacy of so many incredible organizations!",0.0,"Congratulations, Senator DiDomenico!

""EPS is moving quickly but carefully toward holding our drive through graduation ceremony. To make this a reality, the district must adhere to mandatory safety precautions recently issued by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. The guidelines require intense and detailed planning by school and city officials. But we're making progress with this cooperative effort. In fact, Everett just successfully completed an extra approval process in our steps to make live graduation a reality.

Good Morning Last night was going to be the Annual Memorial Day Tribute Concert that was started by Mr Kelleher nearly 30 years ago at the Centre School in Everett. It was one of the biggest events in Annually held in the Everett Public Schools. Unfortunately it was cancelled along with the other 5 concerts presented by the Everett Music Department. But thanks to the hard work of Charlotte Grande and Penny Yebba a Program was printed with all the student names and music selections. Not all has been lost.
This weekend is Memorial Day please say thank you to a Veteran and for this year our front line workers of EMTs Nurses Doctors custodians Police Fire.

Incredible turnout at today‚Äôs Lift Our Kids MA Coalition‚Äôs event to collect shoes and socks for families in need! Representative Marjorie Decker and I, working in partnership with the Lift MA Kids coalition, are the lead sponsors of legislation to lift families out of deep poverty. The term deep poverty applies to families living below half the federal poverty line. To illustrate, this equates to only $905 for a family of 3. It is unconscionable that we have 50,000 children living so far below the poverty line in our Commonwealth. Far too often, children living in deep poverty go without the basic items they need, including things like shoes and socks. We can‚Äì and must‚Äì do better, and we can start by passing S.36/H.102 this legislative session.

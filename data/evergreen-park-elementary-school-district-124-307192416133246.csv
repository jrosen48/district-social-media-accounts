Throwback Thursday. Five years ago tonight, D124AA hosted our first girls' basketball games ever at Southeast. All three of our 5th Grade teams played that night. While we don't remember what all the teams did that night, we know they had fun and we know they are better athletes for having been a part of it.

Not all from that night, but here are pics of the three teams.

Hopefully we will be back out there soon!

This year, the attorneys at McCready Law were able to give away $100 gift cards to five local teachers in our community in an effort to help them obtain the necessary supplies to have a successful school year. These wonderful teachers were nominated by fellow members of the community and their stories touched our hearts tremendously. It is an honor to be able to give back and help individuals who give so much to others. #McCreadyLaw

Congratulations to our second nomination & teacher, Allie Grazevich who works at Southwest Elementary for the Evergreen Park Elementary School District 124. Check back tomorrow to see if it is your favorite teacher!

From Allie Grazevich:
I am beyond humbled by the generosity of McCready Law firm. As all teachers use their own money to enhance classroom environment for students, I am thankful for this fund that is being provided for my fourth grade students and myself. It is amazing to be a part of a community that looks to give back to education. I am beyond grateful for McCready Law firm for providing this opportunity to me. Thank you!",2.0,"McCready Law

The Board of Education approved the annual celebration during its Oct. 16 meeting, when Southeast School fifth-grade student Kyle Croft presented the idea as a way to remember a former classmate.

Croft spoke to the Board and community about his desire to honor Alan J. Reyes-Landeweer each year on his birthday. He came up with the idea following a Memorial Bench Dedication at Southeast School, when he asked Principal Tim Sheldon if the school could celebrate his friend each year on Sept. 26.

The Board and District are now taking the thought one step further, establishing an official Kindness Day at all five schools moving forward. On this day, students will discuss what kindness means to them, work on projects dealing with kindness, complete service projects, or find other ways to spread kindness in honor of Alan J. Reyes-Landeweer.

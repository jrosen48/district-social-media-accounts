He lived a long life, he lived a good life and I know the world is a better place for having him in it.

Gina's Operation Santa was created to coordinate participation in the Chicago Sun-Times Letter to Santa Program. Through their school or a nonprofit agency, kids write letters to Santa, asking for their dream gift. For many of the children the gift received through this program is the only gift they will get. Gina became involved with the program around 20 years ago by responding to just 2 letters. Along with a team of elves, Gina’s Operation Santa has grown every year.

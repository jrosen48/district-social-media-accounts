Evergreen Families,

We can't wait for Monday! Below are some final updates and reminders as we prepare to welcome students on-site.

Classroom Welcome Videos
Since we cannot host a traditional Student Experience Day this year, teachers will be calling families and making classroom welcome videos. Classroom Welcome Videos will be posted over the next few days.

Daily Health Screenings from Home
Please carefully read page 19 of our COVID-19 Guidelines and Procedures regarding screening your child each day before school. If your child can answer ""Yes"" to any of the health screening questions, please keep your child at home.

Remember to WWW!
Help protect yourself and others, Wolverines!
Wash your hands!
Watch your distance!
Wear your face covering!

Thank you again to everyone for your continued patience, flexibility, and grace.

See you Monday!

One of our elementary teachers sent us this message today:

“I have been blown away by my class this week. We have been doing [Google] meets every afternoon, and these kids are amazing! We address homework questions first and then the daily focus. Today was reading, and we discussed the novels that students were reading. The kids understand norms and would mute themselves and ask to speak next through messenger. It’s pretty incredible how diverse learning can be. We then took some time to do some of the normal stuff that we do in class which is a game called ‘would you rather.’ The thing that struck me the most and had me in tears was that they see this as any other classroom. We were getting to the end of our meeting one student said, “Tomorrow is Friday. I was wondering if we could still do free write and in the afternoon if our meeting could be Author’s Chair like we always do on Friday.”

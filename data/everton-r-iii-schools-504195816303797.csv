I come to you late but worth posting now.
Just got home from Prom.
Great Night!!
I’ve made posts in the past regarding what a great group of kids we have in our Everton community. Even personnel from other school districts have commended our kids for their manners and politeness.
Well I want to give a “Big Shout Out” to our kids tonight. Not ONE problem or issue!
No Wake Cafe was the scene for Prom action. We were supposed to be done at 9:00.
The majority of our kids were still going strong after 9:00. The DJ kept the music rolling, the staff at No Wake was in no hurry for us to leave. I believe it was around 9:30 when last dance was called.
Just simply a great night!
THANK YOU to: Holly Fifer for most of the “leg work”. Kim Gladden for getting crowns, sashes and ballots. Dewitt Fifer, Lacey Daniels, Caleb Daniels and Lexie Scott for their efforts.
Thank you to No Wake Cafe and our DJ.
THANK YOU EVERTON PROM goers!
Stay tuned as Mr. Daniels will get pictures posted soon!

Everton FFA Members, Agriculture Students and Families,

As many of you may know, my husband, Anthony, and I had our baby boy this past December.

Dawson was born 11 weeks early, weighing only 2.5 pounds. Due to this unforeseen situation, we were in the neonatal intensive care unit for 64 days with our son. Thankfully he is doing really well and we have been home for a little over a month now.

With how premature Dawson’s lungs are, we are unable to leave him in someone else’s care until he is much older. This unfortunately ends my journey with Everton FFA and Agriculture Department.

It has been such a joy to be part of your community, and I will greatly miss being your FFA Advisor.

FFA Members, never stop advancing your leadership skills through FFA. You’ll never regret the experiences you have in your corduroy jacket.
I truly wish the best for all of you.

Thank you for providing me with such a great teaching experience!

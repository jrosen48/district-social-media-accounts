Dear Friends in Orange,

Attached is a link to the Schematic Design presentation we gave the the Building Committee last Thursday. The presentation contains all the project cost data that we now have from the state.
We are very please to report that MSBA has committed to spend over $34 million on our project!
I will also post a finance snapshot which contains the cost data and other important cost information.

We will be holding other public forums in the future... most likely, given the current health crisis, online and through AOTV. Stay tuned.

As always, feel free to reach out if you have questions

Many have been asking me if they can read my book in its entirety to their students online. Here’s my answer: I can’t legally give you permission for that. It’s a publisher copyright/license (they sell rights for audio books,etc.) It’s also why I am only sharing a single chapter or story from my books in my YouTube clips. (https://m.youtube.com/user/gracepacy)

HOWEVER, if it is a closed stream, just for your students and is not saved or archived, I, personally, think it is fine.

For example, for my daughter’s book club we will be meeting everyday by zoom and I will be reading aloud a couple chapters a day, non-recorded. I can’t imagine anyone being upset with that as it’s pretty much the same as our in-person meeting.

So, yes, please share my books! I want you too! Share everyone’s books! But please do it responsibly so authors will still be able eat after this is all over. 😳❤️🤞",0.0,"YOUTUBE.COM

The Orange Elementary PTO has been selected as beneficiaries of April's Hannaford Community Bags. That means for every reusable Community Bag purchased at the 150 New Athol Road Hannaford's in April $1 will be sent to support our kids! There is a Giving Tag on each bag, so that if you buy a bag at another Hannaford location or buy one another time during the year (and complete the required steps within 7 days) you can still direct that $1 to go to the Orange Elementary PTO! It sounds easier to just buy any bags you might need in Athol in April, but it's nice to know that you can direct your donations later in the year if you need more bags later ;) Help the environment by using reusable bags and help your children by support a group that supports the.

2020-02-26 Dexter Park Office Update

The office at Dexter Park will be put back together soon! The steam pipe that was leaking and causing watermarks was replaced over the vacation week. No mold was found to be present either.

During the pipe repair, it was discovered that some concrete work in the foundation has deteriorated. The town’s structural engineer along with the building inspector determined there is no danger to staff and students. We are however, ensuring due diligence by contracting with a commercial-grade structural engineer who will do a more detailed analysis and provide us with specifics for next steps.

More to follow.

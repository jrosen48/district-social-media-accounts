An activity from your school counselor:

Make a collage on a poster, construction paper, or anything else that you have. Be creative! Here are some options for your collage: ""I can stay calm"" collage, ""I can stay busy"" collage, or ""I can set goals"" collage. Use old magazines or newspapers, print the pics, or draw them.

I pray that everyone is staying safe, happy, and healthy during this time.

RE: Tropical Storm Gordon

My Staff and I are continuing to monitor weather conditions with local officials.

Currently, the decision is—all Evangeline Parish Public Schools are open tomorrow—Tuesday, September 4, 2018.

We will continue our discussions with personnel from the National Weather Service (NWS) and Evangeline Parish 911/Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP).

While we are planning for our schools to be open throughout this week, we will notify the public of any changes that would prompt any school closures.

Stay tuned to area TV stations, KVPI radio, The Gazette, EPSB’s website & Facebook page, and other media outlets for updates.

Thanks to all families that provided valuable feedback by completing last night's questionnaire. This information is very helpful as we continue to plan and prepare for the reopening of schools.

At this point we have had over 10,000 responses, with 85% of families selecting the Learning at School option and 15% of families considering the EVSC Virtual Academy. Another part of the questionnaire deals with bus transportation. We are encouraging families to provide morning and afternoon transportation to help reduce the number of students on school buses.

Bosse’s Class of 1947 made a caring decision this week to donate their class treasury balance to Benjamin Bosse High School. Their funds will address the most pressing needs of BHS students during this time of economic hardship.

“We would like Bosse's principal, Aaron Huff, to take care of students who may need a little extra help” shares Jack Buttrum, Class of ’47. “Our class is also challenging other classes and alumni groups to do the same. Not only at Bosse, but at all EVSC high schools. If we join together in this effort, schools and students have greater potential to avoid hardships.”

What’s the power of classical music?

1,200 students, a 50 minute presentation … and you could hear a pin drop!

Thanks to EVSC (Evansville Vanderburgh School Corporation) schools for arranging this event and busing in string students from all around the district. It’s thrilling to see such an active string program, and the effects are palpable! Congratulations! - RBP

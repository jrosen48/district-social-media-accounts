Hey, Red Devils! Would you like to get involved with ASB and help improve our school culture? Then YOU should consider running for a position as a Class Officer! The positions are President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Activities Coordinator. As a Class Officer, you will be a part of the ASB Council and will have the opportunity to make a positive change in our school and help plan activities and events. If you are interested, please fill out the Petition to Run for Elected Office in Google Drive. You will need to open the document, make a copy of your own (go to File, pull down to “make a copy” and save it on your own drive), and then share it with Mr. Duerre, EVHS ASB Advisor, when you have filled it out. If you have questions, please contact Mr. Duerre at duerre.michael@evsd90.org. Petitions are due by MONDAY, MAY 11.

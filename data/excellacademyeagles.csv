From building out critical hospital capacity to launching a landmark testing strategy, Minnesota has made meaningful progress in preparing for the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Minnesotans have made this possible by staying home and holding down the rate of infection.

But now is not the time for sudden movements. There’s more work to be done. We need to keep this virus at a simmer, not a boil. We must prioritize the safety of Minnesotans while taking cautious, strategic steps toward getting people safely back to work.

Our Stay Home Order has been extended until May 18. While retail businesses can begin offering curbside pickup on Monday, we’re asking Minnesotans to continue to stay home, practice social distancing, and wear cloth masks as we turn the dial toward reopening society. #StayHomeMN",0.0,"Our Stay home Order has been extended to May 18th.

Completely free, no other purchase is necessary. Just ask for a manager and we will be happy to make it happen.

If you are concerned about ensuring your children have lunch, stop by Granite City Food and Brewery. Every kid can receive a free lunch that contains a turkey sandwich, chips, and applesauce. Completely free, no other purchase is necessary. Just ask for a manager and we will be happy to make it happen.

Valid at Granite City Food and Brewery in Maple Grove, Minnesota.

If you're in one of my biology classes,

Tomorrow morning (Wednesday the 15th) at 10 AM, I will be hosting an online video meeting, either through Zoom or Google Meet, for anybody who would like some help with this week's assignment. I'll have a few new examples that we can go through, and we'll go through the slides and see if there's a spot that gives a lot of trouble.

I apologize for the lateness of this reminder - I posted about a meeting in a comment on Google Classroom last night. Usually Classroom sends e-mails when I comment like that, but did not this time.

If you don't see this in time, that's perfectly okay. It's not going to hurt you at all if you don't attend the meeting. If you don't attend and hit some trouble, make sure you e-mail me and tell me specifically what's messing you up (I check my mail lots of times throughout the day).

I hope everybody's doing okay and staying safe through the remainder of the wellness break. I look forward to seeing you online tomorrow.

My assignments for MS Language Arts for this week (4/13 due 4/20) are posted in Google Classroom and available in paper packet form in the lunch pick up line at Exeter School.

The paper packet from previous weeks are also there in case they are needed. Paper packets can be returned to school. I will come pick them up there.

April is National Poetry Month, so each class is reading a poem and constructing a poem. There is also a reading/writing survey included.

Please remind students to check their email for reminders and check-ins every so often.

Last week we had the privilege of working with Exeter School District to put together a fire safety class for the entire school! Traditionally every year we talk with students during fire prevention week in October and we will continue to do so! However we felt it necessary to take on the task of refreshing and educating the whole school. Simple fire safety and planning is often forgotten about and not implemented like it should! We appreciate Exeter School for helping us with the planning and coordinating to get the whole school involved!

As we prepare to begin the school year virtually, our goal is to ensure that your child is prepared for success. Providing students with resources to support their online learning experience is an important part of our virtual learning plan. Therefore, the District will be creating learning resources for students in Grades K-4. These learning resources will include, but are not limited to, books, math manipulatives, workbooks, and Fundations materials for our K-2 learners. Additionally, we will be distributing devices to families. Exeter Township School District understands that we may have families that do not have internet access; therefore, the District will have hotspots for families in need of this support. More information will be forthcoming regarding the distribution of those items.

As we prepare to begin the school year virtually, our goal is to ensure that your child is prepared for success. Providing students with resources to support their online learning experience is an important part of our virtual learning plan. Therefore, the District will be creating learning resources for students in Grades K-4. These learning resources will include, but are not limited to, books, math manipulatives, workbooks, and Fundations materials for our K-2 learners. Additionally, we will be distributing devices to families. Exeter Township School District understands that we may have families that do not have internet access; therefore, the District will have hotspots for families in need of this support. More information will be forthcoming regarding the distribution of those items.

Your Partners in Education,

Dr. Christy Haller
Mr. Ted Isselmann

The distribution of student belongings scheduled for next week has been Postponed at this time. Unfortunately, Governor Wolf’s decision to extend social distancing and closures to control the spread of Covid-19 has prompted this cancelation.

At this time it is our hope that once these restrictions have been eased that we will be able to reinstate our distribution plan.

I wanted to reach out and let everyone know that May 8, a date currently listed on the District calendar as a Teacher In-Service Day, will no longer be an in-service day and will be a normal instructional day instead. At this time of the year and given the unique circumstances all districts are facing, we felt it was in the best interest of all our students and their learning to make this decision. Please note that this calendar change does increase the number of student days from 180 to 181. That said, we believe that the additional day of instruction will prove beneficial to all students, especially given the uncertain times in which we live. Additionally, please be aware that June 5 is still the last student day of the year.

In closing, we appreciate your ongoing support of your children as we work through virtual learning together, and please join me in thanking all of our teachers for their hard work and dedication today and throughout Teacher Appreciation Week.

Please know that at this time there has been no new news out of Harrisburg about extending this closure; we are awaiting more news about that in the near future. I am happy to hear that families are taking advantage of the instructional packets that were distributed to the buildings yesterday. We just sent out the last of the hard copy materials to the buildings and they are now available for pick up at your convenience. We will have copies of all hard copy materials to access on our website in the near future. We have also placed many instructional resources that you can access on our website and more are being added daily.

Please know we are constantly communicating with our local, state, and federal agencies and taking every precaution to keep our staff safe and our students supported. Please keep watching the District website for continued updates.

Over the past month, Ms. Seeberger has taught a ""Cool Down Lesson"" in each classroom. The focus of the lesson was on using tools to help us ""Cool Down"" when we have big, intense emotions that are distracting us in school. She introduced to the students a cool down box that they will have access to in their classrooms (K will be introduced in the spring!). Each student practiced how to use the tools and consider what works best for them! The lesson finished with a trip to our brand new sensory path in the library hallway! All students K-4 had the chance to go through the pathway and practice using it to help them ""Cool Down"". Our students experience lots of emotions everyday and we know it is important to teach them about self-regulation and how to advocate for themselves when they need a break. We hope these new tools will benefit our school and allow each student to feel successful at Lorane and we are thankful to our partners at J.P.

In order to conduct an effective public relations program, the Exeter Township School District shares news about activities and events that occur within the schools. To do this, names and photos of students might be placed in district publications, as well as names, photos, and video images could appear in the local media.

Respecting the right to privacy, parents/guardians are asked to notify the student’s school office if there are any objections to their child’s name, photo, or video image appearing in district publications (including the web site) or in the local media.

It will be assumed that parental / guardian permission for the above activities is granted for the 2019-2020 school term unless a written denial of permission is provided by the parent or guardian and on file in the child’s school.

At about 9:40 pm, we were made aware of a potential threat of violence toward the Junior High School made by a student via social media. Immediate action was taken by the School Administration and the Exeter Police Department upon receiving the information to investigate, and appropriate actions have been taken to ensure the safety of all students.

While the threat was determined to be not credible, we want to make you aware of the situation and inform you that the district and police will have a heightened security presence today. We would also like to thank the individuals who reported the threat to administration. The safety of our students and employees is our top priority.

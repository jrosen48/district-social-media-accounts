Thursday the elementary building will be open from 8:00 -12:00 for parents to come and pick up their child/children's packet that their teacher has prepared for them. These packets have conference papers as well as resources that can be used while we are not in school. 2nd-5th grade students will also be able to take their chrome books home. After Thursday there will be no access to the building for students or staff. This is the time the custodial staff will be busy deep cleaning the building. There will be no exceptions.

We ask that you come at the allotted time according to your child's last name. If you are unable to come at the allotted time you may come at a different time. We are just trying to spread out the crowd to keep the line moving. If Thursday doesn't work at all for you, you'll have to make arrangements to have someone else pick them up.

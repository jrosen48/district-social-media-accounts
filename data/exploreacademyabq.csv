For those of you who have picked up your PowerSchool credentials, you can now log on and see your schedule.

There were a couple of classes that got dissolved over the summer, so check your schedule for gaps. If you find any, schedule an appointment with Ms Barreras to enroll into a class. If she doesn't see you in time to fix the problem, report to the front office during that timeframe for instructions.

If the schedule doesn't look correct in any other way, please let me know immediately!

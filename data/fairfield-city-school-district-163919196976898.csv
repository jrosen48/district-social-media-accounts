COVID-19 converted Friday night’s Fairfield-Middletown football game – without a doubt – into perhaps the oddest Indians home opener ever.

But one thing remained the same for The Tribe, thank goodness … victory.

The Indians – behind the first-half four touchdowns and 207 yards rushing/83 yards passing of freshman QB Talon Fisher, and the 243 yards of rushing of senior RB Malik Tate – crushed the Middies, 35-13. Also scoring in the first half was sophomore RB Kavi Bivins.

The Indians move to 1-1 overall, tied with Colerain and Sycamore for 4th place in the GMC.

Do you know what the traffic laws are when students get on and off buses? Motorists are required to stop at least 10 feet in front of or behind a school bus when flashing lights and an extended arm are displayed and cannot resume driving until the school bus begins moving. Those traveling on two or three lanes, all lanes must stop.

In Ohio, on four or more lanes of traffic, only the traffic traveling in the same direction must stop. The Fairfield Police Department also reminds motorists to plan ahead and allow extra time for school bus stops.",21.0,"A great reminder from our friends at the Fairfield Police Department about Ohio’s school bus laws.

There are far too many child fatalities due to heat strokes from being locked in a hot car. There was a record high of 51 deaths in 2018. Since 1998, Ohio has had twenty reported deaths – the largest number of accidents in any northern state. The students developed a device that detects an unknown weight remaining in the car seat of a vehicle, which connects to an app that alerts car owners before they move too far away from the vehicle.

“I'm so excited to celebrate the accomplishments of these 4th and 5th graders at Fairfield Compass Elementary school who were recognized at last night’s school board meeting. During remote learning, many 4th and 5th graders were asked to log in to a program called IXL. IXL is an online program where students work through questions in the areas of reading and math.

Hello parents/guardians,

This is unfortunately the last week of the school year.

A few weeks ago I put together an official, unofficial digital Art Fair for the students and set it to post on YouTube this morning. I thought it would be nice for them to see their work displayed somehow.

There are 5 new videos (no assignments) for the students to enjoy, plus one final video message.

Try to have a good and safe summer.

Mr. Cobbs Art",5.0,"A Message to West Elementary Families from Art Teacher Michael Cobbs...

Hello parents/guardians,

This is unfortunately the last week of the school year.

A few weeks ago I put together an official, unofficial digital Art Fair for the students and set it to post on YouTube this morning. I thought it would be nice for them to see their work displayed somehow.

There are 5 new videos (no assignments) for the students to enjoy, plus one final video message.

Try to have a good and safe summer.

Expand her world—from home! Your kindergartner will try new and exciting things. She’ll make friends, grow in confidence, and build skills that will help her in school and beyond. You don't need to wait for schools to reopen or kindergarten to begin—she can start now and participate in our virtual Girl Scout troop meetings and programs.
The best part? You’ll get to join the fun right alongside her as she plays, learns, and grows with the help of other caring adult volunteers. It’s all waiting for her at Girl Scouts!

We hope you are doing well and staying safe! We know many of you are anxious to find out more information about cheerleading tryouts and what format we are using this year.

The coaching staff has decided that due to students not returning to school this year, we will be doing virtual tryouts. These tryouts will be for BOTH football and basketball cheerleading.

In order to get all information out to families and ensure that we are reaching as many athletes as possible, we are asking that you share your contact information using the google form linked below. This will help us to quickly send out information about the tryout process as we move forward.

Today the Fairfield City School District Food Service Department with the help of teachers, administrators, and community volunteers served 1,200 students a total of 6,000 lunches and 6,000 breakfasts. As we prepared for the meal system today, we based the number of lunches prepared on the number that were prepared and served prior to spring break.

The preparation and coordination of this system is challenging due to COVID-19 restrictions and obstacles. We met today to review plans and increase our prepared lunches and breakfasts to provide meals for over 2,000 children. This is an increase of nearly 80% of what we prepared for today.

As families plan to pick up food for their children next week we suggest you arrive as early to the 11 a.m. start time as possible, as the meals are provided on a first-come, first-served basis.

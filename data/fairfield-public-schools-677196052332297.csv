I hope this finds you and yours well.

I am writing to share a new video. It is the first of ten from a series entitled, Schools Cannot Do It Alone. I will send one a month throughout the year.

These videos are informative, entertaining, and inspiring. Each is designed to give you a better understanding of how our schools contribute to the health and well being of our entire community. I know you will enjoy them.

This first clip is fourteen minutes long. It provides a review of the challenges we face, old and new. There are no ads. No one is collecting data of any kind.

Every day, our staff and Board work hard to prepare the children of our community to thrive and prosper as adults. But as the title of the video series suggests, we cannot succeed without your understanding, trust, and support. And the truth is, we all have a vested interest in increasing student success whether or not we have children in school.

Here is the direct link: https://player.vimeo.com/video/445589485

Enjoy and have a great day.

The school is looking for helpers at some of our athletic games as a result in changes due to Covid 19.

One area we are looking for help would be with ticket taking for Volleyball (Fall Season) and Basketball (Winter Season). If you are interested, please contact Brenda Evans or Mike Schmidt at the school. Here are some of the incentives????

1. High Wages (Competitive in the world of professional ticket taking)
2. Great View (We actually will have the ticket booths in the gym doorway so the game is 100 percent visible, so ticket takers will be able to watch the games)

Please let me know if you are interested in taking tickets.

Have a great week.

I have included the link to the Fairfield Spectator guidelines that have now been updated.

Please look over the rules and procedures.

In addition, we will have parking available on a limited basis on the south end of the football field. Handicap, elderly, high risk individuals and family members will be given priority for the spots we have available. If you would like a parking spot you will need to email/text to be put on the list: I have received one request as of noon on Wednesday. Thank you.

EMAIL: mschmidt@fairfield.k12.mt.us
TEXT: 406.590.2677

Please remember that the east side of the football field, the east porta-potties and the east parking lot are reserved for the visiting team. We are trying to keep the home/visitor crowds separate.

Senior Night will take place at 6:45pm with introductions and kickoff to immediately follow.

If you have any questions, please contact the school.

Our first home football game will be this Friday, September 4th. It is a change from the original schedule due to Covid-19 related issues in Missoula County. It also will be our SENIOR NIGHT as we recognize the contributions of our seniors and their parents.

This year, with Covid 19 being a major concern, there will be some different protocols in effect. We will post the football guidelines when they are updated tomorrow.

However, one of those changed protocols is the elderly and handicap parking we have offered in the past on the SOUTH end of the field. Anyone who would like to request to park their vehicle on the field will need to contact me at:

mschmidt@fairfield.k12.mt.us

In order to service our handicapped, elderly and FAMILY members, first, we will be strictly enforcing this change to parking on the south end of the football field. We want to ensure the safety of everyone who needs to attend the game with a priority of those above.

If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know.

Hopefully the time you are spending with your family is good and you are using this time to communicate and bond. Also hope some of you escaped by going on a virtual field trip to some place cool!
It's always hard to get back into the swing of school after an extended break and Tuesday morning will not be an exception, but look on the bright side, you only have to go from 8am to 12pm and you don't have to drive!
I would like to ask all parents and students to please continue where we left off. Attendance has been excellent and school work has been pretty good. We have to power through now and make the best of this together.
We are all grateful for the words of encouragement many of you have sent. We will continue to work hard to get through this and provide the best education we can.

HELENA—The Office of Public Instruction and Montana University System announced today that Montana juniors will have the opportunity to take the ACT free of charge this coming fall semester of their senior year. Normally, current juniors would take the ACT in the spring as Montana’s statewide standardized test for federal accountability. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak and Montana’s pending waiver request from standardized tests, it is likely that juniors will not be taking the ACT this spring.

“In this time of uncertainty, Montana students, families, and educators should be focused on their health and safety not fulfilling standardized test requirements,” Superintendent of Public Instruction Elsie Arntzen said Tuesday. “I am pleased that Montana high school students who wish to take the ACT in pursuit of post-secondary education will have the opportunity to take it free of charge this fall.”",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2993130260738853&id=677196052332297,,0.0,"Office of Public Instruction, Montana University System Announce Free ACT Opportunities for Students

When in doubt 🛑 STOP when you see a school bus with red lights and a stop arm extended.

Indiana state law requires motorists to stop when a school bus is picking up or dropping off children. Watch for school buses with the stop arm extended and flashing red lights, which means STOP, not proceed with caution.

This law applies to all roadways except those that are divided by a physical barrier or an unimproved median. On a divided roadway, one with a concrete, metal, or grass median, only vehicles traveling in the same direction as the school bus are required to stop.

A turn lane is not considered a median, and as a general rule, if you can easily drive over it, it is not a median.

Please know that conversations and planning for a variety of scenarios are happening for the fall semester at Fairfield Schools. These include both in person and distance learning. It is our desire that schools be back in-person in the fall, but there's still much to be determined. Any plan will depend not only on what's happening in our community and Elkhart County, but also what's happening in Indiana and surrounding states.

The Indiana Department of Education and Gov. Eric Holcomb will eventually issue guidelines at a state level that may redirect efforts we pursue. We will look at options and make preliminary plans while we wait for this guidance. Unfortunately, for now plans for the fall are very fluid. We don’t have enough information or data at this time to say what we’re going to do. Rest assured that all stakeholders including the Elkhart County Health Department will be involved in the process.

Thanks so much for your patience and perseverance as we move forward!

Both classes ended the same way - students were asking their teacher if they could “keep going”. They were working on challenging tasks and were not ready to quit.

In the first class, students were challenged to find multiple ways to create a cube using only 6 faces. The students were busy brainstorming, collaborating, and cutting. Many times, they would find their end result wouldn’t work. Back to the drawing boards they would go in an attempt to find the perfect configuration. The students hung with it, and with amazing amounts of grit and persevering, many creative ways were discovered to create a cube.

In the other class, the students were asked to use the numbers 1-9 to write true equations. They were only allowed to use each number one time. Again, with much grit and determination they were able to complete this challenge.

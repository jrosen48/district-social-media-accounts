Today we are completing a Tabata workout.
You will “work” for :20sec and rest for :10sec. You will do 4 rounds of the movement consecutively before moving onto the next movement.
This :20sec of work should be a sprint but maintain good form and technique!

Have fun! Keep working hard!

Together we will get through this, stronger than ever!!

Dear FCHS Students and Parents,

It is essential that we do our part to flatten the curve. We know you are bored and restless and miss your friends. We all share those feelings. But, now is NOT the time to get together and physically hang out with friends. When you do, you put not just yourselves and your families at risk, but the entire community. Use your technology to stay connected! Find creative ways to let your friends know you care!

Parents: your kids look to you for boundaries and as role models for behavior. Help them make good choices about social distancing.

The more we work together and follow the guidelines, the healthier and faster we will get through this.

Sincerely,
Your FCHS Family",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2920197384707395&id=410671078993384,,0.0,"Day #10 Update

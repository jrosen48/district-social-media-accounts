In the morning, seniors and middle-schoolers braved the cold at Fort Phoenix to capture photos. Upon returning to school, the scholars and seniors had lunch together before jumping onto the computers to edit their photos.

The seniors were amazed by how talented, smart, well-spoken and patient the students were.

Tomorrow, seniors will return to EHMS to print their photos that will be included in a collage put together by students and seniors. The collage will be presented at a later date in a ceremony at the Fairhaven Senior Center. Stay tuned for part two tomorrow!

The Empowered Classroom spent the day planting and cleaning up the community gardens while the 6th graders enjoyed their first official ""Open Air"" (recess) today.

The ""Open Air"" initiative was brought to school administration by a group of 6th graders. The group prepared a presentation, expectations to be followed and even a vote by the entire class.

So, from now until the end of the school year, 6th graders have the option to spend 1/2 of their lunch period outside. Today, students played spud, frisbee, danced and soaked it all in! Way to advocate for your class, 6th graders!

I hope you are all enjoying a lovely summer and are all safe during the storm this evening.

I am writing to provide an update to an alarm that caused the FHFD to respond to Knollwood School this evening.

There was no fire. The Fire Department has cleared the building for use.

A partial power outage caused us to lose a phase that in turn caused a water heater pump motor to overheat and burn out.

All is well at Knollwood and assuming power is restored, all summer programs will be in session as normal tomorrow. We do anticipate power to return at some point this evening.

Please extend a big thank you to our firefighters when you see them this year at the fair as they do an incredible job in responding to our community and emergency needs.

You will only be notified if school is closed tomorrow as a result of the power outage. If you do not hear any follow up, Summer Learning Academy and ESY are on as scheduled.

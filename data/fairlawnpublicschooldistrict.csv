Dear Incoming Kindergarten Parents,

I understand that there were some technical difficulties accessing the Kindergarten survey about reopening schools. In an effort to have the most accurate up to date information, which will help drive our decisions about reopening schools, I created a new survey, utilizing Survey Planet, instead of Google. Even if you were successful and completed a survey last week, I ask that you complete a new survey in this new platform, as well.

I am writing to you tonight to remind everyone that beginning tomorrow our Spring Break will begin. The last few weeks, we as a community, have been moving at a speed that words can’t even describe and over the next week, please take time to rest, rejuvenate, spend time with your family, and most importantly stay healthy!

When we return on April 13th, Week 4 of Fair Lawn’s Distance Learning Plan will pick up where we left off. Also, Governor Murphy is expected to announce additional information on or around April 17th about the status of all schools in New Jersey. Once we have more information, we will be sharing that information as soon as possible.

Finally, should we make any changes to Fair Lawn’s Distance Learning Plan Week 4, we will communicate that with you accordingly.

Thank you, stay healthy Fair Lawn and enjoy your break!

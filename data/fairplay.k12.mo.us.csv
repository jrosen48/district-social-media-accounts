Good Evening parents, I just wanted to take a moment and say thank you for being part of Parents as Teachers. This time of year I would be planning a family night for us to enjoy. Instead I am brain storming how to reach my families virtually. The health and safety is always top priority when planning events for our families. So I am coming to you. What would you like to see at home?

My recommendation is that you reconsider holding all area and district FFA events involving significant numbers of students. While a variety of factors go into making a decision like this, be assured that the health and safety of our students and stakeholders is always our primary concern.

As an association we know there will be questions. We are evlauating all options as we move through the next few days and weeks. Continue to check with your advisor and watch social media.",,,

Kick off #NationalParkWeek with National Junior Ranger Day! The Junior Ranger Program is a great way to explore national parks. You can learn about nature sounds, night skies, or even the Transcontinental Railroad! You'll also learn why national parks matter and how you can be a part of the team that helps keep parks healthy.

We don't care what age you are—just ""explore, learn, and protect"" your national parks online and become an official Junior Ranger! Look for the virtual badges you can print out and post on your refrigerator. Learn more at https://www.nps.gov/kids/junior-ranger-online.htm

Good luck to the MS girls basketball players, competing today in their final game of the season. 8th graders travel to Geneva to face Lakeside and 7th graders travel to West Geauga MS to face Berkshire. Basketball season is sort of like running a marathon. Our season started with open gyms in October. Practices in November and December, and games in January, February and the first week of March. That is about 5 months of dedication and committment! We are very proud of the effort you put in each day!! Many of you came to play this year and tried something for the first time ever. That's hard to do. Now keep on working - the off-season starts today. 🏀⚓ #futureladyskippers #smallbutmighty",0.0,"Sandra Knight‎Fairport Harding Athletics

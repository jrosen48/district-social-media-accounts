Fairview students, your teachers are putting some exciting activities together for you to do while you’re at home. I know you think “packets” must be full of boring worksheets, but your teachers have outdone themselves with fun things you can do with your entire family! During this time of uncertainty, please challenge yourself to keep learning as much as you can. I challenge you to write about your feelings and experiences while we are out of school. This is an unprecedented time that you will tell your children about. It would be awesome if you have some of your own writing to share. You can make books, keep a journal, make your own newspaper! You are only limited during this time by your imagination. Remember, We Love You and We Miss You! Stay Safe, Stay Healthy, and STAY HOME!",7.0,"Stacy Prewett is with Amy Judd Petrus at Fairview R-XI School District.

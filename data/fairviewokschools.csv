As some of you may have heard, earlier this year, the Fairview City Council approved our request to start a Scholarship Program for Fairview High School Seniors!

We have designed and created a Scholarship Program that we feel will be immensely beneficial to the Student Participants, our citizens, and our community.

The program, titled ""Operation BLUE SHADOW"" will immerse the participants into the entire operation of our Municipal Government. They will experience the daily routines of each and every department, gain new insight and perspective into the operation of each employee's role, and how we work harmoniously together as one team‚Ä¶",0.0,"Congratulations to these seniors!

F. Mayer Award and the Archie Griffin Award, respectively. They were surprised by their teachers with these high honors yesterday!

The Lewis F. Mayer Award is given each year to an outstanding eighth grader who has shown the many fine qualities displayed by Mr. Mayer, a dedicated educator and Superintendent of Fairview Park Schools for 43 years. This award is named in his honor,
recognizing qualities which include courteousness, thoughtfulness, concern for others, enthusiasm, a positive attitude as well as outstanding scholastic achievement.

Also given annually, the Archie Griffin Award is named for Mr. Griffin, an Ohio native and the only two-time recipient of the Heisman Trophy for football. As a professional athlete, Griffin always displayed exemplary sportsmanship. This award is given to the student who shows Mr. Griffin‚Äôs core values in both academics and athletics: integrity, ethics, and sportsmanship.

Congratulations to two well-deserving students and their families!

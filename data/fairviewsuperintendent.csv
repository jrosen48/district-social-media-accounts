For example, K and 6th grade only will start in-person classes on August 27, 2020 with students at other grade levels phasing in as outlined in the chart in our reopening plan.

We are in need of volunteers to participate in our district volunteer program. Volunteers will provide two areas of service: 1) Additional sanitation of school facilities throughout the school day, or 2) Conduct student temperature checks upon loading of school buses and arrival at school.

All volunteers in our volunteer program go through an extensive background check, receive training, and are under the direct supervision of school personnel at all times. Volunteers will work with district staff to choose a set weekly schedule that can range from as little as a couple of hours one day weekly to a couple of hours five days weekly. The schedule will need to be set in advance though to allow efficiency and effectiveness in planning.

If you are interested in volunteering, please email our superintendent at jackie.risden-smith@fairview.kyschools.us and include your phone number.

I am very proud to announce that for the 2020 JFL season, Fairview will be joining the River Cities Conference. This conference consists of 9 teams. We will play an 8 game regular season, and the top 4 teams in each grade level will make the playoffs. We will also be hosting a preseason Grid-O-Rama this year at Fairview. I will post a tentative schedule this weekend.
Teams consist of Fairview, Ashland, Boyd, Russell, Lewis Co., West Carter, East Carter, Greenup, and Raceland.
Any child that will be playing this year grades K-6, I need an email confirmation NO LATER than July 1st! Please include the child's name, grade they will be entering, a contact phone #, and tshirt size! Please make the heading of the email ""JFL signup"". I will need this info by July 1, before our next conference meeting, so I can determine how many teams we will have entering the conference. The plan for now is a 5/6 team, 3/4 team, and a flag team. League fees will not be due until the end of July. Thank you!

If you have questions about due dates for NTI student work, you’ll find the answer by reading this document that was prepared and posted on Facebook and our district website to support you with the information you need. The first column identifies the NTI Days (1-10, 11-20, 21-30). The second column identifies how the work gets to our students. The third column identifies how the work is turned in. Additional information about the work is included as well.

An update since the attached document went out last week...
A container will be on the bench in front of central office tomorrow, Friday, April 17, 2020 and Monday, April 20, 2020 from 9:00AM-11:00AM for NTI student work for days 1-10 ONLY if you still have not turned it in.

Thank you for looking closely at these important communications developed for you to have answers to questions you may have. We post frequently on our district Facebook and website during these fast paced changing times.

Courage - When we think about the word... the opportunity to exhibit this commendable quality only presents itself when we are up against something bigger than us, such as the situation we are currently facing. As hard as it can be at times, we have the opportunity to face every challenge with courage. So often courage is misunderstood to be the absence of fear, when courage is actually the resistance of fear. Continue to have courage, #TeamFairview.

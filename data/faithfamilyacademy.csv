In Mariela Villasmil's art class, students are busy preparing for next week's Chinese New Year festivities. 2020 is the Year of the Rat.

Each beautiful piece is completely hand drawn and painted by the students using acrylics on canvas. Their challenge was to represent the richness of the Chinese culture through the color use and subjects.

Some students were inspired to base their work on some of the very intricate masks from the beautiful Pekín Opera that symbolize positive traits such as intelligence, heroism, integrity and loyalty.",0.0,"Check out Mariela Villasmil's class beautiful work!

In Mariela Villasmil's art class, students are busy preparing for next week's Chinese New Year festivities. 2020 is the Year of the Rat.

Each beautiful piece is completely hand drawn and painted by the students using acrylics on canvas. Their challenge was to represent the richness of the Chinese culture through the color use and subjects.

Some students were inspired to base their work on some of the very intricate masks from the beautiful Pekín Opera that symbolize positive traits such as intelligence, heroism, integrity and loyalty.",2020-01-16 09:17:17,,

So beyond proud to be teaching the most amazing kids and so happy to be able to share their work with all of you.

Their talent is simply beyond words 🙏🏼🥇🏆

Here is our Christmas project.
I wanted to do a collaboration painting so they woudn't feel overwhelmed as this was their very first time to do something like this!!!!

A total of 18 super talented kids got to draw and paint oils on 4 different large canvases.

Everything you see except the baby Jesus face (my demo) and few black lines (my demo too) were done entirely by the students.

Each of them with totally different skills and one thing in common: They have NEVER PAINTED BEFORE!!!!!!

Please cheer them up, I'll read your comments to them and thank you from my heart for your love and always support 🙏🏼🥇🏆

They deserve the highest recognition for their hard work 🤩

""Work gratitude into your daily conversation. Lately, we've been trying to weave appreciation for mundane things into our everyday talk -- with A.J., his big sister, Mathilda, 10, and especially with our 2-year-old, Mary Elena. (""We're so lucky to have a good cat like Sam!"" ""Aren't the colors in the sunset amazing?"" ""I'm so happy when you listen!"") When you reinforce an idea frequently, it's more likely to stick. One way to turn up the gratitude in your house is to pick a ""thanking"" part of the day. Two old-fashioned, tried-and-true ideas: Make saying what good things happened today part of the dinnertime conversation or make bedtime prayers part of your nightly routine.""",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2555243664563715&id=139695676118538,,0.0,"It's #tiptuesday!

""On days when there are no afternoon activities, give your child a time frame — say, between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. — to get down to business. This gives her some control over her schedule (some kids need a longer break after school, and others need to start right away to keep the momentum going). The only rule is that 5 o’clock is the latest time to start...This way, the bulk of it can get done before your kiddo’s too pooped — and you can just review and wrap things up once you get home.""",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2417565468331536&id=139695676118538,,0.0,"Say hello to our new semi-regular feature, #TipTuesday.

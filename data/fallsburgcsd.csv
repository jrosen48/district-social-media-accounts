Dear School Community Member,

We have been advised by the Department of Public Health that an employee has tested positive for COVID-19. At this time, based on available information there were no exposures to our school district, as the employee was not on campus within the last 14 days.

Remote learning will commence on September 14, 2020, as planned for. All building related functions will continue as normal. As always, the health and safety of our students and staff remains our top priority.

Sincerely yours,

Ivan J. Katz, Ed.D.

Meal deliveries began this morning and will take place daily from 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM. We are delivering food, by bus, to each regular bus stop. We are also making meals available for pick-up at the entrance of BCES for any family who wants to access meals that way. If you have any questions about meal delivery or pick-up, please email us at:

meals@fallsburgcsd.net

I appreciate the phone calls and emails to the district that indicate your preference to not have meals delivered to your homes. It will take us a couple of days to straighten all of those requests out but we will get it done!

Our primary objective is to get our children fed and we are making that happen! I am very proud of the grand team effort and support to make this a reality! I would also like to thank district staff and community members who have offered to volunteer. At this time we have the support that we need. However, if we need additional support, we will reach out to you.

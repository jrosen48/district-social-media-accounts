This post is in regards to our pick up and drop off at middle school before and after school. We have been in consultation with the FCPD and the map below was designed in coordination with them. Please drop your students off in the parking lots either North or South of the building or in the parking lot on the east side of the building. Please do not pull over and drop students in the bus loading zone or on the east side of Morton Street.

FCPD will be issuing tickets to parents who drop students in the bus lane or that drop on the east side of Morton street in the no parking areas. It is also illegal to stop at the stop sign on 15th and Morton to let your kids out. Students should always cross using the marked cross walks.

Student safety is our first concern and this map provides us the best way of keeping our kids safe.

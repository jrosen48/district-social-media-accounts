About two years ago, as the crow flies, I inherited a DMV Waiting Room masquerading as an Art Classroom in a trailer with.... let's call it eccentric.... A/C-Heating unit.

Today, I have an ACTUAL Art Classroom, with adjustable drawing boards for every seat; 10 computers; 6 large light boxes; individual pro-level watercolor sets, for every seat; 9 gallons of tempera acrylic paint; 300 large sheets (can be halved) watercolor paper; Dozens of 8""x10"" canvas boards; Dozens of 5""x7"" canvas boards; Paint palettes with lids, enough for almost all three Middle School grades to have one per student, so they can keep and use for the year (tempera paint can be reactivated with water, so we have less waste); plus new brushes and other sundries.

A lot of time, effort, volunteering and fundraising has paid off.

To all who helped, volunteered, donated and supported the Arts Program at FLA, THIS is the results. Thank you all!

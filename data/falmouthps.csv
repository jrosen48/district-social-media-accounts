All Falmouth students and staff engaging in in-person schooling will be required to wear a face mask with two-ply material.

Families are asked to provide masks for their children. If a child forgets theirs or it becomes unusable, there will be some available at school.

Acceptable
Cloth face masks
Store-bought or homemade masks are both OK. Masks with patterns need to follow school dress code.

Disposable surgical face masks
They are meant for one-time use only.

Not Acceptable
Bandanas
Loose bandanas do not prevent the spread of respiratory droplets.

Gaiters
After studying recently-released scientific data, our Health Services team has determined that gaiters may not provide sufficient protection.

Masks with valves
Valves release exhaled droplets and don’t protect others.

Face shields
CDC guidance indicates shields cannot be used as substitutes for face masks.

Be sure the mask is snug but comfortable against the sides of the face!

Mr. Dan Whiting from Shepley Wood Products in Hyannis has very kindly and generously arranged for a plane to fly over Cape Cod on June 4th with a banner honoring the Class of 2020 from each high school on the Cape, including Falmouth High School.
Between approximately 11:15 am and 11:30 am on June 4th, the pilot will be following Route 28 over the downtown and Main Street area, then by the waterfront, and then back up Route 28 towards Bourne. The pilot is hoping to do a few laps to maximize viewing opportunities. So if you are out and about during this time on June 4th, please look up towards the sky for the Class of 2020 plane and banner!

Today Mrs. Abbott (and a trail of about 18 staff) drove all around Falmouth and Mashpee (for 3 hours) to deliver T-Shirts to all 28 semi finalists of this years Virtual ""Battle Of The Books"". She even created 11 personalized signs for the finalists! You could hear the fun music, beeps and cheers all throughout town today. Thank you to all of the parents for keeping the secret and the staff for joining in on the fun. This is a day the staff and students will remember for a long time!

I write today with an important update from Governor Baker who announced during today’s press conference that schools will remain closed for the rest of this school year. Falmouth Public Schools will continue with remote learning via the Continuity of Learning Plans until June 26, 2020. The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) will be recommending districts concentrate on essential standards in addition to deeper learning of standards already taught. Our district is positioned well to follow this guidance since we began introducing new learning in our plans on April 6, 2020.

Based on this announcement of extended closure, I will provide you with additional updates as more specific plans are made for Falmouth Public Schools. We look forward to re-engaging with staff and students next week. I hope everyone stays safe and well.

So, as many of you already know, we’ve had to cut our season so insanely short due to the COVID outbreak and many other legal issues that follow, such as licensing, rescheduling, and many other variables of which many are unaware. To say this virus took a lot from so many is an understatement. Our prayers go out to everyone affected by this horrible time in history!

We still wanted to thank you, the Fannin Community, for all of the support for our shows, this year, past, and future! Here is a small sampling of what could have been, karaoke style, of course!

Fannin County High School student, Bryce Ware, is working to produce protective masks for medical workers in our area. Bryce is using the MakerBot 3D printers from the Engineering classroom at FCHS to 3D print respirator mask bases. It takes approximately 9 hours to produce one mask base. Bryce is working closely with Dr. Causey with Causey Orthodontics in Blairsville, GA. Dr. Causey is combining the 3D printed bases with filters and distributing them where needed.

Bryce is an active member of the Technology Student Association (TSA,) and we are very proud of him for using his talents to help with this noble cause.

Attached are some pictures of Bryce with the 3D printer, and here is a link to a video that he produced explaining what he is doing!

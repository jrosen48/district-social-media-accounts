Students will have the choice of returning to campus or remaining in the virtual learning platform. Students will have the ability to switch from in-person or virtual learning as desired. Each Thursday will be dedicated to virtual learning to make the transition smoother. Be on the lookout for more information and details to come!

Congratulations to one of our Fannin Site seniors, Shayelyn Millsaps. Shayelyn graduated back in January after completing the healthcare CTAE pathway and her CNA license. Shayelyn currently works at a horse farm where she helps take care of animals. She plans to continue her education to become a registered nurse. She says, “my favorite memory is being chosen to go on the Washington D.C. trip and having the opportunity to place the wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.” Way to go Shayelyn.

**NEW STAFF SPOTLIGHT**

Name: Grace Simpson

Hometown: Menomonie, WI

Role at FHS: Choir Director

Faribault High School is excited to welcome Grace Simpson as our new Choir Director. Grace earned her degree in Music Education from Luther College and before coming to FHS she served as a Dorian Summer Music Camp Counselor. “I’m excited to work in such a supportive and caring community”, said Simpson when asked what she looked forward to the most about working in Faribault.

When she’s not serving students, Grace loves to read, do yoga, pet dogs, and drink too much coffee! She also loves this quote from Eleanor Roosevelt: “The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams”. Grace feels that we should dream boldly about the things in life we find to be beautiful. And when we dream beautifully, the future is ours.

Please join Faribault Public Schools in welcoming Grace Simpson into our Falcon Family!",0.0,"Faribault High School

As announced yesterday, Governor Tim Walz and the Minnesota Department of Education have extended distance learning through the remainder of the school year. The governor has set aside Friday, May 1st and Monday, May 4th as days for staff to prepare for this next phase of distance learning.

This means that May 1st and May 4th will be professional development days for our staff. As a result, students will not be required to attend school via distance learning on these days.

The district will continue to provide child care for tier one and tier two workers and free meals on those days. Go to our website for more details.

Thank you for your cooperation and understanding as we continue distance learning through the end of this school year. We are Faribault and we will get through this together.

A distance learning story from a proud FMS teacher:

""I have a young man who is stuck in Mexico because of covid-19 for at least another month and is technically a drop. He missed us so much that he joined our Google Meets that I had invited him to; all the way, live and in color, from Michoacan, Mexico! He asked if he could continue to join us and hang out with us. That is so awesome my eyes welled up. That young man showed me that through all the challenges of distance learning, there are some bright spots. BIG shout out goes to that young man and his family!!!! Can I have an Amen brother!""",0.0,"Faribault Middle School

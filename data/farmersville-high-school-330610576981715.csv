They also need to clean out their athletic locker at that time. On Monday April 27th go to the parking lot where the HS weight room door is. Coach Hoge or myself will be at that door, we will be using social distancing guidelines, only 1-3 girls will be allowed in at a time. Please stay in your car until you are waved up to the door. The following will be the times to come up so we do not have too many girls at one time. Please come at the appropriate times. LAST NAME

Breakfast sacks will be handed out 7:30 to 8:30.
Lunch sacks will be handed out 11:30 to 12:30.
Meals will be provided to any child 1 year old to 18 years old.
Children are not required to be enrolled at Farmerville ISD and children do not need to be approved for any school meals program to receive these free sack meals. Texas Department of Agriculture requires children to be present to receive a meal, but they will not be required to enter the building.
We look forward to serving breakfast and lunch “grab and go” meals to kids at Tatum campus bus lane location starting 3/17/20 through 3/20/20.

Tuesday, it was reported that one of our students made a statement that was perceived as a threat toward some of our students. During the investigation, it was concluded that the statements qualified as a threat and the student was removed from campus.

It is always the district emergency protocol to address school safety concerns and enlist the support of our school Police Department. We are fortunate that our school police department is here to support and investigate such issues.

An important reminder to all parents and guardians, please tell your children to report any frightening situations or concerns. If you see something say something. By the same token, please tell your children to refrain from joking about acts of violence and terror. Please note that making such statements can be construed as threats and may result in prosecution.

It also a good idea to monitor social media and Facebook accounts to know firsthand your children’s activities and clear up any possible misconceptions that maybe posted regarding violent behavior.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1998400626869360&id=330610576981715,,0.0,"Dear Farmersville High School Community,

All of this was dropped off at the ARK animal rehab center today.... so lots of happy animals and volunteers!!! This is the 2nd load just like this and the attending volunteer was shocked, once again at the hearts of Farwell School students. It was exciting to see these kids take on the laborious task for the sake of animals they will likely never see in person.... the next generation is looking bright! Thank you to all involved and to Laura Pfeiffelman for allowing her Service Learning kids to help... they were excited to be a part of this and put a large portion in the pile from our school forest! Fun day to be an Eagle!!",0.0,"More donations for the animal rescue...thanks, Eagles!

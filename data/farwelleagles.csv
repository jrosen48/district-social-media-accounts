Farwell students doing great things!!!

For those of you who had students collecting acorns for the wildlife rehab, here are a few pics of the final tally.... despite the rainy week!!! They currently have 58 squirrel babies there, which is more than they have ever had! So, we may be needing some more! Also, we will be doing a donation drive in December, however, since the acorns are a right-now sort of thing, we obviously had to do this earlier. There will be more information to follow for their other needs and creative ways we can ask the kids for help! As you can see from their food wagon, they need a wide variety of foods for the many types of animals they support there. The kids are‚Ä¶ More",13.0,"Farwell students have been collecting acorns for a wildlife rehab for 58 baby squirrels....look how much they've gathered! And look how proud they are of their good work!

To provide for social distancing, each family group will be assigned to a 10-foot circle that has been pre-marked. All fans will be required to wear their masks at all times. No smoking or alcohol will be permitted. Circles will be assigned on a first-come, first-served basis until we reach the 250-spectator capacity.

Ms. Jeanine Ging and the newly launched Freedom Area Middle School Science Club are excited to tackle the ambitious project of renovating the FMS Courtyard Classroom! The current courtyard will be transformed to include a Monarch Waystation, a pumpkin patch, an aquatic greenhouse, and a chicken coop to raise chickens. The products of the courtyard will support the sixth grade science and math standards and cross-curricular projects that are already in place.
Donations are needed for the butterfly garden and pumpkin patch, so that they will be flourishing in the fall.

Juniors,

Please bring in your permission form for the College Fair to Mrs. Shultz by Tuesday, February 5th. We need to know who is going on this field trip. If you do not have your form, please have a parent/guardian email Ms. Kaplin or Mrs. Shultz to give permission to attend. Don’t forget to bring money for lunch, we are still going to the Eat and Park in Sewickley. We will leave at 8 am on Thursday, February 7th you will need to go to first block for attendance. We will announce dismissal.

The day will be busy and chaotic with all the other high schools in the area attending. It would be best to register for the College Fair to talk to the college representatives quicker.

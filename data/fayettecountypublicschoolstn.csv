Although the school year has already begun, we are still accepting applications for pre-K students! The early years teach valuable social skills, problem-solving concepts as well as critical thinking skills. As children learn through exploration, they become creative thinkers and doers. If you are interested in signing your child up for pre-K, call 465-5260 for more information or visit our Central Administration Building located at 10425 Hwy 76 S. in Somerville to register now.",2020-08-24 11:44:14,,

Many homeless families with school-aged children find help at Fayette Cares, which is why Fayette County Public Schools is partnering to equip our shelter with technology including computers, printers, and internet access.

Federal data shows student homelessness is at an all-time high with over 1.5 million children and youth homeless during the 2017-18 school year, an 11% increase over the previous year. Student homelessness in rural America is reported to be growing at nearly 4x the national rate, and we don’t yet know how the pandemic will affect these numbers.

Displaced students face barriers that put their academic achievement at risk. The trauma and instability of homelessness affects mental and physical wellness, increases the likelihood of chronic absenteeism, and often results in negative educational outcomes.

With virtual learning options becoming essential, these important resources will provide the tools children need to succeed in school and beyond.

Each year since 2017, LaGrange-Moscow Elementary has hosted an event called the Extraordinary Shake, which tests students' communication, professionalism, and other soft skills. Due to COVID-19, LaGrange-Moscow Elementary School's annual Extraordinary Shake event went virtual! Students were invited to sign up, and 16 4th and 5th graders accepted the challenge! Round 1 consisted of 60-second video introductions. In Round 2, 10 students debated a topic relating to COVID-19. Round 3 was a gauntlet of challenges in which 7 students
were required to demonstrate customer service, management skills, and persuasion. During Round 4, the top 6 students were asked to create and record a video marketing pitch. During Round 5, three students completed a final interview. A panel of judges scored these students

Your breath is made up of oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen and water vapor. Anytime a breath leaves your mouth, the gases in your breath cool and turn into liquid.

No matter how small your group may be, it’s important to take the following actions when gathering with people outside your household:

• Consider meeting virtually. If that’s not possible, make sure you apply the rest of this guidance.
• Keep your group to 10 or less.
• Maintain 6 feet of distance between yourself and those who are not part of your household.
• Ask that anyone who is feeling sick stay home.
• Ask that everyone use cloth face coverings to protect the group in case someone is contagious and not experiencing symptoms.

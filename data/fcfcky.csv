A spokesperson for the Franklin County Humane Society indicated that they vigorously supported the idea.

📊Here is an updated case count for Franklin County.

**Edited to add: 2 of the cases we are reporting today are what we call probable cases. Meaning they have had a blood test showing either a past infection or active infection.

We have been anticipating a spike in our case count as testing has become so widely available, test results are coming back much faster and as things begin to reopen in Kentucky and residents have more exposures. We want to continue to urge Franklin County to be good neighbors and stay home and away from others in your home if you are feeling ill, continue to social distance as much as possible, wear your mask, cover your cough/sneezes and most importantly, wash your hands!

Updates are provided daily at 6pm when new cases are confirmed in Franklin County.

📊Here is an updated case count for Franklin County.
Many have reached out in regards to other news avenues report a different number. FCHD can only report on cases that have been reported to and confirmed by the health department.
Additionally, sometimes cases may be reported for one county because an address change has yet to occur or an individual was tested in Franklin County but lives in another county.
🏆We want to commend Franklin County residents on doing a great job during this pandemic. 🏡We have no doubt that because of their efforts staying healthy at home that we have not seen a huge spike in cases as many other counties have.
We want to urge everyone to keep up the great work and ✋ 🤚HAND WASHING next week as things begin to open back up!

📊Here is an updated case count for Franklin County.
Many have reached out in regards to other news avenues report a different number. FCHD can only report on cases that have been reported to and confirmed by the health department.

Additionally, sometimes cases may be reported for one county because an address change has yet to occur or an individual was tested in Franklin County but lives in another county.

🏆We want to commend Franklin County residents on doing a great job during this pandemic. 🏡We have no doubt that because of their efforts staying healthy at home that we have not seen a huge spike in cases as many other counties have.

We want to urge everyone to keep up the great work and ✋ 🤚HAND WASHING next week as things begin to open back up!

In an effort to better use and share these resources, Kentucky Capital Development Corporation has tried to categorize and organize all local, state, and federal assistance below. There are programs to assist local governments, businesses, and individuals included.

📊Here is an updated case count for Franklin County.
Many have reached out in regards to other news avenues report a different number. FCHD can only report on cases that have been reported to and confirmed by the health department.

Additionally, sometimes cases may be reported for one county because an address change has yet to occur or an individual was tested in Franklin County but lives in another county.

Stay Healthy! FCHD would like to commend all Franklin County residents on their efforts in flattening the curve.

First, we need to cover the basics - starting with what type of system you should choose. This is usually based on the amount of space you have available. Don't be fooled, you can compost without a backyard - or even in your small apartment !

For the rest of the week, we'll be releasing some info-graphics with common (and not so common!) set-ups depending on space availability. Tomorrow will focus on small and medium systems, with Friday showing options for those with larger yards and land space.

Tune in and join us on this fun and informative journey! The Solid Waste Department is along for the ride, as we will both be building our compost systems during this time as well. We hope to be able to share pictures and instructions for our choices at a later date.

Here is an updated case count for Franklin County. Many have reached out in regards to other news avenues report a different number. FCHD can only report on cases that have been reported to and confirmed by the health department.

Additionally, sometimes cases may be reported for one county because an address change has yet to occur or an individual was tested in Franklin County but lives in another county.

We understand that parents needed more time to evaluate the curriculum.

If your Findlay City Schools student is already a student and you want traditional learning, you do not need to do anything. If you would like your student to receive remote education only, please sign your student up for Trojan Academy. Please note, you will not receive an email stating that you have enrolled your student; however, teachers will be reaching out with more information after the deadline. Basic school supplies can be purchased for Trojan Academy. A supply list will be given to students at a later date.

This afternoon, Governor DeWine announced that all schools in the State of Ohio will remain closed for the rest of the 2019/2020 school year. With this announcement comes additional planning and considerations that we are working on. We will provide more information on the plans for the remainder of the school year tomorrow. Remote education will continue for the remainder of the year. Thank you for your support and know we are here to help and support student and families.

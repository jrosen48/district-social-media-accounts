When you can be around others after a positive COVID19 test?
If you think or know you had COVID-19 and had symptoms, you can be with others after at least 10 days since symptoms first appeared AND at least 24 hours have passed with no fever without fever-reducing medication AND symptoms have improved. If you tested positive for COVID-19 but had no symptoms, you can be with others after 10 days have passed since your test.
According to the CDC, a person who has had and recovered from COVID-19 may have low levels of virus in their bodies for up to 3 months after diagnosis. This means that if the person who has recovered from COVID-19 is retested within 3 months of initial infection, they may continue to have a positive test result, even though they are not spreading COVID-19. Meaning, they are no longer infectious to others.

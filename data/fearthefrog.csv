Calling all Juniors (well, I guess technically you are now seniors 🙂
We need your help decorating for Saturday's Prom. The more help we have, the faster we can get it done! We can't start decorating until 12:00pm due to the Farmer's Market at Merchant Park in the morning. Please meet at Merchant Park at noon and be prepared to work for a couple of hours. We would like to have it all done by 4:00pm so you have plenty of time to get ready for the BIG EVENT! We will also need to have juniors stay after the dance for a short time to help take down the decorations.

Please email Meagan or Summer if you have any questions.",3.0,"Pratt High Greenbacks

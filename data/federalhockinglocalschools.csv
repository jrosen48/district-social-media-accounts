This includes all activities on our campus involving youth through varsity sports.

The rapid increase in cases in Athens County makes our community one of the fastest growing areas for COVID infection per capita in the country.

While we are not aware of any cases directly related to our athletic programs at this time, we feel it is in the best interest of our community to put in place greater restrictions for the time being until we have a better understanding of the degree of community spread.

This directive is in place effective immediately ‪through at least Monday, July 27, 2020‬.

My senior project was to learn how to play guitar.

The reason I chose this project is because it’s something I’ve always wanted to learn. As the process went on, I realized that I am much better at finger picking than strumming. Thank goodness that worked out because I love the sound of finger picking.

In the end, I’ve learned so much and I’m glad I have the experience in a musical instrument that I can grow with my whole life.

Great job Ashlynn! (Check out her video below)

Today we introduce you to Federal Hocking’s own Amanda Petroff! 🍎

My name is Amanda Petroff and I teach sixth grade math & science at Amesville Elementary.

This is my first year teaching in our district, but it already feels like home. I love teaching at Federal Hocking because of the passion with which the community, teachers, and staff support our students. I truly enjoy the people that I work with and I feel genuinely supported in all that I do.

Some of my favorite things to do are playing soccer, seeing live music, and exploring the outdoors with my family. I also find joy in daily homesteading adventures, such as scratching piglet ears and attempting to keep chickens off of my porch.

This picture was taken earlier this year when the high school boys’ basketball team made it to the district semifinals.

The Lancer spirit and pride in our district is strong! #FedHockRocks!

Shane Fredricks! 🎉

My senior project was Iconic Prop Making.

This was something I had always wanted to do. It was challenging for me because I had never really done woodworking, or creating something this complex, and I wasn’t very neat at painting.

The four props I ended up creating were from two categories, games and movies. For the games category I made the sword and shield from Legend of Zelda. For the movies I made Obi-wan’s Lightsaber from Star Wars and Wolverine’s claws from X-men.

Most of the props were made of wood except for the lightsaber. The lightsaber was made from hose and plumbing parts from Lowe’s along with some pvc.

Overall this project taught me to have patience, work with wood, and how to paint better to get a better final product.

Today we introduce you to Emma Wright 🍎

Hello! My name is Emma Wright and I currently teach American Studies 9 and Psychology at the high school. This is my seventh year of teaching and my second year at Federal Hocking.

I love to spend time with my husband and our three pets, Huckleberry, Daisy and Snax. I enjoy traveling, reading, watching movies and photography.

A fun fact about me is that last summer I went white water rafting through the Grand Canyon on the Colorado River. It was amazing!

I love working for Federal Hocking because I believe that teaching is a work of heart; this district recognizes, values and appreciates that kind of work. ♥️

”For this project, I worked with RVC Architects in Athens.

I worked on a computer and used the AutoCAD application to make floor plans for a house of my own design. I designed these and then revised them with my mentor. He would mark them up and then I’d have to fix what was wrong so I have a lot of rough drafts.”

Take note of the four car garage that Brandon thinks he will need in the future!

Today we get to meet #FedHock’s own Shelby Denhart 🍎

I’m Shelby Denhart and I teach Kindergarten at Amesville Elementary. This is my second year of teaching.

I love learning new things and traveling. This year I am learning how to play the ukulele. The children help me sing and we end each day with a whole group sing along.

I enjoy working for Federal Hocking because the children and families are amazing. There is such a feeling of belonging in this school.",2020-04-10 07:00:54,,

Here is a little bit about Kathy:

I have been a preschool teacher for many years. Both my undergraduate and graduate degrees focused on early childhood education.

I enjoy spending my work days with preschoolers. I enjoy their creativity, curiosity and energy. I enjoy working with my teacher assistant Gloria Keirns.

I am teaching at Amesville Elementary School because I believe in Federal Hocking Local Schools’ mission statement. ""The Federal Hocking School District uses a progressive approach to help all young people become productive and engaged citizens. Our graduates will be creative thinkers and problem solvers, able to make positive choices about their careers, education and community"". I believe this mission begins with Federal Hocking Local Schools preschoolers.

I am married to Randy Zeisler. I am a mother to two sons. I am a grandmother to three grandchildren under four years old. I enjoy hiking, reading and spending time with family and friends.

Through this fun, yet experiential way they are learning the value of earning a paycheck, how to budget their spending and discovering the importance of saving money to obtain what they want.

Students are utilizing math skills to manipulate transactions with decimal amounts multiple times in one class period. They are also learning the importance of record keeping as they fill out their check books daily and practice writing checks when they purchase items from the store.

Before beginning our classroom economy, students led the discussion to create cumulative lists for ways they can earn money or lose money during their math block. They decided on items they can purchase with their earnings or invest with their peers to purchase something for the whole class.

Each day students have an opportunity to “visit” the store or save their money for days to come.

Good Afternoon Cardinal Families. I am pleased to share that Felicity Schools has been awarded a Coronavirus Relief Funds – Broadband Ohio Connectivity Grant in the sum of $151,446.00. This grant money is earmarked to provide and/or improve high speed internet access to the families of the district. The district will be purchasing high speed internet equipped iPads, hot spots, and will be expanding the school WiFi outside of the building. Later this afternoon I will be emailing a survey to parents and also posting a link to the survey on the district website. It is extremely important that each family fill out and submit the survey. The district will use the information gathered to determine how to best deploy the new technology. I realize we gathered similar information last spring. However, we want to make sure our information is current and accurate.",0.0,"Great news!!!! Please be sure to complete the survey!

Dear Parents,

A few weeks ago we communicated that we have some confirmed cases of fifth disease at our elementary school. Today we want to let you know that we continue to see additional cases. After consulting with the health department again, we have identified additional measures to limit the spread of this illness. We are taking extra cleaning precautions in the classrooms and common areas of the school. For the next several days we will not allow students to use the water fountains. We will provide water stations for students with cups or students may bring in their own water bottles. Hand washing will continue to be a priority throughout the school day.

As a reminder, if your child has a fever, he or she should be kept at home until fever free for 24 hours. Please contact our school nurse, Mrs. Peron, if you have any questions at 513-362-5354.

Additional information about fifth disease:

Dear Parents,

A few weeks ago we communicated that we have some confirmed cases of fifth disease at our elementary school. Today we want to let you know that we continue to see additional cases. After consulting with the health department again, we have identified additional measures to limit the spread of this illness. We are taking extra cleaning precautions in the classrooms and common areas of the school. For the next several days we will not allow students to use the water fountains. We will provide water stations for students with cups or students may bring in their own water bottles. Hand washing will continue to be a priority throughout the school day.

As a reminder, if your child has a fever, he or she should be kept at home until fever free for 24 hours. Please contact our school nurse, Mrs. Peron, if you have any questions at 513-362-5354.

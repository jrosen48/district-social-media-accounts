Congratulations to the Drum line who advanced to the semi finals!!! They will perform tomorrow at 1:00 on Lucas Oil main stage and then at approx. 5:45 for the actual competition, also on the main stage.

A huge shout out to Mark & Kristin Baird for coordinating, chaperoning and driving them around this week and helping with everything from tryouts to practices.

A BIG thanks to Lee Myers for designing and fabricating the awesome cart for the bass drums for easy transport around the city and higher sound quality, as well as Garrett Taulbee, Charlie Troxell and Ethan Simmerman for their help!

We wouldn’t have gotten this act off the ground without the help of David Parks and Stacie Taylor this summer! Thanks for all the hours on a really crammed weekend to make this happen and all the opportunities to perform since then!

And thanks to Ben Backus, HS band director, for helping give them the background needed and tweak the musical quality of the performance.

Unfortunately, we must postpone the homecoming dance a second time. In fairness, the noon weather report calls for rain and freezing rain to begin in our area throughout the morning hours and then becoming snow around 5-8pm with the heaviest snowfall to occur from 8pm-midnight. After the snow moves through temperatures will drop to brutally cold temperatures through the rest of the weekend. These will not be safe conditions for you to be out in, I care about your safety.

Student safety is my number one priority. In fairness, to all our volunteers, parents who must pick-up flowers, hair appointments, picture and dinner arrangements, etc. This decision needs to come no later than lunchtime the day preceding.

The dance is rescheduled for next Saturday, 1/26/2019 from 8-11pm in the Elementary Cafetorium.

If you're traveling to CNE tonight to support the basketball team, travel safe, I look forward to seeing you there.

Please stay safe and warm this weekend.

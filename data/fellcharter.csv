Just two reminders today......if the Governor decides to move our state to ""yellow"" and all that entails, I will keep you up to date on any school-related changes! As of today, I have received no notice of changes to schools.

Remember to check the CDC website for the most current information on health and safety!

Happy Tuesday!

Thank you for all the positive comments and great feedback on what we sent out yesterday!

I want to acknowledge the hard work being done by our teachers. They are fabulous teachers!

Now moving to videos, packets, etc. and not having faces in front of them is hard on them as well; they are adjusting too. I have asked them to do a 180 degree change on how they teach. No one could be prepared to go from live teaching to this..... It's challenging, all the way around. I believe that for a first shot at teaching ""like this"" they have done a great job!! As usual, when asked to do something for our students, they always say yes and do their individual best to contribute!

Remember to pace your teaching and learning; you have 7 days!

Stay safe Warriors and enjoy this beautiful day.

We have thrived for another week!! üåü Way to go Warriors!ü§ó

I take the same route to school every day...the last few days I have seen these beautiful pink and purple flowers sprout up....they are so colorful and really make me happy when I see them.

Today, they reminded me that amidst crazy and scary times goodness comes through! Take a look at the picture...despite the snow...they are pushing through and their goodness is visible. It reminds me of us! No matter what, we are beautiful, vibrant survivors!!

The answer to Wednesday's...what was Miss Walsh up to....I was at the elevator. Good eyes and funny guesses!!

Today....no picture challenge, just the picture of the hard working flowers!

Enjoy and have a peace-filled, colorful, beautiful and healthy weekend!

I apologize for being late today, with getting this out....it's busy here at school today!!

What was Miss Walsh up to yesterday.....I was peeking around the building from the side entrance to the parking lot!! Good eyes spies on that one! Today's challenge is attached.

Today, I have only ONE update regarding lunches:

Starting next week, April 20th, we are going to serve the ""grab & go"" lunches on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday only. Monday you will get lunch, Tuesday breakfast, Tuesday lunch and Wednesday breakfast. Wednesday you will get Wednesday lunch, Thursday breakfast. Thursday you will get Thursday lunch, and Friday breakfast and lunch, and Monday breakfast. We will not be serving ""grab & go"" lunches on Tuesdays and Fridays. I am doing this to limit the exposure of our staff who have been diligently here for the last 4 weeks. I hope you understand.

Be well, stay safe, wash those hands and REACH OUT TO LOVED ONES!!!

Good Morning!

I have very little to update today....I guess that means we are all doing what we need to do, and making the best of this challenging situation!!üåü

The answer to yestedays...what is Miss Walsh up to....., seemed to be a tough one.....I was at the playground in one of the tubes. There are holes cut out of the tubes!! Today's is attached!! Good luck!!üéñ

I want to assure you that not only are there staff working from home, working here to distribute food, but we are also working side-by-side with our School Board. They have been with us every step of the way, ensuring that things run as smoothly as possible. Our work with them continues as we planned, without interruption.

Please remember that lunches distributed tomorrow (Thursday) will be for Thursday lunch, Friday breakfast, Friday lunch and Monday breakfast. We are giving our staff Friday off to be with family.üêá

Have a safe and healthy day!!

Happy Tuesday!

I don't have much to report today, OTHER THAN...I would like to stick to our ""school calendar"" and give the staff Friday offüéâ like we planned. Staff have been working diligently here preparing and passing out lunches and breakfasts. Teachers have been sending daily emails. There will be no emails from teachers on Friday.

Therefore if you pick up lunches this Thursday, you will get Thursdays lunch, Fridays breakfast, Fridays lunch and Mondays breakfast. We will not be offering food service THIS Friday the 10th.

The answer to yesterdays....what is Miss Walsh up to....I was at the AED machine here at school. This seemed to be a big challenge! See today's challenge.

Good Luck!!üçÄ

I have just a few reminders for today:

1. Stay safe! Make those positive phone calls to people who would like to hear your voice!üòä
2. Be sure to read the local papers, or look on line...there are people who are doing amazing things to help others!! It is a great way to talk about kindness and see people who are putting kindness into action.
3. Remember to do little things in big ways....stay focused on who or what is in front of you and give it your all!!
4. Remember to read those emails everyday from our teachers. They have great review materials and enrichment websites to keep us going in a positive direction.
5. This ""new normal"" is not easy, we know that. BUT keep up your spirits, keep learning each day, take plenty of walks and know what we miss all of you and your smiling faces.

Have a healthy weekend.üíô

The challenge of what is is Miss Walsh up to...for yesterday, was: at the water cooler in Miss Jezuit's office!! Good eye-spy Warriors!! Today's challenge is attached!!

Although I have nothing new to report, I do have a few reminders....

My reminders are simple: keep washing those hands, stay positive (we are one week through this!), stay connected by making phone calls, sending letters and reaching out to people who you have not chatted with in a while. Enjoy this family time together, play games, and go for walks.

I have decided that every day I am going to research something that I have often wondered about and never had the time to research or read about. Today, my curiosity has lead me to dig into Mount Rushmore: who designed it, how long did it take to finish, how did the presidents get chosen? I am sure that I learned this some please along the line...but now I am curious. I encourage you to use this time to dig into what makes you curious!!

Have a peace-filled day!

Take a look at the picture each day and see if you, as a family, can figure out where it was taken in or around our school! I will give you the answer the next day!!

I hope that you are all doing well, staying safe and healthy!

Here is what I know as of today:

1. Teachers will continue to send you an email daily.
2. The school is closed, expect for parents/guardians to pull up for food distribution at the cafeteria door: 11:00 to 1:30 p.m, Monday through Friday.
3. I want to thank our staff for filling food bags and for being here to distribute to families!
4. I want to thank Miss Jezuit for once again connecting us with food from Jenny's Kloset! Not only did she order the food, but she picked it up as well!!
4. Fundraisers are still on hold. Field Trips are on hold. ALL school related events are on hold.
5. Remember to be gaining your information from the CDC website or other reliable resources.

Have a peace-filled day!

As you continue to send letters to Governor Wolf, Secretary of Education Pedro Rivera, and our local representatives in Harrisburg, I thought I'd share this level of hypocrisy (in my Principal opinion):

This past Saturday in the Scranton Times, on the front page, was the attached picture of Governor Wolf planning for the COVID -19 Virus in schools.

His suggestion is that we may have to teach our students at home! So therefore, isn't his plan for teaching at home just another name for cyber charter schooling??

His actions/reactions to COVID-19 reminds me of the story of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. Rudolph was treated very poorly, even purposely ostracized (just like charter schools) until he was needed to guide the sleigh when no one else could (just like charter schools). Rudolph succeeded and went down in history! I guess we just have to continue to do what we , as charter schools do; SUCCEED!

As most of you know, we send snacks home each week. In an effort to be more eco-friendly, we have been making an attempt to stop using plastic grocery bags. As of a month ago, we eliminated the need for almost all plastic bags and were just using 25.

On Tuesday of last week I challenged Natalie, Erika, and Lexi to find a way to send home 25 snack bags in a recyclable bag. On Thursday they come up with an idea. On Friday there were 25 bags made from recycled newspaper on my desk ready to go!

Dear Parents & Guardians,

My apologies for the SUPER late notice of school being closed today.

Occasionally I do not know road conditions in many outlying areas until the busses actually try to venture out and I get reports back. Today is one of those days.

Please know that my goal is always to keep our students and staff safe. As we are just beginning the ""closure and delays"" of the winter season, please know that I will continue to work with other schools and transportation providers to get information out to you as soon as I can.

Our students have been very lucky to have had so many amazing experiences with Veterans coming in to meet with them, share their stories and talk about what giving back really means. This year, we are going to send our students out into the Veterans community to give back and show our appreciation for all they have done to defend our freedom.

This community service opportunity will give our students a chance to give back to the local heroes and heroines who have given so much to us.

My big news for this week, is that the Annual Parent Survey is coming home today with the oldest child in each family!

For our new families, this is our annual ""check up"" to see how we are doing! I ask that you reflect on our year so far and tell us what you think.
The data is collected, shared with the Board, and used for planning with the staff for the 2019-2020 school year.

I thank you in advance for your help with this!!!

Also, on behalf of myself and the Staff, we wish you a peace-filled holiday weekend!

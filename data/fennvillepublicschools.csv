248,3.0,,57.0,,10156757710956969,"This is an important announcement from Fennville Public Schools. At approximately 11:20 a.m. today our schools were instructed by police to go into lockdown due to a potential threat outside of the school. At 11:30 the lockdown was changed to shelter in place so instruction could continue in the building. At 11:40 a.m. we received the “all clear” signal and operations returned to normal.

At this point we do not have specific details about the nature of the incident, and we are not aware of any connection to the school. Police stopped a vehicle on the southwest corner of Memorial Drive and reportedly took a suspect into custody.

I appreciate the prompt response of law enforcement and their concern for the safety of our students and staff. I also appreciate the cooperation of students and staff in following our emergency procedures. We will use this opportunity to evaluate our response as part of our continued commitment to safety and security.

Thank you,

The 20 FHS students are caring and talented people. Thank you families for all of the support. Thank you to Mrs. Pam Pierson and Mrs. Vivian Boot for all the accompanying for the day. You both were incredible. ♥️♥️
Both ensembles, Chamber Choir and Men’s Ensemble, achieved high ratings; will move on to state. Congrats!!
We also received 11 One ratings on solos and 7 Two ratings on solos. 6 of the solos that were Twos, were the highest number possible and also qualified for state.

Jan 31, 2020",2.0,"Ms. Onken's third-grade class learned about the geography of Michigan. Each group chose a different city in our state. Together they researched the location, natural characteristics, and human characteristics found in that area. Students not only learned a lot about our state, they also learned how to work together successfully.

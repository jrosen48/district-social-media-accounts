I have a 4th and 6th grader at home with me so I do understand the challenges everyone is facing. My best advice is to balance the day with academic activities, reading, outdoor activities if safe, limiting screen time, promoting social contact with peers via technology or a good old fashioned phone call, board games, etc. I will continue to post resources to assist us all during this challenging time.

Thank you for your patience, understanding, and support.

Families,
Earlier today we received notice from Ferndale Area Police to institute LOCK IN protocol at Ferndale Area Junior-Senior High School as a precautionary measure. A person of interest by the police was on foot in the neighborhood of Harlan Avenue. Police from 3 precincts were on location searching for this person. Within approximately 1/2 hour, the person of interest was secured and we received an ""All Clear"" from Ferndale Borough Police Chief Blake.

During a LOCK IN, all activity proceeds as normal on the inside of the building. All students and staff are safe. However, no one is permitted to enter or leave the school building until notified by police that all external concern is gone

Thank you.

We are excited to be one of the many local schools participating in #SpeakOutGreenOut on Wednesday, February 12, 2020.

The purpose of this day (and activities throughout the week) is to raise awareness of and prevention of social isolation. Many times, students feel alone or unable to connect and make friends, even in a classroom or a cafeteria full of people. So, the focus of this day is to come together as a school unit, to reach out and speak to someone new, to get to know someone better and to check in with one another if someone is seen sitting alone.

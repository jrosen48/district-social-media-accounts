One in A Million
By: Ahmajaye W. J. 5-1-2020

One word to describe my time at TCEC is success. From the Principal, teachers, and even janitors there could be no wrongdoing. When I first started to attend TCEC I did not think I was going to fit in. I thought because it was “one of those” schools that it was going to be hard to accomplish my goals.

We will be holding a weekly online check in for future Boys Fall 2020 players to provide any help with staying engaged during quarantine, updates on schedule, and any other questions they might have. We aren't just a team but a family. We encourage incoming freshman to attend these as well. Please either message us or email us your sons school email so we can add them to the invite.

Alternatively girls players who would like to stay connected can come as well, please reach out so we can add you to our email list.

Thanks,
Coach Nick",2020-04-12 14:00:40,,

Due to the uncertainty created by the rapidly evolving nature of the the COVID-19 outbreak and the many logistical hurdles we currently face, there is not a responsible way to change spring break at this time. We want our students back in school as soon as it is safe, and logistically feasible to do so.

Last nights victories gave the Eagles a 2-0 League record as the quest for league and district titles begins in 2020.

Double winners for the Eagles last night were: Martez Squalls, Dylan Coleman, Ameer Joyner, Jeremiah Crisp, Justin Varnadore, Elijah Pool, Mason Smith, Joshua Cook and TJ Smith.

Also winning matches last night were Armand Richey, Christian Renfroe and Dawy Gonzales-Count. Competing for the first time as a varsity wrestler last night was Andrew Merriman in a tough fought match at 103. Anthony Akabuo continues to work hard as our light heavyweight.

Congratulate your friends on the wrestling team! Our next league matches are at Berkley next Wednesday at 5 pm. Go Eagles.",2020-01-09 14:32:12,,

After consulting with our teachers union and other Oakland County School Districts, we have determined that Spring Break will continue as originally planned (April 6th-10th).

Due to the uncertainty created by the rapidly evolving nature of the the COVID-19 outbreak and the many logistical hurdles we currently face, there is not a responsible way to change spring break at this time. We want our students back in school as soon as it is safe, and logistically feasible to do so.

Thank you for your understanding during these challenging times.

As of now, our plan is to return to school on Monday, April 13th. Please know that this date is subject to change based upon guidance from Governor Whitmer and health officials.

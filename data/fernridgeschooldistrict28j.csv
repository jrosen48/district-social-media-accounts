Videographer Michael Sherman of @SpringFedMedia created this video about this amazing experience!

What is Every 15 Minutes?
Every 15 Minutes is a two-day underage drinking and driving prevention program which challenges teens to think before drinking and operating any type of motor vehicle, riding in one after the operator has been drinking, or engaging in activities that cause them to become distracted such as cell phone usage. It also focuses on the impacts those decisions have on family, friends, and the people you leave behind when someone is killed as a result of an alcohol or distracted driving related crash.",7.0,"https://www.facebook.com/LaneCountySheriffsOffice/videos/1111541792381078/

If the field is built, the district would ensure it was saving 40 thousand dollars a year to make certain that we could maintain and replace the field without another bond when it's time to replace it.

Today, both the Cross Country Meet in Cascade and the Girls Soccer match in North Bend are ""on"" based on air quality reading at both sites. Good Luck.

We are still unsure if practice for the rest of our teams here in Elmira will occur inside or outside, a decision will be made soon. Tomorrow night we have home football vs. Newport. Our current plan is to hold the game here tomorrow night as planned, assuming air quality warrants it. If the weather changes late in the day tomorrow, unfortunately cancelling is still an option. If, we can determine tomorrow morning by 8:00 AM that we cannot play here in Elmira, the game may be moved to Newport. I will post updates as we have them. Go Falcons..........and please let in RAIN!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1359601774138685&id=460293930736145,,0.0,"Athletics update--Air Quality:

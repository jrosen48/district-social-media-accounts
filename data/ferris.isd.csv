Governor Abbott has closed all schools for the remainder of the school year. We will continue with our current ""at-home"" instruction models while we await further guidance from TEA Commissioner Mike Morath early next week. Although this may be a difficult decision to comprehend, the Governor has made this closure decision in the best interests of the health of students and school district staff. We will remain steadfast in our service to our children and our community.

Blessings to you all.

“What makes their designs state worthy is not just the art work, which is obviously fantastic, but more importantly their unique design concepts, which must be explained in detail in their justification papers that they write. They did amazing work.” -Mrs. J. Curri Hairston

These school closure decisions are based on these health agency recommendations.

Ferris Jr. High – Samysara Villa
We are so proud of Samysara Villa for her willingness to work so hard for her family. She is a student that is not only working hard at home to help out her family, but is also working extra hard in school to graduate early. She has plans to be a music producer and at an early age knows her goals are bigger than her adversity. She is even motivating her sisters to finish their schooling as well. We are so proud of her for being a HERO and inspiration at school and at home for her peers and family.

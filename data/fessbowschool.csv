Celebrated the Class of 2020 at graduation today. No reception line, so the class paraded down Main Street whole friends and family shouted congratulations and honked to celebrate their day! Just a bittersweet moment.... these kids you've watched grow up for 12 years are off to adult and on to college and starting careers!🎓

I was watching the seniors walk out of FBS one last time with a dear friend and colleague Mr. Warren Strand. He has been by my side everyday for the last 8 years as my Principal, and 23 years working together. As I looked up at him, I also realized this was OUR last graduation.....and we were both moving on to the next chapter of OUR lives! Thank you Mr. Strand for supporting the kids and staff of FBS....but also always believing in my crazy ""gut feelings"" and believing in my ""outside the box"" ideas that were always ""best for the kids""😉! Best of luck!

I reviewed the Pandemic Plan with the school board last evening, and would like to share it with you to keep you abreast of the educational planning for your child(ren).

Dear Parents,

This is a reminder that for the Christmas concert we would like to have our students wear “festive” Christmas attire. The attire should not be casual (jeans, t-shirts, sneakers/athletic shoes, etc.), but dressy (girls - slacks, skirt, or dress, blouse or sweater; boys - slacks, button-down shirt or sweater; all - nice shoes. Christmas accessories allowed!)

Our standard black/white is also acceptable, but with some added Christmas accessories, if possible (tie, bows, earrings, etc.). If you need help with attire, please let us know!

On Monday night students should be in their places in the bleachers by 6:20 at the latest. Kindergarten, 1st and 2nd grades will perform at the beginning. At the end of their performance, we will dismiss them to be seated with their parents. Please do not have your child here before 6:15pm (unless they are with you), as they would be unsupervised.

Thanks so much - I’m looking forward to a wonderful evening!

This year for the Christmas concert we would like to have our students wear “festive” Christmas attire, rather than (or in addition to) our standard black top/white bottom. The attire should not be casual (jeans, t-shirts, sneakers, etc.), but dressy (girls - slacks, skirt, or dress, blouse or sweater; boys - slacks, button-down shirt or sweater; all - nice shoes.
Our standard black/white is also acceptable, but with some added Christmas accessories (tie, bows, earrings, etc.).

If you need help with attire, please let us know!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2549960158392653&id=418209844901039,,0.0,"Dear Parents,

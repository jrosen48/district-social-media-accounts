While the start of the 2020-21 school year looked a little different this year, smiles and excitement were a continued hallmark of the first day at FFCS. Students in grades 7-12 are attending school in-person this week, while students in PK-6 participate in remote learning. Prekindergarten and kindergarten screening is underway as students in grades 1-4 attend one-on-one meetings to tour their classrooms and meet their teachers. We hope all of our students, families and staff have a wonderful start to the school year! #bravestrong",0.0,"Fonda-Fultonville Central School District added 32 new photos.

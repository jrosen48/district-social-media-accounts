A few moments ago Governor DeWine announced that Ohio students will not return to school buildings for the remainder of this academic school year. He stated that remote learning will continue. He also shared that no decision has been made regarding our return to school in the fall.

With this announcement comes many questions. Over the next days and weeks the Board of Education and administration will be sharing with you how Felicity Schools will finish this school year. Questions regarding grades, credits, promotion/retention, graduation and summer learning opportunities will be answered.

By now, most of you know of Governor DeWine’s announcement that schools in Ohio will be closed starting Monday, March 16 and reopen April 6. I am sure you have a lot of questions.

Our administration is working on a detailed plan for your students and will have those details regarding school work, grade cards etc. for you tomorrow.

In the short term, Felicity-Franklin schools will be on a two hour delay tomorrow, Friday, March 13. Staff will report at regular time.

Felicity Schools will be closed beginning Monday, March 16 and will reopen Monday, April 6.

We are using the two hour delay to allow teachers time to begin preparing learning materials for students to use during the three week closer.

Assuming your child is not ill, it is very important that your student(s) attends school tomorrow. Students will receive educational materials as well as important updates for you.

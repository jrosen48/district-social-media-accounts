Great profile on Forest Hills Public Schools Kristen Pennington, the new Knapp Forest Elementary principal and a 2002 East Kentwood High School-KPS graduate. Pennington earned a bachelor’s degree in elementary education from Western Michigan University, and a master’s degree in educational leadership from Cornerstone University. She said a specialty endorsement course called Leadership Matters — which she took through the Michigan Elementary and Middle School Principals Association — “really refined my skills as a leader. Once I completed that course, I felt really prepared to support a building full of people.”

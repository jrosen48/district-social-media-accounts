Local drivers should be aware of a major I-5 ramp closure at Port of Tacoma Road in Fife from March 6-23, due to a vital cleanup project. View full details and alternate routes at https://cityoffife.org/traffic.

The cleanup is required following an accident in 2016 when a fuel truck overturned on Port of Tacoma Road. The insurance company for that truck driver is paying for the cleanup and project. The project is significant because the overturned truck leaked 7,500 gallons of fuel. Much of the contaminated soil already has been removed, but the time has come to remove the last of the contaminated soil under the roadways.

We'll be sending out several alerts leading up to the closure and during the closure, but please consider sharing this post with your friends who regularly drive this route.",0.0,"TRAFFIC ALERT: Please see the information from City of Fife, Washington below.

Fife Police Officer Patrick Gilbert is a prime example of selflessness. He works as a School Resource Officer for Fife High School, coaches football, is involved in his community, and in his ""spare"" time dedicates his energy to advocating for people with Intellectual Disabilities.

Last year he organized the first ever Hoopin' 4 Heroes basketball game, which saw first responders play against Fife High School employees- and helped to raise $5,000 dollars!

This year he once again pushed the envelope and Super Plunged in Seattle! You can find him next at Fife Highschool's 2nd Annual Hoopin for Heroes or at the Tacoma Polar Plunge this Saturday.#PledgePlungeParty

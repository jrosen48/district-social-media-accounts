In order to protect our staff we are asking those of you with a driveway longer than 100 feet to put a tote at the end of your driveway. We are also asking those of you with a driveway less than 100 feet to place a tote near your door to respect social distancing rules and remember to keep your dog tied up or in the house between 10 o'clock and 1 o'clock. The staff has been instructed to not deliver meals to homes with loose dogs. We appreciate your cooperation in helping keep our staff safe.

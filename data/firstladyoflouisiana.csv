If you haven’t done so already, visit https://buff.ly/3iRHl6u and fill yours out today! #lagov",2020-08-18 09:51:44,,

Today, I issued an executive order that flags be flown at half-staff in honor of the life and legacy of Rep. John Lewis, civil rights pioneer and icon. Congressman Lewis is an icon of the American Civil Rights Movement and dedicated his life to protecting human rights, securing civil liberties, and building what he called “The Beloved Community” in America.

As he poignantly once said, ‘When we see something that’s not right, or not just, we have a moral obligation to speak up and speak out to do something about it.’ He will be long remembered by the people of Louisiana and across the world.

Please join First Lady Donna Edwards and me in praying for Congressman Lewis’ family and all who have been touched by his tremendous fight for justice and equality for all of humanity. #lagov",4.0,"Governor John Bel Edwards

I have declared today, June 19, 2020, as Juneteenth Observance Day in Louisiana. On Juneteenth, we celebrate the end of slavery in America and we honor the history and contributions of African Americans in our country.

Juneteenth is a celebration of freedom and justice and it is a reminder of the strength and resolve of African Americans throughout history.

Honoring Juneteenth gives us all an opportunity to develop a greater and deeper understanding and appreciation of the experiences of African Americans. As we take time to reflect today, may we all recommit ourselves to the ongoing fight for equity and justice. #Juneteenth #lagov

As today marks the beginning of the 2020 Hurricane Season, we are actively monitoring a tropical system in the Bay of Campeche with a high probability of development. Regardless of development, there will be a potential for heavy rainfall this weekend.

I want to urge the people of Louisiana to prepare for hurricane season now and Get A Game Plan. Visit GetAGameplan.org for emergency preparedness tips and information and be sure to add items like masks and hand sanitizer into your supplies kit.

There is still significant uncertainty in the system's eventual track and intensity, but we will continue to monitor the situation and offer updates as they are made available.

Congratulations, class of 2020! I know this isn’t the senior year you envisioned and no one can replace the memories you had hoped to share with friends and family during this time. But, I want you to know how incredibly proud I am of everything you have accomplished and the persistence it took to get there.

One of the things our fight against COVID-19 has taught us is that we need creative, innovative minds like yours to bring forth solutions and build stronger communities no matter what challenges come our way. You are the future of Louisiana, and because of you, that future looks bright.

Part of our new normal will mean wearing a mask or face-covering in public. Wearing a mask in public is just like holding a door open for someone, it's being kind and courteous, and it will be critical to Louisiana moving forward.

When I say mask, I mean wearing some sort of cloth facial covering. We've seen creative folks make masks out of t-shirts or other household materials, and I am encouraging everyone to begin the process now to start getting them for yourselves and your families.

Sunday’s severe weather impacted multiple parishes, with reported tornadoes and hail. I am declaring this emergency in order to make sure the impacted parishes and any additional areas that may see severe weather into the night are able to get assistance.

Please continue to monitor local media for information about weather in your area and follow the directions of your local officials. #lagov #lawx",2020-04-12 21:10:00,,

April 2 at 3:36 PM ·

Today, we are announcing a new text alert system that will provide timely COVID-19 updates and other critical guidance directly from the governor’s office to Louisiana residents.

I encourage all Louisianans to sign-up for the new text alert system and stay up to date with the latest COVID-19 information. We are all in this together, and having the most recent information is critical in stopping the spread of COVID-19 throughout Louisiana.

We have not yet begun to flatten the curve in Louisiana, and we need the people of our great state to be good neighbors, stay at home and socially distance themselves now more than ever.

To opt-in, text ‘LACOVID’ to 67283.

Big news! More than 440,000 small businesses in all 64 Louisiana parishes will have access to federal Small Business Administration disaster aid in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis. COVID-19 is a unique crisis affecting all walks of life, and that means Louisiana’s small business community will continue to be heavily impacted by disruptions to their operations.

We are pleased to work with SBA and the federal government in providing this critical working capital to our small business owners who are suffering from the necessary measures installed due to the Coronavirus. Our hope is that these SBA disaster loans will be an important part of sustaining their businesses and providing support to their employees who make up over half of Louisiana’s private-sector workforce. #lagov

Our elderly and those with chronic health conditions are the most vulnerable, but we all need to act responsibly and look out for ourselves and our neighbors. #lagov #COVID19

It is with heavy hearts that we announce the first Louisiana death related to COVID-19 today. I have spoken with Mayor LaToya Cantrell, and we send our prayers and condolences to the family of the deceased. In addition, we now have 10 new presumptive positive cases bringing our total to 77.

Now more than ever, we must remain vigilant against the spread of this illness by taking care of ourselves and each other, avoiding going into public areas if you are sick, practicing social distancing and washing your hands frequently with soap and water.

This underscores the fact that those with underlying health issues are most at risk from the coronavirus. Those with compromised immune systems and are older should be taking extra precautions to avoid becoming affected with the coronavirus. #lagov",14.0,"GOV.LOUISIANA.GOV

Today, I signed a proclamation that immediately halts any gathering of more than 250 people until Monday, April 13, closes all K-12 public schools statewide effective Monday, March 16 and also moves upcoming state elections.

We are at an inflection point now and we are going to take bold action to minimize the further spread of this illness. That is why I am issuing this order today, ending all events of more than 250 people, closing our schools, and reducing the amount of face-to-face public interaction at state government buildings.

In a separate executive order I will grant Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin’s request to move our upcoming elections for April and May to June and July. The limits on gatherings of 250 people or more statewide is based on federal CDC guidance given the community spread which we are currently experiencing. These steps are necessary to protect the health and safety of the people of Louisiana from the risk of COVID-19.

Today, the Louisiana Department of Health has reported Louisiana’s first presumptive positive case of COVID-19, commonly referred to as coronavirus, as a Jefferson Parish resident who is hospitalized in Orleans Parish.

At this time, there is only one known case of the illness in the state.

While today is the first time that we can confirm that we have a presumptive positive coronavirus case, Louisiana has been preparing for this moment for many weeks. The CDC still believes the risk to the general public is low, but we will work quickly and decisively to assess the risk to those around this patient. #lagov

The service interruption was due to OTS’ aggressive response to prevent additional infection of state servers and not due to the attempted ransomware attack.

It is with a heavy heart that we say goodbye to Ernest J. Gaines, a native Louisianan who used his immense vision and literary talents to tell the stories of African Americans in the South. We are all blessed that Ernest left words and stories that will continue to inspire many generations to come. Born in poverty in Pointe Coupee, Ernest would go on to author 10 novels and numerous short stories, to be nominated for a Pulitzer Prize and win the National Book Critics Circle Award for his acclaimed novel A Lesson Before Dying. He was a writer in residence at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette for more than 20 years. Earlier this year, Donna and I had the chance to visit with Ernest and his wife after a Sunday drive. It’s a memory we will both cherish as part of our long friendship. Please join us in elevating him, his wife and his family in your prayers. #lagov",26.0,"THEADVOCATE.COM

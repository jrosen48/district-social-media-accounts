Alex is the daughter of Elizabeth.

She celebrates her birthday on January 4.

Alex’s sibling is Ronnin.

Her favorite class Choir because she loves to sing. Her least favorite class in Animal Science.

Alex’s favorite food is olives and her favorite color is baby blue.

Mrs. Larson has been her favorite teacher. She was the best 3rd grade teacher.

Alex’s favorite memory from high school is playing Pictionary.

The year she was in 4th grade is her favorite elementary school memory.

In her spare time, you will find Alex relaxing with a good book as reading is her downtime activity of choice.

If Alex could change one thing about herself it would be her attitude.

Her advice to underclassmen is “Stay focused and keep your head up.”

After graduation, Alex plans to get a job and move out on her own.

... Meet Cam!

Cam is the son of Tom and Becky.

He celebrates his birthday on December 14th.

Cam’s siblings are Claire and Trace.

Cam says that his favorite class would be Composition because he likes writing papers. His least favorite class is math because it gets too complicated.

Youth Service and getting to help out teachers this year is a favorite school activity for Cam.

His favorite food is chicken wings and his favorite color is orange.

Ms. Hensrud, the English teacher, is Cam’s favorite teacher because she has taught him lots of things to remember for college.

Being with friends is his favorite high school memory.

Gym class is Cam’s favorite elementary school memory.

In his spare time, he keeps himself busy with hunting and fishing

For employment, Cam works with a local carpenter.

His advice to underclassmen is “Good luck, you got a long road ahead.”

After graduation, Cam plans to continue with a career in carpentry.

Best of luck to you Cam!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2940443282712580&id=968822399874688,,0.0,"We know this is not the ideal way to spend your Senior Year of High School, so let's give our Seniors some love!

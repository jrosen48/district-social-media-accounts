Attention Flagstaff!

Alyssa Williams, one of the rock stars that won Vans, was selected as a finalist for a new competition to have her design featured on a state license plate, which will contain the Native American Code Talkers seal she created. She has been in the lead the whole time, until the past couple of hours.

Voting ends TOMORROW at 5pm. Could you please take a moment to vote at the link below?

This is very important to her, as a Navajo young lady. She wants to be a designer once she leaves high school. All the success she has had in the past couple years could launch her into an insanely rewarding and successful career.

If you are heading to the 51st City Championship Football Game between Coconino and Flagstaff in the Skydome tomorrow (Friday), make sure come by the tailgate before heading into the Skydome. There will be games, fun, and a live remote on HITS 106. It runs from 5-7 p.m. so stop by. Also, if you are planning on going and don't have a ticket, get them early at the NAU ticket office or online.

If you can't go, don't forget we will have the game LIVE starting at 7 p.m. on KAFF Country Legends 93.5/AM 930. Coconino has qualified for the 4A state playoffs, but ""COULD"" get a home game in the first round with a win. A win by Flagstaff ""MAY"" get them in the 4A state playoffs and snap the two game winning streak by Coconino. Pack the Dome, or listen on KAFF Country Legends or online at KAFFLegends.com.",3.0,"KAFF News

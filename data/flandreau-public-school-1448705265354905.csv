Parents,
The next School Board Meeting is Monday 7/13/20 at 6pm in the Elementary Commons. The Back to School Plan (BSP) is on the agenda. The BSP link is attached and is currently a work in progress as information and guidelines from various departments needs to be addressed, but is changing daily. Again, the BSP is a work in progress.

The BSP includes 3 phases - Full Open (Green Phase), Hybrid (Yellow Phase), Distance Learning (Red Phase). Distance Learning will be a full time option available to families, but once a family has chosen this option, it will remain that way for the entire Semester.

Please see links for more info on the meeting.

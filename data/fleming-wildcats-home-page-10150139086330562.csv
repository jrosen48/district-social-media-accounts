Here is our registration form for Machine Pitch, Minors, and Majors for our 2019 season. As a Board decision we are doing everything earlier this year. This includes registration dates, registration deadlines, coaches meeting, team drafts, and the season schedule. This form has been/will be taken to Ayres Elementary School, Campbell Elementary School, Sterling Middle School, Caliche Schools, Fleming Schools, Merino Schools, Peetz Schools, PRO Sports, and the Sterling Rec Center. You can either bring this form to our 3 registration dates, drop it off at PRO Sports in Sterling, or mail it to us. Also here is a PDF link to the form you can print out. T-ball and Coach Pitch forms will be put out later in about a month since their season is different. We are looking forward to having a great season for the kids!

Sterling Baseball Organization
January 16, 2019 at 6:29 PM ·

Here is our registration form for Machine Pitch, Minors, and Majors for our 2019 season. As a Board decision we are doing everything earlier this year. This includes registration dates, registration deadlines, coaches meeting, team drafts, and the season schedule. This form has been/will be taken to Ayres Elementary School, Campbell Elementary School, Sterling Middle School, Caliche Schools, Fleming Schools, Merino Schools, Peetz Schools, PRO Sports, and the Sterling Rec Center. You can either bring this form to our 3 registration dates, drop it off at PRO Sports in Sterling, or mail it to us. Also here is a PDF link to the form you can print out. T-ball and Coach Pitch forms will be put out later in about a month since their season is different. We are looking forward to having a great season for the kids!

I think it would be best if you brought your own lunch and snacks to eat when we arrive that way we will have more time to enjoy the exhibits as we will have a little less than 4 hours. We have admittance into the Star Wars exhibit at 12:15. We will depart the museum around 2:45 and stop at DQ in Fort Morgan and arrive home at approximately 5:30 (Sterling kids will be dropped off around 5:00/5:15).

This includes registration dates, registration deadlines, coaches meeting, team drafts, and the season schedule. This form has been/will be taken to Ayres Elementary School, Campbell Elementary School, Sterling Middle School, Caliche Schools, Fleming Schools, Merino Schools, Peetz Schools, PRO Sports, and the Sterling Rec Center. You can either bring this form to our 3 registration dates, drop it off at PRO Sports in Sterling, or mail it to us. Also here is a PDF link to the form you can print out. T-ball and Coach Pitch forms will be put out later in about a month since their season is different. We are looking forward to having a great season for the kids!

The Stull Family had a house fire last night. Cia posted some needs as of right and I have posted them below. If any of you have anything to get to them please comment below. Drop off items at Cattleya Floral in Sterling or with Kassie in Iliff. As we get more information on needs they will be added to this post. Let's help them out if we can! Hugs to the Stull family!!

Clothes for my younger 2 as they lost everything. Quincy is a size 12 and size 4 shoes and my son Kanyon is a size 10 and size 3 shoes. Quincy is almost 9 and likes craftsy stuff, American girl dolls, drawing, and animals. Kanyon is 7 and a complete country kid and likes trucks, tractors, legos, farm and ranch stuff, and sports.

Also, Chris Green is taking donations for meals for the family that they can freeze and reheat. Post below if this is something you could help with and I will get you into contact with her.",0.0,"The Stull Family is part of Fleming Schools.

""The true sign of intelligence isn't knowledge but imagination."" -Albert Einstein.

I am extremely proud of the amazing imaginations of our artists at Fleming High School! They truly demonstrated craftsmanship, technique and of course, imagination with their pieces chosen for the High Plains Art Show at NJC. Way to represent! Props to their previous art teachers, Ms. Wernsman (so?), Ms. Foote, and Mr. Laybourn who laid a pretty fabulous foundation!

""The true sign of intelligence isn't knowledge but imagination."" -Albert Einstein.

I am extremely proud of the amazing imaginations of our artists at Fleming High School! They truly demonstrated craftsmanship, technique and of course, imagination with their pieces chosen for the High Plains Art Show at NJC. Way to represent! Props to their previous art teachers, Ms. Wernsman (so?), Ms. Foote, and Mr. Laybourn who laid a pretty fabulous foundation!

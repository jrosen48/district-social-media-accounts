Since students will be working from home and the District-issued devices are not needed for use at school, we are asking any family that does not need their District-issued device to voluntarily return the device so we can redeploy it temporarily to a kindergarten student.

If we should return to in-person learning before our shipment arrives, we will collect the devices from our Kindergartners and return them to your child for use in school as well as at home.

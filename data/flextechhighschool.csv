Today, I am issuing a “Stay Home, Stay Safe” Executive Order. It goes into effect tonight at midnight.

The goal here is simple: Stay home. Stay safe. Save lives. If we all stay at home, except for critical work and needs, we can mitigate the spread of COVID-19.

Let me be clear: Your grocery stores will still be open. Your pharmacies will remain open. Your banks and credit unions will still be functioning. You can fill your car with gas.

The full list of critical services that will remain open is available at Michigan.gov/coronavirus.

I know this is difficult. I know that this is disruptive. But doing this will save lives. When we look back at this, we must be able to say we did everything we could. We will get through this together.

""I am very excited to be part of the FlexTech team. I have worked in education for the past six years and I love what I do. I am passionate about education and each year I look forward to working with students and teachers to engage in memorable experiences.

I attended the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor where I earned both a Master of Arts in Educational Studies and a Bachelor of Arts in Spanish and English. I was raised in Ann Arbor, MI and still live in the area with my husband, Andy, and our standard schnauzer named Oscar. We enjoy going out to eat, taking walks downtown Ann Arbor and at parks, and traveling when we can. When I am not spending time with family and friends I enjoy reading, exercising, and exploring new hobbies.""

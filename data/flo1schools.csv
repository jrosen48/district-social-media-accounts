National Championship

From the Desk of Jeremy Trussell:
In everything that has taken place with sports in 2020 we finally finished the bass season Saturday with the state championship. Even though we did not take first this year in the state, the team of Matt Brault and Jackson Salley finished 2nd in the final standing of the SC High School Bass Challenge Trail.

This finish has qualified them for the B.A.S.S. National Championship to be held in October in Paris, TN on Kentucky Lake.

Both of these anglers are rising seniors and great young men. The school and district should be proud to have these young men represent them in October.

Congratulations to our Sneed Middle School 2019-2020 Teacher of the Year, Mrs. Lynn Howard!!!

Mrs. Howard has been a Science teacher here at Sneed for 7 years now. In addition to her regular teaching duties, she is the head of our award-winning 4-H Club and assists with our Environmental Club.

Sneed Middle School has an established Honeybee Apiary thanks to a grant Mrs. Howard, a certified beekeeper, won for us. More recently, we received a Champions of the Environment grant for a Wildlife Oasis on our campus. She has put in countless hours of her own time working on these projects, and has even planted a 4-H Food Plot for her students to tend!

After viewing a video segment, partners discussed how the bullies could show kindness instead. Then, we applied what we discussed with three hands-on STEM building projects: Stacking cups, Keva Planks, and playdough creations.

Finally, we practiced giving and receiving compliments while creating unique artforms out of playdough. K is for Kind!",2019-11-10 18:45:46,,

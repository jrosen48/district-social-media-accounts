FHS Senior Salute: Sonae Shelton

I played tennis and went to state all four years! I was also in FCA, FCCLA, Pep Club, and Student Council (Secretary) all four years. I was on the NHS, High Honor Roll, Spanish Club, Science Club, basketball team, and on the Homecoming, Sweetheart, and Prom Court.

I plan to attend Frontier Community College and obtain my Associate's Degree in 1 year. I will then transfer to a university and major in business finance.",0.0,"Toby Pearce

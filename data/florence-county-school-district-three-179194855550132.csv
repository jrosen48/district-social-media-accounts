Our second grade students attended a field study today to Moore Botanical Gardens to learn about pollinators!

Students had an opportunity to practice pollinating flowers on their own and then followed up with observing actual pollinators in the garden!

We’re so excited that Mrs. Kelli Meeker will be coming to Olanta Magnet next week to help us set up our own pollinators!

Meet your 2020-2021 Florence FFA
Treasurer, Tyler Edgar. This is not Tyler's first rodeo, last year he also served as the Florence FFA Treasurer. He competes in an abundance of events in the FFA such as Milk Quality and Food Science. Tyler is an asset to the officer team because of his generous personality, and ability to pick up and handle whatever is thrown at him. Tyler is a smart, skilled leader for this team. His advice to younger FFA members is to be involved and be dedicated to managing your time to do as many things as possible. Hard work will pay off in the Florence FFA. Tyler looks forward to an exciting senior year to help motivate members to be more active in the program.",0.0,"Florence FFA

Following SPC, she went on to Texas Tech University, where she was a member of the 2015 National Champion Meat Judging Team. In 2016, she graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Animal and Meat science. Upon graduation, she took a job with Food Safety Net Services, and has been working in the Food science industry ever since.

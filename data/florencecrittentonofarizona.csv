Cheryl Burke
March 21, 2019 at 5:15 PM ·

Today I had the honor of speaking at an event that has totally given me a new sense of purpose and has made my heart SO full.

Thank you to Florence Crittenton of Arizona for inviting me to the 17th Annual Teaming Up for Girls Luncheon. Every single woman that I met today was awe-inspiring (take a minute to read Hope Award recipient, Michelle Knight’s incredible journey of survival on my Instagram story!) and as a survivor of abuse I can truly say that the work this organization does is life changing.

Thank you for reminding me what is important in life and for the profound impact you have had on mine. #TUFG2019",2019-03-21 20:23:46,,

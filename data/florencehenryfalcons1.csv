Here is a reminder for our drop off days on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday

The drop off days will go from 4:00-6:00 pm on W, Th, Fr. Wednesday will be dedicated to high school, Thursday to middle school, and Friday to elementary. If you have students in various grades, you can pick which ones work best. We ask that HS and MS students come on those days to drop off materials and address any items that come up. Elementary parents can bring their students or take care of it on their own. We will have teachers available on the dedicated days to answer any questions that students have.

Students need to bring any missing homework for turn in, textbooks, library books, laptops, chargers, jerseys, and any other items they may have at home. Students will enter on the east door into the commons and get checked out at each table. they will then exit the main doors on the south side of the gym when they are finished.

With any missing or damaged items, a bill will be sent out.

We look forward to seeing the students one last time before summer break.

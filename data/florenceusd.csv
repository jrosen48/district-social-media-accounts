Hello FUSD athletes, parents, and guardians,
Due to an oversight, the Baseball/Softball season will not be played during Quarter 2 (Q2) of the 2020 season. The FUSD baseball and softball fields will be overseeded during this time and no events will be permitted.
As a result of this, we will offer SOCCER during Quarter 2 (Q2).
SOCCER will begin on October 5th, 2020.
We will keep you informed on Quarter 3 (Q3) and Quarter 4 (Q4) athletic seasons as we make decisions.
We apologies for the inconvenience but look forward to seeing the athletes on the fields again.
If you have any questions, feel free to contact your school site athletic director.

Thank you,

Jeff Cox, M.Ed.

Therefore, please take a moment and provide us with your valuable feedback so we can better serve the educational needs of our students and families.

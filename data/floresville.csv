Floresville Middle School is feeling thankful.
August 7 at 2:40 PM ¬∑

Thank you to our local H-E-B for providing such amazing goodies for our teachers as they continue to work hard to prepare for this NEW year.

H-E-B also provided cases of water bottles for our future face to face students, in case they forget their reusable water bottle the first day of school.

We can‚Äôt wait to see our students, on campus and those studying remotely!! #FloresvilleFamily #FMS #Inthistogether‚ù§Ô∏è #FloresvilleHEB",2020-08-07 21:22:34,,

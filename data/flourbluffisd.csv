Hi Folks - I am officially frustrated with the lack of solid dependable information from our state agencies and politicians. I know all of you are frustrated with the lack of information as well.

We thought we were ready to post reopening information to you our community. Then politics gets in the way and we have to start scrambling to see how our plan matches the changes posted yesterday. Yes, that's right, yesterday! As a result we are working to make sure we are in compliance with the changes.

Our intention is to push out some information Friday afternoon. The disclaimer will be that it may change if we have further last minute changes from the state.

With the new UIL cutoff numbers the closest 5A D2 is 143 miles. Therefore, Flour Bluff ISD reached out to the UIL and asked to opt up to 5A D1. We have received word from UIL that our request has been granted and football will now be in 5A D1. This will minimize student-athlete time out of the classroom and excessive travel costs. We would like to thank the UIL for working with our school district to provide a quality program for our athletes.

For the past seven years, The Walter Douglas Hiking Club, in partnership with the Saguaro National Park, has invited students to get outdoors! The club provides members with several outdoor experiences and culminates in an overnight camp out on Mt. Lemmon in the spring. Members are also encouraged to continue their involvement with the park through volunteer opportunities in the Cactus Ranger program, which can eventually lead to post high school internships. Currently, four FW students from The Walter Douglas Hiking Club have gone on to participate in the Cactus Ranger program!

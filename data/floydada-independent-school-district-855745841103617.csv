1. UIL rules state that schools are limited to a maximum of 50% occupancy of a stadium; therefore, we will only allow 750 spectators at the scrimmage tomorrow evening.

2. Social distancing (6 feet) is required between groups that are not in the same household.

3. Masks or face coverings (over nose and mouth) will be required in the stadium for all spectators. Exceptions to the wearing of face coverings or face shields are as follows:
a. Any person with a medical condition or disability that prevents wearing of a face covering
b. While a person is consuming food or drink
c. When a congregating group of persons in the same household maintains at least 6 feet of social distancing

4. Hand sanitizing stations will be provided throughout the stadium and at all entrances.

5. Seating, handrails, and other common surfaces will be cleaned and disinfected prior to each game.

Thank you to those who have completed the Information for Remote Learning Survey. If you have not already done so, please take the time to complete the information.

FISD is using Google Classroom as a means to provide instruction to your child during this time. Students in grades 5-12 have a gmail address provided by the school. However, students in PK-4th grade do not have gmail addresses. In order to accept the invite to Google Classroom, you must provide a gmail address. It is absolutely free to create an account.

We will be sending out school wide registration forms on Monday for your child to fill out & we will be starting another round of students the following week.

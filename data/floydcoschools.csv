""Maybe Something Beautiful"" by Campoy- Book Reading by Mrs. Elliott - Permission granted to read

Model Elementary School
March 25 at 6:17 PM ·

Today Mrs. Elliott will be reading the book ""Maybe Something Beautiful - How Art Transformed a Neighborhood"" by F. Isabel Campoy and Theresa Howell. illustrated by Rafael Lopez.
Permission was given by the author for us to share this wonderful story.

Mrs. Elliott chose this book because of the message of joy it promotes in the community. Please help in our mission to shower our Model community with positivity by encouraging your student(s) to create and post a joyful piece of artwork using the hashtag #MESspreadsjoy. The students can chalk, paint, color, record themselves singing a song, write a poem or create a craft. When their art is complete, help your child post their creations on social media or share via email with Mrs. Elliott so she can post student work if need be. The hope is that this will help to remind our community about the importance of seeing happiness that we can all enjoy!

Mrs. Elliott chose this book because of the message of joy it promotes in the community. Please help in our mission to shower our Model community with positivity by encouraging your student(s) to create and post a joyful piece of artwork using the hashtag #MESspreadsjoy. The students can chalk, paint, color, record themselves singing a song, write a poem or create a craft. When their art is complete, help your child post their creations on social media or share via email with Mrs. Elliott so she can post student work if need be. The hope is that this will help to remind our community about the importance of seeing happiness that we can all enjoy!

The best way to prevent #COVID19 is to practice everyday preventive behaviors like hand washing and covering your #cough or sneeze with tissue.

Hand washing is the first line of defense because washing your hands with soap and water ,for 20 seconds, kills viruses that may be on your hands.

Special day for my child! He was born colored blind and recently he discovered that they offered glasses for colorblind folks! I told him to wait til after christmas and I would get him a pair.
Well....he took it all on his own(without me knowing) and set himself up a go fund page to where he could get them sooner in hopes of having some donations🤦‍♀️
I tried and tried to get him to stop that campaign but he was way to adamant to get these glasses right now.
**Moral of the story.....being able to see colors each and everyday is a blessing and we fail to realize what a gift our senses really are! For someone that has never really seen what true colors are vividly-what a blessing it is to experience this for the first time!
Thank you to each one that helped my son make this moment happen!!!

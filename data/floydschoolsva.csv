Ms. Joan Agnew was the lucky winner of our Teacher of the Month contest from Willis Elementary! Ms. Agnew has been a teacher for 39 years and currently is in Special Education. Ms. Agnew always puts her kids first. When she battled cancer, she never missed a single day! She scheduled everything around her school schedule because she wanted her children to have a normal day. This is just one of the many special things she does! We are thankful for teachers like Ms. Agnew that lead our youth to a brighter future 📚 #growingthefuture #msagnewisasuperhero Willis Elementary School",0.0,"Congratulations Ms. Agnew!

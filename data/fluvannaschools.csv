And that’s a wrap!

To celebrate World Kindness Day, we decided to “give back” and host a coin drive! We raised $802.54 for OneSight, an organization that provides free eye care for people in need.

Congratulations to Ms. Tapscott’s class for raising the most money!

Thanks to Brooke Nazar for organizing this great project!

In spite of the continuing uncertainty of what next year‚Äôs school year will look like, our administrative team has been looking at different scenarios based on tentative guidelines sent to us by Governor Dewine‚Äôs office and the Ohio Department of Education. As we continue to study our options, a short survey will be sent out sometime in the next several days asking for your opinions. Please help us by completing the survey.

On a different topic, the Class of 2020 will be coming to campus this Saturday to take part in a graduation ceremony that will be released via video on May 31. More details will be released soon on a parade that will be held featuring this outstanding bunch of graduates.

Good afternoon --

Earlier this afternoon, Governor Dewine announced that schools will remain closed for the rest of the school year. In anticipation of that information, we had already scheduled a tentative administrative team meeting to discuss our priorities going forward for early next week. As those plans begin to take shape later this week and early next week, they will be shared with you as quickly as possible. Until then, please be patient with us as there are many subjects to tackle.

In the next few days there may be a reluctance on the part of students to complete work because of this decision by the governor. Please be encouraging and understanding. This is different for everyone and difficult for most.

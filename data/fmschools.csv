Today, Enders Road Elementary School students traveled from their school to the F-M Transportation Center to learn more about the importance of staying safe while waiting for, riding on, and entering and exiting a school bus.

The special presentation was led by an interactive school bus named Buster and a crew of F-M school bus drivers.🚍🚍

🚸🚸The district's transportation department holds the presentation for all F-M K-4 students each year in the fall. For the younger learners, the program helps them become familiar with bus safety and rules. For older students, it's a chance to refresh their knowledge and learn how they can become safety role models.

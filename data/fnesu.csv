As schools open up and children are back on the road, keep in mind that school bus stops and parent drop-offs will take more time than we’re used to. That means more congestion in front of schools, the potential for more vehicles stopped on the road, and more kids and adults near traffic. If you are driving, remember these simple rules:

• Yellow flashing lights on a school bus mean slow down — don’t speed up — because the bus is preparing to stop. There are likely students waiting to get on the bus or parents waiting nearby to pick up children.
• Red flashing lights mean stop — and wait at least 20 feet behind the bus — because children are getting on or off the school bus. Stay stopped until the red lights stop flashing, the extended stop-arm is withdrawn, and the bus begins moving.
• Even when lights aren’t flashing, watch for children, particularly in the morning or mid-afternoon, around school arrival and dismissal times. Be alert as you back out of a driveway, or drive through a neighborhood, school zone, or bus stop.",6.0,"Tomorrow is the big day! We are excited to welcome FNESU students back to school.

Here is a fun activity that will get kids counting, practicing number recognition, fine motor skills, and more using bean seeds and disposable pots. If you don’t have mini pots, use small disposable bathroom cups instead. If you don’t have beans, us can use small rocks, stones, twigs, dandelion heads, goldfish crackers, etc.
How to play:
Roll the dice
Use the tweezers to pick up the beans one by one
You can either put one bean in each pot as you count, or you can put all the beans in the same pot of the number you rolled. (So if you rolled a 6, all the beans would go into the #6 pot).

Adding the tweezers is totally optional. Children will still get tons of small motor pincher grasp practice just by picking up the bean or object you use!",0.0,"Early learning fun!

She also talked about the path she took that led her to her current career, and how it takes MANY types of jobs (artists, cooks, engineers, mechanics, pilots, and video production crews, to name a few) to pull off an arctic expedition on a ship!

Congratulations to all of our incredible scholar leaders inducted into the EFHS chapter of the National Honor Society last night!
As there appears to be some misinformation circulating claiming that this will be the last group of NHS inductees at EFHS, we wish to clarify that this is absolutely not the case. The four NHS tenets of Service, Leadership, Character, and Scholarship will always be fostered and grown here at EFHS, and the National Honor Society will continue to play a role in that growth. We encourage any parent or community member who has questions about structures such as NHS in a proficiency-based system to reach out to our school. We appreciate the opportunity to help clarify your questions and receive your feedback as we grow to support the sort of student success that was on display last night.
Once again, congratulations to the 2018 NHS inductees!",0.0,"Enosburg Falls High School

4-H Staff from Benton, McLeod, Meeker, Sherburne, Stearns and Wright Counties have teamed up to design a fun weekly educational challenge activity for youth to participate in all summer long.

“Full STEAM Ahead With 4-H” Weekly Challenges contain activities that can be completed with your whole family using supplies that you should have on hand at home and are a great way to learn about and make some 4-H projects. The challenges will be located on the MN 4-H at Home Site for families to access. If you miss a week, you can look back and watch. A new activity will be released each week from June, through the end of August. We hope you will choose to participate.

Ms. Monroe’s High School Spanish I students just completed a big project! It's a great compilation of what they've learned to date where they created coloring book pages and brought in crayons, toothbrushes, puzzles, cars, etc. to donate. To date our high school kids collected over 3,500 crayons, 51 toothbrushes, 45 health related items, 59 note pads, 92 writing utensils, 37 sheets of stickers, 32 cars, 9 pairs of sunglasses, 50 educational toys, and over 100 coloring books! In the next couple of weeks, Ms. Monroe will be bringing the coloring books and items to a group from St. Cloud that is traveling to Guatemala for a volunteer work opportunity installing stoves and water purifiers in homes and communities. The items our Foley students made and donated will be passed out to children throughout their trip.

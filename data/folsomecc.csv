I intend to offer additional sessions over the next 3 weeks prior to school starting to review instructional plans for both hybrid and full remote models, and to share any additional updates. There will be a written reopening ""handbook"" that will be available digitally the week before the kids return that will review all of these topics and more.

A 3-year seat will be opening on the School Board in March of 2020! Please consider running for the open seat. No prior knowledge is needed! New board members are given guidance and resources. All you need is common sense, and a desire to help all of South Hero's kids succeed. For more information, check out this short video:
https://www.vtvsba.org/prospective-school-board-members

If you're thinking ""I'm just too busy"", well, you're not alone! Three of the current board members are parents of school-age children. Four work outside the home. ALL of us find ways to volunteer in the community, beyond serving on the school board. No one HAS lots of free time. Board members MAKE time to serve on the school board, because the work is important.

Voter petitions can be picked up at the Town Hall. Collect 17 signatures from registered South Hero voters, and then return your petition to the Town Clerk by 5pm on Monday, January 27th.

Hello Folsom Patriots,

What an amazing and energized beginning to the school year. It is great to hear all of the stories and see all the smiles coming back to the school. We have started practices for both the boys team and the girls team. Both teams are lacking in numbers, leaving the girls with few subs and the boys without a full team. I am hoping by reaching out, a few more students might be willing to sign up to play. The team had a blast at our first practices and we are hoping to get as many additional players as possible to join in on the fun. The soccer season is a great last chance to enjoy outdoor activities before it starts to get colder and darker! Please reach out to me at jgardner@gisu.org if your child is interested in playing.

There will be a sports meeting for parents on Tuesday September 3rd at 6 pm.

I hope to see all of you there!

Thank you!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=668107767037104&id=240410773140141,,0.0,"From Athletic Director Justin Gardner:

Hello Folsom Patriots,

What an amazing and energized beginning to the school year. It is great to hear all of the stories and see all the smiles coming back to the school. We have started practices for both the boys team and the girls team. Both teams are lacking in numbers, leaving the girls with few subs and the boys without a full team. I am hoping by reaching out, a few more students might be willing to sign up to play. The team had a blast at our first practices and we are hoping to get as many additional players as possible to join in on the fun. The soccer season is a great last chance to enjoy outdoor activities before it starts to get colder and darker! Please reach out to me at jgardner@gisu.org if your child is interested in playing.

There will be a sports meeting for parents on Tuesday September 3rd at 6 pm.

I hope to see all of you there!

Thank you!",2019-08-31 16:11:36,,

ONLY IN THE ISLANDS-A daily look at life in the Champlain Islands by Rob Swanson
The Folsom School 3rd and 4th grades paused for a group shot in between a field trip to the South Hero Post Office and a stop at Seb’s for ice cream Tuesday. The students were definitely pumped about the ice cream part of the excursion and the approaching end of the school year.

GREEN UP DAY IN SOUTH HERO SATURDAY

Islanders fanned out across Grand Isle County including South Hero to clean up the roadsides and shorelines during the 49th annual Green Up Day Saturday.
Some of the tires and trash were heavy so young South Hero volunteers needed a helping hand from parents to get the refuse in the back of the collection trucks.
Dean Tremble, 7, manhandled a tire at White’s Beach but needed just a little help from dad Luke to get it into the pickup. Dean didn’t pull any punches when asked his opinion about people who throw out trash and tires at the Town Beach. “They’re pretty stupid,” Dean said as he used a long stick to pull a plastic bag from the wetland behind White’s.
On South Street the Chevrefils family collected roadside trash and all three hoisted a bag into a truck together. From left to right they are; Chase, 9, Cole, 4, and mom Maegan.
Volunteers enjoyed lunch at the Folsom School after the work was finished.

This is an Agency of Education accountability process where teams of educators from various districts visit other schools and conduct a very scripted and specific protocol to gather data about school systems. At the end of the process, teams write up a broad report suggesting areas the supervisory union might want to focus on in the future. There is not an individual school report. This group interview would be conducted on February 13th, in the afternoon, in the 2:15-2:45 time frame. Should last about 20 minutes or so. If you would like to volunteer for this, please send me an email and I'll let you know within the next week about specific details.

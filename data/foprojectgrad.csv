Fort Osage’s Student Council is creating the Senior Slideshow for upcoming senior events. It’s a video ￼ compilation of pictures from the class of 2020’s memories throughout grade school and highschool. We would greatly appreciate it if you would send in pictures of the seniors doing things they love, memories throughout their years at school, pictures with their friends, etc. to @fohsseniors2020@gmail.com . If there is multiple people in the picture it helps us out if you could list the names, but if you don’t know the person’s name that’s okay too. I hope you guys are staying safe and healthy!

Fort Osage, along with other Kansas City metro school districts, are cancelling classes for Wednesday, February 5th. This decision was made due to the number of students and staff who plan to be absent from school to attend the Chiefs Super Bowl celebration. As in 2015 when the Royals won the World Series, there is a concern over the number of substitutes that are needed and the quality of the education day with so many students absent.

Our Fort Discovery program will remain open normal hours for families enrolled. Families will need to report to Blue Hills Elementary School and need to bring breakfast and lunch for their child.

Sports are on as scheduled for Wednesday. DECA and Skills USA competitions have been rescheduled. The CTC open house has been rescheduled for February 6th.

Reminder there is no school on Tuesday, February 4 for staff professional development.

The kids were introduced to many useful things today:
1) Different types of screws and drivers
2) How to read the marks on a tape measure
3) How to read basic building plans
4) Different types of lumber: 2x4, 2x2, 1x4, OSB, structural, treated, pine vs cedar, and so on
5) How to lay out walls and floors
6) What ""on center"" means
7) What the different settings on a cordless drill are used for and when to use them
8) Where & how to shoot screws: location, toenail and straight driving screws
9) How to square a wall or floor by measuring diagonals
10) LOTS of practice shooting 3"" and 2"" screws.
11) How teamwork is important in construction.

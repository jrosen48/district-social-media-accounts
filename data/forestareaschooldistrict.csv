22,1.0,,26.0,,3752628071420124,"The Warren Forest Counties Economic Opportunity Council was awarded a Community Services Block Grant Discretionary Grant from the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development. The intent of the Grant was to address the immediate needs of the residents of Forest and Warren County caused by the onset of the COVID – 19 Pandemic. The Agency determined that providing access to nutritional meals and food was the most pressing need. In response, the Agency provided the Forest County Commissioners $7,850 to purchase and distribute food within the County.

Recognizing that the need for nutritional food is and will continue to be an issue, the Agency is partnering with the Forest Area School District to expand the District’s Community Gardens. Located in Marienville and soon in Tionesta, the Gardens will allow local residents the ability to grow their own food.

For the past three years, Mrs. Hartle and Mr. Wortman have worked with students to enter the ""Talk to your State Senator"" video contest. The theme for this year's contest was Preserving Pennsylvania's Legacy, with an emphasis on farming.

Once again, our middle and high school groups won the senate district! Both groups will advance to the state level of competition and compete for scholarship money. The winners will be announced this summer.

The senior high group consisted of Hunter Turba, Liam Dickson, Waylin Dashner, Brett Banks, and Sebastian Campbell.

The middle school group consisted of Izzy Flick, Hailey Greenlee, Jessica Culver, Katie Salsgiver, and Tori Brown.

Congratulations!

Mrs. Druckemiller’s sixth grade science classes have been working very hard to learn about life’s classification and structure. The students have learned how living things are classified, what are prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, various cell parts and their jobs, and other important concepts throughout the chapter. The students were asked to make either a 3D plant or animal cell to end the chapter. They could use edible or nonedible materials and had to label the cell parts. As you can see the students, greatly enjoyed this project and were very creative in their designs! Great job sixth grade!

On May 3, 2019 the West Forest Elementary Starfish Club held their tenth annual carnival. The theme this year was BIG 10 Sports. The children played basketball, football, golf, and many other sports related activities. They had the opportunity to compete in a free though contest that was won by Devious Hipple. They danced with the Lion's Club Lion and jumped in the bouncy house all night long.
We would like to thank all the community organizations that attended. We hit a new record this year with 27 activities for the children. Maybe next year, we can hit 30. We would also like to thank our PTO for a $500.00 donation and Muccio Transportation for a $300.00 donations. These funds were used to pay for two inflatables. We also received $250 from Fryburg Sportsmen's Club and $100 from Central Electric. Without the support of our community, we could not provide the carnival and many other wonderful experiences for the students of Forest County.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2747739571908984&id=605290362820593,,0.0,"10 years and counting...

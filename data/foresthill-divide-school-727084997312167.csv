Hello FDS Families, Staff, and Board.
Based on the information available yesterday, we have begun initial preparations for keeping our school open during the anticipated Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) on Thursday and Friday. Please note that I have not yet received notification regarding an official shutdown. We are simply preparing for that possibility.
Likewise, please consider preparing on your end should the power shutoff actually occur.
At this time, we will keep school open on Thursday and Friday regardless of the PSPS status barring safety or any other extenuating circumstances unknown to us at this time.
I will keep everyone timely apprised on this PSPS matter.
Thank you.

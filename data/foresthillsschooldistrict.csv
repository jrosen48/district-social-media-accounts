Answer the Call!

Our founding fathers decided every decade every person living in the United States should be counted. The United States Census Bureau takes on this task to obtain an accurate representation of what the country looks like.

Answering the census later this month or in early April is important to help understand our community needs and what it looks like.

The count also helps determine where $675 billion in federal funds will be distributed, and government representation.

This year‚Äôs census only takes a few minutes; for the first time it can be answered online.

Why a Census?

Soon, you will be asked to fill out nine questions for the 2020 U.S. Census, which starts in March. The U.S. Census Bureau takes a head county of every person in the U.S. every 10 years.

The 2020 U.S. Census is mandated by law and important to many functions of government and funding in our community. It helps determine government representation and how millions of dollars are spent in community programs.

New this year, you can answer the questions online, and by telephone.

Look for your 2020 Census Bureau information in your
mailbox soon, beginning with a postcard in mid-March. For a less than 2 minute overview of Census 2020, go to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eq-FMB4epyw.",0.0,"Take a moment to read important information about the Census from our friends at Anderson Township, Ohio - Government! üëáüëá

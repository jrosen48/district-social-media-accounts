The USDA has announced that they have extended the summer meal program waiver. This is great news, as this allows Forest Park Schools to continue serving free meals (as they did in the summer) to all children through as late as December 31, 2020 (or until available funding runs out). What does this mean? This means that if your child would like breakfast or lunch each day, it is free. There is no additional paperwork needed. Your child simply scans their lunch card, so that we can record the sale, and their lunch account is not charged. This is available to ALL students.

Students who choose a la carte items (additional food), or an additional milk, must pay for the additional items, and their lunch account will be charged accordingly. Students who bring cold lunch can also purchase additional food items or milk at regular cost.

Any money that has already been deposited on a student's account will remain in the student's account until needed at a later date. Please contact the office with any questions.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3512467725470423&id=1583721735011708,,0.0,"Parents/Guardians:

It is our tradition to announce the recipient of the Arion award at this concert. The Arion award goes to a senior who has shown great musicianship and citizenship and has demonstrated that they uphold the highest standards of Forest Park tradition.
It is with great pride that I announce that Ms. Mindy McKinnon is this year's recipient.

Mindy McKinnon has always loved music since she was young. She began playing the flute in fifth grade and she has improved her musical ability over the years. She has participated in Solo & Ensemble for four years and the District XIV Honors Band for two years. At Solo & Ensemble, she has received high rankings in her high school years. For her senior year, she was voted among her peers to be Drum Major for marching band. After graduating, she still plans to keep music as a part of her life.
Congratulations Mindy!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3139101909473675&id=1583721735011708,,0.0,"Last night was scheduled to be the Forest Park Music Department spring concert.

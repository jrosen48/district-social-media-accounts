Governor Greg Abbott announced today that schools in Texas would not reopen their school facilities for this current school year but would continue the education of our students through distance learning. Although this saddens us, his goal of keeping us all safe makes this decision understandable. We will soon announce plans for graduation of our 2020 Senior class. We will gradually make other announcements related to end-of-school activities. But first, there are about five weeks of school remaining. We want all of our students to reach their full potential and to accomplish their goals. A serious approach to school work and a “finish strong” attitude are both important in these last few weeks. Thank you each for making this new environment work.

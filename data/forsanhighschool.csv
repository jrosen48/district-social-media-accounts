We have 403 reasons to return to school, but see our 44 biggest reasons in our Senior Spotlights.

Senior Spotlight: Cody Huitt

Message from Cody:
After I attend graduation I plan on attending a trade school to become a mechanic. It has been something that has always interest me. I enjoy playing tennis and playing a little basketball in my free time. Something funny about myself, Freshman year at a tennis tournament, it was me Joshua Caldwell, and Jaden Ceasar all sitting together. Josh accidentally spit his gum out onto the stands. He then tries to throw it at me, I quickly turn my head to dodge it. I then, slowly turned back not knowing the gum was thrown right into my mouth.",0.0,"Forsan HS Counseling Dept

Senior Spotlight: Celsia Sanchez

Message from Celsia:

After I graduate I plan to gain my education at Howard College. I want to enter college striving to receive my LVN license, and then proceed to receive my RN license. My main goal is to become a successful maternity nurse. In my spare time I enjoy spending time with family, coloring while listening to music, and making breakfast. One fact that I can share about myself is that as a senior I worked on receiving my CNA license. I can say it was well worth the time and effort. Through this process I’ve gained knowledge, appreciation, and understanding on what it takes to become a successful nurse. I’ve always had a tremendous heart towards helping others. I can honestly say I’ve gained a greater passion for nursing.",0.0,"Forsan HS Counseling Dept

Governor Greg Abbott announced today that schools in Texas would not reopen their school facilities for this current school year but would continue the education of our students through distance learning. Although this saddens us, his goal of keeping us all safe makes this decision understandable. We will soon announce plans for graduation of our 2020 senior class. We will gradually make other announcements related to end-of-school activities. But first, there are about five weeks of school remaining. We want all of our students to reach their full potential and to accomplish their goals. A serious approach to school work and a “finish strong” attitude are both important in these last few weeks.

Forsan ISD",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1997946217016518&id=783391091805376,,0.0,"To the Forsan ISD Students and Parents,

Governor Greg Abbott announced today that schools in Texas would not reopen their school facilities for this current school year but would continue the education of our students through distance learning. Although this saddens us, his goal of keeping us all safe makes this decision understandable. We will soon announce plans for graduation of our 2020 senior class. We will gradually make other announcements related to end-of-school activities. But first, there are about five weeks of school remaining. We want all of our students to reach their full potential and to accomplish their goals. A serious approach to school work and a “finish strong” attitude are both important in these last few weeks.

“Dare to be Great!”

Randy Johnson

Think of a teacher who has made a big impact on you and film a video in under 30-seconds telling them one specific thing you're grateful that they taught you, and how much you appreciate the role they've played in your life. Speak as if you were talking directly to them, and be as specific as possible.

Our staff met this morning to review the latest information from the Texas Education Agency and the Centers for Disease Control. Teachers and paraprofessionals began planning the best ways to provide instruction to our students. One of our goals is to determine very soon which of our students have access to a device/internet. Watch for a survey this week. We will adjust provision of lessons based on students' ability to use google classroom and/or teachers' websites for updates and assignments. We must also be sure to provide the accommodations and modifications needed for our students that receive special education services. Teachers began today reaching out to students through existing communication channels such as google classroom. We will continue that through the week and begin providing lessons. We miss our students and want them to know that we are thinking about them and their families. Please let us know if you have any questions: 432-457-2223.

Fourth graders at Mercer were all set to participate in The Memory Project, an artwork exchange program with students in Pakistan, when the pandemic hit - leaving their beautiful creations stranded on the drying rack at school. But with the Foundation's support, Mercer teacher Anna Jo Gosses found a way around that obstacle by sharing digital scans of artwork the students had already completed, along with the students' photos. The students from Pakistan shared their fabulous creations with the Mercer students virtually, as well.

The students from Pakistan shared their fabulous creations with the Mercer students virtually, as well.

Hip Hop Rules the World
By Jacqueline Woodson

Hip Hop Rules the World, Lamont said
Grinning like somebody had told him
He’d just won the lotto.

But all it was was Ms. Marcus saying
Of course rap is poetry!
One of the most creative forms.

So now Lamont’s writing lyrics
And bopping his head
And every chance he gets

Saying
Hip Hop Rules the World
And

It’s one of the most creative forms
And

Hey Dog! Guess who else is a poet now!

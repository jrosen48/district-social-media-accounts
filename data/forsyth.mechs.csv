Our student, Sara Isabelle (Izzy) Frances Villacorta is the first graduate to ever sign an athletic college scholarship. In the fall, Izzy will play Lacrosse for Reinhardt College. Until then, she is making a commitment to the Army National Guard. She reported for training in November.

Izzy, we will always remember your smile and work ethic. Best wishes for much success in the National Guard and in your future Lacrosse seasons!",2020-01-05 19:41:10,,

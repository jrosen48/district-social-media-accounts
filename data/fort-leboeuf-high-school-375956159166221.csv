Emily Kucenski will be attending Penn State University in the fall and majoring in Kinesiology. After completion of her bachelor’s degree, Emily’s goal is to pursue a career as a Physical Therapist. Congratulations Emily!

Emily encourages her fellow seniors to reflect on the time they have spent together, and to put the premature end to their senior year in perspective. “Even though our senior milestones have been lost, I realize that it was a small price to pay knowing that my teachers and classmates are safe. For now, I will make the most of the time I have with my family before I leave for college and once all of this is over, I will never again take for granted time with friends.”

All students are required to have a health screening prior to entering the school buildings. The school is asking that parents make every effort to screen their children before sending or bringing them to campus. Our ability to reopen school safely and ability to remain open is truly dependent on parent cooperation with home screening. Additionally we are strongly recommending using the online screening as this will be the most efficient way for screening to be verified and will expedite student entry in the morning. The online screening from can be found on the district homepage.

Please visit our website for more information on the health screening process.

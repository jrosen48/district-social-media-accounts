Good stuff!

Caitlynn Walker, junior, and Mykah Jasman, sophomore, sang vocal solos in Class 1 and Class 2, respectively. Both received Superior ratings for their performances, each bringing home a medal.

Class 1, the highest possible level of competition, is the only category in which a student can advance to state competition, and only then after receiving the highest possible rating (Superior). Having attained that rating, Caitlynn Walker will be advancing to perform in the Texas State UIL Solo Contest on Memorial Day Weekend in Pflugerville, Texas.

Both girls are to be commended for their hard work, their superior performances, and their excellent representation of their high school.

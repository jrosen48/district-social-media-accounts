We are launching our #SafeSchoolsWashtenaw donation drive today!

Schools are being tasked with preparing for a return to in-person learning. Though we don't exactly know when that is yet, our schools WILL need personal protective equipment and critical supplies when that happens.

Thanks to a generous $100,000 starter grant from #ToyotaUSA, we're kick-starting the #SafeSchoolsWashtenaw campaign with a head start towards our $500,000 fundraising goal.

Washtenaw schools are grappling with the challenge of getting high-need items like masks, hand sanitizer, disinfecting wipes, tissues and gloves during the global pandemic, so we are asking the community for help.

Learn more about donating items or funds here 👇
https://washtenawisd.org/covid-19/safe-schools-washtenaw

All items donated or purchased with donations will be distributed equitably across the county's public schools.

If you are in the building by the art room or the kindergarten rooms, you can look out the big windows and see them. I love the bright colors and inspirational quotes or words that my students wrote on them.

Maybe this week or weekend you and your family could paint some rocks and add them to your yard or garden. I would love for you to share pictures of the rocks you painted in the comments. Have fun!

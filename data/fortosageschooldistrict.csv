Good afternoon!

Last week I asked the FOWBB fam how they could still serve the community while staying at home. They decided to develop a series of videos for community youth!

Here's our first video! Katelyn takes your child through a series of basketball ball-handling skills.

Please let us know what you think!
We hope there will be many basketballs bouncing today!

Please share!

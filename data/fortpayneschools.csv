Dear Parent or Guardian,

In an ongoing effort to continuously improve upon its practices, Fort Payne High School invites parents of our students to take part in its annual survey. This year FPHS will use the AdvancED Parent Survey to capture parents’ input, and help target areas of improvement and effectiveness within the school. The AdvancED Parent Survey is also a requirement for accreditation by AdvancED.

The AdvancED Parent Survey gives parents the opportunity to provide their input, opinions and feedback about the school. The results are used to guide FPHS administrators and faculty members in future improvements and organizational efforts to help our students, parents, and community.

We value your opinion and ask that you take the time to complete this survey. Please go to https://eprovesurveys.advanc-ed.org/surveys/#/action/140023/22612 to complete the survey. Your response to this survey will be anonymous. Your honest opinion is appreciated.

Thank you for your time,

Beginning for the 2020-21 school year, Fort Payne High School will begin implementing a Card & Mobile Payment Only ticketing policy at all athletic events. Fans will be able to purchase tickets online through Fort Payne’s GoFan page or by presenting a debit/credit card (or mobile payment option) at the ticket gate.
The new ticketing policy allows Fort Payne to operate a more efficient and professional ticket gate, while creating an enhanced fan experience. Purchasing tickets online allows fans to easily access and share tickets (email or text) without standing in line.
A new ticket gate setup will help promote social distancing, while limiting person-to-person contact and the physical exchange of cash.
Fans are encouraged to purchase their tickets online prior to reaching the facility. For your convenience, signage will be setup at the venue to allow fans to easily navigate an online purchase. Debit/Credit card stations will be setup to support card and mobile payment options at the ticket gates.

I hope all of you are well and practicing social distancing. As you are probably aware Governor Ivey has closed Public Schools for the remainder of the school year. We will now move to virtual school and paper packets for the rest of the school year beginning Monday, April 6, 2020. We will be sending iPads home for all K-4 students, which will allow virtual instruction K-12. I will be sending out more information next week and you will be contacted by your teachers no later than April 6, 2020. We will continue to make meals available for the remainder of the school year. Our CNP Staff and volunteers have done an amazing job the past two weeks providing meals for our students. We will finalize our lesson delivery next week and I will reach out with more information. I want to assure you that we will do our best to make this a productive academic experience.

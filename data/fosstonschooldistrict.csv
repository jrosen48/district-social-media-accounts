Families should still fill out the free and reduced form; when funding for free meals is gone, we will return to charging for meals. This could happen at any time, and with very little notice.

Due to graduation guidelines set by the governor and Department of Education, we will be using the seniors' second choice, a parade-style graduation. Once our plan is finalized, we will share the date and times for material pick up, parade guidelines, and ceremony recordings.

Calling all Greyhound Families!

We understand that these are uncertain times and that our children are feeling the stress. They’re missing their friends and the sense of community. We are determined to bring some light and fun to the situation.

VITAL is proud to present...Virtual Spirit Week!

This is a contest based on Facebook that is open to all students from Threeschool through 12th grade. Students who play along will be entered into drawings to win awesome prizes purchased here in town to support our local businesses.

Here’s how to play:

Each day, have your students dress up according to the theme. Snap a photo of your students and post it on Facebook - *MUST TAG @VITAL Fosston* on your post. That’s it!
** Earn an extra chance to win by liking the VITAL Facebook page and sharing this post! **

Winners will be announced on the VITAL Facebook page and in the Thirteen Towns.
Keep checking the VITAL Facebook page for more fun activities and contests while we are out of school.

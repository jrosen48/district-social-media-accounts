She has worked in Education upwards of 16 years. Being a big theatre buff, Janetta has incorporated her talents into working with middle-schoolers in a 21st Century after school drama program. She has also coached middle school cheer, and helped to start up a morning coffee cart with a high school special education class. Her heart is always with the kids she works with!

Janetta and her husband relocated back to Arizona from Colorado, and chose Fountain Hills as their home. They have a big family of seven kids with their youngest daughter recently graduating from high school. Golf is a big deal with this family, and now have two golf pros to brag about.

Lisa Port was born and raised in the small Midwestern town of Troy, IL (about 20 miles outside of St. Louis, MO).

She is a seasoned educator with 15 years of experience. The entirety of those years have been at Silver Creek Elementary School in Troy, IL.

Mrs. Port and her husband Mark have three adult-age children: Taylor (25), Kaleb (18), and Kristian (18). She is a new resident of Arizona. Her family relocated here at the end of May 2019. In her free time, Mrs. Port enjoys outdoor activities when the weather is nice, reading, and spending time with her family -especially her two sweet nieces.

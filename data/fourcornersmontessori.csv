This summer, Ms. Mandy has been researching mythology, biking, gardening, and observing swallowtail caterpillars.

Last year was the first summer where she had monarch caterpillars and she had been nervous that they wouldn't have any monarchs this year. But she is excited to say that last week 2 monarch eggs hatched! Now there's 3 teensy tiny caterpillars and one more egg. She has been checking every day to try to find new eggs/caterpillars.

Ms. Mandy has also been lucky enough to have a young buck (with velvet antlers) visit a few times at night and in the morning as well as ending up having to learn a lot about her air conditioner when it stopped working!

We define perseverance as:
Keep trying even when it’s hard; Hard work; Use encouraging words and a positive attitude; Be patient with yourself

Some ideas on what you can do at home with your child involving the character trait perseverance is:

• Teaching your child to ride a bike or to play a sport
• Watch clips from a past Olympics and research their journey to the Olympics
• Help and encourage your child to work on their homework
• Ask your child to explain what perseverance is and why perseverance is an important trait
• Tell your child a story from your life that involved perseverance
• Read a story that relates to perseverance and discuss how the character showed perseverance.

""One thing I love about working with FCMA students is their creativity. When we have a composition assignment, students get right to work on classroom instruments or Soundtrap (our online composition platform) and GO! Sometimes students work in groups, and sometimes they prefer to create individually. It brings me so much joy to get to sit back and witness art being created by our own students with just their imaginations and musical skills.

This month, upper elementary students (grades 4-6) began compositions based on human emotions - they started off so strong and enthusiastic! It is such a pleasure to work with students who work hard and aren't afraid to let their creativity flow!""",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157223031520748&id=133393995747,,0.0,"Ending our #Sharethelove month with a note from FCMA's music teacher, Ms. Shannan.

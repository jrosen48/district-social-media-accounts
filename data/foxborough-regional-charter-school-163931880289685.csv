This is why the Massachusetts State Police Recruitment Unit has implemented a voluntary homework assignment for any school in the commonwealth, grades 1-5. A student can send a picture of themselves demonstrating how they are following good sanitizing and distancing practices. (I.E., Standing apart, washing their hands, wearing a mask) This is a great way to learn and have fun at the same time. Students are encouraged to seek assistance from their parents or legal guardian. Stress bears will be given out while supplies last.

1Ô∏è‚É£ We‚Äôre providing free, live and on-demand AP courses

To support AP students affected by school closures due to COVID-19, students and schools will have access to live AP review lessons, delivered by AP teachers from across the country. Lessons will begin March 25.

2Ô∏è‚É£ We‚Äôre developing a new at-home testing option

Because of the challenges created by COVID-19, we‚Äôre developing a new at-home AP Exam option. Students will be able to test on a computer, tablet, or smartphone.

We will invest so that every AP student impacted by COVID-19 has the tools and connectivity they need to review AP content online and take the exam from home.

During this challenging time, we will work to give every AP student the opportunity to earn the college credit and placement they‚Äôve been working toward all year while maintaining a focus on the health and safety of our AP community.

The Team Rival challenge pits high schools in Norfolk County against each other in a friendly competition that involves events that encourage building a school culture of making healthy choices. The winning school gets a $1K Grant from the DA's office!

We need 100 students to play one hour of the smokeSCREEN vape-prevention video game. And 100 students to take the safe driver Distractology course.

Details on how to complete BOTH activities can be found HERE --- > https://www.foxboroughrcs.org/apps/news/article/1196259

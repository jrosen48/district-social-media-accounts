Late last night, district officials received word that a Safe2Say Something report was made pertaining to a bomb threat for today at Fox Chapel Area High School. The threat was very ambiguous and non-specific, and was related to rumors circulating about a bomb threat.

O‚ÄôHara Township Police were called and did a thorough search of the high school. This search included two bomb-sniffing dogs.

Following the search, district officials were told that the building was clear. However, out of an abundance of caution, we have decided to cancel school, just at the high school, for today. School will go on as scheduled at the other district buildings today.

When school resumes tomorrow at the high school, we will have a heightened security presence.

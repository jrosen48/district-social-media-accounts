Just a reminder that there are 3 ways to get meals and 3 ways to get student materials:

MEALS:
1. Daily bus runs
2. Grab and Go at Lotus daily 8:00-10:00AM
3. Early Bird Meal grab at Lotus daily 6:00-6:15AM and Stanton 6:30-6:45 AM

MATERIALS:
1. Friday bus runs
2. Pick up at Lotus Grab and Go Friday between 9:00-10:00AM or Monday-Thursday from 8:00-10:00AM
3. NEW!!! Weekend pick up from totes located outside the Lotus Main Entrance (under camera surveillance for safety) anytime from Friday at 3:00PM-Monday at 7:00AM! You must call the Lotus office (847-973-4100) to request that materials be put in the weekend pick up tote. You can make this a PERMANENT ARRANGEMENT or you can call by 2:00PM Friday so we make sure your materials for that week are put in the tote. Both school's materials will be picked up from Lotus.

*Note--We will NOT HAVE bus runs, Early Bird, or Grab and Go when school is closed for a day off or holiday.

We hope this all helps as we continue this Remote Learning journey together!

57.0% of Fox Lake Residents have completed the 2020 Census. Fox Lake remains one of the lowest responding communities in Lake County.

By not completing the Census you directly impact several programs used by Fox Lake residents. Just a few examples include:

‚Ä¢ Roadway and Infrastructure funding for local communities
‚Ä¢ National School Lunch Program, which helps feed many Fox Lake school children
‚Ä¢ Senior Programs and aid for local seniors
‚Ä¢ Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Community Development Block Grant Programs
‚Ä¢ Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
‚Ä¢ Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program

Now more than ever, funding is crucial. If Fox Lake under-reports, we potentially loose millions of dollars in federal funds. Please help us help you!

How will you address the district‚Äôs needs with a ZERO TAX RATE CHANGE?

Answer: Basically, the bond (or mortgage) we took out to build Lotus will be paid off. This means that--if we do nothing, or if the referendum fails--the tax rate drops 59 cents per $100 of home value for all taxpayers. It's kind of like a bank account when the mortgage is paid...you get that money back. In this case, it would be the taxpayers who get the money back.

By asking our taxpayers to keep the rate EXACTLY WHERE IT IS, the District keeps that 59 cents per $100 of home value for each home. We can repurpose the money since we no longer have to pay the bond on Lotus. In doing so, we free up the funds to pay for much needed building improvements at both sites, pay our teachers so they are no longer the lowest compensated in Lake County, and purchase current instructional materials to make sure our students have an equitable and current learning experience.

This year, Lotus School will host their third annual Scarves in the Park initiative. Lotus 1st graders teamed up with 4th graders to give back to the Fox Lake & Spring Grove communities.

Students collected cold weather essentials (hats, gloves, scarves) for people in need and worked together to write persuasive letters to local retailers asking for donations.

Students will take a field trip to hang the items, along with signs explaining the initiative to the public.

Do you need a scarf, hat, or gloves? Visit one of the following locations from December 13th - 17th, Millennium Park or Lakefront Park in Fox Lake.

Thanks Lotus!",0.0,"Awesome job, Lotus! ‚ù§Ô∏è

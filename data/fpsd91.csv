On Monday, April 20, 2020, Garfield Primary School hosted a car parade to celebrate the special bond between teachers and staff and their students. On a beautiful spring day and under a special police escort, Garfield principal Jamie Stauder, teachers and staff traveled in their cars through the streets of Forest Park north of 290. Honking their horns, cars were decorated with signs that showed how much the Garfield teachers and staff missed their classes. In return, families stood in front of their homes shouting and holding signs to show their love for all their teachers and staff. A big thank you to Mayor Rory Hoskins and the Forest Park Police Department for helping to make this event such as success!

On Friday, April 17, 2020, Betsy Ross Primary School hosted a car parade in front of the building at 1315 Marengo Avenue to celebrate the special bond between teachers and staff and their students.

Braving the elements (it snowed that morning!), Principal Bill Milnamow and BR teachers and staff stood out in front of the school (a safe distance apart!) holding signs that showed how much they missed their classes.

In return, parents and their children drove by honking horns, waving, shouting and holding up signs to show their love for their teachers and staff. It was a bittersweet moment for everyone that day as Governor Pritzker prepared to announce that all schools in Illinois would be closed for the remainder of the year.

Last November, a group of third-grade students from Field-Stevenson presented a request to the Board of Education to have plastic straws eliminated from District 91's food service.

As part of their presentation, the students specifically focused on pollution in the oceans and the plight of sea turtles who ingest the plastic straws and suffer greatly in the process.

Through their efforts, District 91 is currently working with the food service vendors to eliminate plastic straws for the FY 2021 school year.

In fact, the Shedd Aquarium got wind of the story and posted a shout out to the Field-Stevenson students for their efforts to reduce plastic use in their schools and prevent pollution. See the attached tweet from the Shedd.

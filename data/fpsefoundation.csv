We have never been more proud.
It's not because you earned a championship medal, or excelled in your classes, or made a knockout play performance. It's not because you led the team or dazzled in your prom outfits or marched in the band or walked across the graduation stage.

We're proud because you stayed in, despite feeling a sense of loss. You weathered the storm for your community, for humanity and for those you love. You pushed through and adapted to a new way of learning. You stayed connected, you demonstrated love to your family and friends. You learned lessons and taught lessons by doing the right thing.

You didn't know that when you walked out through the school doors in the middle of March that you were stepping into a world that was rapidly changing and unpredictable....and that you wouldn't be coming back. But you also have a bond with each other unlike any other. And you drew together by staying apart. Stay strong.

A committee comprised of community members that are on the Foundation Board will decide on the disbursement of funds. This committee will work closely with the administration and school board to prioritize and choose the most appropriate areas of need.

The goal is that donations will create an endowment fund similar to what one might see at a university. It will exist in perpetuity, with continual growth, and provide interest which will eventually be used to support the school each year.

The funds may potentially be used for classroom and technology improvements, specific projects or programs or other areas that support classroom instruction.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1588852814727472&id=1545186385760782,,0.0,"There have been some questions as to how donations will be used.

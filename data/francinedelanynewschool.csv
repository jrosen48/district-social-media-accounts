What an amazing time we had at Francine Delany New School For Children on Friday! We met with the upper grades to share more about our BeLoved Village and tell the stories of people we know and love who are living through the housing crisis! We believe that youth are not just the future but the NOW in making changes to help solve tough community problems.

We love sharing this program with schools and youth groups about what home means using art. And we have the youth brainstorm about how to use their super powers to help us build a home in the Beloved Village! These students were super engaged and are ready to be the change to create deeply affordable homes that are community-oriented, sustainable, and produce equity! Will you join them?

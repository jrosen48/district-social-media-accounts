We’ve heard that some residents mistakenly believe that after they’ve self-quarantined for the recommended two weeks that they are in the clear from COVID-19 and can now gather with others who have done the same. Here are a few reasons why this is not the case:
1) Any time you interact with others, there’s a possibility for the virus to spread.
2) If the person you meet didn’t fully stay at home for the full two-week period, they could be asymptomatic and carry the virus. Asymptomatic means they haven’t shown symptoms yet and/or may never show symptoms, but can still infect someone else.
3) The “Stay Home Missouri” Order prohibits individuals from conducting non-essential activities, from having more than 10 people in any single space at one time and from close contact with others (less than 6 foot distance between you and others).

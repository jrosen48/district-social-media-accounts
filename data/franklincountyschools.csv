You won't see this anywhere else...

We are currently putting the final touches on the annual ""Dam Numbers"" tradition which has been alive for over 30 years.

Usually, high school seniors volunteer to etch the numbers in by weedeater each year which loom over the town directly in sight from Franklin County High School. Covid 19 has hit Brookville pretty hard and we are unable to partner with the students so we are taking our own initiative to keep the tradition alive.

From all of us at The Corps of Engineers Brookville office we say KEEP TRUCKIN' class of 2020 and Happy Memorial day everyone!!

Attention FCHS seniors and parents:

This is the last call for cap and gown pictures for the senior class collage. I must have your photo no later than Tuesday, May 19th. NO exceptions. I understand that some may not have their cap and gown. If this is the case, then please submit just a senior photo of yourself. We would love for you to still be included in the photo, regardless of whether or not you have your cap and gown😊 I have only received about 60% of the class’s photos. Students have been reminded a couple of times over the past months via email and details have also been released on social media about this project. I am having the college arranged professionally, so I must have all of the photos collected no later than May 19th. If you have questions about the picture please feel free to message me.

You can either send me the photos via social media or you may send them to my school email! Your students will have access to this email address! Thank you so much!",5.0,"Sydney Graf‎Franklin County 2020 Seniors

Yesterday, kind of last minute I thought how nice it would be if I could get a teacher or two to write a little note for the kiddos at school. So yesterday evening I put a post on my personal Facebook page and thought I would hopefully fill the few spots I had empty by morning.

Pretty soon it was apparent the kid's page this week was going to be dedicated to the teachers. I took my last one two hours before deadline and it just so happens there was room for only one thing, the eLearning schedule! 😊

Teachers!!! As I’ve been looking more into the Teletherapy type platform I’ve found some awesome resources. I highly recommend checking out Boom!Learning (basically TpT but virtual) and then search “Distance Learning” on TpT and choose the “free” option. These resources are compatible with iPads and can be made interactive for your kids to work with (even PDF’s). I’m going to also link an awesome article I came across for virus proofing my room, which would work for any classroom (what to throw out, etc). I’m going to be using the Glad Press N Seal on my iPads in between each kid!!!

The Alabama State Department of Education has partnered with the University of Alabama to conduct a statewide school technology survey. The purpose of this survey is to build a statewide repository detailing Internet connectivity and Internet-enabled digital device availability to inform decision makers as we expand remote learning capabilities and enhance high-quality instruction to students around the state.

Whether a student is attending school in a traditional classroom setting, virtually, or a blended version of traditional and virtual, it is important that we hear from parents across the state as the survey responses will impact our efforts to respond to ongoing changes relating to remote and blended learning options throughout our state. Please take a few moments to share and complete this statewide school technology survey. The deadline for completing the survey is Friday, July 31, 2020.

Rilan is the first student of the PCHS Aviation classes to receive his license. Rilan will pursue his dream of becoming a pilot further at Auburn University.

Alabama is at risk of losing up to $13 billion of federal funds along with a congressional seat if Alabamians don't participate in the Census. Funds for roads and bridges, education, farms, healthcare, recruiting new businesses, and much more could be lost to OTHER STATES. It's only 10 questions and takes less than 10 minutes to complete.

How many times in your profession have you been truly proud of your job and the group for which you work? Honestly it happens in education a lot. There are lots of small victories you see come to fruition down the road. Many times the work that happens in education has a more long-term payoff. (Much like parenting). In all my 26 years as a teacher, coach and administrator, today was one of the best. I saw a real difference being made with immediate impact. Franklin County Schools handed out 3 days worth of food to over 2600 kids today. In Vina, I saw lunchroom workers, bus drivers, teachers, fellow administrators, maintenance workers and SROs go over and beyond to make sure our kids get their needs met. I’m thankful to Greg Hamilton (Superintendent) and Robynn Whitfield Bragwell (CNP Director) and Dr Johnny Cleveland (transportation director) for their leadership and planning to get this done. These are trying times, but we will grow and get better from it. FYI: We will continue this effort every Monday until school resumes. Stay safe and God Bless.",6.0,"Brent Gillespie

3/19 - ON HOLD: Teachers, given the situation with CV closings, I have received very few proposals after many expressions of interest. I am going to put this on hold till things settle down a little bit.

Teachers, I am looking for my Donors Choose project(s) to support this year in North Alabama. I prefer to invest in STEM related projects that give students the opportunity to see the positive impact of science, technology, engineering, and math on their lives. With my company’s match, the amount available this year will be $5,000.

Please send me links to your projects via direct message or in the comments below and I will choose the one(s) most closely aligned to the mission of opening the doors on STEM education to young Alabamans.

Feel free to share with teachers.

Please join me in voting NO to Amendment 1 on March 3rd!! You may be led to believe it promises to help improve education in Alabama, but you are being misled.

Amendment 1 on your March 3rd ballot would take away your right to vote for State School Board and make them all appointed by Gov. Ivey. These POLITICAL appointments would be manipulated by the same BUSINESS interests who started trying to dismantle public education in 2010.... the same interests who want to control the SCHOOL CALENDAR !!!

VOTE NO on Amendment 1 on March 3rd!

The Governor wants you to vote yes on Amendment 1 so SHE can appoint ALL members of the State School Board. Don't do it!!!

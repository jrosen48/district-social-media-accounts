What is an Equinox?

The Spring Equinox will be here tonight at 11:49 PM (US Eastern Time); the sun will be directly over the equator.

Equinoxes and solstices have inspired people's curiosity and helped them organize their lives since before history was recorded. Your students are likely no exception.

Here are some basic facts to share:

• Equinoxes occur twice each year, in March and September.

• On only those two days each year, all people on Earth experience an almost equal duration of daylight and nighttime. (Due to the size of the sun and refraction of light, day is actually eight minutes longer than night on the equinoxes.)

• Equinox is Latin for equal night.

• Equinoxes also mark the midpoint in the year between the Summer Solstice and Winter Solstice; the longest and shortest periods of daylight in a day.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1066024040449748&id=462667334118758,,0.0,"Home instruction vocab word of the day: Equinox

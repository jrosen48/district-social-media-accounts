Monday, April 20th is Patriots Day and will still be a day off. We will keep the same Tuesday-Thursday schedule, but move Monday to Friday. Therefore, English, SS, PE/Health, and shop will move their Monday Office Hours and assignments to Friday.

Every one of the Franklin Tech meal sites currently open are “open” sites meaning that any enrolled student or student from a neighboring town can take a meal to go.

Therefore, any school (or entire district) that is not serving meals currently to their students (whether by choice or not eligible for reimbursement) can direct their students to a site near them. Below is the link to view site locations. There currently are more than 1,100:

I hope you and your family are well and taking care in this ambiguous time. I wanted to make sure you have all materials you need to respond to any and all questions about Comcast’s Internet Essentials offers in response to the COVID 19 Outbreak. Comcast is providing fresh internet access for two months to low income families waiving its fee of $9.95 per month. (And i will advocate passionately for a longer period as this challenge continues).

Feel free to share with others!

Hi all,
Hope this finds you well.

I wanted to make everyone aware that in continuing to establish community during this challenging time, I'm hosting an online SingAlong every Friday at 8:45am. Fostering community and connections is part of my job as not only a high school, but elementary school music teacher as well.

It is a family friendly concert with words to sing along to, and features myself along with my musical partner and colleague at my Elementary School, Peter Nolan.

Here is a link to last Friday's show:

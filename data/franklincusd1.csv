Happy Friday to our Franklin community! As a yearbook and student news class, we wanted to come up with a way to keep everyone connected and involved while we are out of school!

Each week, we will be posting photo challenges for our students, parents, and faculty to participate in that could be featured in our high school yearbook! You can get those photos to us via this page or by sending them to escannell@franklinhigh.com. With your permission, we will post the photos sent in to our Facebook page to keep students involved!

We are facing a unique challenge in that almost half of our book consists of spring events and sports, so we are getting creative & making sure that our book is still memorable for all students!

We would love to hear from you during this time, so if you have some creative ideas for photos make sure to message or email so we can include your ideas in our next challenge!",0.0,"FHS Student Publications

Dear parents,

We will continue to provide supervision for all students until 5:30pm today. We are committed to our students and parents who depend on us for our late pick-up times. However, due to forecasts that snow is expected to continue throughout today and tomorrow, we will operate on a limited services program today after 2:30pm. After 2:30pm, normal academic operations will end for all grades including kindergarten. Students will then have the option of free play in the gym or STEMRec. They will be supervised by staff members.

We have staff members from all over the valley and would like to allow as many as possible to head home before the worst of traffic and before it gets dark. We have an amazingly dedicated group of staff who live closer to the school and have volunteered to provide the supervision from 2:30-5:30pm.

If you are able to pick-up your student by 2:30, we’d encourage you to do so. If not, you are free to come at your normal pick-up time.

One hour out of the average 2,080-hour working year determines your “grade”. That is how our students are evaluated on subject retention and they don’t even get to pick the hour.

If it were only that simple. It is not only about the time spent on standardized testing, but additional tests and assessments are administered throughout the year, in preparation. For example, interim or benchmark tests. Some claim students can average as high as 16 hours during the year, testing.

And when you are testing, you may not be capitalizing on learning opportunities. Many teachers feel that time testing comes at the expense of instructional time. Do you really think teachers need students to take a standardized test to fully grasp their progress and knowledge? Ask a teacher and see what they say.

Learning is a life-long adventure.

One hour out of the average 2,080-hour working year determines your “grade”. That is how our students are evaluated on subject retention and they don’t even get to pick the hour.

For example, interim or benchmark tests. Some claim students can average as high as 16 hours during the year, testing.

And when you are testing, you may not be capitalizing on learning opportunities. Many teachers feel that time testing comes at the expense of instructional time.

The students gave their all and we understand there were several talent scouts from that famous choir in Salt Lake that were in attendance. Like everything else, you have to catch the talent early.

Los Angeles Times: “SACRAMENTO — California will become the first state in the nation to mandate later start times at most public schools under legislation signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday, a proposal designed to improve educational outcomes by giving students more sleep.”

While schools have three years to implement the change, there is not much “choice” for students and parents.

What about choices at Franklin Discovery Academy? Oh yeah, major choices! Parents and students can choose a start time between 7:30 am – 10:30 am, starting on the half hour. Our school is open until 5:30 p.m. so if parents need students to stay a little longer than the normal six hours, we can accommodate them. Their students will be supervised and appropriately engaged. In most cases, students don’t even think of the time as “school time.”

The brain begins to mature even before birth. Although it continues to mature throughout most of life, the brain does not mature at the same rate in each individual.

This should not be surprising. After all, our bodies grow at different rates — we reach puberty at different ages and our emotional maturity at different times as well. Why should our brains be any different?

Just because you have a classroom full of students who are about the same age doesn't mean they are equally ready to learn a particular topic, concept, skill, or idea.

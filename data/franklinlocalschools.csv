Ashley McLean was honored as the region's most outstanding female student. The program has been going for 20 years and this was the first time that both outstanding students came from the same school!

Mr. Mull, Mrs. Swingle, Mrs. Graff, Mrs. Harris, Mr. Boysel and Mrs. Pollock have worked very hard to help our students have an outstanding Homecoming experience. Thank you.

Many teachers have provided helpful information to help improve students' 504 plans.

Teachers are working hard on their SLO development.

A big thanks goes out to our coaches of fall sports. We appreciate your willingness to help guide our students through sports.",2013-09-27 13:14:06,,

This unique situation does not necessarily provide households with information on the duration of the furlough or the ultimate impact on the household income.

Federally furloughed households approved for meal benefits will need to terminate or update their free/reduced-price status once the economic hardship is remedied due to returning to work and/or restoration of pay for the furlough period.

HOUSEHOLDS AFFECTED BY THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN:

Households of furloughed employees affected by the government shutdown may be temporary eligible for free or reduced-price meal benefits. While free and reduced-price meal eligibility is intended to reflect actual annual income, applications may reflect the current households situation. This unique situation does not necessarily provide households with information on the duration of the furlough or the ultimate impact on the household income.

Federally furloughed households approved for meal benefits will need to terminate or update their free/reduced-price status once the economic hardship is remedied due to returning to work and/or restoration of pay for the furlough period.

If you have any questions regarding this unique situation, please contact the Nutrition Services office at 253-298-4618.",2019-01-18 12:50:14,,

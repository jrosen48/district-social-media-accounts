During this Staff Appreciation Week (and with Tuesday being ""National Teacher Day""), this is a very timely share.

From Student Council: Thank you, FPMS Staff! These days, teaching looks a little bit different and can have its challenges. The students from Forest Park Middle School recognize this, and wanted to say thank you to all the staff members going above and beyond. With the help of their classmates, Student Council Representatives organized and produced this Staff Appreciation Video to express their gratitude to everyone working at FPMS! We thank you, we miss you, and we can't wait to see you all soon!

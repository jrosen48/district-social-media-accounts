Dear Franklin Families,

We are writing to share important information with you related to the development of the School Department's FY 21 budget. Attached, you will find a memo to the School Committee outlining anticipated budget shortfalls under two possible scenarios: the Governor's Budget from January and a possible reduction to state aid.

The link to the virtual meeting has been posted as part of the School Committee's agenda as a place for those who wish to participate. The meeting does have a space limit. An alternative way to view the School Committee meeting this evening to learn more about the status of the FY 21 budget is to watch the program live on Comcast Channel 11, Verizon Channel 29, or through Franklin TV livestream: https://www.franklinma.gov/home/pages/live-meetings-stream

Dear Franklin Families,

Earlier this evening, the Franklin School Committee voted to eliminate four school days of April vacation and hold four days of remote learning. This will provide for continuity at this time. An overwhelming majority of faculty (93%) and families (89.3%) preferred to eliminate vacation, most favoring eliminating four days over three.

Please note that Monday, April 20 is Patriots’ Day, a state holiday and will not be used for remote learning.

This will adjust the end of the school year. According to the most recent guidance from DESE, this would have Franklin Public Schools ending its school year on Thursday, June 18, or our 181st day of school. (We have one snow day to make up from December 2019).

If you have any questions, please contact the Superintendent’s Office at 508-553-4819 and leave a message. Your message will be received via email and returned shortly.

Sincerely,

Dear Franklin Families and Faculty/Staff,

As you may know, Governor Baker announced earlier today that he signed an executive order that all Massachusetts schools will remain closed through April, opening no earlier than Monday, May 4, 2020.

Both the Governor and Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) Commissioner explained how the Department has been working to develop new guidance about Remote Learning in light of this extension. Superintendents are expecting to receive this guidance tomorrow and, after reviewing it, we will follow these guidelines and work cooperatively with the Franklin Education Association to build upon our initial engagement and enrichment since last week.

Per Commissioner Riley’s announcement this afternoon, our plan will begin in early April.

We will continue to keep the community informed as we continue to navigate these unprecedented circumstances. We sincerely hope that you are feeling well and that your families are staying safe.

Kind regards,

Sara Ahern

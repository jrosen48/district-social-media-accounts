‚ÄúAnd the people stayed home. And read books, and listened, and rested, and exercised, and made art, and played games, and learned new ways of being, and were still. And listened more deeply. Some meditated, some prayed, some danced. Some met their shadows. And the people began to think differently.

‚ÄúAnd the people healed. And, in the absence of people living in ignorant, dangerous, mindless, and heartless ways, the earth began to heal.

And when the danger passed, and the people joined together again, they grieved their losses, and made new choices, and dreamed new images, and created new ways to live and heal the earth fully, as they had been healed.‚Äù

Feeling grateful this week!

Franklin junior and founding student Emma Mohammed is grateful for:

- Learning Expeditions, for connecting her with the community and the world, and making her learning meaningful,

-Crew, for creating a community of students and teachers she can trust, and

-Collaborative projects, which have helped her develop the skills she'll need to be successful in school and career.

We're grateful to our families and community members who contribute to our Annual Fund! The Annual Fund supports all the extras that make this kind of learning possible in our school - like buses and vans to transport students out into the community, and professional development that helps our teachers design great projects and become strong Crew leaders.

Hear from Emma yourself, and please give to our Annual Fund today!

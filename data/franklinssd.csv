You’ve likely been hearing a lot about vaping in recent news. While the FDA and CDC are still investigating these lung injuries, the common link is that patients reported the use of e-cigarettes, or vaping products. This hit too close to home for two Williamson Medical Group pulmonologists.

After Drs. Devin Sherman and Tufik Assad personally treated patients at Williamson Medical with vaping illnesses, they knew they needed to get in front of the teens in our community. Both physicians have recently spoken about the dangers of vaping and tobacco products to Franklin Special School District and Williamson County Schools students, parents and staff.

As I signed their specially made postcards, it was not lost on me that it’s a big deal for kids to interact with any author, let alone a black woman.

We just had the best experience at the FSSD Story Bus! In case you haven’t heard of this amazing (and free) service in Franklin, allow me to enlighten you. 😄 Every summer, the Franklin Special School District rolls out its Story Bus and parks at local grocery stores. This bus is like a rolling library, filled with shelves of children’s books and bean bag chairs. FSSD teachers and volunteers will read to your kids for 45 minutes while you shop. When you pick your kids up, they each get a free book and sack lunch to take home! Such a fun way to promote early literacy and reach out to the community! Check out the bus’s schedule at https://fssd.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019StorybusFlyer-Eng.pdf. #franklintn #historicfranklin #franklinspecialschooldistrict #fssd #storybus #earlyliteracy #childhoodliteracy #bookstagram #booksbooksbooks #katieshandsauthor #fssdstorybus @franklin_elementary_school",7.0,"We love taking “our show” on the road!

Instructor: Mark Bridge

Not all bread is created equal. Sour dough bread has the most health benefits, and many individuals with wheat allergies or “yeast” allergies have no problem eating real sour dough. During this class you will learn about sour dough--it’s history, creating and maintaining a sour dough culture, baking techniques, and using sour dough other than for breads such as pancakes and other goodies. You will also have the opportunity to sample different sour dough breads and biscuits at class. Your fee includes your own culture to take home and a collection of Mark’s favorite recipes.

United Way’s Day of Caring is one day each year where volunteers set aside a few hours to give back to the community through a morning of helping. Teams of volunteers from the Frazee High School gather to complete much needed tasks such as raking, window washing, litter pick-up, spring cleaning, landscaping, gardening, and general repairs. It’s a single day of service with a big community impact. Last year we had 400 plus students and 40 staff who took to the streets, lawns, schools, parks, and senior centers to give back to over 60 families in our area. Participants must reside in the Frazee-Vergas district. If you are interested in being a part of this year’s Day of Caring, please call and pre-register.

Instructor: Mitch Groethe
Even if you have never played a musical instrument before, this brief course introducing the ukulele is the place to start! In this class, we will start with a review of the equipment, learn how to tune the strings, and then learn to play the most common chords. By the end of the class, you’ll even know a few songs. Please bring your instrument and a notebook to class. Mitch has been playing for over 50 years and this is the perfect person to help on your musical journey! All ages welcome.

Great News! All students in the Frazier School District will be provided a free breakfast and a free lunch every day when school begins! This will continue through December 30th! Also, as a follow up, students who would like to pack their lunch are still permitted, lunch boxes are not required to be clear.

Thank you,

Clear Back Packs/ Masks

Dear Parents/Students/Guardians:

With the anticipation of sending the students back to school, as you begin your school shopping please know that Elementary and Middle School students will be required to have clear back packs. This is essential now more than ever so that they may easily be disinfected and wiped down on a daily basis. I strongly urge you to purchase your child a backpack this year more so than ever before.

Your child is required to wear a mask on a daily as mandated by the state of PA. If you are unable to provide a mask, the school will have a free mask available for your child. Also, please know that I will be providing updates daily so please check back often.

Thank you for you support!

Back to School Task Force - Hello Frazier Family, I hope this post finds you healthy and well. As an informational update I want you to know that the Frazier SD is meeting regularly to formulate a plan with how to best open our schools for the 2020/2021 school year. The schools are currently planning to open on August 24, 2020.

District Administrators are meeting with teachers, parents, school board members, nurses and several Frazier students to formulate a plan on what must take place during our opening. We are considering both the guidance of the PA Department of Education and Gov. Wolf's PA State recommendations as we formulate our plan.

Dr. Henderson, FSD Superintendent, continues to meet and collaborate with surrounding school districts as well as state officials in order to help develop a back to school plan that will be safe for everybody. I will do my best to keep you up to date as the plan comes together.

Have a safe and happy holiday,

I wanted to take a minute and thank each of you for working through our online schooling over the past few months! I know it has been difficult at times but you made it! I wish each of you a safe and happy summer and look forward to seeing you next year! For my eighth grade students I wish you the very best at the High School, I know you will do well. I will be at the Middle School over the summer if you should have any questions or concerns. Grades for the fourth nine weeks have been posted and are availble online.

For any families with students who receive a free or reduced lunch:

Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer (P-EBT) Supplemental Payments

Under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (P.L. 116-127) the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) approved the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services (DHS) to provide households with children eligible for free and reduced-priced meals under the National School Lunch Program (NLSP) or the School Breakfast Program (SBP) with P-EBT benefits due to the COVID-19 outbreak and related school closures. DHS will work with the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) to identify eligible children and issue P-EBT.

Benefits will be provided to all eligible children whether or not they currently receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. This is meant to ensure that all children who would normally receive meals at school do not go hungry while schools are closed.

Dear Seniors and Senior Parents,

District officials recently met with our class sponsors and with your class officers to discuss commencement and how it will look with the current CDC and State guidelines in place. We are working on plans to hold a live commencement in some form or fashion. It may not be our traditional ceremony, but the feedback we received is that the students would prefer some sort of in person event instead of a virtual one. We will continue to keep you updated as the plans unfold.

Good Evening Middle students, parents and friends. As I am sure you have already heard earlier today Governor Wolf ordered all schools across the Pennsylvania Commonwealth closed for an additional two weeks. This meaning the earliest we could reopen school would now be Monday, April 6th.

Frazier administration and staff are currently working on a plan on how to best educate our students in these unprecedented times. Within the next few days, I hope to have Chromebook chargers available for all sixth and seventh grade students as it certainly looks like we will be using our Google Chromebooks for instruction in the very near future. I do understand that some of our students may not have internet connections and we are working out an alternative plan to assist them.

On Wednesday, I will be in my office from 9:00 am to 11:00 am if I can l be of assistance to any of you. Please call the school's number at (724) 736-9507 and select the MS option. I will do my best to answer any questions that you have or you may message me here on Facebook.

Please keep well

Hello, everyone!
Our Makerspace is in desperate need of all kinds of tape and rolls of papertowels. We have absolutely NONE left. It can be Scotch tape, masking tape, Duct tape, etc and any brand of paper towels. Our fifth graders are currently making projects in the Makerspace and are in great need of tape. If you are able to donate tape, paper towels, and/or any other supplies, it would be greatly appreciated! You can send donations in with your child and write “Makerspace Donations” on them.

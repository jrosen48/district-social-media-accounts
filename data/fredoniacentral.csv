Middle and High school families ONLY - Please take a moment to complete the survey below to let us know if your child does NOT need a district-issued device. Our district has ordered enough devices for all of our students, but they will not arrive until mid-school year. In an effort to get devices to students who need them, we are asking families whose children have their own devices to let us know so that we may distribute to those in need.

Thank you for your efforts to help all of our students succeed!

In compliance with the Governor's order to continue school closures through April 14th, we will continue to provide educational materials to our students remotely. While the extended school closure does coincide with the planned Spring Recess, the Governor has ordered that all schools, regardless of their calendar, must continue to support students and families. As such, we will continue to provide food service and remote educational opportunities through the closure dates. Building principals and/or teachers will continue to communicate with students and provide materials.

Our food service department and our many volunteers will continue to provide for families in need. We are, however, reducing the number of days for pickup/delivery to three starting next week. Rest assured, that five days of breakfast and lunch will be provided. Specifics on the changes were included with April 1st meals.

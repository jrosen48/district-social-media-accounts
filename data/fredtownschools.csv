Debbie Wojtczuk has spoke to someone in Marble Hill that will do a Senior banner 12” X 18” for $16.18 each. This includes the pole to put them on. We would like to make sure every senior has one, and we’re trying to get it approved to put them at the school. You can choose the picture.
The email to send picture is serenityhouseflowers@yahoo.com. Add to your email that it is for Fredericktown. She will let you see it and approve it before she makes it.
She will then send a Paypal link to you for payment.

A dear friend called this afternoon to check in on me and to let me know she had stopped off at one of the Community Sharing Boxes and filled the cabinet with some food. She then went to Wal-Mart to get a few necessities and also purchased some more items for the next time she could donate again to the Community Sharing Box. Those additional items didn't quite make it back home with her because when she was driving home from Wal-Mart she noticed that the box she had just filled 30 minutes prior was already empty. Just wanted to remind everyone of the 2 Community Sharing Boxes in town (located at the Methodist Church on S. Main and at the Catholic church on W.

Tonight was West County high schools last basketball game of the season, and hands down the best. Not because we won, because we actually lost. Its because of a young man named Tyler, #10 who has disabilities and actually plays on a special olympics type team locally, and is also the manager for WC. Layne often takes Tyler home after practices, and picks him up so that he can attend practices on days they don’t have school, but still have basketball.
Tyler comes over to our house to hang out with Caleb, they talk wrestling and superheroes, and who knows what else! Tyler is an awesome kid that hasn’t been dealt the best hand in life, but you would never be able to tell by talking to him.

I have never became teary eyed at any game, until tonight. This video shows the love that our coaches have for our boys. And the sportsman ship shown by Fredericktown, when one of their teammates handed the ball over to Tyler was simply amazing. What a great end to a season, and the smile on Tyler’s face after the game tells me that he will never forget this night!",5.0,"This is great stuff. Thank you Mrs. Harris for posting this moment.

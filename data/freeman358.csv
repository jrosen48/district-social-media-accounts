The @freeman.scotties Teachers are taking a twist on teacher appreciation week and serving their classified staff lunch.

We are so grateful for all of their hard work and support of all that they do inside and out of the classroom.

We are blessed that they can support our local small businesses too and grateful for the opportunity to contribute these 70 meals to these incredible youth leaders.

This week we're sharing a few of their stories and showing our gratitude to all our members.

Ken Spiering, artist and educator:

Ken's work transformed Spokane: from the majestic Redband trout sculptures at the Convention Center and leaping cougars at the STA Plaza to his iconic ""Childhood Express"" - a.k.a the Big Red Wagon at Riverfront Park - chances are that you're already familiar with his artistic side.

Ken taught art for 30 years at area colleges, and is finishing out his teaching career as a part-time art teacher at Freeman School District 358.

Recently, the Fremont County School District was fortunate to receive a grant to study how we can improve the educational offerings for our children between the ages of 0 and 5. We have referred to this as the “crib to kindergarten,” or the Preschool Grant. In the upcoming weeks, we will be trying to determine the needs of our community regarding pre-school education and care. You will have the opportunity to answer some questions regarding what your needs are regarding educating this age group of children, and how our school district and community can help with these needs. We are especially interested in knowing how to better support those who currently offer preschools or daycare to our children. We would appreciate your input.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3364818040262680&id=314791698598678,,0.0,"Dear Patron,

￼ We have received official word from the IHSAA that all spring sports have been cancelled. We want to acknowledge all of the athletes and coaches. We especially want to recognize the senior class of 2020! It is hard not to have the opportunity to compete after preparing so long for this moment. As all of our coaches teach, when we have trials and adversity we will find a way to get through and move past this. We are so proud of the athletes, coaches, and families in our school and community. This is an amazing place to live and we always come together and help each other. If there are any questions or if you need any help let us know. When the time is right we will be in contact with the athletes and the coaches to address fee payments and to turn in uniforms and equipment. It’s a great day to be a Cougar!!",0.0,"South Fremont High School

In the upcoming days we will start a new chapter in public education. There is a huge learning curve that students and teachers will be navigating together!!

As we embark on this thing called ""remote learning,” I am asking my Facebook friends to refrain from publicly scrutinizing their children’s teachers/schools/district for the way they are teaching or the lessons they are assigning.

We are about to navigate uncharted waters with little, to no prep time. This is a crisis, not a time to be playing armchair quarterback. We love your kids, and we will be doing our absolute best!

A Huge Thank You to everyone that participated in the Veterans Day Assembly today at the High School. It was phenomenal. The speakers did a great job. The band and choir were extremely entertaining. But what was even more impressive was how reverent and respectful the students were. The gym was packed with High School, Jr High, and Elementary age kids and it was absolutely silent except for the presenters and performers the entire hour. Thank you to all those that attended.

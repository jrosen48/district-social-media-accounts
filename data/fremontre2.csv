***NO ADJUSTMENT TO THE FALL SCHEDULE***
In spite of any rumors or incorrectly passed information from outside sources, the CHSAA BOD voted unanimously NOT to change the sports schedule. This means that all sports, football included, remain where they are for this school year. That statement from CHSAA is below.

At a meeting on Tuesday night, the Board of Directors of the Colorado High School Activities Association, addressed a potential change to the 2020-21 sports and activities calendar.

The COVID-19 pandemic has presented many challenges. Specific to CHSAA activities, this has included trying to resume a traditional fall season for moderate- to high-risk contact sports. It has forced inequities when making statewide decisions for the 180,000 student-participants, 363 voluntary members schools, and 178 school districts across the state.

No snow day for the FFA, we had a great tour this morning at Shatto Milk Company!

Shatto Milk Company is a small family-owned and operated dairy farm located just north of the Kansas City metropolitan area. The family has been farming here for more than 100 years and began a dairy farm more than 80 years ago. They currently have 254 cows that they milk three times a day. Shatto produced lots of specialty products include flavored milk, which ranges from banana to cotton candy and is sold in glass bottle only. They also have ice cream, cheese and butter. Our students had the opportunity to tour the facility, taste product and even milk a cow!

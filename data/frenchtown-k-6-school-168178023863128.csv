As part of that assembly some Frenchtown students, parents, and staff members donated their hair to companies that make wigs for children who have had medically related hair loss. This was their opportunity to start a chain reaction of kindness. In the assembly students and staff were challenged to make a choice to spark a chain reaction on their own: picking up garbage, asking a friend to play, compliments, sharing, letting others play, meeting someone new, helping where you see a need, etc. There are 1000s of ways to be kind!

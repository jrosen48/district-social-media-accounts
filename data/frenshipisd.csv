Last Friday, a few of the AMAZING Upland Heights virtual learning teachers hosted ‚ÄúPoppin‚Äô in for Popsicles,‚Äù a drive-up event for their virtual learning students to drive-up, see their teacher and get a popsicle!

Tara Espindola, 2nd grade virtual learning teacher at Upland Heights, said that the idea for the event started with a quote about Mr. Rogers.

‚ÄúIt started with a quote that was circulating around Facebook,‚Äù Espindola said. ‚ÄúIt said ‚ÄòMr. Rogers was one of the best teachers and he did it virtually.‚Äô So, we thought - if he can do it, we can do it!‚Äù

The group of teachers said that the event was a collective effort and it was the perfect ending to a fun week of dress up days for their virtual learners. They said it was a way for them to be able to celebrate the hard work the students have been doing, and a way to connect with them, engage with them, and let them know that they are still a TIGER!

Great job, ladies! #frenshipway

Willow Bend Elementary PE coaches Elisa Gonzales and Meagan Vining are finding creative ways amid the pandemic to keep PE fun and engaging, while following state mandates and guidance.

Elisa Gonzales has been coaching PE at Willow Bend for nine years. She said before COVID-19 she would elect captains for each class, and they would be interactive with stop watches, whistles, and other equipment.
She said she felt that this gave the students ownership of the PE class.

However, this year she had to reinvent how to conduct PE to keep kids safe and healthy.

‚ÄúMy goals are to keep class fun,‚Äù Gonzales said, ‚Äúbut to also keep the kids safe.‚Äù

Frenship High School revealed their INCubatoredu classroom this week to help kick off the new program for the 2020-2021 school year.

Amy Baker, coordinator of the Career and Technical Education (CTE) program said the room's concept was meant to feel different from all other classrooms.

‚ÄúIn this kind of environment,‚Äù Baker said, ‚Äústudents are encouraged to think beyond a classroom desk or chair, and truly become an innovator or creator.‚Äù

INCubatoredu is a year-long course that will take Frenship students through an elite national business startup model that was developed at Stanford University. Students will create, innovate, and apply their business skills to see an idea through from ideation to creation.

‚ÄúThese are not just students; these are our children,‚Äù said Flores. ‚ÄúWe have to take care of them.‚Äù

Beyond hiring additional custodial staff, FISD added a Quality Assurance Custodian (QAC) to each campus. The QAC will ensure the building is sanitized and disinfected to the standards set forth by the district.

We know you have tough decisions to make about the upcoming school year. Every family situation is different. We will do our best to support our families and their needs.

We have been working to develop options for our students while also implementing new and changing mandates, requirements, and guidance from the State. But through it all - Frenship remains committed to providing a premier learning environment for all students where our teachers take pride in meeting the needs of every student to empower them to reach their potential.

We know it's a lot of information, but please take the time to read through our Reopening Parent Guide and website FAQs. We fully understand that you will still have questions as we continue working through this process. Give us a call/email and we will work to answer your concerns.

Some of you may be eligible for the Pandemic-EBT food benefits.

WHO SHOULD APPLY:
Families who received SNAP benefits for the month of March 2020 and have children 5-18 years old as of May 17, 2020, do not need to apply for those children. These families should have received P-EBT benefits on their current Lone Star Card by May 22.

Families with children up to 21 years old who are certified to receive free or reduced-price meals during the 2019-20 school year need to apply for P-EBT. (This includes families who received SNAP benefits for the month of March 2020 and have children under 5 and between 19 and 21.) Once HHSC receives the application and verifies your eligibility with the school list, you will receive a Texas P-EBT card in the mail that includes P-EBT funds.

Back in February we shared a sweet story about the Superintendent's Student Advisory Board. Each year, Superintendent Dr. McCord and the high school students join together to make blankets as a community service project. This year the blankets were donated to the UMC Cancer Center.

This week, UMC Health System sent us this special card with an update on one of the blankets used by a patient. In part, the card read, ""She was nervous about her treatment. When presented with the blanket by one of our nurses, she was touched. I saw her shoulders relax as she rubbed her hands over it.""

UMC also created a card that says ""Made with Love"" to pin to each blanket.

Back in February we shared a sweet story about the Superintendent's Student Advisory Board. Each year, Superintendent Dr. McCord and the high school students join together to make blankets as a community service project. This year the blankets were donated to the UMC Cancer Center.

This week, UMC Health System sent us this special card with an update on one of the blankets used by a patient. In part, the card read, ""She was nervous about her treatment. When presented with the blanket by one of our nurses, she was touched. I saw her shoulders relax as she rubbed her hands over it.""

This is what it means to live the #FrenshipWay

Frenship High School Engineering teacher and robotics coach James Holloway decided to give his students a project during remote learning - create, design, or build something that could help our community during the COVID-19 crisis. Awesome, right?! The kids can take what they're learning at school and use it to help in a real world situation!

FHS student Mark Dannemiller took the project to heart! Using a ventilator prototype, he enhanced the design to also make it a respirator for patients fighting COVID-19. He is currently in talks with local medical facilities to provide them with the final product design. AND this is something he's sharing with other high school/robotics teams around the country to see if they want to get involved!

""He‚Äôs really what Frenship is about and he‚Äôs really what our future is about.‚Äù - Mr. Holloway.

TxDOT anticipates the traffic switch to last about four days ‚Äì two days for each direction of traffic. After the switch is done, the westbound 82nd Street exit ramp will remain open.

NASA at Westwind

Geraldo Cisneros, father of two students at Westwind, is an intern at NASA this semester working in computer programing. Mr. Cisneros came to Westwind today to teach our students about NASA and some upcoming missions to the moon and later to MARS through photos, videos and even video conferencing with other NASA interns who were at the Johnson Space Center at the time. Those interns talked with us about what each of them were working on for NASA. The students were fascinated with learning about NASA and the future missions - some even hoping they can be an integral part some day. One thing that touched the students the most was that the group of astronauts who would be going to Mars are in elementary school right now. It could be one of the students in the room. The students could also be the engineers, programmers, AR/VR specialists, and other jobs that don't exist yet to help the mission to Mars or other missions.",0.0,"How cool is this?!

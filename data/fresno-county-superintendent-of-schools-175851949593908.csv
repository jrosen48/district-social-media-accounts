RED MEANS STOP!
Local area law enforcement agencies and school districts are joining together to remind drivers they are required to stop when a school bus has its red lights flashing or stop sign extended. This indicates students are getting on or off a bus.

Red means stop. It's the law, and the right thing to do.

Schools will be back in session soon and more buses will be on the roads. (Clovis Unified starts Aug. 19.) Keep our children, bus drivers and motorists safe.

Both directions of traffic are required to stop when a bus has its red lights flashing. Failure to do so can result in fines of up to $1,000 and could mean loss of driving privileges for one year.

Don't pay the price in a fine or a life. Red means stop.

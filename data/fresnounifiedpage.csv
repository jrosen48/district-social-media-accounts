Tomorrow, we continue our effort to help feed the families of Fresno Unified School District by holding our 4th meal distribution. This time in the Roosevelt High School region. We are also supporting local businesses in the process. Tomorrow's meals will be prepared by Sam's Italian Deli & Market.

Tomorrow's meal distribution will take place at Sequoia Middle School on Hamilton Ave. Please be mindful that we have a limited number of meals and want to be able to give them to those most in need, therefore only those present will receive a meal.

Due to social distancing guidelines we prefer that participants drive up. We will hand over the meals. IF there are walk-up participants, they must maintain social distancing guidelines.

We plan to feed about 500 people per week in the various FUSD regions over the next several weeks.

As you may know, we've pledged at least $10,000 and have received many generous donations to help in this effort.

Congrats to Elementary & Secondary Education Champions (and sisters) Harmony Mendez and Melody Drumm!

Harmony is a music teacher at Fresno Unified School District Ayer Elementary School & Leavenworth Elementary School and Melody is a music teacher at Kratt Elementary, Starr Elementary School, and Tenaya Middle.

Harmony and Melody have gone above and beyond to ensure that their students' music education continue at home. They helped distribute technology, so their students had access to Smartmusic. Smartmusic is a system that allows students to practice various types of songs. They communicate with parents, they write thank you cards to students for completing their weekly performances. Plus, they are collaborating to create a virtual orchestra made up of students from Kratt, Starr, and Leavenworth. Students will record Scotland, Canon in D, and Beethoven's Ninth. They will put the recordings together and share the finished product with sites and parents as a ""Spring Concert"".

Tomorrow, we continue our effort to help feed the families of Fresno Unified School District by holding our 3rd meal distribution. This time in the McLane High School region. We are also supporting local businesses in the process. Tomorrow's meals will be prepared by Sam's Italian Deli & Market.

Tomorrow's meal distribution will take place at Yosemite Middle School- Fresno CA. Please be mindful that we have a limited number of meals and want to be able to give them to those most in need, therefore only those present will receive a meal.

Due to social distancing guidelines we prefer that participants drive up. We will hand over the meals. IF there are walk-up participants, they must maintain social distancing guidelines.

We plan to feed about 500 people per week in the various FUSD regions over the next several weeks.

As you may know, we've pledged at least $10,000 and have received many generous donations to help in this effort.

Congrats to Fresno Unified School District Bullard Talent K 8 Elementary School teacher Jessica Diaz on being selected as the MS & HS Educator Champion.

Let us know the great things you or someone else is doing...
Link: fresnoteachers.org/nominate-a-champion/

Jessica was nominated by multiple colleagues for her great work during our school closures.

Jessica gathered her materials and made lessons for her students, invited them to come to her home and pick them up from a ""Grab and Go"" table. She also decorated her house with inspirational quotes and signs to greet her students as she watched from a distance.

If you or someone you know are/is doing some fun and creative things to reach and teach your students, we’d like to know. We plan on recognizing two distance learning educator champions per week (one from elementary and one from secondary). Winners get an electronically delivered gift card, an educator champion profile, and we’ll share their creative ideas out to the world.

Submit your nomination today and continue your great work.

Later today we continue our effort to help feed the families of Fresno Unified School District by holding our 2nd meal distribution. We are also supporting local businesses in the process. Today's meals will be prepared by Quesadilla Gorilla.

Today's meal distribution is for the students and families in the
Fresno High School area. Please be mindful that we have a limited number of meals and want to be able to give them to those most in need, therefore only those present will receive a meal.

Due to social distancing guidelines we prefer that participants drive up. We will hand over the meals. IF there are walk-up participants, they must maintain social distancing guidelines.

We plan to feed about 500 people per week in the various FUSD regions over the next several weeks.

As you may know, we've pledged at least $10,000 and have received many generous donations to help in this effort.

Later today we are launching our first meal distribution for the students and families of Fresno Unified School District. We are also supporting local businesses in the process. Today's meals will be prepared by Quesadilla Gorilla.

Today's meal distribution is for the students and families in/near the Addams Elementary area. Please be mindful that we have a limited number of meals and want to be able to give them to those most in need.

Due to social distancing guidelines we prefer that participants drive up. We will hand over the meals. IF there are walk-up participants, they must maintain social distancing guidelines.

Special thanks to Live Again Fresno who will help us distribute the meals to families in the Parkway Drive area.

We plan to feed about 500 people per week in the various FUSD regions over the next several weeks.

As you may know, we've pledged at least $10,000 and have received many generous donations to help in this effort.

Parent(s)/Guardian(s): Jon and Amy Annis

Future Plans: I am planning on going to JCC to major in Biology.

Favorite Memory at FCS: With the number of memories I've been able to make at FCS, it makes it hard to choose just one. However, winning the Section VI Class C Girls Varsity Soccer title and then going on to play in the Far West Regional Game with my teammates is one that I'll always carry with me.

Shout-outs: I would like to thank my parents and siblings for the years of constant love and support they've always given me. I would also like to thank my friends for bringing out the best version of me and giving me memories that will last a lifetime. Lastly, I would like to thank my coaches, teammates, and the staff and faculty at FCS for making every year the best that it could have been and always pushing me to my full potential. To the grades below and the younger kids: enjoy every moment while you can and always work hard; it all goes by way too fast.

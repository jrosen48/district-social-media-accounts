First up are 13 members of the Friend High School Class of 2020, who donated $1,000 to the Saline County Food Pantry.
The students raised the money over the course of their high school careers. While we're saddened they and all the seniors in our service area weren't able to finish their final year in the way they imagined, we're honored and humbled that these students chose to donate to our organization.

We found out today that the team of Sarah and Jacob and the individual report submitted by William are all in the top three of their respective divisions. The reports will go through one more round of judging and scores will be averaged to determine who the winner will be if each division. This is a huge honor for these members and had we had a state convention all of them would have made it onto stage.

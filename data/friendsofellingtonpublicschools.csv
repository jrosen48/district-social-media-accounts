Hi there - hoping everyone is surviving and staying safe and SANE!!
Sharing an update:

The PTO has put together a yearbook to commemorate the 2019-2020 school year. To express our appreciation for all the extra effort given by CLS students, parents, and teachers these past few months, the PTO is giving one yearbook to each family this year. We hope it will remind all of our students of fun moments shared in their classrooms! Your family will receive the yearbook when you come to pick up/drop off items either on June 8th or 9th. These will be free of charge this year - you do not need to purchase them.",0.0,"Crystal Lake School PTO

Good Morning Center Families!! The PTO is hosting Rocky’s Parade!! Rocky and Center School Teachers will be driving through Center neighborhoods on Wednesday, April 22nd! We encourage you all to make signs and posters to show your teachers some love and show your Center School pride!

Our parade route will be posted by Tuesday. We will make every effort to include as many streets/neighborhoods as we can. We ask that if your street/house is not on the parade route to go to the nearest area/street that is. In many cases this would only require you to walk to the end of your street or neighborhood. All social distancing measures need to be adhered to. This means you will need to stay in your driveway, front lawn, or on the sidewalk. Please do not approach any of the vehicles. If you are on the sidewalk or end of a street make sure to maintain at least a 6ft distance between anyone not in your household.

💜 Please share and spread the word! We are so excited to see you all!! 💜",0.0,"Center School PTO

2018-2019 Budget

Ellington is a growing, dynamic town with increasing enrollment when many schools across the state are experiencing a decline in enrollment.

We have proposed a fiscally responsible budget that attempts to add a few key positions to support our growth which include: an EHS technology and computer science teacher, an elementary education teacher, and an assistant principal to be shared across the middle and high schools.

To compensate for the volatility in our special education budget, we intend to create a separate non-lapsing fund with the town to carry over money from year-to-year to help address fluctuation in special education outplacement expenses. This year, we anticipate being able to fund the account with fines associated with non-compliance of outside contractors.

Ellington High School (EHS) students were in their clinical uniform and were asked questions about their interest in the class, etc. EHS is working in cooperation with the Ellington Ambulance Association to have seven of our EHS students participate in a year-long course that will prepare them for EMT certification.

The story on Fox 61 will highlight that EHS is the first high school in the state to offer this as a UCONN ECE course. The students are excited about the course and have already tentatively arranged a blood pressure screening at the Ellington Senior Center on Tuesday November 7, 2017. The students are very excited for the opportunity. There is a lot of exciting work going on, and the students are doing a tremendous job!

Ellington High School (EHS) students were in their clinical uniform and were asked questions about their interest in the class, etc. EHS is working in cooperation with the Ellington Ambulance Association to have seven of our EHS students participate in a year-long course that will prepare them for EMT certification.

The story on Fox 61 will highlight that EHS is the first high school in the state to offer this as a UCONN ECE course. The students are excited about the course and have already tentatively arranged a blood pressure screening at the Ellington Senior Center on Tuesday November 7, 2017. The students are very excited for the opportunity. There is a lot of exciting work going on, and the students are doing a tremendous job!

The Opening Knight Players will present The Silent Sentinels by William Prenetta on Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 7:30 pm in the Gordon C. Getchell Auditorium. Tickets are $8 and $6 for students/senior citizens.

The play begins in 1976 with Kate O’Halloran, who is barely in her 20s and not interested in feminism, arriving at the home of suffragette legend and ERA proponent Alice Paul, aged 93, for an interview. Kate, unbeknownst to Paul, has no desire to discuss the ERA but to uncover the truth behind Paul’s tortured illegal imprisonment in 1917, a secret that has remained buried for over 50 years. By revealing parts of her past, told through flashbacks, Alice hopes to achieve her biggest coup in the little time she has left.

The Opening Knight Players will present The Silent Sentinels by William Prenetta on Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 7:30 pm in the Gordon C. Getchell Auditorium. Tickets are $8 and $6 for students/senior citizens.

The play begins in 1976 with Kate O’Halloran, who is barely in her 20s and not interested in feminism, arriving at the home of suffragette legend and ERA proponent Alice Paul, aged 93, for an interview. Kate, unbeknownst to Paul, has no desire to discuss the ERA but to uncover the truth behind Paul’s tortured illegal imprisonment in 1917, a secret that has remained buried for over 50 years. By revealing parts of her past, told through flashbacks, Alice hopes to achieve her biggest coup in the little time she has left.

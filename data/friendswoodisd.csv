**Update** Laurel Drive, Castlewood, and Shadowbend have both been sponsored!

For some of our neighbors in Friendswood ISD, navigating the challenges of Covid 19 have been like being pieces in a real game of Monopoly. Families have been dealt unimaginable ""Chance"" cards that have left them struggling to stay on the board.
They need help right now - and we're looking to connect those who are in a position to help with those with greatest need.
This is our first round of FISD Careopoly, and we hope that you will go to your church small groups, close network of friends, or even your neighborhood to come together to adopt one of our FISD Careopoly Families.

It wasn‚Äôt long ago we all stood together as a community elbow to elbow as we rebuilt Friendswood. Our true ‚Äúmustang colors‚Äù shone brightly for the world to see. We were FRIENDSWOOD STRONG.

Now, we are faced with COVID-19. We are told to separate - to practice social distancing. So we must come together to show our strength in a different way. As a community, let‚Äôs show our spirit by creating and POSTING a mustang in the windows of our homes and businesses. Art teachers will be sharing videos today to help guide you. These are meant to be a reminder of our community togetherness so that when you are out taking a walk or going for a drive you will see these mustangs and know that we are forever connected! When you‚Äôre done, be sure to leave a comment below with a picture!

It wasn‚Äôt long ago we all stood together as a community elbow to elbow as we rebuilt Friendswood. Our true ‚Äúmustang colors‚Äù shone brightly for the world to see. We were FRIENDSWOOD STRONG.

Now, we are faced with COVID-19. We are told to separate - to practice social distancing. So we must come together to show our strength in a different way. As a community, let‚Äôs show our spirit by creating and POSTING a mustang in the windows of our homes and businesses. Art teachers will be sharing videos today to help guide you. These are meant to be a reminder of our community togetherness so that when you are out taking a walk or going for a drive you will see these mustangs and know that we are forever connected!

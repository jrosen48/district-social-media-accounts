Frontier was on schedule without this delay already having more completed ballots than any other time in the last few decades.

The second order allows traditional in-person graduation for up to 150 people. The 150 would include graduates, family, staff and administrators. If we were to use this option, we would have to break up our graduation into at least 8 groups. Thankfully, Mr, Charland, his assistant principals the Board of Education and I took our time to find a solution that allows all of the Class of 2020 to come together. This order does not affect our planned graduation at the Lancaster Speedway as it falls in the same category as drive-ins. Many more details on exactly how the ceremony will occur will be sent out to the Class of 2020 soon.

“We saw the plea for blood donations in the Western New York area, and we wanted to help. What can Frontier High School do to help our community? We decided this was a great way to give back.”

The Frontier Central Schools District has been a great partner of ConnectLife for many years. They run a very successful Donate Life Club and run blood drives throughout the school year.

As a valued partner of ConnectLife, Frontier HS chose to go the extra mile and help the WNY community out in a time of need. It’s partners like this that help to save lives in our WNY community, and for that we are grateful.",2020-04-02 08:09:22,,

Frontier’s event is a daylong affair and brings the entire community together. DJ Anthony and players from the Buffalo Bandits also joined in on the fun throughout the day. A shout out goes to Mrs. Klein and her committee for their coordination and organization of this fantastic event.

Today we honor senior Kamden Sweet. Kam was our starting center fielder last year as a junior. Kam would have been a two year starter this year in the outfield. He like many of our players is versatile to play infield and outfield when needed. He also is a relief pitcher. Kam as soon as last year was done was right back working on his skills. He made huge strides in all areas and was looking to have a huge year at the plate and in the field. Kam would have been an innings eater out of our bullpen this year and be very successful at it. Kam is a teammate that‚Äôs wants nothing more than to see his buddies succeed and his team to do well. He would do anything a coach would ask. Chase a ball out of play he‚Äôs on it. Drag the tarp on it. Kam‚Äôs leadership and love for the game will be missed by all. Kam plans on attending MCC in the fall. We will miss Kam‚Äôs leadership, hard work, and just the pure joy that he brings to the field everyday. Thank You Kam from the bottom of our hearts for all you have done for the Fruitport baseball program, and the future Fruitport Trojan baseballers.

Today we are honoring Chase R. Campbell. Or as we like to call him Soup. Chase would have been a second year starter on the Varsity as a DH/corner infielder. Like so many of our players he is versatile enough to play multiple positions and be effective. Chase took advantage of his opportunities when he was thrust into the line up due to some injuries and never looked back. He hit .333 in 17 games as a junior with a .462 on base percentage. Chase batted in the 5th spot and provided protection for Luke and Nick. He also hit .400 in conference games. If teams pitched around them they had to pitch to Chase and he often made them pay. Chase put a lot of work in during the off-season and was primed for a big season. Chase is quiet and often lets his game do his talking but he is also quick to protect his teammates. Chase plans on attending MCC in the fall. We are gonna miss Chase next year and the leadership and work ethic he brought to the program.

Our second senior to be honored is David Ross. David would have been a second year starter as a senior. As a junior he started at multiple spots. He‚Äôs played Shortstop,third,second,all 3 outfield spots and this year he was working on the mound as a reliever for us as well. David is the type of kid that if the coaches asked him to do something with out hesitation he would say yes coach. He is a true program guy. David as a junior hit .296 overall .347 in league play. He had an on base percentage of .387. David scored 24 runs with 9 runs batted in with 5 doubles. David led the team last year with 15 stolen bases. David is always willing to help another teammate to get better. David plans on attending Alma in the fall where he plans to study Computer Science and then Biotec Engineering and to play football.

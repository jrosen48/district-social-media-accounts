Our 8th grade Lady Cougar volleyball teams opened their season last night against the Marion Lady Bulldogs. B team started the night off, and while they fell short of grabbing the win-notable highlights include strong serves by Gabrielle Cunningham, consistent passing by Angelina Escboar, and all around team hustle from beginning to end. A team finished the night with a close first set and rally from behind second set. Sofia Mercer and Kyra Brown led the team in serves.

Mrs. Garatoni took the challenge and her PreAP English II classes put on their broadcasting hats and got to work. On Tuesday, May 14th, NPR featured some of the high school podcast finalists in a piece on NPR’s evening news show, All Things Considered. Out of over 25,000 entries, Cole’s entry “Growing Up Military” was picked as a finalist and snippet of it was featured on the show. 10th graders Garrett Barnard, Joseph Huisken, and Julian Longoria created the podcast. It was very well received by NPR and is an accurate and thoughtful look at what it is like to be a military child. Way to go Cougars!

In early 2018, current FSH Elementary student Samantha White submitted a story to a popular national podcast, Story Pirates. Her story, “Dreaming Sheep”, was selected to be turned into a song and in February of 2018, Samantha’s Dreaming Sheep song aired on the Story Pirates podcast. That, in itself, is quite a feat!

Fast forward to today, and Samantha and her family just learned that Dreaming Sheep will be one of only a handful of songs featured on Story Pirates' second CD! The album will be released nationally on May 31st.

When asked what inspired her to write and submit her story Samantha said, “When I listened to other kid's stories, it inspired me to write my story. I wanted to write about my stuffed animal sheep, Ba-Ba, doing the same things that I did every day."" We are sure glad she did!

Congratulations, Samantha. We’re very proud of you!

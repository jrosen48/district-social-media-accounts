Jase has been a member of the lacrosse team for four years. His favorite thing about being on the lacrosse team is the brotherhood and bond between teammates. His favorite memory was the excitement he felt after each win and when the team went to the Wafflehouse together. After graduation, Jase will be attending Norwich University where he will study mechanical engineering and continue playing lacrosse. Thank you Jase and best of luck.

Are you interested in doing something different and meeting new people? Would you be interested in attending a cake decorating event? This would not be a fundraiser. Whatever the vendor charges per person is what each participant would pay. The PSO would cover the cost of snacks and beverages.

If you would be interested in a decorating/casual social event and the cost would be $40, drop me a comment and if we have enough interest, we will schedule the event. Each participant would make and take home a cake similar to the one I have pictured. (We have other cake options also!) I would want to schedule on a Saturday afternoon or a Sunday.",0.0,"FSMA PSO

Good morning everyone! I have attached our online learning class schedule. Students will have each class two times per week for 30 minutes. This has been the norm across the state when it comes to the class schedules. There is an overall matrix form. It is also broken up by grade for the week These are the times when you must check in for each of your classes and work on and complete assignments and tasks. This schedule will begin Monday, April 6, 2020.
As this is new for everyone, we want to hear from our families throughout this process. We want to know how we are doing, what is working, what isn't working, etc. We are working on getting a ""drop box"" for questions, comments, and concerns. In the meantime, please email Principal Kramer at cari.kramer@k12.nd.us or Superintendent Baker at robyn.baker@k12.nd.us.
We will also mail out these schedules to all families today. We will also send them to parents via email in our all-call system.
Please do not hesitate to contact us! We are all in this together!

Good morning everyone! I have attached our online learning class schedule. Students will have each class two times per week for 30 minutes. This has been the norm across the state when it comes to the class schedules. There is an overall matrix form. It is also broken up by grade for the week These are the times when you must check in for each of your classes and work on and complete assignments and tasks. This schedule will begin Monday, April 6, 2020.
As this is new for everyone, we want to hear from our families throughout this process. We want to know how we are doing, what is working, what isn't working, etc. We are working on getting a ""drop box"" for questions, comments, and concerns. In the meantime, please email Principal Kramer at cari.kramer@k12.nd.us or Superintendent Baker at robyn.baker@k12.nd.us.
We will also mail out these schedules to all families today. We will also send them to parents via email in our all-call system.
Please do not hesitate to contact us! We are all in this together!

Hello FYPS families and community members,
There have not been any real changes since the governor's press conference on Thursday where he announced that North Dakota Public Schools are closed until further notice.
FYPS is continuing to work on their distance learning plan that is to be submitted to the governor for approval. This plan is due Friday, March 27, 2020. Once we have further information and instructions for that we will get that out to everyone.
Tomorrow we will continue with lunch drop offs. We will also have school supplies, learning packets, and devices for those families who have notified the principal. If you are in need of a device please email Principal Kramer.
We hope you are all doing well and staying healthy!!

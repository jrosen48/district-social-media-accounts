Beginning April 6, the following changes will be implemented to our school meal program during the closures:

· Due to demand, the District will be closing the Lynbrook and Monta Vista locations, with our other four locations continuing to serve meals (Fremont, Homestead, Cupertino and Fair Oaks Park).

Summer Band Lessons

Fulda High School Band & Choir
May 22 at 9:18 AM ·

Important FHS Band updates!:

First, there will be NO marching band this summer 😔 Our first three scheduled parades are cancelled, and the others are surely just waiting to announce cancellation until the last minute. Large group practices are also not feasible yet.

Second, there WILL be summer band lessons, upon request! 😁 To schedule lessons for your band student, either fill out the form attached below, or contact Mr. Saxman at 507-425-2514 ext. 3522 or matthew.saxman@isd505.org. As always, all band lessons are totally free. We have an administration-approved plan in place for practicing social distancing in the band room while learning to play instruments. Please ask if you have any concerns - safety is our #1 priority!

Last, ""instrument try-outs"" and first lessons for students exiting 4th grade/entering 5th grade will take place either in the fall, or as soon as more hands-on learning in school is possible. I will talk to the classes and contact parents when the time comes. 👍

Thanks for a GREAT year in band at Fulda Public Schools!",0.0,"DOCS.GOOGLE.COM

Important FHS Band updates!:

First, there will be NO marching band this summer 😔 Our first three scheduled parades are cancelled, and the others are surely just waiting to announce cancellation until the last minute. Large group practices are also not feasible yet.

Second, there WILL be summer band lessons, upon request! 😁 To schedule lessons for your band student, either fill out the form attached below, or contact Mr. Saxman at 507-425-2514 ext. 3522 or matthew.saxman@isd505.org. As always, all band lessons are totally free. We have an administration-approved plan in place for practicing social distancing in the band room while learning to play instruments. Please ask if you have any concerns - safety is our #1 priority!

Last, ""instrument try-outs"" and first lessons for students exiting 4th grade/entering 5th grade will take place either in the fall, or as soon as more hands-on learning in school is possible. I will talk to the classes and contact parents when the time comes. 👍

Thanks for a GREAT year in band at Fulda Public Schools!",0.0,"Fulda High School Band & Choir

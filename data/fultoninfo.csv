Today as we are celebrating the birthday of our Founder Chris @ludacris Bridges, we are pleased to announce that we have joined forces with Fulton County Government to help in spreading the word about the #2020Census here in ATL!

Atlanta has about 400,000 people that are uncounted. That means that just year one after the census 400,000 x $2,300 = $920 million dollar will not be allotted to communities in need. Most of the uncounted are in South Atlanta!

This means underfunded school, ranging from no free lunches to underfunded books and technology.

If just 10% of the 400,000 take 5 minutes to complete the census that would result in $920 million coming into the community!

This season, participants will take part in online nutrition education module and curbside pick-up instead of in-person activities.

Every week, attendees will participate in a 10 minute online UGA Extension Fulton County nutrition education module. On the day of the market, completion of the online module will be verified and participants are given a free bag of in-season produce from our mobile market to take home and prepare. Pick-up will be outdoors, contact-less, and curbside.

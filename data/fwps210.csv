It's Wonderful Worksite Wednesday!

Help us recognize one of our incredible community partners, World Vision Storehouse in Fife!

ETP would like to spotlight World Vision. World Vision has provided ETP student interns with real-life work experiences in a professional setting. Our students enjoy the fun environment World Vision provides while they learn skills for future employment. World Vision provides a safe and fun environment where students can work together with the team at World Vision.

Thank you, World Vision, for all you do for not only the community at large, but specifically the investment you make in each of the ETP World Vision Interns!",2020-05-13 13:06:33,,

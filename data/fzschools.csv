Thank you for all you do as we mark National Library Workers Day! We know you are avid readers, and we know you are powerful coaches. You help students build the skills they need to navigate digital resources and create their own content. You spark student interests in STEM fields, podcasting, video storytelling and more. Last week you shared tips for successful video conferencing with #FZCommunity, helping us all be safer digital citizens
Even with all of these 21st Century lessons to teach, you always find time to remind us just how important reading is: it can take us where we want to go when we have to stay where we are.
We know how you miss your students, and we know they miss you, too. Sharing stories is one of our most powerful connections!

Operating Revenue is the money the district uses to operate every day. These revenues pay salaries and benefits, pay for supplies, equipment and educational materials such as books and technology. They also pay to keep the lights, heat or air conditioning and water on.

Bond Revenue can only be used to make capital improvements. These revenues can only be used to improve or maintain existing facilities (such as construction, renovation and repairs) or to construct or purchase a new facility.

The law requires money in either fund only be used for specific expenditures.

Thanks to voter approval of a $35 million no-tax-increase bond issue in April 2018, Fort Zumwalt completed several improvement projects this summer, ensuring safe, welcoming learning environments for our staff and students.

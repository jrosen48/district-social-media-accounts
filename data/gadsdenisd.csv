In support of this endeavor, Friday, May 8 will be the first of the Family Fun Fridays for the remainder of the school year. GISD encourages our students and their families to engage in fun family experiences outside of learning. No lessons, no phone calls from teachers and no Google Classrooms. This is your time to relax, unwind and engage in family living. School district offices and campuses will be closed on Friday, but open during regular operating hours, Monday through Thursday.

The entire campus at Santa Teresa Middle School read the heartwarming story, ""Too Many Tamales"" by Gary Soto. As the story reads, students participated in making sweet tamales to enter a contest with parents. Making tamales is a tradition in Latin cultures during special occasions and involves preparing the corn dough, cooking and preparing the filling, soaking the corn husks, then spreading, filling and wrapping. Parents took the tamales home to cook then brought them back to enter the contest which was scored on originality, flavor, and presentation.

The educational experience was integrated into all the classrooms. Students learned the literary elements of the story, the cultural aspects, math strategies to convert tamales into dozens and measure the ingredients needed. They also learned about converting Fahrenheit to Celsius for cooking the tamales.

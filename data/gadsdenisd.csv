The entire campus at Santa Teresa Middle School read the heartwarming story, ""Too Many Tamales"" by Gary Soto. As the story reads, students participated in making sweet tamales to enter a contest with parents. Making tamales is a tradition in Latin cultures during special occasions and involves preparing the corn dough, cooking and preparing the filling, soaking the corn husks, then spreading, filling and wrapping. Parents took the tamales home to cook then brought them back to enter the contest which was scored on originality, flavor, and presentation.

The educational experience was integrated into all the classrooms. Students learned the literary elements of the story, the cultural aspects, math strategies to convert tamales into dozens and measure the ingredients needed. They also learned about converting Fahrenheit to Celsius for cooking the tamales.

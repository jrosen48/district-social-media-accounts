The Gadsden County Times is publishing its annual graduation section in its May 28 edition of the newspaper. If you'd like to congratulate your outstanding student, you can do so with these incredibly affordable rates.

Additionally, I'd be remiss if I didn't offer an immense amount of praise for Tika Wiggins-Milton with Gadsden County Public Schools, Debbie Potter with Robert F. Munroe Day School and Kim Truett with Tallavana Christian School, who ensured The Times had all available senior photos to include in this special keepsake edition. Those three women's work, organization and patience with me is a big reason why we'll be able to publish this great section highlighting the seniors' graduation. Thank you to those three for all you do in our community.

The students may be at home right now, but faculty and staff are out at Greensboro right now making sure kids get their EdPackets for at-home skill practice. We can’t thank our Bulldog team enough for their commitment to our kids. The cafeteria staff have been making and delivering breakfasts and lunches, custodians are doing a deep clean of the campus, and teachers and administrators are doing everything they can think of to help keep our students on track to finish the expectations of this school year. Thanks so much to everyone for everything you’ve contributed to this process.
Oh, and Superintendent Milton stopped by this morning for a wellness check, making sure everyone is healthy and in good spirits. We appreciate your concern, Mr. Milton, and thanks for coming over to see us!

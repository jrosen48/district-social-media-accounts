GRIN NEEDS YOUR HELP: GRIN hopes to provide book bags, school supplies, personal hygiene items and food to local families who need help with “back to school” items (whether they start at home or in the school). THIS WEEK we are trying to collect colored pencils, crayons, post-it notes and scissors. If shopping for items is not right for you, please feel free to text “GRIN Give” to 77977 to donate and we will purchase the items needed. Thank you for your help!",2020-07-13 16:38:45,,

Do Your Thing Thursday for Gahanna Schools. We had to show what Karrington likes to do. She hates to practice, but loves performing on stage. This was the routine they had just started to learn a month ago when they stopped classes. Very fitting for what everyone is going through.

An active case indicates that a student or staff member has received a lab-confirmed positive case of COVID-19 and they have not yet returned to campus. Individuals who test positive are excluded from participation in any in-person/on-campus activity until the campus verifies that the individual meets the return criteria set by state and local health authorities. Once the individual is cleared to return, they are then considered a recovered case.

Students and staff labeled as quarantined are a result of either a personal lab-confirmed positive case OR exposure to a lab-confirmed positive case. Exposures are reported to GISD by a parent and/or the Cooke County Emergency Management System as a result of contact tracing.

This data will be updated each school day. The dashboard is located on the district and campus websites under news & announcements.

Parents of new GISD students: Your emails and contact info are not yet accessible for the emails and phone calls. We are working with campus registrars to get this information by the end of the week, next week at the latest, so that you will receive the same communication regarding reopening.

An email with a commitment form will be emailed on Thursday and will be open until July 31st. This gives every parent a choice of instruction (in-person or virtual) for each of their students.

All information is posted to our website: www.gainesvilleisd.org/returntolearn

Taryn is a first grade teacher at Edison Elementary.

The announcement came during the end-of-year service awards celebration on Friday, May 29th and we were able to present the awards on Monday afternoon. These two deserving teachers were nominated during the year by their campus principal and then selected by their peers as campus teacher of the year. After reviewing the thorough applications by all campus teachers of the year, a district level committee then determined who would be our district teachers of the year.

Whitney and Taryn will now go on to represent GISD in the ESC 11 Teacher of the Year contest. Congratulations!

On February 6, 2020 at a special-called meeting, the GISD Board of Trustees approved and called an Order of Election for a May 2, 2020 Bond Election in the amount of $35,100,000.

Prior to making the final decision, the Board reviewed all of the information as well as options that were developed by the Facilities Steering Committee.

The proposal will be as follows:
Expansion of Chalmers campus - $12,781,954
Expansion of Lee campus - $ 13,013,400
Capital Improvements - $9,263,176

The expansion of the Lee and Chalmers campuses would decommission Edison Elementary from student use.

needs. Committee members are evaluating the district’s enrollment projections, a comprehensive building assessment and financial information in preparation of making a facility recommendation to the Board of Trustees.

To assist the Facility Steering Committee in gathering input from a variety of perspectives, we’ve partnered with an independent polling firm to conduct a facility survey. Your perspective as a parent is very important, and I hope you’ll take a few minutes to participate in this survey. All participation is completely anonymous to the district. Names are collected solely for the independent surveyor to avoid duplicates and compare with registered voters.

GISD staff please only complete the survey sent through district email.

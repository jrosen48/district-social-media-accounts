While Galion City School District has taken some major preventative measures to disinfect our buildings this past weekend, here are some measures you can take yourself to prevent the flu virus this season:
• Clean hands often with soap and warm water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
• Keep kitchen, bathrooms, and toys clean. (Don't forget door knobs, light fixtures, and TV remotes!)
• Don't share items for drinking or eating.
• Avoid contact with anyone who has a cold or the flu.
• Avoid the crowds during the peak flu season.
• Drink plenty of fluids!
• Keep your hands away from your eyes, mouth, and nose.
• Get enough sleep, exercise, and nutritious foods daily.
• Keep stress under control as much as possible.
• Take a daily vitamin.
• Get an annual flu vaccine.

Please note that families will need to sign an appropriate use form as well as a form outlining responsibilities for the technology. Because of this students will need a legal parent/legal guardian to accompany them when they pick up and we will only be able to release equipment to each student and parent (no one will be able to pick up for a friend).

Today I am announcing that effective tomorrow at 8 AM, New Mexico will be under a statewide stay-at-home instruction. All New Mexicans are instructed to stay at home except for outings essential to health, safety, and welfare.

It is urgently important that New Mexicans understand: You must stay home. Don’t panic – but it's no time for business as usual. This is life-and-death, and the most important thing the average New Mexican can do to help, right now, is stay at home. All businesses except those deemed essential to public health, safety and well-being will be ordered closed. Our society must continue to operate – but in an extremely limited way. This is the only way to slow the spread of COVID-19. More information here: https://bit.ly/2QHgSwD

Essential services include health care services, grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations, utilities, child care for essential workers, banks & credit unions, shelters, emergency services, & infrastructure operations.

March 23 at 3:50 PM ·

Today I am announcing that effective tomorrow at 8 AM, New Mexico will be under a statewide stay-at-home instruction. All New Mexicans are instructed to stay at home except for outings essential to health, safety, and welfare.

It is urgently important that New Mexicans understand: You must stay home. Don’t panic – but it's no time for business as usual. This is life-and-death, and the most important thing the average New Mexican can do to help, right now, is stay at home. All businesses except those deemed essential to public health, safety and well-being will be ordered closed. Our society must continue to operate – but in an extremely limited way. This is the only way to slow the spread of COVID-19. More information here: https://bit.ly/2QHgSwD

Essential services include health care services, grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations, utilities, child care for essential workers, banks & credit unions, shelters, emergency services, & infrastructure operations.

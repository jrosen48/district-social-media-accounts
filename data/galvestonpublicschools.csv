The week before spring break UTMB reached out and asked that we encourage students to get involved in showing appreciation to nurses for Nurses Week 2020￼. This seemed to be a meaningful assignment for my classes first online assignment. It was posted Monday and I was so excited to get my first submission on Tuesday. To all of my students I really miss seeing you in class and receiving your pictures brightens my day. I will continue to post the pictures that I receive. Keep up the good work. Assignments will be on Canvas until we return to school. You can reach me at my GISD email.￼￼",2020-03-18 12:22:40,,

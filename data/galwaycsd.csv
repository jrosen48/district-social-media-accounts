You kept working even from home, you showed support for one another through kind messages and car parades, and our Galway Spirit held strong through pictures/videos on our Facebook page and District website.

You should all be very proud of yourselves and your accomplishments through this very challenging time. We hope to all be back together again in the Fall. Until then, stay safe, stay healthy and stay active. Have a great summer!

This was our fifth consecutive Book Fair to win a national award and another üí≤1,000 in prize money‚ÄºÔ∏è

Scholastic was full of praise for our school and community. The contest is not about sales ~ it focuses on efforts to encourage and engage students in reading, as well as volunteerism and faculty involvement. We are commended for all our continued efforts.

üì¢ Shout out to Mrs. Emma Obern and all the FANTASTIC VOLUNTEERS who work so hard to give the children a fun, memorable experience that they look forward to every Fall and Spring‚ÄºÔ∏è Thank you for instilling a love of reading

When we began developing protocols to work within the COVID-19 guidelines, we knew there would be challenges. As a team, we have worked tirelessly to come up with creative and safe solutions to continue to satisfy our mission of creating a safe, challenging, and engaging environment for our community's youth.

Despite these efforts, due to an exceptionally low (albeit not surprising) response rate for registration, we have had to make the difficult decision to cancel the Summer Programming for 2020.

We are fully committed to finding ways this year to provide programming where possible as the current landscape continues to evolve.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us.",2020-09-13 01:17:19.846882,,

Thank you to everyone who has sent in Boxtops or used the online program to scan Boxtops for ESS! I am proud to say that we set a very ambitious goal to earn $1000 this year, and we are almost half way!! If you are interested in using the phone app to submit boxtops, check out the website (www.boxtops4education.com) or download the BoxTops for Education app on any smartphone.

It is easy to sign up to support Elm Street School. There are always ""deals"" happening too - for example right now we get 50 BONUS box tops ($5.00) when you buy 5 General Mills box top products from now until February 3 at Market Basket or Price Chopper. Many families buy cereal and fruit snacks - it might be on your regular shopping list and you can donate to the school at the same time!

Elm Street is looking to get outside for recess a lot more this winter, however there are days in which we have no choice.

With that being said, we are looking for donations of simple board games (Trouble/Checkers/Chess/Connect 4/etc), decks of cards, UNO, or other age-appropriate games/activities to help occupy our students on these chilly days. We do utilize GoNoodle and other interactive games in the classrooms for those needing movement, but for those who may prefer a quiet game with a friend...we do appreciate your support. Thank you!",2020-09-13 01:17:19.847153,,

Fifth grade student leaders from Elmwood Elementary School participated in a very meaningful ceremony which took place earlier in the week at Jennings Home as part of their annual Veteran‚Äôs Day celebration. Integrally involved with the ceremony itself, these Elmwood students, known as ‚Äúambassadors,‚Äù carried flags representing the various branches of the armed forces and hoisted them during the flag raising ceremony at the pole in front of the Jennings Home campus. From there, each fifth grade student had the opportunity to read aloud a special and personally-written statement of gratitude expressing their appreciation for the sacrifices of the men and women who were veterans in the audience.

In total, nearly 200 people participated in this ceremony and the Elmwood student ambassadors did a fantastic job of representing the Garfield Heights City Schools. Thank you to Ms. Jen Huncharek for her leadership of the student group and to Jennings Home for allowing our students to contribute to this yearly patriotic and solemn ceremony.",0.0,"Garfield Heights City Schools

As cold temperatures approach, we STRONGLY urge residents not to leave their vehicles unattended and unsecured while warming them up. Last winter we had numerous vehicles taken out of driveways while they were left running. Exhaust fumes in cold temperatures make these cars easy targets to spot.

Suspects are generally wondering the streets looking up driveways. The thefts happen within minutes of owners going back inside their houses. Several thieves were arrested last winter but no doubt they, or their associates, will be out again this winter.

DO NOT leave your vehicle running unless it can be secured by a secondary means (remote start, a second key, etc.) Also, please report ANY suspicious persons whom appear to be wandering on side streets with no apparent agenda.

Please share this message with any and all residents. This is a preventable problem and with cooperation from everyone it can be all but eliminated from our city. Thank you.",0.0,"Garfield Heights Police Department - Ohio

Life was passing me by because I was allowing it to.
My loved one‚Äôs addiction was controlling everything in my life‚Ä¶.because I was letting it.

There is a reason that prescription drugs are intended to be taken under the direction of a doctor: if used improperly they can be dangerous. Teens are making the decision to abuse prescription medicines based on misinformation. In fact, many people think abusing prescription drugs is safer than abusing illicit drugs.

What Is Prescription Drug Abuse?

Prescription drug abuse is when someone takes a medication that was prescribed for someone else or takes their own prescription in a manner or dosage other than what was prescribed. Abuse can include taking a friend's or relative's prescription to get high, to treat pain, or because you think it will help with studying.

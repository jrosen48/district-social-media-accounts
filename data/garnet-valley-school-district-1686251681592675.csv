This morning at the high school, a bag of pinnies, which are pieces of sportswear made of mesh used in physical education classes, was thrown near a stove in the sports snack bar area and inadvertently engaged it. The pinnies caught on fire and were quickly put out with an extinguisher. However, there was a great deal of smoke. The fire department was quickly called and all of the students were evacuated until the building was deemed safe by the fire marshal.

The high school team is currently using fans and exhaust systems to clear the smoke and improve the air quality prior to lunches. The students, teachers, and support staff were fantastic as they handled the situation with calm.

As always, thank you for your continued support!!

Due to the current forecast, we are proactively scheduling a 2 hour delay for schools and offices tomorrow–Tuesday February 12, 2019. Kindergarten will also run on a delay and use a modified schedule. We, however, will reassess conditions in the morning, and if we decide to close schools, we will make the call between 6:30 and 7:00AM.

As I’m sure you know, the weather service is calling for more precipitation, and the timing will be problematic for a normal start time. Additionally, temperatures are not expected to be above freezing until approximately 10AM, so the snow could linger and also mix with freezing rain. Although making a decision based on a forecast comes with risk, I know how difficult these days are for parents, and I want to give everyone plenty of time to prepare and organize their schedules.

I apologize for the late notice, but we have to change our earlier decision and close schools and offices today. The snow is continuing much longer than anticipated and it is causing major road issues as well as covering all of the areas that we shoveled and plowed this morning. I know that this change causes everyone great inconvenience, but we had to make the decision based on what was the safest thing to do for our students, faculty and staff. Thank you so much for understanding!

Schools and offices will run on a two-hour delayed schedule today–Monday, February 11, 2019. Kindergarten will also run on a delay and utilize a modified schedule. As we drove throughout the district, the precipitation was ending, but many of the back roads and neighborhoods were completely snow covered. Although we believe that conditions will improve quickly once the sun comes up, a two-hour delay will allow rush hour traffic to break-up some of the snow and ice, give everyone extra time to navigate their neighborhoods and driveways, and help our snow teams prepare district sidewalks and buses.

Unfortunately, it appears that we are in for more bad weather tomorrow, so I appreciate everyone’s patience and cooperation in advance. As always for our student drivers, if you are uncomfortable driving, please take the bus. Be careful this morning, and we’ll see you in a few hours!

Sincerely,

I have received some emails this evening from parents regarding tomorrow's schedule. Our plan is to open schools on their normal times on Thursday, January 31st. Admittedly, we contemplated a two hour delay; however, looking at the forecast, it didn't appear that conditions would improve significantly enough to warrant it. Our transportation department and facilities teams will be in early to start buses and ensure that buildings are prepared for school. If we experience any systems failures or discover unforeseen icing, we will make decisions accordingly.

Since more parents may decide to drive their children to school in the morning, please allow for extra travel time. Again, schools will open on time tomorrow, so please bundle up!!!

Due to the timing of the squall, we are holding dismissal at the secondary level by ten minutes. All students, including student drivers, will be held in their last period classes for ten minutes in order to wait out what appears to be a very fast moving burst of wind and snow. We also informed student drivers that if they were uncomfortable driving to leave their cars in the high school parking lots and take the bus. We also decided to keep after school activities running because this system is not supposed to last beyond 2:40pm. For elementary parents, the delay will impact your children's dismissal times, so expect them to be a few minutes later.

All schools and offices will run on a two hour delayed schedule. Kindergarten will run on a modified schedule. I, along with the rest of our team, have been driving throughout the district since 3AM. Although roads and sidewalks are mostly wet, our temperature gauges never got above 32 degrees, which gave us concern about the “snow burst” forecasted between 5AM and 7AM. Additionally, there are huge puddles, downed branches, and slush in several areas but especially on the back roads. After yesterday, it’s senseless to risk another difficult commute for our students, drivers, and parents. Coming in two hours later will hopefully bring daylight and higher temperatures.

It’s been an unbelievable 24 hours, and I want you to know how much I appreciate your cooperation and support. These schedule changes are inconvenient for everyone, but we want to make sure that our students, faculty, and staff are safe.

390,14.0,,77.0,,2175295672688271,"Dear Parents,
I’m really concerned that temperatures are not going not to rise quickly enough for our students to get home without incident. I, consequently, will dismiss our secondary students at 11:15 AM and our elementary students at 12:00 PM. Morning Kindergarten will dismiss at its usual time and there will be no PM or Extended Day Kindergarten.

I realize what a major inconvenience this change is for parents as well as the difficulty of having short notice; however, I’m not comfortable putting our students, faculty and staff at risk. At the high school, we have drivers whose first inclement driving experience will occur today, and additionally, I want to get everyone home prior to work traffic. Admittedly, I cannot seem to get last year's storm out of my mind when we kept students in school and some did not get home until after 6PM.

I truly appreciate your cooperation, understanding, and flexibility!

Sincerely,
Marc Bertrando, Superintendent

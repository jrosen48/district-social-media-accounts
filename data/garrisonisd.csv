We are getting ready to have our annual student flu & immunization clinic. It will be a little different this year as students are REQUIRED to use the link and sign up at least 2 DAYS PRIOR to the clinic.

If you have received a letter that your student needs immunizations this would be a great time to catch them up as each shot is $5!

The due date for proof of all immunizations will be extended for those planning to participate in this clinic.

On Monday October 21 at approximately 8:10 we received word of a chemical spill that could possibly contain hazardous material. The spill occurred approximately 3 miles south of the GISD campus and the wind was out of the North. We alerted staff members to review evacuation procedures from the crisis prevention plan. Appropriate personnel were notified and had buses in place for a planned evacuation of GISD. In conjunction with the Nacogdoches County Emergency Management Team it was determined that GISD was outside of the ¼ to ½ mile evacuation radius. It was recommended for GISD to observe a shelter in place/hold for the remainder of the school day. Buses will run at 3:25 with alternate routes and small expected delays for students that ride buses #2 and #7. We would like to thank the GISD family for their patience and cooperation during this process to ensure the safety for the students at GISD.

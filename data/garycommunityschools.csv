HOW MUCH WILL THE REFERENDUM RAISE?

If supported by voters on November 3, the referendum would raise approximately $8.9 million per year. Every dollar raised goes directly to Gary Community Schools to support the costs listed in the ballot question: teacher salaries, support for instructional staff, expanding pre-school options, support for a high-quality athletics program along with extracurricular activities, enhanced student wellness, and ensuring the fiscal stability of our Gary Community Schools.

DOES GARY COMMUNITY SCHOOLS ALREADY HAVE A BALANCED BUDGET?

No. The problem has gotten better, but the budget is not yet balanced.

Gary Community Schools has two main funds to receive and spend funds: the “Education Fund” and the “Operations Fund.” To have a balanced budget, the revenue from both funds combined must exceed the expenditures from both funds. The support of our Gary community and continued efforts at cost-savings will enable us to provide a stable funding option for our schools and our community's future.

WHY IS GARY COMMUNITY SCHOOLS HOLDING A REFERENDUM?

Our Gary Community Schools face a multi-million-dollar deficit, which results in deficit spending. Through cost-saving efforts, the deficit for our Gary Schools decreased from $22 million in August 2017 to $6 million in December 2019. Revenue from the referendum will help ensure that we receive the funding necessary to meet the educational needs of this and future generations.

What happens if the referendum fails?

Gary Community Schools, like any school district or organization, cannot spend more money than it brings in indefinitely. Gary Community Schools must have a balanced budget. If the referendum fails, very hard decisions will be made on how to balance the budget. These decisions will likely involve significantly reductions in quality teachers and staff, elimination of programs, and an image that Gary does not support its public schools.

Also, please note that Hammond, Lake Station, Hanover (Cedar Lake), Munster, Crown Point, St. John and Hobart residents all supported their local schools by voting ""Yes"" for their town’s most recent local referendums.

Did GCSC get $4 million from US Steel?

In August 2019, GCSC received a one-time payment of approximately $4 million from US Steel. This revenue was a one-time, upfront payment on future property tax revenue over 20 years. In exchange for this one-time payment, GCSC will not collect property tax from US Steel over the next 20 years on investments made in Gary. This one-time payment must cover the property tax revenue that will not be collected from US Steel over the next 20 years. While a one-time payment may have a short-term positive impact on a fund balance, the GCSC overall (all funds) budget imbalance is a long-term situation that is not corrected by a one-time payment or receipt of funds.

How will the money raised be spent?
The first million dollars of referendum revenue would go directly to teachers as a salary increase. GCSC teachers have not received a raise in over a decade – they deserve one. After the first million dollars for teachers, revenue would be spent on education enhancements for students such as arts, athletics, and extracurricular activities, safety, and student supports such as more counselors, salary increases for other instructional staff, resources for academics and learning and, ultimately, balancing the budget to end State control.

Why hold the Referendum?
GCSC is running a multi-million-dollar deficit, which means the district is spending more money every year than it is taking in. Since 2017, the deficit has decreased from $22 million to $6 million, as of January 31, 2020. Revenue from the referendum will help eliminate the annual deficit and balance the budget. A balanced budget is necessary for ending State control.

God is so good; I give Him the praise. I have been working hard for nearly two years on accreditation for the Educational Leadership Program of which I am the Coordinator at Indiana University Northwest. I have had to do this periodically every six years since I have been at the university. Believe me; it is not a cakewalk. Instead it is an academic headache, a real pain, an quantification nightmare, an unbelievable paper chase. Fortunately, I just got notice that our principal preparation program has again obtained SPA'S NATIONAL RECOGNITION WITHOUT ANY CONDITIONS. Thank you, God.

Tommy is the son of Cotton and Carolyn Davidson. He was an outstanding athlete and a 1974 graduate of Gatesville High School. He played football at Baylor University and returned to Gatesville to practice chiropractics. Tommy and his wife Nina had three children: Casey, Claire, and Will. He went on to serve on the Gatesville City Council and Gatesville ISD School Board. He served for many years as an athletic trainer to Gatesville High School.

More recently, he served as the team chiropractor for Baylor University athletics. Tragically, Dr. Davidson passed away in October of 2019 from injuries sustained in a traffic accident.

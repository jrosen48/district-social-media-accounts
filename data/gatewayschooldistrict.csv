Happy opening night Gateway's Drowsy Chaperone!

Tonight would have been opening night for Gateway High School’s musical, The Drowsy Chaperone! Sadly, these talented kids won’t get to perform this year. I’m especially sad for my seniors who do not get to experience their last opening night jitters...last alma mater circle... last costume parade ... last musical banquet... their last final bow! Musical is such an important part of their high school experience and my heart is hurting for them! 😢💔

Here are a few dance rehearsal videos we took throughout the month we got to be together. A lot of these videos are from only a couple rehearsals in ... and the kids look so good! They worked so hard at each practice and I’m forever grateful to have spent this short amount of time together!

With the average college credit cost of $595 , that's over $60,000 future tuition savings for Gateway families! Our partnership with the University of Pittsburgh and Seton Hill University allows German & Spanish students in levels 4 and 5 to earn 3 college credits each year. Next year the CHS program will grow to include French 4 & 5 as well.

GCS Parents:

Thank you for your patience and support as we work through the challenges of returning to school. Overall, this first week was a success: 80% of our students were back on campus and 20% were engaged in our new distance platform. We do recognize that the changes in building schedules and protocols this year have led to some increased traffic issues, especially at the east end of town. Although there is no easy fix for this problem, we are confident that we can make the issues more manageable. We are working on opening up a morning latchkey program at GIS, NOE, and SME that should help to stagger the drop off times and reduce traffic congestion. Our transportation department is also working with the city police department to explore traffic patterns and possible route changes. I am confident that we can take steps to reduce parent wait time and increase safety. I appreciate you working with us as we address these important issues.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3392282144220771&id=1024143264368016,,0.0,"A message from Superintendent, Brian Pearson

I wanted to thank you all for completing and returning the survey that was distributed last Thursday regarding technology within your homes. The data in the survey is helping us prepare a platform to be able to continue to provide an education to your children during this time of school closure. Currently we are building an online delivery system so that instruction can reach each and every student through their own teachers. We are also making preparations for students that do not have access to the internet or a device at home. We are working very hard to develop an effective and engaging program.

Our plan is to be able to implement the program beginning on April 6 if the school closure gets extended. We will not be providing this program before that due to the complexity of the design and staff training.

Please check the Gaylord Community Schools website as well as the Facebook page for updates.

Stepping out of the classroom and onto the court!
Keeping the new tradition alive, teachers and staff from GAMS and GAHS go head-to-head for the 2019 Teacher Basketball Game. It was a tight game ending in a 31-30 victory for the GAMS team on Thursday, February 28th.

The turnout was incredible as students and families came together to cheer on their teachers. When asked why the event is special, GAHS gym teacher Kylene Swain replied, “Seeing the support from you as the students, from high school to middle school, and just all the parents, the community coming together to come out and see us play… the environment was incredible, loud, crazy.”

Technology is everywhere, in our homes, our cars and even our schools! Greencastle has been a part of this technological wave as well, even in the youngest of grades.

In fact, it appears that the students are being brought up learning from technology at a young age. In Ms. Keeney’s first grade class we can see that she is both teaching with technology as well as the students responding in a positive manner.

The class began with a lesson shown from the teacher’s iPad projected onto the screen. “Who are we learning about today?” says Keeney, to which the class eagerly replies, “George Washington!”

The students were then sent to use the class iPads to interact with a program called “Epic”. Talking to the students the overall answer was, “It makes it easy because if you don’t know, you can just ask Epic.” (Cooper).

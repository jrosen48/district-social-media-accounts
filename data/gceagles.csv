Here is the best plan we can come up with for this messy situation
We get 150 tickets
Your current tickets are not valid
We are pulling out tickets for all the players to have their mom, dad, brothers and sisters to get tickets and be at the game.
That leaves us about 100 tickets
We will have a lottery style drawing for those 100 tickets.
We have the list of names of tickets purchased here and that list will be the start of the lottery list. You are in the drawing.

We will pull 50 names and each of those 50 will get 2 tickets.

If you did not buy tickets from us and you want to be in this lottery you have until 2:30 to come to school or contact us by phone to get on the list. You will have to meet us at JQH to pick up your tickets.

We also have a plan brewing to be able to live stream this game to the Plaza Theater in Lamar so any fans who do not get tickets can go see the game there for free",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2581327028793049&id=1880909622168130,,0.0,"Ok

During a recent Zoom staff meeting, April Southerland, 6th grade math teacher at Northwood Middle, couldn't help but notice that - while all of the staff were visible on the screen - they looked a lot like the Brady Bunch. So, Ms. Southerland wrote a poem to go with the screenshot.

""Here's the story of a group of teachers
Each of whom had a classroom of their own
Every day we saw hundreds of students
Never had time alone...

Till the one day when Corona hit the district
And we knew that it was no more just a hoax
So this group is now home with their families
That's the way we all became digital folks

Dig-it-al folks! Dig-it-al folks!
Northwood Knights are all one
Group of dig-it-al folks!""

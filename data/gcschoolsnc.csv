Changes Coming to School Meals Distribution Process",65.0,"Starting Sept. 1, the process to pick up student meals will change. Meals will be available at all GCS schools from 11 a.m. to noon. Families can pick up lunch and breakfast for the following day. Families do not have to go to the school(s) their children attend to pick-up meals.

To prevent any interruption in service, parents/guardians are encouraged to apply for meal benefits for the 2020-21 school year by filling out the application at www.lunchapplication.com.

The changes are due to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s decision to require states to shift from summer meal distribution, which was extended through August 31, to the National School Lunch Program.

The issue was with the state portal that all North Carolina school systems use, not Canvas. Thank you for your patience.

The following is a statement from State Superintendent Mark Johnson:

“It’s bad enough that so many students don’t have the option to attend school in-person, but malfunctions of the tool that so many schools use to access remote learning are simply unacceptable.

These are challenging times, and everyone is trying to extend more grace. That’s what Identity Automation, the vendor, got on Monday, the first time their remote learning tool went down.

Parents, educators, and students are all doing the best that we can and deserve technology that works. While we are limited in terms of what we can do immediately, rest assured that DPI will be having blunt discussions about these failures with the vendor and NC DIT in the days ahead.”

The board will decide which of the three scenarios the district will use later this month. The district’s goal is to serve the largest number of students for the greatest amount of time while keeping students and staff as healthy and safe as possible.

EDITED TO ADD: Students who may want to enroll in the virtual schools are those who thrive online, need a more personalized approach to learning, or those who desire a more flexible learning environment while continuing to receive a quality education.

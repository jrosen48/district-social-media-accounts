We encourage parents to complete this survey as soon as they feel prepared, but no later than August 11th. We understand that this is a difficult decision, but the sooner GCS has the information, the better we can plan for our students. We ask that if you have multiple children, please complete and submit the form for each child separately by selecting """"submit another response."" Thank you.

From Mr. Meredith:
""I'm proud to present the Greenville combined HS chorus performance of ""Omnia Sol."" Each year at our final concert we sing this piece as a send-off song for our graduating seniors. The seniors sing the opening verse, the underclassmen sing the second, and they combine for the refrain.

The goal is to win a trip to Vans headquarters, where the top five finalists will present their projects and vie for the grand prize.

In its eighth annual Vans Custom Culture art competition, the Los Angeles shoe maker is asking high-school art teachers to sign up their classes in a competition to create the most artistic and inventive designs using blank Vans shoes as their canvas.
The grand prize is $50,000 towards the winning school's arts program. The four runner-up schools will each be rewarded $4,000.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1907394106195611&id=1658226404445717,,0.0,"CDHS Art Students Put New Twist on Canvas!

I'm a GMA parent myself, and a new member of the GMA Board as of Tuesday, and am excited to be supporting the ""Community Outreach"" Pillar. As the Committee lead for Outreach, I'll be seeking to engage with parents, the PTO, the community, and school vendors.

One of the first initiatives will be to create a parent survey, and I'd appreciate if the PTO can share this request for help in gathering questions parents would like us to ask in that survey. I'll hold office hours at the North Campus Tuesday and Wednesday evening if parents would like to meet in person to share suggestions...or if that's not a good time, folks can email or PM me with suggestions. This will get us ready to have GMA Parent Town Halls this Fall (Oct & Dec), and create longer term strategy for constructively engaging parent feedback.

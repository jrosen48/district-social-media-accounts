Students will not report to school but will be learning from home that day.

Given that the Center for Disease Control has asked that schools prepare, plan and practice contingency plans in the event that the Coronavirus pandemic shuts down schools, we have decided to conduct our snow make-up day as a FID on March 13, giving teachers and students the opportunity to ‚Äúpractice‚Äù for unforeseen circumstances.

This will count as the make-up day for the February 27, 2020 snow day that closed all GM schools.

PLEASE see the FAQ on our home page right now for answers to questions you may have. Thank you, in advance, for your cooperation.

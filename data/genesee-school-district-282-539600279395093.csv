Research shows a proper deep hug, where the hearts are pressing together, can benefit you in these ways: 1. The nurturing touch of a hug builds trust and a sense of safety.

2. Hugs can instantly boost oxytocin levels, which heal feelings of loneliness, isolation, and anger.

3. Holding a hug for an extended time lifts serotonin levels, elevating mood, creating happiness.

4. Hugs strengthen the immune system. The gentle pressure on the sternum and the emotional charge this creates activates the Solar Plexus Chakra. This stimulates the thymus gland, which regulates and balances the body's production of white blood cells, which keep you healthy and disease free.

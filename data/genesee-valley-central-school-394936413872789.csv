The GVCS Urgent Care is open Monday-Friday during school hours 7:40 a.m. - 3:00 p.m.

In addition to treating non-emergent medical needs such as ear infections, pink eye, allergies, skin abnormalities, and more, the GVCS Urgent Care can uniquely test students and employees for COVID-19, Influenza, Strep Throat, and Urinalysis.

To take advantage of the GVCS Urgent Care, students must be enrolled in the program. Once enrolled, when a student becomes ill while they're in school, a provider from our tele-medicine partner (Mobile Primary Care) can quickly assess their symptoms and get them tested before they leave campus.

If you would like to enroll your child in the Urgent Care/Tele-medical program, please have your insurance information ready, use access code: 287111, and visit this website: https://form.jotform.com/92653014669159.

We realize the challenges that COVID-19 presents to working parents in need of childcare when school reopens. In an effort to help GV families, we have created a list of high school students who are interested in babysitting for the children of working parents. (These high school students would only be able to babysit on days when they are not in the school building.) Students available for babysitting will have completed a babysitting online training, a First Aid/CPR online training and be a student in good standing (grades and attendance to be approved by the building principal).

If you are a parent in need of childcare once school reopens, please contact Paula Mighells, Dean of Students/Curriculum Coordinator, at 585-268-7942 weekdays between 8:00 a.m.-3:00 p.m. or email at pmighells@genvalley.org.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3800987586600971&id=394936413872789,,0.0,"Dear GVCS Parents,

“Gibson is an intelligent and fun-loving nerd, just like me,” said Mr. Anger. “I can always count on him to understand my references to movies and video games.”

“When I think of Gibson, I think of hidden talent,” said Mr. Duttweiler. “Behind his quiet demeanor is a gifted, critical thinker. Although not always willing to show his talents, Gibson's skill and dexterity with mathematical concepts is fun to work with. Not to mention, he runs like a deer—and as a track coach, I will surely miss that aspect of his persona.”

Daily Sequence of Bugle Calls

“5:30!! We have to be at school at 5:30.” This is usually one of the first questions about the itinerary. You don’t have to be up at 5:30 to join us this year, but enjoy the video of the different daily sequence of bugle calls.

Reveille comes from the French word ""réveiller"" or in English to ""to wake up."" In 1812, U.S. forces designated the iconic melody to call service members to muster up for roll call to start the work day. It appears there is no official composer of the tune, which is used by about six countries like Denmark, Ireland, and Sweden to mark the start of the day. The notes for each country do vary and they all have written different lyrics as well.

Where are our band kids at? Take a recording of you playing reveille and post them for us to enjoy!

“I have worked in 4 schools in my career and hands down, GV firms the tightest bonds between the staff, students and community. From our bus drivers, custodians, teachers, support staff and all the way to our Superintendent, everyone has a single goal in helping students.”

Mr. VanTassel’s students have done quite well on the earth science regents and he is looking forward to this year’s group finding success. “I don’t view teaching as work,” he says. “I come to school and find ways to make the learning process fun and joyful while pushing students to grow in Earth Science.”

Mr. VanTassel graced the stage earlier this year as Mr. Pulitzer in GV’s production of Newsies. He has also served as the math/science department chairperson for the past two years.

Mr. VanTassel is finishing his 38th year teaching, including 23 years at Genesee Valley.

“I have worked in 4 schools in my career and hands down, GV firms the tightest bonds between the staff, students and community. From our bus drivers, custodians, teachers, support staff and all the way to our Superintendent, everyone has a single goal in helping students.”

Mr. VanTassel’s students have done quite well on the earth science regents and he is looking forward to this year’s group finding success. “I don’t view teaching as work,” he says. “I come to school and find ways to make the learning process fun and joyful while pushing students to grow in Earth Science.”

Mr. Duttweiler has been in the district for 28 years (4 in Angelica and 24 here at GV).

His favorite thing about teaching at GV? “The people! I have a great group of talented, caring adults as my co-workers and highly supportive administrators. GV students are inquisitive about life and quite loyal to their school community. They rally around their peers when difficulties come and celebrate group successes. I count it a privilege to work with them.”

Mr. Duttweiler has been married to Pam for almost 29 years. Their two children are both GV graduates, Luke (2012) and Carolyn (2015).

Mr. Duttweiler is an avid sports fan and likes to read and do puzzles. (He can even solve a Rubik’s cube!) He is also an expert teller of dad jokes: “What did Tennessee? The same thing that Arkansas.” 😆🤣",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3211296725570063&id=394936413872789,,0.0,"Today we’d like to introduce you to Mr. Rollie Duttweiler, high school math teacher, varsity cross country 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️ coach and varsity track & field🎖coach at Genesee Valley.

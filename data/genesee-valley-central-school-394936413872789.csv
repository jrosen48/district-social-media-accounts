The GVCS Urgent Care is open Monday-Friday during school hours 7:40 a.m. - 3:00 p.m.

In addition to treating non-emergent medical needs such as ear infections, pink eye, allergies, skin abnormalities, and more, the GVCS Urgent Care can uniquely test students and employees for COVID-19, Influenza, Strep Throat, and Urinalysis.

To take advantage of the GVCS Urgent Care, students must be enrolled in the program. Once enrolled, when a student becomes ill while they're in school, a provider from our tele-medicine partner (Mobile Primary Care) can quickly assess their symptoms and get them tested before they leave campus.

If you would like to enroll your child in the Urgent Care/Tele-medical program, please have your insurance information ready, use access code: 287111, and visit this website: https://form.jotform.com/92653014669159.

We realize the challenges that COVID-19 presents to working parents in need of childcare when school reopens. In an effort to help GV families, we have created a list of high school students who are interested in babysitting for the children of working parents.

Students available for babysitting will have completed a babysitting online training, a First Aid/CPR online training and be a student in good standing (grades and attendance to be approved by the building principal).

If you are a parent in need of childcare once school reopens, please contact Paula Mighells, Dean of Students/Curriculum Coordinator, at 585-268-7942 weekdays between 8:00 a.m.-3:00 p.m. or email at pmighells@genvalley.org.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3800987586600971&id=394936413872789,,0.0,"Dear GVCS Parents,

Reveille comes from the French word ""r√©veiller"" or in English to ""to wake up."" In 1812, U.S. forces designated the iconic melody to call service members to muster up for roll call to start the work day. It appears there is no official composer of the tune, which is used by about six countries like Denmark, Ireland, and Sweden to mark the start of the day. The notes for each country do vary and they all have written different lyrics as well.

Where are our band kids at? Take a recording of you playing reveille and post them for us to enjoy!

1. Choose the type of facts that best fits the player's level: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or a mix!

2. Decide where the ""start"" and ""end"" will be for the mission.

3. Explain that one math fact will be written on the piece of paper. If the player answers CORRECTLY, the piece of paper will be taped to the floor as a ""stepping stone"" to get to the end without falling in the lava.

4. If the question is answered INCORRECTLY, the player cannot move forward and will get another question.

In college I was a part of the Augustana softball team where I had the opportunity to travel to Brazil this past winter to experience their culture and compete against their national team.

My favorite teams are the Chicago Blackhawks, the Chicago Bears and the Chicago White Sox. I love to spend time at the beach or lake. My favorite two vacation spots are South Haven, MI and Minocqua, WI. My favorite color is blue and my favorite food is chocolate.",2020-08-17 10:00:01,,

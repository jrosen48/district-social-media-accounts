It is expected that COVID-19 mandates/guidelines will result in increased expenses. These expenses are due to a variety of new practices and procedures necessitated by new state laws, executive orders, and health department directives such as increased cleaning/sanitizing and social distancing in school buildings and buses. As an example, the district spends approximately $3,000 on the annual budget vote for supplies and poll workers. This year we are mandated by New York State to do the entire vote through absentee ballots. The cost is estimated to be about $40,000.

The biggest factor impacting the budget is the amount of uncertainty related to revenues and complying with COVID-19 mandates/guidelines. We will all have to adapt as we go through this process together. You can be assured that the district will continue to communicate what we know and don‚Äôt know in order to help you navigate the impacts to the Geneva CSD community.

It is expected that COVID-19 mandates/guidelines will result in increased expenses. These expenses are due to a variety of new practices and procedures necessitated by new state laws, executive orders, and health department directives such as increased cleaning/sanitizing and social distancing in school buildings and buses. As an example, the district spends approximately $3,000 on the annual budget vote for supplies and poll workers. This year we are mandated by New York State to do the entire vote through absentee ballots. The cost is estimated to be about $40,000.

The biggest factor impacting the budget is the amount of uncertainty related to revenues and complying with COVID-19 mandates/guidelines. We will all have to adapt as we go through this process together. You can be assured that the district will continue to communicate what we know and don‚Äôt know in order to help you navigate the impacts to the Geneva CSD community.

We are truly moved by the efforts of people across Geneva to help each other through this confusing period. We are so proud to be a part of this community and to represent you on the Board of Education.

As you know, we have been preparing for and conducting a search for a new superintendent this year. We were thrilled to get so much school and community feedback on our survey over winter break ‚Äî over 500 responses! Thank you. You helped us set the direction for what Geneva needs and deserves from our educational leader.

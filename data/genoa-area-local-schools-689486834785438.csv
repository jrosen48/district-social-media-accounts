On Oct. 31st, GHS students participated in a Pumpkin Smashing fundraiser to raise money for one of our own Comets, Carson Culter. Carson was recently diagnosed with leukemia. As the color orange is the official leukemia awareness color and with Halloween right around the corner, it only felt right we should smash some pumpkins for Carson’s sake. Students were able to smash, chuck, or catapult a pumpkin for $1. Funds were also raised via costume contests and a pumpkin themed bake good sale. GHS successfully raised over $1,000, but we all know the real healing power came from all the fun, laughter, and positivity!

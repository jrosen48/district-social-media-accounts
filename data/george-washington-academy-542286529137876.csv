During my time in the classroom I gained a passion for witnessing my students grow and develop both academically and socially.

The good news: It's going to be a little easier to make that left at the intersection of 3000 East and 2000 South.

The other news: Those traveling north and south only on 3000 East can expect a slightly longer commute.

This member of the class of 2020 draws inspiration from her faith.

Julianne's student-selected senior quote is ""But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint."" - Isaiah 40:31

Congratulations and best of luck, Julianne!

🏫 She is a Graduation Coach who has been with Georgia Connections Academy for 4 years. She has a Bachelor's Degree from Mercer University in Mathematics and a Master's Degree from the University of Georgia in Educational Administration and Policy as well as a gifted endorsement.
🧡 Jennifer found her love for education because she has always loved helping others learn. She says, “Even in elementary school, I would be paired with others to help them learn in class. I knew from an early age that I wanted to be a teacher. The Graduation Coach role is perfect for me because it really allows me to work one-on-one with families and make a difference in the lives of my students.”
🏅 The High School Counseling Department recently received RAMP. This means our High School Counseling Department is a Recognized ASCA Model Program (RAMP). She says, ""We worked really hard to earn this status and are very proud!”

Thank you so much Gerber Union Elementary School staff and teachers for this parade. I know it meant a lot to the students and their families. I am proud to say that I graduated from Gerber School (2012). Today I saw some of my teachers and brought back memories of when I attended Gerber School and felt as if this parade was also for me. It was an amazing experience and thank you staff and teachers for finding a way to educate our children in difficult times and providing them with lunches. On behalf of myself and my family.

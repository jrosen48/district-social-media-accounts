This means:

From September 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020, hot lunches for all K-8 students will be free of charge. This includes the salad bar.

Student accounts were charged for hot lunches purchased on the first day of school, August 31. August 31 was not included in the waiver period.

Our junior high students may still purchase ala carte, but their account will be charged for the ala carte purchase. The ala carte cost is $1.50.

Students may also purchase an extra milk with their lunch, but their account will be charged. The milk cost is 35₵.

Morning recess milk/juice for our PreK-4th grade students is not covered under the waiver, so families will still be charged for their child’s morning drink.

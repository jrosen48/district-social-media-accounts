KELSO wants to make sure you have access to KELSO‚Äôs Wheel of 9 Choices (attached below) so you have it to use when you have a small problem.

Try 2 (or 3 or 4) of KELSO‚ÄôS choices to help you solve your own small problem!

If you can, please send KELSO and I an email (kschassler@germantowncsd.org) and share a time (this week) that you have used a KELSO choice to solve your small problem. KELSO will reward students that share a time they solved a small problem using a KELSO choice AND the bigger reward is that you solved your own small problem.

Congratulations to Eagle Scout Dean Stutler! He is with Boy Scout Troop 25. Dean worked with Plough Towers, a retirement center in Germantown, to address an acoustical issue. The center’s large main gathering area suffered terrible noise and echo issues after they removed the carpet. Dean designed, built and managed the install of 20 acoustical panels on the walls that did an incredible job to absorb the sound, so all the elderly residents could use the multi purpose room.

Good morning, Germantown!

If you have been on a walk in your neighborhood this week, you may have encountered some bears. There is no need to fear! We can confirm that these bears are completely harmless.

All over the country, people are placing teddy bears in their windows as an activity for children (and the kids at heart) during the COVID-19 quarantine. If you are looking for a fun activity for the family, take advantage of the sunshine this afternoon and go on a “bear hunt” in your neighborhood. Just remember, if you run into neighbors during your walk, please keep the CDC’s recommended 6 ft social distancing measures in mind.

Pop See Ko 2.0 - Koo Koo Kanga Roo | GoNoodle",18.0,"GoNoodle created a free online resource GoNoodle: Good Energy at Home. It includes premium content and learning materials including movement and mindfulness videos as well as downloadable learning resources and ideas for off-screen activities - and if you sign up for email updates, they plan to send new ideas, activities, and tools to you weekly. There’s also a Good Energy channel on all GoNoodle home apps (iOS, Android, AppleTV, Fire, Roku) where all the best GoNoodle videos can be used by kids directly. Whether it takes the form of a family dance party, a song, and activity that reinforces something kids are learning at school, or a mindfulness or yoga video to help us all relieve stress and get a break from the intensity of it all - let’s all work to create Good Energy with our kids during this stressful time.

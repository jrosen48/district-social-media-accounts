PMHCA and Youth MOVE PA are offering “virtual check-in” zoom meetings to help reduce the sense of social isolation we can experience during this difficult time. One topic that is off-limits is the COVID-19 virus!

The “Adult Virtual Drop-In”, is a topic-driven, social gathering hour that is scheduled twice a week. We would love to discuss many different topics such as our “favorite things” and our “go to coping skills” with whoever wants to join us. Meetings will take place using Zoom on Tuesday and Thursday from 1 pm to 2 pm.

Youth MOVE PA is excited to host a “Youth Virtual Drop-In” that is all about getting some social Interaction. We will be talking about ourselves, what we like, and be discussing a specific topic with each other during each meeting. Our meetings will be hosted every Monday and Friday from 1pm to 2pm on Zoom.

GASD would especially love to hear from Camp Hemlock 1971 alumni. If you were a camper, counselor or teacher from 1971 and are willing to talk about that first camp, be sure to respond.

Help us spread the word by sharing this news with family, friends and coworkers. We look forward to celebrating 50 years of camp with you! #GASDisGreat",2020-02-28 14:46:03,,

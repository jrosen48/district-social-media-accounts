If we have another power interruption tomorrow morning, we will not be able to have school (no internet + no power= no school). Grades 7-12 should log into ECHO (same username and password from last year) to find the zoom login information on their class landing page.

Thank you for your continued efforts as we finish the 2019-20 school year with distance learning. Many families want to know what is going to happen next school year. Right now, we don’t know what COVID-19-related health orders and social distancing will be like in August. That’s why we are creating a plan that includes several scenarios.

Hey guys, during the next few weeks do everything in your powers to lessen the stress on your family by prepping and cooking for family meals. Now, more than ever, food and how that food plays a part in our relationships, plays a massive part of our lives.

A couple of tips:
Don't waste leftovers. Get creative on repurposing. Be inventive; think Chopped. We are going to get a little stir crazy without changes in our daily routine, so try to reinvent some meals. Take over the shopping list duties. It’s a great time to learn how much and what types a food your family normally uses. A tight list will also keep you from going to the store more often.

What is the difference between a bond and an operating levy?

An operating referendum is an election asking voters to provide funds that the district uses to run and operate its schools. An operating levy is for running the educational programs at the school and goes to the district‚Äôs general fund.

Bond levies are for funds that the school district uses for new construction, updates to existing facilities, and other additions to school properties. GFW ran a bond referendum in November 2019 for a building project.

The 2020 referendum is entirely for funds dedicated to learning and addressing the district‚Äôs financial situation.

Graduation is an important milestone in a student‚Äôs academic journey and deserves to be celebrated. However, to protect the health and safety of our communities this year's celebrations must be different. After consulting with the Minnesota Department of Health, we are advising schools against holding in-person graduation and commencement celebrations. Instead, we encourage schools to find ways to celebrate graduates virtually. We know how much students in the class of 2020 have sacrificed this year, and how disappointing it is not to participate in the milestones or traditions they had imagined.

This event will occur at 8pm each Monday by turning on the GHEC football field lights for 20 minutes to represent the all that has happened in the year 2020, and to recognize the senior class of 2020 during the COVID-19 shutdown.
There have been examples of this done nationally and many Minnesota communities and schools are taking part. Although groups are not allowed to gather, please look for the lights in the GHEC community sky as we show support for our kids and look forward to the time when they can get back to school and practice and play again.

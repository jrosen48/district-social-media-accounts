This quilt will be auctioned sometime this school year and the proceeds will go to the Germantown Hills PTO. The quilt hangs in the main entrance of the Elementary School.
Please share this around so as many parents of these children will see it and know about the auction, I do not know the date at this time.
Thank you!!!!",2019-01-28 12:22:50,,

The students at Gibbon are collecting items this year for the Food Pantry. We wanted to stress the act of showing kindness to others in our community. The food pantry will take any items, but shared that there is a higher need for paper products, personal hygiene and baby products. There are collection boxes by the elementary and high school libraries!
Here are the events going on at school the next couple of weeks:
Today is a 1:45 dismissal. The Board of Education will also be meeting at 5:30 today. Please note the change in time.
On Thursday, December 20th, the parent organization will be bringing in a speaker, Bryce Abbey. It should be a great motivator to hear the story of a local Kearney man.

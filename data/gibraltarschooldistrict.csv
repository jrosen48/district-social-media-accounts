With that in mind, we have been able to make the following adjustments in start times in most of our buildings for the 18-19 school year. The middle school start and end times have moved up 8 minutes, and all four elementary schools have been moved up to start 10 minutes earlier than last year. We hope this small change will help families with their after-school activities.",2018-08-10 09:00:01,,

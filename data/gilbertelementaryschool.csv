With profound sadness; Late last night, Forsyth Township Firefighter Ben Lauren was killed in the Line of Duty, fighting a structural fire side by side with his FTFD Family. Ben's Father Ron and Sister Tori are also members of the Department, and we ask that you keep them, the whole Lauren Family, and all of our brave volunteers close in your thoughts and prayers. Ben, a 3rd generation Volunteer Firefighter, via his maternal Grandfather, was born on Flag Day (June 14th) 1996, and attended his first of many UP Firefighter's Tournament six weeks later... He was a proud, dedicated and exceptional member of your Fire Department, and was truly the finest representation of our Community's young people - respected and admired by all who knew him.

Those kids (and their teachers) are worth this!!!

These little Modeltowners who will grow up and be your doctor when you are sick. They will be the ones to fix your car when it breaks down. They will be the ones to help you with your financial planning. They will teach our future children to read and write. They will be the ones to take care of our future.

I was blessed to work at Gilbert, Sawyer, and GMS/GHS, and I can tell you that if anyone can do those things, it's the kids in the Gwinn Schools.

Do this for them! Vote YES!!

Important Athletic Update: First, we've been able to move our high school boys basketball game, originally on 1/30/2020, to FRIDAY, JANUARY 31ST. Also, our Student Council is going to use this week starting on Monday, January 27th as Snow Fest Week which replaces our typical winter homecoming. The week will still include dress-up days along with other activities and a short assembly on Friday. There will also be a dance but we are waiting to hear if the Junior Class will be offering that on Friday night or a different date. Certain things like hall decorating and crowning a king and queen along with assembly games will not take place. Stay tuned and please help to spread the word about the new date for our high school boys basketball game versus Bark River-Harris. GO MODELTOWNERS!",0.0,"Rob Soyring

LOOK! LOOK! Paw Packs has a big announcement!!

Our favorite Dr Buck at Northern Trails was chatting with James Mennell, owner of Biogenic Reagents on an airplane. Next thing I know Mr. Mennell sent our backpack program over $5,000!!!! Only a little over a year ago our program started. I never would have dreamed of such a generous donation. THANK YOU Jim!

This was our first year participating in “Adopt a Senior” for Christmas! The Forsyth Senior Center secret Santa program has 53 seniors adopted this year anonymously receiving gifts from secret Santas from our community. This is an annual event. My class experienced the true spirit of giving by making cards and purchasing gifts along with being involved in their community. I had the project be completely voluntary and many in the class participated. It was a great experience, and I look forward to it next year!",0.0,"Debbie Goldsworthy is with Samantha Upson.

Our Sincere Gratitude!!

Ms. Laliberte's high school senior English class (titled Reading & Writing for the Workplace) was tasked with creating a business in order to help students learn real world skills in preparation for one day entering the workforce. Students chose to develop a business that makes wooden flags. As part of that business, students also decided they wanted to show their appreciation for public safety professionals in the community. As a result, the class, at a planned luncheon, presented the Gilford Fire & Police Departments with career-themed flags.

The police flag, presented to Lt. Dustin Parent and SRO Alyssa Raxter, is now being proudly displayed in SRO Raxter's GHS office.

Everyone at GPD would like to express their sincere gratitude to all the students who participated in creating this project, and for taking the time to recognize local public safety professionals in such a unique manner. We are honored to be a part of the Gilford community!!",0.0,"Gilford Police Department

For the second year in a row, the same 5 male vocalists had the honor of representing GHS at the annual New England Music Festival, held at The Woodstock Academy in Woodstock, CT March 21-23. These five young men, along with 230 other stellar musicians from around NE, spent 2 1/2 days rehearsing their program with nationally known conductors, ending the weekend with incredible performances.

To earn this honor, students have to perform a prepared piece in a Solo & Ensemble Festival in December, earning scores that, if high enough, get them selected for the Concert Festival. Representing Gilford were senior Ryan Witham (4th year), junior Charles Purcell (3rd year) and sophomores Blake Bolduc, Jonathan Buttrick and Chandler Green (all 2nd year).

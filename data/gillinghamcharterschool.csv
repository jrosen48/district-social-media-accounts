At Gillingham Charter all grades study three artists a year - they call it ""Picture Study"" - but with schools being closed, teachers have had to get creative with this part of the curriculum. One of their high school teachers assigned her 10th-12th graders to choose any painting and ""recreate"" it with anything they had at home. The results ranged from students dressing up their pets to recruiting their entire family to dress up like dancers and posing outside. What a great way to keep students engaged!

Today‚Äôs forum sponsored by the AFT - American Federation of Teachers should be about students and their families, but instead it is an audition for a union endorsement for a democratic presidential candidate. #PowerfulParentNetwork PSEA - PA State Education Association 143K Rising",2019-12-14 12:25:49,,

William Wordsworth, 1770 - 1850

I wandered lonely as a Cloud
That floats on high o‚Äôer Vales and Hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host of golden Daffodils;
Beside the Lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the Milky Way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

The waves beside them danced, but they
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:‚Äî
A Poet could not but be gay
In such a jocund company:
I gazed‚Äîand gazed‚Äîbut little thought
What wealth the shew to me had brought:

For oft when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude,
And then my heart with pleasure fills,

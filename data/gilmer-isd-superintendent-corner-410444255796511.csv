Students can park in the following locations (areas marked in blue): Small grass lot near the athletic fieldhouse, new lot (the small lot that is striped already) directly in front of the gym and the first section of baseball/softball parking lot. This should be plenty of spots for our students.

""Is visitor overflow area open for those who do not have a ticket?""

For Gilmer High School students who need work packets:

Due to the low number of students who actually need a hard copy of the school work, along with the vast number of classes we have at the high school, we will try to make this easy to accommodate our students as well as streamline the process for our teachers, staff and parents.

We are currently making hard copies for ELA I and Algebra I only. These two courses will have material available on the bus routes beginning Friday. However, any other student that needs a hard copy can request work by emailing their teacher or emailing Mr. Bowman at bowmanb@gilmerisd.org Mr. Bowman will work with each family on a pickup time and location to help each of you. Any course besides ELA I and Algebra I that you need a hard copy for, please let your teacher or Mr. Bowman know and we will get with each family to have the work ready for you.",4.0,"Brian Bowman

Due to the construction of our new High School, parking on the main campus is very limited this football season. We will be providing shuttle buses to designated parking areas that are fairly close to the high school campus. Please review the map to find these parking areas and designated stops at church parking lots. No Parking is allowed on Scott St. from Bledsoe to Bradford. This street is marked and will be enforced by City Police. I would ask that spectators not park on side streets so the shuttle buses have room to maneuver on their routes. Shuttle buses begin at 6:00 will pass by the designated areas about every 10 minutes. They will begin their routes again when the game concludes. Thank you for your patience.

Due to the construction of our new High School, parking on the main campus is very limited this football season. We will be providing shuttle buses to designated parking areas that are fairly close to the high school campus. Please review the map to find these parking areas and designated stops at church parking lots. No Parking is allowed on Scott St. from Bledsoe to Bradford.

We had a fantastic day in school today. Thank you to all our staff for the hard work that goes into a successful first two days of instruction. A special thank you to our bus drivers and transportation department for exceptional improvement in our afternoon routes. The elementary staff got us off to a great start and we significantly improved our delivery times as well as decreased car pickup time. We will continue to improve through the week as we finalize some overcrowded buses and long routes. A huge thank you to parents for your patience, support and input. Finally, our students have been great both in class and on the buses. I am looking forward to an amazing year in GISD.

The USDA has provided emergency funding for schools to provide free breakfast and lunch meals until December 31, 2020. This will allow the school nutrition program to serve nutritious meals to all students who attend in person classes, at no cost to families. Students who purchased a school lunch September 1-4, 2020 will be issued a credit on their meal accounts.

Regular meal prices will resume in January, 2021, so we strongly encourage families to complete an application for free and reduced meals. Lunch price for elementary and middle school students is $2.15 and $2.30 for high school students. Reduced price lunches are $.40 for all grade levels.

We understand that these are trying times for everyone and are hoping this will relieve some of the financial hardship that is being felt by many in our community.

**GETTING THE WORD OUT TO OUR YOUNGSTERS**
It’s nearly school-time with many preparations underway. Part of those preparations is helping our kids understand the importance of good health practices. Gilmer County Community Paramedicine, with the generosity of Parkside Ellijay Nursing Home, paired together for a fun project this week at our elementary and middle schools.
Supplied with the generous donation of 1,000 face covering masks donated by Parkside, and 1,000 informational flyers in English and Spanish, the Community Paramedicine team visited three of our schools across the county. The team handed out all the masks and 700 of the flyers to students and parents who arrived over the three-day period to collect their end-of 2019 school year belongings.
Many thanks to Michael Feist, Director & Part-Owner of Parkside Ellijay for the wonderful donation of the face covering masks, and to Dr. Shanna Downs, School Superintendent, for allowing our Community Paramedicine team to conduct this very successful service to our school children.",7.0,"Gilmer County Public Safety

Enrique's favorite memory at Gilmer High was when he dead lifted 405lbs. His future plans are to enter the workforce. If he could have done anything different in high school, he would have studied more for Mr. Martin's electricity end of pathway test.

************HAZARDOUS WEATHER NOTICE************

*****WE'RE ASKING THAT OUR READERS TAKE THIS INFORMATION VERY SERIOUSLY*****

The National Weather Service will be issuing a SIGNIFICANT FLOOD WARNING - by their own admission, a rare occurrence from their office.

The first of several waves of rain is underway across North GA this morning. Rain will shift southward across parts of Central GA this afternoon & evening. Isolated non-severe storms are possible. The highest rainfall totals thru early Tuesday AM will be across North GA.

Unfortunately, the most significant rainfall and danger will be during the overnight hours. Persons living on creeks and rivers should find a way to monitor their surroundings frequently, and be prepared to evacuate. Have a plan!

Remember - if you encounter water on streets and highways, do not attempt to cross unless you already know it is safe to do so. Don't drown - Turn around!",9.0,"Gilmer County Public Safety

Our current timeline is to review the pandemic and make a decision on September 1, 2020 about how we will proceed with teaching and learning. The decision will be one of the following options:

continue with 100% Remote Learning Program or
change to a 25%/75% Hybrid Learning Program or
change to a 100% In-person Learning Program

If a decision is made to change the current learning plan, the implementation of the new plan will begin on September 8, 2020. The Gilpin Online Learning program through CDLS/Edentum stays in place for the entire school year.

The September 1 decision needs parent input and the important data you provide via the survey will be considered for the learning program decision-making. Complete the survey by August 26 or as soon as possible.

Hello everyone! My name is John Paul DiMauro. I have kept very busy during my high school years. I have really enjoyed exploring the arts via the plays our amazing school has put on over the last multiple years. I have been a behind the scenes assistant and enjoyed enriching my life with all the experiences and person to person interactions this has allowed me.

I have also participated in baseball and football during my 4 years at Gilpin. The friendships and team bonding are things I will take with me into my future and will never forget. I started Warren Tech at Red Rocks for autobody work while still in high school and very much appreciate that opportunity provided by our school.

After high school, I plan to continue with that line of training to eventually obtain a job in the same field. Gilpin has successfully provided me with the tools I need to become successful as I move forward in life. Thank you to all my teachers and family for supporting me and pushing me to be my best.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2529740637291237&id=1904170226514951,,0.0,"Congratulations Class of 2020!

We held an unconventional gift give away via a webex video call where we randomly selected senior names out of one bag and numbers out of another bag, each correlating to a gift. Although we know this does not make up for missing a crucial time of their high school careers, it was a reminder of the care and support the community has for these seniors.

Noelle Arrington is excited and relieved to have finished her senior year relatively unscathed, after what turned out to be a challenging year at a completely new school. It's not something she recommends, but she is grateful for the chance to face her fears head-on and overcome them. She would like to thank the teachers and fellow students who helped her to feel included and accepted into this amazing and tight-knit community.

Noelle will be attending the University of Utah in the Fall (though possibly taking a gap year to explore the world first), and will be studying her lifelong love of Video Game Design, with a minor in Animation Studies. Noelle has always been a determined and dedicated student, multi-talented in the areas of music, art, science, and engineering, and we wish her luck and success in her future endeavors.

I have truly enjoyed my time at Gilpin. I have been blessed to be at Gilpin since preschool.

While at Gilpin I have participated in 8 years of the school play. I have always looked forward to the school plays, and I am so glad that I got to be a part of them. I want to thank my friends, family, and teachers for helping me all these years. I also want to thank Mr. and Mrs. Raynes for helping cultivate my love of theater. They have been wonderful role models for me.

I plan to take a year off and get a job and enjoy life after quarantine. My plan after that is to attend Western Colorado University to pursue film studies.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2523471491251485&id=1904170226514951,,0.0,"Congratulation Class of 2020!

While at Gilpin I participated in volleyball, basketball, and track all four years of school (if you count the beginning of the season).

Outside of school, I am usually pretty busy working as a lifeguard and seasonal sports official at the Gilpin County rec center. I have valued my involvement in athletics the most out of my four years because of the friendships and memories that were made and I will carry with me. My other hobbies in my free time include camping with my family and traveling.

I will be attending the University of Nebraska-Lincoln next fall as a Ruth Leverton scholar. I will be studying business administration and marketing. While I am not sure what I “want to be” yet I know my areas of study will open many doors for me and my interests of leadership, networking, and creativity.

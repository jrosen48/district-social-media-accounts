Students and teachers will not be able to log into the platform to join any scheduled Zoom classes. As an alternative, students should log-in to their Google Classrooms throughout the day to access lessons that can be completed independently.

GUSD will be in regular communication with staff and families as we receive updates from Zoom, including when access to the platform has been fully restored.

Direct any questions you may have about Zoom outages to questions@gilroyunified.org. Direct any questions you have about independent lessons during the outage to your child's teacher(s).

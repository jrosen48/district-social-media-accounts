On July 1, 2020, the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Health announced an order requiring universal face coverings.

Schools should provide face covering breaks throughout the day. Maintain a distance of 6 feet during these face covering breaks. Schools may allow students to remove their face covering when students are:

1. Eating or drinking when spaced at least 6 feet apart;
2. Seated at desks or assigned work spaces at least 6 feet apart; or
3. Engaged in an activity at least 6 feet apart (e.g. face covering breaks, recess, etc.)
4. When wearing a face covering creates an unsafe condition in which to operate equipment or execute a task.

‚ÄúFace covering‚Äù means a covering of the nose and mouth that is secured to the head with ties, straps, or loops over the ears or is wrapped around the lower face. A ‚Äúface covering‚Äù can be made of a variety of synthetic or natural fabrics, including cotton, silk or linen, and, for purposes of the order, can include a plastic face shield that covers the nose and mouth.

Assignments from the second learning module that will be sent to students on April 6, 2020 will be due on Sunday, April 19, 2020. This gives families extended flexibility and students two weeks to complete the required assignments. As always there will be optional enrichment learning opportunities included in the module.
Our last day of school will be June 5, 2020. Graduation plans are being discussed across all school districts in Erie County. We are still watching carefully the success of mitigation efforts in Erie County as we develop a plan for graduation.

Introducing Ms. Antonella Spinelli, Business/Career Teacher at Girard High School. Ms. Spinelli has been with the GSD for 27 years, three of which she taught at RAMS.

She has two children- AJ and Gabriella. Ms. Spinelli enjoys working out, watching the Steelers, reading and cooking.

A fun fact about Ms. Spinelli- she is first generation Italian/American. Her parents were born and raised in Italy, got married and moved to Glassport, PA. The majority of her family still live in Italy. Ms. Spinelli spoke fluent Italian in her younger years.

When asked why she enjoys working for the GSD: My job at the GSD has evolved to a position where I am able to help kids make important decisions on their futures! It is fulfilling when they are excited about their future. I have been able to make many connections with the community in my job and bring many career experiences to the schools. The best part of the job is when graduates express how much I have helped prepare them for success!

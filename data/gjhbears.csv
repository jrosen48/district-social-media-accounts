Today Gause ISD said goodbye to Beverly Renner♡

Mrs. Renner has always had a passion for nature, animals (especially horses), science and children. She felt teaching would allow her to combine all her passions. She graduated from Texas A&M in 1987 and taught 33 years in public education. Mrs. Renner began teaching in Gause in 1990. During her 30 years at Gause ISD, she taught third grade for 12 years. Some of you may remember her dressing up as “Viola Swamp”. Mrs. Renner taught all subjects in third grade, but her passion was science. The superintendent asked her if she would like to teach all the elementary science classes and she eagerly agreed. She has taught k-5th science for 20 years and loves getting kids excited about science. Mrs. Renner has taught two generations of students at Gause School.

Mrs. Renner has been married to her husband, Larry, for 33 years. She has two stepsons, a daughter, and four grandchildren.

We will all miss her very much and hope she comes back to visit often. Today we shared laughs and tears as we said our goodbyes♡♡♡",0.0,"Gause ISD

Dear Gause ISD Community:

Awards day will be a ""drive thru"" celebration of you and our students. We will hand out awards on Friday, May 22nd from 9am to 1pm. Please see the attached map with a route to follow. Mr. Jones will be at the front of the route to help with traffic. Feel free to travel the entire route with your children. However, if you want to exit the route early, follow the red arrow through the gate. If you only have JH students and don't want to travel the entire route, feel free to advance straight to the JH grades. If you have any questions, please let us know. We are looking forward to seeing you all Friday!",0.0,"Gause ISD

Since we are all quarantined at the house and home schooling, with the help of our wonderful teachers, now would be the perfect time to practice an at home fire drill with our familys.
Make an escape plan, have a designated spot to meet up far away from the house. Be sure to check and change the batteries on your smoke alarms, check your fire extinguishers and always close all doors in the house. Closing doors slows the spread of fire, protects lives and belongings. Don't forget, 2 ways to exit at all times .

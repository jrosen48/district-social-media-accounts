MHES celebrated Literacy Week to show our students all the adventures that a book can take them on. Students and teachers read their favorite books, dressed up as vocabulary words, taught others a fun fact from a non-fiction book and went a booknic. We even had some special guest readers entertain us with fantastic storytelling skills.

Ms. Noreen Berden and Ms. Katlyn Woodruff from the Hendry and Glades Soil & Water Conservation Districts were recent visitors at West Glades School. Students in Mrs. Huysman's library classes had a lesson about honeybees and were able to have a presentation from these ladies about pollination. Information was also given about the poster contest ""Where would we BEE without Pollinators"". All students wishing to participate in the poster contest will be provided with posterboard from their office. Additionally, WGS has been provided with a Book Barn that is on loan during the duration of this project. It features many resource books that can be used as students research pollination. At the end of the presentation, all students were provided with honey stix in order to sample the delicious treat.

Our 3rd Grade students and teachers participated in America Recycles Day by completing a service learning project called Playground Cleanup! Students went around MHES grounds and collected as much trash as they could find. Students were able to collect 29 pounds of trash! They learned all about the effects of plastic pollution on our environment.

Third Grade would love to challenge other grades to participate over the next few months and see if they can collect more trash than them!",2.0,"Moore Haven Elementary School

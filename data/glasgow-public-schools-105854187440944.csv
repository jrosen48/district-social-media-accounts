Montana has distributed more than $20 million in federal aid to keep school-aged children fed during pandemic. State health and education officials are urging more families to apply for nutrition assistance.
Montana families who lost access to free or reduced-price school meals due to school closures during the 2019-2020 school year have about a month left to apply for money to help repay the costs of meals.
The federal Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer, or P-EBT program, launched earlier this year in response to COVID-19. It offers a one-time-only reimbursement of $330 per school-aged child/per household.
Montana health and education department officials say over 61,000 children in the state have benefitted from the program. They say thousands more are likely eligible. To qualify, children must attend schools that participate in the National School Lunch program.

Case Investigation involves working with a patient (symptomatic and asymptomatic) who has been diagnosed with an infectious disease to identify and provide support to people (contacts) who may have been infected through exposure to the patient.

This process prevents further transmission of disease by separating people who have (or may have) an infectious disease from people who do not.

The OPI and Office of Commissioner of Higher Education (OCHE) announced Montana juniors will have the opportunity to take the ACT free of charge this coming fall semester of their senior year. The alternative testing dates for these students will be on October 6th (initial) and October 20th (makeup).

Fall test date scores will be in time for the MUS admissions (i.e., ~3–8 weeks after the test date). Fall testing only has the paper option and all accommodations will be rolled over from the spring 2020 student data file.
Students can test on national days in June and July at their own expense unless they qualify for the economic voucher (e.g., F/R eligibility).",0.0,"Glasgow High School Counseling Page

The only people who you are physically close to at any time and for any reason are the people who live in the same house. Do not get together with friends for any reason – everyone needs to stay home unless going out is essential. Essential means to get groceries, care for an elderly person by delivering groceries or a meal, or going to work at a job that is essential to the community.

Parents – your teens need to stay home with you and connect through their social media or online games. You need to say “no” when they want to get together with friends or any social group. All gatherings are discouraged! Our state will also have a “shelter in place” order if the virus increases in numbers as it has in Washington and in New York.

Today I hosted a call with Montana press to provide an update on Montana's four positive COVID-19 cases and share additional response efforts.

I’m pleased to report that all four patients are at home and recovering.

The state lab is performing testing 7 days a week.

I amended Montana's state of emergency to align the effective timeframe with the federal state of emergency announced by the President. This means that our state’s emergency response will be in effect as long as necessary to allow us to continue to mobilize state resources.

I can’t stress enough the importance of the role of the public in helping us mitigate the impact of this virus. The small sacrifices we make now – missing out on a cancelled event, avoiding crowds and enjoying time with small groups of healthy family and friends, and staying home if you feel sick – means keeping more folks healthy in the long run.",2.0,"Governor Steve Bullock

As we move into post season and after recognizing our seniors, we would like to spotlight one of our GHS Alumni who is currently cheering at the collegiate level for Minot State University. McKenna Gagne, a 2017 Glasgow Graduate, had this to say when asked what cheerleading means to her;

""To me, cheerleading doesn’t mean standing on the sidelines and waving pom poms around. What it means to me is a strong work ethic and learning physical endurance. Most importantly however, cheerleading means representing something bigger than yourself. I learned this during my time as a GHS cheerleader. I cheered for all 4 years of high school and during those four years I learned a lot. However, being a GHS cheerleader taught me two very important life skills; leadership and self discipline. During my time there I also grew confidence and began to figure out what it meant to show pride in everything you do. I’m thankful to have had GHS cheer as a background before coming to Minot State.""

***This post is outdated***

A cold frontal passage will bring colder temperatures to NE Montana for Wednesday and Wednesday night. Beforehand, look for a rain snow mix late this afternoon changing to all snow by this evening. Most places will see 1 to 2 inches with snow covered roads and reduced visibility as the primary impacts. A few locations such as the Big Sheep Mountains may come in a little higher. Over the Little Rockies, several inches of snow are possible, along with strong west winds becoming north. As a result of the combination of snow along with strong, gusty winds, near blizzard conditions are possible over the Little Rockies with slippery road conditions and very low visibility. This is where the greatest level of impact will likely be from this event. Other effects from this system will be bitter cold wind chills, near 20 below at times along the Canadian border by Wednesday morning. Keep in mind that these harsh winter conditions can also stress newborn livestock, so take any precautions necessary as this winter weather approaches.",0.0,"US National Weather Service Glasgow Montana

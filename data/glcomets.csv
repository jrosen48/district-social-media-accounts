To Students, Parents, and the Grand Ledge Community,

This past weekend, I posted a statement on FB.

I am deeply sorry for the statement that I posted. As the leader of a school district that seeks to encourage diversity and be welcoming to all, my words fell far short. I did not take into account the historic inequities that have characterized race relations in our nation for generations – and for that, I am sincerely sorry!

I have informed the board that I plan on enrolling in a diversity and/or cultural awareness and sensitivity class to help me grow so that I may better respond in the future.

For future planning, I know that I have learned from this. I look forward to hearing from those in the community that have expressed concern, and listening to them, and to become a better leader by reflecting on my actions.

Brian L. Metcalf, Ph.D / Superintendent of Schools

To Students, Parents, and the Grand Ledge Community,

This past weekend, I posted a statement on FB.

I am deeply sorry for the statement that I posted. As the leader of a school district that seeks to encourage diversity and be welcoming to all, my words fell far short. I did not take into account the historic inequities that have characterized race relations in our nation for generations – and for that, I am sincerely sorry!

I have informed the board that I plan on enrolling in a diversity and/or cultural awareness and sensitivity class to help me grow so that I may better respond in the future.

For future planning, I know that I have learned from this. I look forward to hearing from those in the community that have expressed concern, and listening to them, and to become a better leader by reflecting on my actions.

Brian L. Metcalf, Ph.D / Superintendent of Schools

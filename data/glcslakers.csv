A Sheriff’s deputy will lead the Drive from Myles Kimmerly Park on Burdickville Road to Old Settlers Park on Dunns Farm Road, and a school bus will act as the caboose signaling the end of the parade.

Choose a spot to park along the route, and please practice safe distancing at all times and remain in your vehicles.

We encourage everyone to decorate cars, wave signs, use noise makers, play music, display Laker pride, and just celebrate our Seniors from the safety of your vehicles with as much pizzazz as possible.

Pick-up at the DOJO doors (Bus drop off) will be from 9 - 12:00 noon on both days for all SECONDARY students/parents who wish to pick up belongings.

In order to practice safe socially distancing, we will ask everyone to remain in their vehicles while belongings are delivered to you at the curb.

To participate in the fun challenge, all you have to do is go outside, sing a song, and then post the video and challenge your friends. Make sure to write the title of the challenge in your video description (OUTDOOR SINGING CHALLENGE) and add the new hashtag (#SingOutside) We would love for you to post your own video and share it to Facebook, Instagram, etc. It takes 5 minutes, it's easy, and fun.

This week the 5th grade-12th grade choir and music students have been challenged to a new social media challenge. The project is an enjoyable way to get us all singing, which naturally reduces cortisol and boosts endorphins.

To participate in the fun challenge, all you have to do is go outside, sing a song, and then post the video and challenge your friends. Make sure to write the title of the challenge in your video description (OUTDOOR SINGING CHALLENGE) and add the new hashtag (#SingOutside) We would love for you to post your own video and share it to Facebook, Instagram, etc. It takes 5 minutes, it's easy, and fun.

Let's all get creative and enjoy!",2020-04-13 12:18:57,https://video-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/93545737_220038619250544_8536029054468358144_n.mp4?_nc_cat=107&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=BwuniOafUFkAX_5cUx5&_nc_ht=video-atl3-1.xx&oh=48d61e6f097ba46c1b5081d585ad1169&oe=5F5E30B7,

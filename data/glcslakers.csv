A Sheriff‚Äôs deputy will lead the Drive from Myles Kimmerly Park on Burdickville Road to Old Settlers Park on Dunns Farm Road, and a school bus will act as the caboose signaling the end of the parade.

Choose a spot to park along the route, and please practice safe distancing at all times and remain in your vehicles.

We encourage everyone to decorate cars, wave signs, use noise makers, play music, display Laker pride, and just celebrate our Seniors from the safety of your vehicles with as much pizzazz as possible.

Please note that this Senior Drive is not intended to replace Commencement, which is still tentatively scheduled to occur outdoors on school campus on June 27. More to follow on that later.

We encourage everyone to decorate cars, wave signs, use noise makers, play music, display Laker pride, and just celebrate our Seniors from the safety of your vehicles with as much pizzazz as possible.

Please note that this Senior Drive is not intended to replace Commencement, which is still tentatively scheduled to occur outdoors on school campus on June 27. More to follow on that later.

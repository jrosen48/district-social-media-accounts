• Parent letter (http://www.grisd.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Arena_Scheduling_Letter-rev-04182020-2.pdf)

Career Development Events build on what is learned in agricultural classes and encourage members to put their knowledge into practice. These events are designed to help a member prepare for a career in agriculture by testing and challenging the student's technical, leadership, interpersonal and teamwork skills as well as their knowledge of the subject matter.

Many thanks to Mr. Bates and Mr. Hulbert who came today with Glenbard East students. Those students are also Marquardt alumni and spoke with our Serving Society students about what to expect in high school. Some of their recommendations were:
• Be Yourself
• Get involved
• Take honors classes
• Choose your friends wisely
• Don’t fall behind
• Take part in the mentoring program
• Get connected to your teachers
• If you’re an ELL student put your heart into learning
• Befriend a social worker; they’re full of great advice
• You don’t have to have it all figured out
• Schedule time for your school work
• Don’t waste your freshman year. All grades matter. Not working hard as a freshman is kicking my butt as a senior.

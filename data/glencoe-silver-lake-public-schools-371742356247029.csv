We will have our pep band playing, the panther association will be selling food, and the National Guard will have their climbing wall set up. Please keep in mind, there is a 40lb weight limit requirement for kids to participate on the climbing wall. We will also have some games/activities set up and all proceeds will go towards the ""Randy Shaver Tackle Cancer"" fundraiser.
Please come out and check out the different booths/displays and games as well as socializing with fellow GSL'ers! We hope everyone will stop by and enjoy the event and then stay to cheer on the Panther's football team vs Litchfield!",2017-10-16 14:34:21,,

September 8 at 7:08 PM · Glen Ellyn, IL ·

The main construction phase of Andrew's Eagle Scout project happened this past weekend. Over two days, he led a team of Troop 41 scouts, friends (including a Troop 45 scout), and scouting dads to build out a sensory garden in a courtyard at Abraham Lincoln Elementary School in Glen Ellyn.

The work included putting down concrete steppers, excavating an area for a zen garden, laying out a sitting area, and sinking several huge pots for herbs. Lots of digging, soil movement, and mulch spreading was involved.

Thanks to everyone who helped out!",0.0,"Thank you to D41 School Board member Ted Estes!

This Week's lunch schedule is as follows at the same locations curbside.

Monday-CLOSED HOLIDAY

Tuesday- One meal

Wednesday- Two meals

Friday- One meal

Next week back to the normal schedule of Monday/Wednesday/Friday. The state approved this type of delivery of meals through the end of July. However, we may have to go to one site at some point. We are hoping not, but wanted to give parents a heads up should we have to.

Thank you and have a great day

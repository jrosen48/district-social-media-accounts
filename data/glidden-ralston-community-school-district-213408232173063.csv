Due to circumstances around covid-19 and increases in Carroll County and surrounding counties there will not be flag football this season. With mitigations trying to limit cross class interaction it would be very difficult to monitor this in this setting. So we are sorry we will not be able to offer flag football this year. We know this is a great time for the younger grades as well as the high school kids. There are just too many factors and regulations that already go into high school sports to try to do it at the youth level.

GR teachers are spending time not only providing learning opportunities for their students but also taking time to delve into their professional learning. All teachers are taking an AEA online course focusing on Emergency Learning through online teaching. This course was specifically designed to assist teachers in providing learning to their students in an online setting. Teachers are also spending time aligning their Iowa Core Standards to their curriculum for each course/subject area they teach. This helps our district keep track of what students are learning at each grade level.

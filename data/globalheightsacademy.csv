Michiganders, TODAY WE VOTE! Some more key items to remember:

üó≥ Michigan has same day voter registration.

üó≥ Because this is a statewide primarily, you can ONLY vote in one party section.

üó≥ Polls are open from 7am to 8pm. If you‚Äôre in line by 8pm, you are able to vote.

üó≥ Voters with absent voter ballots at their homes should bring them to their local election clerk‚Äôs office or drop box prior to 8 p.m. on Tuesday. Voters should not place them in the mail at this point, as they will not arrive by 8 p.m. Tuesday and would therefore not be counted. You can find your local clerk‚Äôs location and contact information at Michigan.gov/Vote. A list of ballot drop boxes is at Michigan.gov/SOS.

Please remember to wear your üò∑ and practice social-distancing when you get out the vote. Stay safe & thank you for voting! üá∫üá∏",0.0,"Go out and Vote today!!!

As you probably already know, this morning Gov. Whitmer issued a Stay Home-Stay Safe order. We wanted to update what this means for the schools.

1. Schools will now be closed THROUGH April 13. We were planning to return that day due to Spring Break, but now are scheduled to return Tuesday, April 14. Obviously, that could change as the situation evolves.

2. Free meal distributions will continue during the shelter-in-place period. Providing food is an ‚Äúessential service.‚Äù

3. Our e-Learning will continue. While current state law says the learning cannot count as ‚Äúseat time,‚Äù Gov. Whitmer has clarified that ‚Äúdoes not mean that school work done during the mandatory school closure won‚Äôt 'count' toward grades, credits, or graduation.‚Äù (Teachers and students are still officially scheduled for spring break from April 6-10, so there might be a week off during your weeks off.)

Wow! The generosity of our donors continues to amaze and blow us away. The first picture is of Jenny Allen from Rube's Steakhouse. She picked up the donated meat from Iowa Premium Beef in Tama and dropped off the beef to us. ❤️

The second picture was taken by Erin Murty (Ag Teacher at GMG schools). She coordinated this donation with Jon Surman- General Manager/VP from Iowa Premium in Tama (he is in the black jacket) and with the Mid Iowa Youth Beef Team (thus the youth). They arrived a few minutes later with a second donation from GMG Schools of 160# frozen beef from the school. Rob and Dawn from food service received this donation on behalf of IVH.

Hello!

My name is Madysen Wall. I am an Iowa State University Graduate, with a degree in Family and Consumer Sciences Education, as well as my Health Endorsement. I love traveling, trying new things, baking, reading, and watching documentaries. My family loves to be outside, so in the summertime, we spend lots of time camping and boating. I also love music, so concerts and live music are another favorite pastime for me. One of the many reasons I became an FCS Teacher is that I have a strong passion for helping students succeed. I want to be a positive influence and role model for my students. I also believe that FCS consists of the basic life skills that everyone will use throughout a lifetime.

I am so excited to be joining GMG Secondary School. In addition to teaching, I will also be joining as Football Cheer Coach and FCCLA Sponsor. I look forward to meeting all of my students and their families, and I look forward to creating a classroom where students feel at home!

Mrs. Bradley will be teaching math and serve as our Activities Director starting with the 2020-2021 school year.

Hi - My name is Michelle Bradley. I am the mother of three beautiful daughters, 29, 26, and 24. I have three amazing grandkids, 7 and 5 year old boys and a 10 month old girl. I married my high school sweetheart 31 years ago. (Whoa!) I’m so excited to be a part of the GMG Community. My two passions have come together: teaching math and being an Activities Director. I am looking forward to meeting you all!!",2020-04-09 12:43:40,,

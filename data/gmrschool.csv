Update on the new trail shelter - the Greenbush-Middle River School students have finished the exterior and it‚Äôs headed to Central Boiler tomorrow to have the interior and floor spray foamed. It‚Äôs looking great!

To top it off, we have a fancy new sign donated by Kofstad Signs , in remembrance of a valued, loved club member and longtime Angle resident Bonnie Vickaryous.

The shelter will be placed in the next few weeks. We‚Äôll have a final post on location when that happens. Thank you for all of your support!",0.0,"Northwest Angle Edge Riders

Our 2020 Summer Reading Challenge is set to begin July 1!

The challenge is for all Gilbertsville-Mount Upton students in Pre-Kindergarten to Fifth Grade to read (or be read aloud to) for at least 20 minutes, five days per week.

Students must fill out a calendar to record their reading each week. You may print out the two calendar pages from the attached document, create your own paper calendar/recording sheet, or pick up a packet in the main office.

Students will return their completed calendars on the first day of school or submit them to Lauren Weidman virtually. Our Reading Celebration may have to look a little different this fall, but we’ll still have something amazing for the students!

If you have any questions, please email lweidman@gmucsd.org.

Gilbertsville-Mount Upton thanks “The Mask Factory,” a group of nine women who made facemasks for all of our students to wear!

Nancy Callahan, Liz Campion, Joann Curtis, Michele Farwell, Kathryn Gibson, Barbara Pistor, Carrie Mae Smith, Liz Stebbins and Teresa Winchester started “The Mask Factory” about six weeks ago. Since then, they’ve created nearly 1,000 facemasks for EMT workers, the Office for the Aging, Chase Memorial Nursing Home & Rehab, the Butternut Food Pantry, family members, friends and now, our GMU students!

Materials for the GMU project were purchased following a successful community fundraiser. Three weeks later, “The Mask Factory” delivered 346 facemasks to the school and $900 to the food pantry, all to the delight of Superintendent Annette Hammond and her staff.

GMU will distribute the masks to students soon, so stay tuned!

Gilbertsville-Mount Upton thanks “The Mask Factory,” a group of nine women who made facemasks for all of our students to wear!

Nancy Callahan, Liz Campion, Joann Curtis, Michele Farwell, Kathryn Gibson, Barbara Pistor, Carrie Mae Smith, Liz Stebbins and Teresa Winchester started “The Mask Factory” about six weeks ago. Since then, they’ve created nearly 1,000 facemasks for EMT workers, the Office for the Aging, Chase Memorial Nursing Home & Rehab, the Butternut Food Pantry, family members, friends and now, our GMU students!

Materials for the GMU project were purchased following a successful community fundraiser. Three weeks later, “The Mask Factory” delivered 346 facemasks to the school and $900 to the food pantry, all to the delight of Superintendent Annette Hammond and her staff.

GMU will distribute the masks to students soon, so stay tuned!

Darin Trass’ second-graders are certainly keeping busy in finding new ways to learn at home while school is closed!

Henry worked with his brother, Gavin, to make a sled for those snowy days that are hopefully behind us for a while. The two also made a cat condo. Can you see the cat eating food on the bottom level?

Melena submitted a report on mole salamanders, after she and her grandpa found some a few weeks ago.

Melena wrote the following, complete with illustrations: “If you have a mole salamander and you have nothing to feed it, go outside and find worms and termites and grubs. If you have nothing to put your mole salamander in, make your own. Ask your mom for a jar. Find some leaves; they have to be moist.

“If you want to go outside and grab sticks, break the ends of it. If your mole salamander is in it already, take it out and build the bed like this (see drawing). Put the jar in the dark. I am going to show you what a salamander looks like (see drawing).”

Great job, kids! Keep up the good work!

GMU Teacher Darin Trass recently shared these pics of the latest remote-learning creations from his second-graders.

Kaidyn helped make dinner, adding ingredients and placing chicken nuggets where he thought they belonged. He's been a big helper with his brother's homework and around the house.

Hogan writes: “This is my LEGO Dodge Challenger Demon! It took me two days to build. It was a Lego kit. I built it by following the directions.”

Great job, Kaidyn and Hogan!

For the last three months, GMU Art students in grades 7-12 have been designing clay tiles.
They chose to create endangered-animal tiles on one board and tiles for plants/flowers on another.
Our wonderful custodians then made wooden ""carts"" to show off our finished tiles, which will be displayed in our school entrance for a year or so.
Well done, artists!!!!!!

Congratulations to students of Karen Hill and Debra Davies, who recently completed the Binghamton Devils’ Read To The Rink program by reading at least five books apiece!

The AHL team sent its mascot, Devil Dawg, and a guest reader to Gilbertsville-Mount Upton on Tuesday to celebrate. Each GMU first-grader received a free ticket to a B-Devils home game as a reward for reading.

GMU thanks the Binghamton Devils for promoting literacy and helping our students to get excited about reading!

Gilbertsville-Mount Upton’s Backpack Program will have plenty to share this year thanks to the Sidney Elks Lodge #2175s’ Club #2175.

Elks’ Club representatives Sharon Harris and Marge Johnson stopped by this morning to drop off brand new clothing, boots, sneakers, toiletries and other items for our Backpack Program, which benefits students in our district.

Sharon (center) and Marge joined GMU Librarian and Backpack Program Coordinator Raquel Norton (right) for a quick pic in the library after making the donation, made possible by a $2,000 grant that Harris solicited from the Elks National Foundation. The grant also will be used to help students at Sidney Central School District and Bainbridge-Guilford Central School.

Gilbertsville-Mount Upton students got their first crack at sprucing up Miss Hughes' old Toyota USA Camry on Monday as we prepare the vehicle for next month's Sanfilippo Smash 4.

Our pre-kindergarten kids clearly enjoyed a hands-on experience before Mr. Cimineri's sixth-graders added original designs to the paint job. We'll keep you up to date on the progress of this super-cool project taking place by the flagpole near our front entrance.

Joey Utter of the Certified Auto Outlet - Oneonta NY will drive the car during the Sanfilippo Smash 4, a demolition-derby fundraiser scheduled for a noon start October 5 at the Otsego County Fair (Morris, NY). The event raises money to help find the cure for Sanfilippo Syndrome, a rare genetic condition that causes fatal brain damage.

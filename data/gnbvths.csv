Jessica Dodge, RN was a Greater New Bedford Regional Vocational Technical High School student when she earned her Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) license.

She took her education a step further by pursuing her Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree through the UMass Dartmouth College of Nursing and Health Sciences.

Her Freshman year she began working in St. Luke's Progressive Care Unit (PCU) as a CNA where she worked for three years.

After passing The National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX-RN® exam) Jessica received a position on our Medical Surgical Unit where she has been a nurse since!

""I just made one year here as a nurse last week! I decided to pursue nursing because my mother was a CNA while raising me. She put herself through nursing school and always inspired me to want to help others,"" says Jessica.

We recently sent out a survey to the seniors of two plans for graduation this year.

Option 1: The school would hold four (4) separate graduation ceremonies that day recognizing each Academy. This plan can only move forward if health guidelines allow for events of 300-400 people as our plan involves both students and two (2) adults to join them. The ceremony would be held outside on the football field as originally planned and we are looking at live streaming capabilities to reach others at home.

Option 2: A drive-through ceremony that will be held at the back of the school grounds at the end of June.

After receiving 460 responses (70.9%), the overwhelming majority voted for Option 1. This is of course under the understanding that either of these options must be compliant with social distancing and health guidelines.

Answering the census is COMPLETELY CONFIDENTIAL. In 1982, the U.S. Supreme Court confirmed that even addresses are confidential and cannot be disclosed through legal discovery or the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). In 2010, the U.S. Justice Department determined that the Patriot Act does not override the law that protects the confidentiality of individual census responses.

We collected a five gallon bucket’s worth of trash in just a few minutes today along the street and beach in front of our building. Most of this would have ended up in the ocean! Do what you can to reduce/reuse/recycle and prevent marine debris!

Come and see what we’ve done with some other marine debris tonight at AHA! New Bedford’s Earth Day Eve Procession at 5pm. We’ll also be showing off the marine trash skimmer going into NB harbor in conjunction with Port of New Bedford and Clean Ocean Access. #beoceanfriendly",0.0,"Community Boating Center

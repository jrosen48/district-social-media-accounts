This winter has been anything but typical and Carson City-Crystal will definitely be making- up snow days this year. The question is how many. Our district currently has missed 15 days of learning. With that stated CC-C will be adding back a day of instruction on President's Day, which was originally a scheduled Professional Development Day for Teachers. To reiterate ALL students are to report for school on Monday the 18th of February. All departments, including transportation, will be running as usual. Additionally, Carson City-Crystal will need to extend the school year to meet the state required days and hours. We are confident that will at least include the first week of June, the 3rd through the 7th. Hopefully, by communicating this news now it will allow everyone the opportunity adjust accordingly.

Although this is not the scenario we wanted to deal with, it’s what Mother Nature threw our way. After looking at several factors we believe we have found a solution.

We will have our Winterfest King and Queen announcement on February 26 during the JV/Varsity Girls Basketball game against Montabella and then have our Winterfest Dance on March 9th.

I understand this whole situation is not ideal, but it is the best under the circumstances of scheduled events for the next four Saturdays. We want all parties involved to have a memorable experience and wouldn’t want students to have to choose between events.

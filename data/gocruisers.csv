During my 24 years in education, I never thought as a superintendent, I would be running a school district from a laptop, nor did I ever think that public education would go 100% online. I cannot express my gratitude to the staff of Groveport Madison Local Schools more. They have taken this situation head-on without complaint. They have worked tirelessly for our students and the community. WE APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU! Thank you for your creativity, service, gratitude, and teamwork! #IGTBAC",,,

Check out this awesome art project from 8th graders in Mrs. Gorman’s 1st semester Art class! They recently completed Human Figure Sculptures. They learned about spacial awareness, installation art and how to show movement and fluidity in art. Students were also challenged to think outside the box in regards to materials used in making art, how to work as a team, problem solving and thinking in 3D terms.",4.0,"We have incredibly talented and creative art teachers who know how to bring out the best in our students.

Reina Rhone (GMHS Class of 2019) is excelling at Heidelberg University, where she is taking ""a lot"" of history classes, playing basketball, and enjoying making memories with new friends! She is especially grateful for the AP United States History class she took her senior year, as it prepared her quite well for her college history courses.

We are so very proud of this EITW Scholarship recipient who hopes to come back to the Groveport Madison School District as a teacher and basketball coach!

In a continued effort to provide our teachers and staff with the precious time needed to serve our face-to-face and virtual students, we have made some additional, minor updates to the school calendar. After receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback about the additional Professional Development day in August, we began to explore ways to find more time. With these updates, the calendar has changed from 173 instructional days to 170. However, with this additional time to plan and work, we believe that this change will be greatly beneficial to both our students and teachers.

We appreciate our community's continued patience and support navigating through this school year!

Here are the changes:
8/21 - Instructional Day to Staff Development Day/Student Holiday
9/25 - Half Instructional Day to Staff Development Day/Student Holiday
10/30 - Instructional Day to Half Instructional Day

We had a great first week back and we are so proud of our students and parents for helping it be such a success while following our new COVID-19 safety protocols. After living through our protocols and procedures for a week, we have learned a lot, and we felt we needed to make a change.

Beginning Wednesday, August 12th, all Godley ISD students (PK-12) will be required to wear a facial cover (mask, face shield, etc.). This decision was not an easy one to make, nor was it made lightly. However, we feel that this decision is in the best interest of our students and staff.

The entire community of Godley is invited to the Godley Class of 2020 Cap and Gown Pick Up Parade this Friday, April 24 beginning at 10 am! The parade will take place in the parking areas of the Middle and High School. We will also stream it on Facebook Live so those around can watch and see. Finally, we will unveil our Top 10% for the 2020 graduating class. We will write the rank number on the windshield for our Top 10%.

Our desire is to line the short parade route with friends and family showing appreciation, pride, and support for the GHS Class of 2020. To be safe, spectators will remain in your cars for the parade. Everyone is encouraged to make signs and cheer/honk for our graduates.

Please park in the designated spectator parking areas.

We are proud to partner with U.S. Census Bureau to encourage a complete and accurate count for the #2020Census. Census Day is important because whenever you complete your #2020Census, you should count everyone living (or sleeping) in your home most of the time as of April 1—whether you are related to them or not. It only takes a few minutes to complete.

The 2020 Census count impacts the federal funds that communities receive each year for programs and services that are critical for schools, students, and younger children, such as:
-Special education, Head Start, after-school programs, and classroom technology.
-Food assistance, including free and reduced-price school lunches.
-Maternal and child health programs.

Our 7th-grade technology and innovation classes recently completed their ""Escape Room"" projects!

Each group had only a few weeks to decide on a theme/plot of their choice, create puzzles/clues, design the room with props to fit the theme, and work together as a team to make all of it come together.

Faculty members from different departments got the chance to try and ""escape"" from each room and afterward met with the group to hear more about their inspiration and process throughout the project.

Our students were able to put their skills of innovation, collaboration, critical thinking, problem-solving and many more to work during these projects. Great work, Wildcats!",2.0,"We love seeing our students' imaginations come to life!

Before games, we have the honor of recognizing former Godley students and alums who have or are currently serving our country in the military. They act as our honorary captains and flip the game coin.

This past Friday, we recognized United States Air Force veteran, Dion Turner, class of 1957. Mr. Turner served our country for 27 years and traveled back to Godley from Montana for homecoming. We were glad to have him back home, were honored to be able to recognize him, and are proud to have him as a lifetime Wildcat!

Thank you for serving our country, Mr. Dion Turner!",2019-10-17 11:13:27,,

Godley ISD Throwback Thursday: 5-2-19
Tradition is to the community, what memory is to the individual. As our Godley community grows, we will preserve our small town identity by remembering and honoring our own. Here is the signed professional baseball contract from the Valdosta Dodgers in 1950, along with a note from the scout that recruited this Godley alumni. Extra points for knowing what his signing bonus was. We will proudly display this in our new Godley High School. Don’t forget to mark Oct. 11th (homecoming) and 12th on your calendar to attend the Godley reunion.",0.0,"Rich Dear‎Godley Ex-Students Homecoming/Reunion

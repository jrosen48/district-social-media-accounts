As you are aware, Governor Laura Kelly has closed schools for the reminder of the school year in Kansas. Specifically, this means we will no longer have students attending the traditional classroom. We will however be transitioning to a teaching and learning model outside the regular classroom to support learning at home. March 23 our staff return from spring break. The week will be considered an ‘intermission’ in our school year so that our staff can ‘retool’ and begin working on ways we will deliver the curriculum to your home using a combination of methods. We be using both on line and traditional paper packet method of learning. Watch for communication from your child’s teacher about how this will be done. We will also be announcing a schedule for parents and students to pick up personal items as well as the necessary learning materials we will send home on March 30. We apologize for this dramatic change in your child’s education but we trust you understand this is in the interest of safety and wellness for everyone.

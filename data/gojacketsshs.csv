In regards to letter grades or pass/fail marks, it‚Äôs a system where you have to chooses one or the other. You can‚Äôt choose a couple classes of letter grades and the rest pass/fail. It has to be all letter grades or all pass/fail marks.

I just wanted to take a minute to clarify this, so there were no misconceptions of the process. Also, before deciding which option you prefer, I recommend that the student and their parents, sit down and figure out which option is the best for their own personal situation. Every students situation is unique, which is why we are instituting this option.

Panchita aa most of you know her, has been a dedicated teacher at SHS for 20 years. Panchita recently won our Stevi Rocks award, which is typically includes a bio and is featured in our local paper.

As everyone has been so busy lining out our new online schooling for the time being, I wanted to just remind everyone of what great teachers we have here. These teachers are in new territory and our coming up with some amazing plans for educating your kids. Even if we come to roadblocks from time to time, in this new process, we will work around them. Thanks Panchita!

Panchita aa most of you know her, has been a dedicated teacher at SHS for 20 years. Panchita recently won our Stevi Rocks award, which is typically includes a bio and is featured in our local paper.

As everyone has been so busy lining out our new online schooling for the time being, I wanted to just remind everyone of what great teachers we have here.

I wanted to send out a couple of quick reminders in regards to the next couple of days.

First, tomorrow (March 19th), SHS will be open from 8:15am-3:00pm, for all students to come by and pick up all materials needed for online classes. Class will start Monday the 23rd. Teachers will send out information and assessments each week, until further notice. The materials being sent out will be condensed and concise, so that students can do them at home without issues.

Also, please make sure that your student accepts all invites from their teachers in regards to google classroom, zoom, or any other type of on line platform. This is how student‚Äôs and teachers will communicate at this time.

SHS will keep everyone posted through Infinite Campus and Stevi High as the situation changes.

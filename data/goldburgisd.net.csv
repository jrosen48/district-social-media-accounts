All orders will be organized in the gym to expedite the pick-up process. In addition, we will open each of your boxes to check your products against our order forms, and have you sign-off that your order is correct.

Please make plans to come pick up your child's orders after 12 pm next Tuesday. You may park by the back door of the gym and we will be there to assist you when you arrive. We will stay until 6:00 pm or until all boxes have been picked up. We do not have a large amount of available frozen storage, so please make sure your frozen cookie dough is picked up by 6:00 pm.

Good morning everyone, it's sport season which means we need volunteers to help with the concession stand. The money raised will be split between the athletic program and the elementary. In order to lighten the burden from just one person and to hopefully reach out to more people we have a parent from the H.S. and a teacher from the elementary splitting the duties of getting volunteers, I am the h.s. contact and Kayla Watson is the elementary contact.
I am using the signup.com website like I did last year, below is the link. There are 2 games each night so I have to spots for each night in case somebody can only work one of the games, you will receive a reminder from signup.com as well just in case you forget.
Kayla will be getting volunteers through the school since she sees the teachers and parents on a daily basis so if you see her you can also tell her you would like to help with the games she's organizing.

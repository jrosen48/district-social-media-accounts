Golf School District 67 hosted its 4th annual ELL Family Night. This is an opportunity for our community and families who speak a second language to enjoy a delicious dinner from various neighboring ethnic restaurants, learn about the District's ELL program and meet the District's Language Ambassadors.

In an effort to ensure all families feel welcome and informed, District 67 started a Language Ambassador Program. A Language Ambassador is a parent who is fluent in English and a second language including, but not limited to Arabic, Assyrian, Polish, Romanian, Spanish and Urdu. Raffle prizes and free books were a special bonus!

We're proud to have Mayor Dan DiMaria participate in this event.",0.0,"Village of Morton Grove Municipality

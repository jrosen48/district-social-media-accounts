This decision will be re-evaluated as more information becomes available. If it appears possible at that time, we will begin announcing procedures and a date for a return to normal operations.

School Administrators,

Thank you for your patience as we work to navigate this ever-changing and unprecedented situation. As the situation stands, all UIL contests are suspended through March 29 due to COVID-19. As new information is released, we will continue to make informed decisions and provide amended plans as we have them.

We have received several questions concerning rehearsals, practices and spring football. At this time, all rehearsals, practices and workouts conducted outside the school day, as well as spring football, are postponed until March 29. This means that no rehearsals, practices or workouts outside the school day can be conducted during the time period of March 16 through March 29.

In the case that spring football is canceled altogether, football workouts would resume on August 3rd and teams would be able to add an additional scrimmage.

As this is a rapidly changing situation, please look for future correspondence from UIL.

Thank you,

Dear Parents,

I have enjoyed reading through all of the short stories, poems, and projects you’ve sent me over the last month. I appreciate how supportive all of you have been through this process. I want to emphasize that their classwork takes priority. If your child is overwhelmed by the amount of work they have to complete, don’t worry about the library lesson that week.

As we are finishing up this school year, please remember to return any library books your child may still have out. The red return bin is up in the office for your convenience. It’s not necessary to make a special trip to the school to return books, you can bring them whenever you stop by the school to pick up school work or your child’s belongings.

Information about our summer reading contest will be going home in the coming weeks.

If I can be of any help to you, or if you have questions, don’t hesitate to email me.

As some of you know by now, the Governor made the announcement today that all K-12 public schools will be closed for the next two weeks.

I know you all have a lot of questions but for now know that Monday and Tuesday will be strictly lesson prep days for the teachers. There will be no students. We will get you more detailed information in the next 24 hours on what the next two weeks will look like for everyone involved.

On Thursday, one of the Kindergarten students came to school with some medication in their backpack. Neither the parent nor the student let us know that the medication was there. When the student got home, the medicine was gone.

While the risk to your child is low, we ask, as a precaution, that you please check your child's back pack to make sure they do not have anything that they shouldn’t have. The medicine is ""Aripiprazola"" which is a tiny pill that is orange/pink. They would be cut in half. The pill might have SD 327 printed on it. There might also be another bag containing purple fluoride tablets.

We apologize for any stress this may cause. It is a good reminder for why we ask all medicine to be checked into the main office. If you find the medicine, please notify our main office at 801-393-2950. If not, thanks for checking.

Yesterday afternoon we received some reports that some of the ads on our Symbaloo page were displaying images that were inappropriate. We wanted to let you know that we have responded to those concerns in the following ways.
- We have shifted to an add free version of our Symbaloo page, thus eliminating any external images.
- We re-mapped all of our school computers and Chromebooks to the new (ad-free) page.
- We removed the link for the old page on our website, and replaced it with the link to the new page.
- In the long term, we are considering alternatives to Symbaloo.

The Sixth Graders at GFA would like to invite you to participate in a fundraiser that will aide in purchasing caps and gowns for our graduation ceremony. Each card is $40, and we get to keep $10 of every card sold. If we sell all 50 cards it means our caps and gowns will be over 90% paid for.

The details: Each card entitles the owner to one bouquet per month for an entire year from any Jimmy’s Flowers location. These cards will make an excellent Valentine’s Day present! We are happy to accept cash, check, or credit cards at the front desk. Cards are not replacable, so if yours is lost you will forfeit the card. Additionally, if you miss a month you will lose it for that year.

The winner of our States challenge was also Coach Woods' class with 13 out of state pledges and they will throw pies and shoot silly string at me as I ride our minibike down the gauntlet line tomorrow.

Tonight, we have a pledgers challenge. The class that has the most students get pledges overnight will get to duct tape me to the basketball court and throw water balloons at me. SO parents please encourage and help your kids to log on and share.

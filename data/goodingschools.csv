Please make sure your child understands that if s/he is uncertain about a stop they should not get off the bus. Tell your child to communicate with the driver their concerns.

Younger children (Preschool and Kindergarten) cannot leave the bus unless an adult is there to meet them. If an adult is not present, the driver will return to school with that student.

Samantha Knittle from Gooding Elementary School in the Gooding School District, along with her scurvy friend, Pirate Pat, are teaching 4th graders this week on #ClassroomIdaho on Idaho Public Television. Be sure to check them out on our Create channel or YouTube!

Samantha (Sam) Knittle is a 4th grade teacher at Gooding Elementary School. She has a degree in civil engineering and architecture from Washington State University. It was not until after graduation, that she realize wearing fairy wings to reinforced concrete lectures was a sign she should have been an elementary school teacher instead. If you had told her in college that someday she would live in a small town, surrounded by cows and corn, in Southern Idaho she would have laughed at you. However, Sam absolutely loves her students, cows, husband, and being able to bike everywhere in town!

Graduation for 2020 will be held on Tuesday, May 26th at 7:00 PM and will be held on the football field, and graduates will be seated on the home bleachers. The field will be marked into grids for family members but is limited to eight (8) members per family in order for some social distancing to occur. Grid positions were determined in a random drawing with seniors and Mr. Patterson. Graduates will meet behind the school. All other family members must arrive together to be seated in the assigned grid and will need to provide seating for themselves. Please note that once someone leaves the area, he or she will not be able to return. Seating will begin at 6:00, with assistance provided by staff and Board members. The decision to allow vehicles into the complex will be made on Tuesday, as the ground will need to be dry. If you are sick or at-risk of getting sick, please do not attend. The ceremony will be streamed live on Gooding High School‚Äôs Facebook page.

Typically administration creates graduation plans. However, during this unique time, administration felt the Board should be included. At the last board meeting, trustees approved a graduation plan on the football field. The approval was contingent upon insurance liability concerns needing to be resolved regarding Covid-19 and also legal concerns for the use of a release of liability waiver. I reached out to the insurance company and the district's attorney, and those findings will be presented at a special board meeting on Wednesday. The Board's decision is currently in effect. Graduation plans may or may not change at Wednesday's board meeting. If you have questions, please direct them to administration.

There are many Idaho students who do not have a computer at home or internet access to learn remotely during our current situation. However, almost all families in Idaho have a television and can watch Idaho Public Television.

Beginning April 20, Idaho teachers will provide instruction to students in grades 3, 4, 5 and 6 via Idaho Public Television‚Äôs CREATE channel. Watch the video to learn more.

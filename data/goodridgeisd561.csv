Wore my favorite tie today for today’s floor session. Go Goodridge-Grygla Chargers!! A couple of small schools in my district doing big things.

Between the two schools there are 25 seniors. Would have been great to see them have a graduation to commemorate this milestone in a graduate’s life.

God bless the Class of 2020!",7.0,"Thank you for the shout-out Senator Mark Johnson! And thank you for your support and well wishes!

Wore my favorite tie today for today’s floor session. Go Goodridge-Grygla Chargers!! A couple of small schools in my district doing big things.

Between the two schools there are 25 seniors. Would have been great to see them have a graduation to commemorate this milestone in a graduate’s life.

God bless the Class of 2020!",2020-05-12 19:29:24,,

What's your favorite school lunch? Hot and cold subs.

My favorite school memory: Playing king of the hill during recess.

Who is one person at school you'd like to say ""thank you"" to, and why? Connie (all the cooks) for making amazing food for me everyday for lunch.

Hey Charger staff and high school students...are you ready for a challenge? March 6-7 is National Day of Unplugging. We are challenging all staff and high school students to be unplugged for the entire school day on Friday, March 6!

People can turn their cell phones and smart watches in on Friday morning in the lobby. They will be kept in a safe, locked room until the end of the day. Around 3:15, we will begin to give back cell phones to students and staff who participated. We'll also take a picture to share our daring, unplugged Chargers!

We are really excited about this challenge and hope that many people will choose to participate. In fact, we've already had several people commit to unplug! So come on Chargers, we dare you, are you ready to unplug? It will give everybody a chance to live in the moment, focus, see a new perspective, meet and visit with new friends, etc. Will you unplug?!",0.0,"Goodridge Public School

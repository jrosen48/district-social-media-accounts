Charter Schools receive less funding than ISDs and do not have ability to collect property taxes or build facilities with school bonds. We rely on donations. In light of this, we would like to encourage you to participate in this wonderful fundraiser that allows the students to pay your kindness forward: no selling of wrapping paper, popcorn or candles, just paying kindness forward.

Because charter schools receive less funding per pupil than traditional public schools, we must rely on fundraising to cover that gap. Support from outside organizations and individuals is crucial to our mission.

Thank you to the W.D.

Anna is demonstrating our #SeedsofChange plant of the day, the delightful and often overlooked gourd! Gourds are a perfect plant to grow on Goodwater's eleven acres. They grow easily in our hot weather (and most need our extra long frost free days to grow to maturity), are generally pest free, and come in a variety of shapes and sizes. The gourds are cured by allowing to dry outside, and they can be used for a variety of instruments, toys, and tools. I plan on growing these aptly named caveman club gourds, which make perfect maracas once the seeds dry inside. Other varieties include spinning top, swan, apple, dipper, bowl and bottle.

Maria has a lot to teach us about standing strong and speaking up during turbulent times. She defied societal norms to become one of the first female physicians in Italy and was a fierce and vocal advocate for women's rights. In 1896 she represented Italy at the International Women’s Congress in Berlin where she delivered an address on the rights of working women, including equal pay for equal work. She was later exiled from Italy for refusing to cooperate with Mussolini's government. Maria is known for her innovations in education and was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize more than once. Her life is an example of how teaching peace and being a woman do not mean being quiet. Her work and her convictions continue to inspire millions of people today.

Grades, like other external rewards, have little lasting effect on a child’s efforts or achievements. The Montessori approach nurtures the motivation that comes from within, kindling the child’s natural desire to learn. A self-motivated learner also learns to be self-sufficient, without needing reinforcement from outside. In the classroom, of course, the teacher is always available to provide students with guidance and support. Although most Montessori teachers don’t assign grades, they closely observe each student’s progress and readiness to advance to higher-level lessons. Goodwater will hold family conferences twice per year so parents may see their child’s work and hear the teacher’s assessment of his or her progress. Parents may also schedule a conference any time.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=641706989327660&id=262332440598452,,0.0,"Today's Goodwater Question of the Day: Do Montessori teachers give grades?

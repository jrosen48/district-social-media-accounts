Today GHM presenting Good Will-Hinckley with a check to help with programing.

Historically, Good Will-Hinckley has been a home to youth facing complex academic, social, behavioral and emotional challenges. Before going to Good Will, they may have lacked sufficient support at home and/or in school. Our 1,000 plus acre campus served children and young adults ages 11 through 21. The campus also has the LC Bates Museum, a Carnegie Library and a MOFGA certified organic farm

Just recently, Good Will has formed the first charter school in Maine that focuses on agriculture, sustainability, forestry, workforce skills training and independent living. We offer a unique high school experiences for the active, real-world learner.

The legacy that George Walter Hinckley started will continue with a new focus on project-based, theme-oriented learning that will prepare students to live successful lives as they continue their education and career training.

🚨ATTENTION Goose Creek CISD FAMILIES🚨

We are working to help answer common questions regarding technology for the start of virtual instruction.

⭐QUESTION #1⭐
Is my student required to get an iPad from GCCISD?

⭐ANSWER⭐
A GCCISD iPad is recommended but not required. If you have a personal iPad or computer/laptop, these can be used during virtual learning and for the first day of school. A GCCISD iPad is not required to start virtual instruction on Tuesday.

There are advantages to using a GCCISD iPad, it will automatically connect to district WiFi when near a building or when returning to campus for face-to-face instruction. Additionally, there may be iPad apps the district has purchased (at no cost to families) that are only available when using a district device.

Devices that are NOT recommended for virtual instruction include cell phones and Android tablets. Some of our programs will not work properly on these devices.

Goose Creek CISD is hosting Session 3 of the Engaging Parents and Families in Education Series involving “The Diagnosis.”
After receiving a diagnosis of mental illness, it is common to experience a range of emotions. Once parents know what’s happening, they may not feel so helpless or hopeless. For some, a diagnosis can be a relief in that they are finally able to put a name to a problem.
If your child has a mental health diagnosis/condition and you would like to learn how it may affect their functioning at school, join us Thursday, December 19, 2019, from 9-10 a.m. at J.D. Walker Community Center, 7613 Wade Road, Baytown, TX. Light refreshments and door prizes are available.

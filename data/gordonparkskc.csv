This is Tamara Allen-Williams! Mrs. Tamara Allen-Williams grew up right here in Kansas City, Missouri. Her love for education began with her start in private education. One of the 8th grade graduation requirements was to write an autobiography, and she stated then that she was going to be a teacher. Her 36 years of teaching experience is proof of her non-wavering determination. “Active learning is the foundation for student empowerment. That’s why I am a lifelong learner.” She enjoys visits from previous students. “One of the greatest feelings is to teach a student that is the child of a former student. That’s how I know I made a difference in that student’s life.” Mrs. Allen-Williams lives in the Kansas City area and has two adult sons.

Good morning!

I'm happy to share news of a project I've been working on this month. I'm focusing on chronic absenteeism - and my first story airs tonight.

This is Justine Volkman.

“My name is Justine Volkman and I am thrilled to be joining the team at Gordon Parks. I moved to Kansas City five years ago to teach with Teach for America. I started my teaching career at Operation Breakthrough teaching Pre-K for three years. After that I worked abroad creating an early childhood curriculum in Tanzania, Africa. Most recently I was a Kindergarten teacher at Hogan Preparatory Elementary.

I am so excited to have a small student to teacher ratio at Gordon Parks that will allow me to provide each student with the love, attention, and academic rigor that he or she deserves.

I am drawn to the mission and vision of Gordon Parks based on my deeply held belief in nurturing the whole child. I believe that students need to feel safe, seen, and respected in order to learn. My priority in the classroom is to grow students as human beings with kind hearts, curious brains, and brave bodies. I am so grateful to be part of the Gordon Parks community!”

If there are more interested students than available seats, the schools are generally required to hold lotteries, which randomly determine which students will be enrolled.
Unlike magnet schools overseen by school districts, public charter schools cannot selectively admit students. According to federal law, they must accept all students, including students with disabilities and English Learners (ELs), regardless of previous academic performance.
In 2014, the U.S. Department of Education revised its long-standing policy requiring charter schools to use a “blind” lottery when they are oversubscribed. Where it is permitted by state law, charters can now use “weighted” lotteries to preference “educationally disadvantaged” students. This change will likely result in charter schools serving an even greater share of disadvantaged children than they already do.

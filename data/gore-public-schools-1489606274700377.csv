There was a FB post linking to a donation site. This site asks for donations for Gore Elementary basketball uniforms. In the description there are statements that are not true or even close to being accurate.

Gore Schools is in no way financially struggling. NO requests for uniforms, for our elementary students, have been brought to me or our school board for consideration. Staff that were trying to help out received inaccurate information. We are working to correct the site information. Any needs for our students will be addressed.

Thank you for your support of Gore Schools.

Last year’s program was a rewarding experience that had a positive impact on all who were involved.

Challenge Days are powerful, high-energy programs in which youth and adult participants are guided through a series of experiential learning processes. The overall goals of the program are to increase personal power and self-esteem, to shift dangerous peer pressure to positive peer support and to eliminate the acceptability of teasing, violence and all forms of oppression. Challenge Day programs are designed to unite the members of the school and/or community and to empower them to carry the themes of the program back to the greater school population.

If you are interested in volunteering, please contact Ms. Murray at 918-489-5587 ext. 5 or murrayc@gorepublicschools.org. For more information regarding Challenge Day visit www.challengeday.org.

There will be concessions available at Jr High Girls softball games this season. We will be following IDPH guidelines. All items sold will be pre-packaged...hot pre-packaged items will be available for purchase for us that eat “supper” at the park. You will see X’s in front of the concession stand and on the sidewalk for social distancing purposes, and we will ask that you exit the stand to your right (toward left field), to prevent walking back through the line.

These girls worked most of the day to get lunches ready for pick up and bus delivery for this Friday. Next week is spring break, so we decided to make more meals for the kids to have for the next week. We didn’t get everything done, but will be finished up by Friday! We are doing almost 1,000 meals a week when you take into account that each bag has 5 days worth of breakfast & lunch!! After spring break, we will be back at making meals for the Tuesday after spring break😊. Everyone on our list stays on the list, so no need to order a meal if you have already received some. If you have not received meals, you do need to let us know so we can have them ready. If your kids ride the bus, there is no need to call an order in, the buses will be stopping on their routes and honking so someone can come out and get them. Please keep in mind, pick up is Friday between 11-12, and no meals next week. Hope you are all doing well and staying safe!!❤️",4.0,"#BlackcatPride #ilschoolsstepup

I want to brag on this young lady...Miley Kwiatkowski. Most of you have seen the posts where she ran for State Beta President but what you don't know is when you run for State office you cannot compete in anything else at convention. That's nothing including Group talent, showchoir any academic test...absolutely nothing. Most teenagers running for a state office would be busy getting their campaign and skit ready and Miley did those things and then did every single thing I asked her to help the rest of the club get ready for convention and about a hundred things for me. She may not be the next State Beta President but to our Goreville club she is much more... She is one in a million...great role model for what a leader truly is!!

I continue to be blessed by friendships and businesses that give back to their community.

Today, Fiona Russell, Jessica Lachtara and Shelby Johnson from IDEXX Laboratories of Westbrook, Maine spent the morning in the garden as part of their Global IDEXX Volunteer Program. This team helped to harvest 93 pounds of produce for the Gorham Food Pantry and weeded every garden bed, harvested and even fit in time to mow the lawn throughout the garden!

Jessica shared that they “were extremely grateful to be able to volunteer and help our the local community. We can’t wait to do it again!”

GHOP will reopen for takeout & curbside service. We have made changes to help with safety measures for our customers and staff.

We will have modified hours initially:
Sunday-Thursday 11:00 AM - 8:00 PM
Friday & Saturday 11:00 AM - 9:00 PM

We are reconfiguring our entrances and exits:
- GHOP will have a single entrance on the South Street side (brick steps).
- The other two doors will be used for exiting the building only and for those with disabilities.
- We will have markers inside for spacing purposes to enforce 6ft of social distancing measures.
- A limited amount of customers will be allowed in the building at one time. This means there will be lines forming outside of the building and we respectfully ask you to maintain 6ft of social distancing.

We thoughtfully request people to be patient with any wait time associated. We're all in this together. We look forward to serving the community once again and getting back to work!",0.0,"Gorham House of Pizza - ""GHOP""

This weekend the GMS FLL Robotics team traveled to the Augusta Civic Center and competed in the State Championship. After months of building, coding, and practice the team competed against teams from all over Maine, earning 9th place in the robot competition.

The team earned 1st place during the Core Value Competition and was recognized with the FLL Inspiration Award for their ability to work together and show effective problem solving.

Congratulations to Zeke Lockman, Dayton Crockett, Arianna Morse, Laura Burt, John Copperberg, Alek Nauman, and Riley McCallister as well as our GHS mentors Owen Begley and Hunter Pellerin.",2019-12-16 19:01:30,,

Full service library cards are available at no cost to GCS students - just come to the library to register.

why we are not recommending on-line only education for our school districts. I
cannot speak for the St. Joseph County Health Officer, but I‚Äôm sure we are both
looking at the same data for our counties, considering where we as a county seem to
be going, and how the county is doing over several metrics. While Elkhart County
had the dubious distinction of being a ‚Äúhot spot‚Äù for coronavirus, the community
took preventative measures to heart and we no longer have that designation. As
you can see from the graphs below, Elkhart County and St Joe County have different
demographics and different trends at this time. We each need to do what is best for
our county considering what is happening at the present time. If metrics change
over time, I will revisit my recommendation, and I am sure the St. Joseph County
Health Officer would also adjust sanctions according to any fluctuation occurring.

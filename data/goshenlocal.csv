As you know, GLSD mails a printed school year calendar to every home in the school district each July.

This calendar includes important school dates and fantastic photographs of our students and faculty.

What you may not know is that the process for creating the art for the calendar takes several weeks and hundreds or thousands of photos.

This year, for obvious reasons, we are missing our models: you!

So, we are asking you, our quarantined Warriors, to submit photos for us to use in the 2020-2021 school year calendar.

The theme for this year‚Äôs calendar is ‚ÄúIn This Together.‚Äù

We are seeking photos of students and families doing what Warriors do: smiling in the face of new challenges, supporting ourselves, our loved ones, and our community, facing new challenges with grit and a positive attitude, and WARRIORING UP!

So, post your photos here! We will choose photos to use in the calendar and other publications as we move into summer and a new school year.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3095415527220137&id=365134906914893,,0.0,"Hello, Warriors families!

As you know, graduation is a milestone event that every student and family looks forward to. COVID-19 has caused many scheduling difficulties during the past few weeks. Students have reached out concerned that the May 27th graduation might be cancelled as well.

As of today, we plan to hold graduation as originally planned on May 27th. In the event that the governor extends the ""stay at home order"" we have secured a second graduation date. Mark your calendars for both dates at this time until we get further direction from the governor.

Original date: May 27th at 7 pm at BB&T Arena at NKU
Back-up date: July 17th at 7 pm at BB&T Arena at NKU

If you have questions, feel free to reach out to Mrs. Walker at walkers@goshenlocalschools.org

Have a great day! Mrs. Walker

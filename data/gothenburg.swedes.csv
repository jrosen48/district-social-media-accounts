Dear GHS seniors of 2020,

On Friday (April 24) after 1:00pm, ALL Gothenburg 2020 Seniors are welcome to go to the high school parking lot and decorate a parking space with their name and fun designs! Please keep in mind there can be NO inappropriate pictures, NO provocative language, and make sure to only draw in the parking lot. Be respectful and don’t do anything bad. CHALK ONLY!

Also, with social distancing going on Mr. Ryker said that only 10 people can be in the parking lot at a time. If you come and there are already 10 people there, please come at a later time. You can come to the school anytime after 1:00p.m.

When you are done with your art, take a picture and email it to Mr. Ryker! Be respectful, be smart, but have fun!

Students should access Flipgrid (through Clever) on student Chromebooks. Simply find the image of Flipgrid in Clever (see attached), click on it, and it will take you to Flipgrid! Once there, students will simply ""Sign in with Google"" (this will sign the students in automatically). Each grade level has a ""class"" on Flipgrid to enjoy being in touch digitally!

With Flipgrid, students can see videos and messages from their teacher, add a response, or ask a question! We look forward to communicating with you over this school closure. Please stay engaged with us!

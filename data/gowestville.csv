In case of severe weather, I ask that everyone bring a mask in case we must move inside where a mask is mandatory to enter the school.

The first official practice will be Monday August 10, at 11:30am at Harrison Park. More information about season will be handed out and discussed at meeting.

If you have not turned in a physical form already, please bring it with you Sunday to the meeting as you will not be able to practice without one.

Locker clear out begins tonight at WHS for Sophomores.

The Seventh Grade will have materials pick-up at WJHS. Check the district website at www.gowestville.org for a detailed schedule.

Some important things to remember -

1) WHS students must bring a mask and wear it when on campus during locker clear out. Gloves will be provided by the school district.

2) While we all miss our students, the locker clear out process has been designed to run quickly and smoothly to minimize exposure.

3) Social distancing will be maintained at all times during locker clear out ‚Äì both inside and outside the building. Law enforcement will be assisting in supervision to ensure safe procedures.

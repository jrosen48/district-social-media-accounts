The Audubon Community School was recently the benefactor of a generous gift. 1992 graduate, Jeanette LaFoy, passed away on April 1, 2019. In her will, she left her home in Washington State to the district. The home has been sold and the district received a check for $191,000.

There are no definitive plans for the money at this point. However, the district administration and Board would like to use the money for specific projects that have a direct effect on students and can be credited to Jeanette. The district is very appreciative of this generous gift and is committed to using it to make a positive impact.

Every year Landmands does a class picture for the seniors, and this year is no different! Except obviously it is, and we have been trying to figure out how to make this work from a safe distance.

Even though their senior year has been cut short, we want nothing more than for our seniors to feel remembered! They have worked so hard over the years and deserve any support we can give them! This was going to be a surprise but we've actually had lots of inquires about this today☺️. My Way Designs and S&R Hoyle Trucking are sponsoring boulevard banners of all of the Audubon Seniors to be displayed uptown. (Similar to the Albert ones that have been up the last few years). We would like to get these up as soon as possible so we please ask for you to email us a picture of your senior that you would like used along with their name as you would like it displayed. Please keep in mind that the better the quality of photo, the better it will look...so a digital high quality pic would be best! You can email it to us at extremedesigns1@hotmail.com. *please try to have your picture submitted by noon on Tuesday, April 21st*

Huge congratulations to Clare C. & Abby Z. for winning GOLD Keys from the Scholastic Art Competition!

The Scholastic Art Competition is one of the country’s longest running and most prestigious recognition program for creative students in grades 7-12. The Iowa and Midwest region received over 7,000 pieces of art and writing. Out of those 7,000 pieces, Gold Keys are only awarded to the top 5% of entries!

Gold Key works of art will also have the opportunity to be judged on a national level - national gold medalists will be announced in March.

Scholastic awards are very competitive and only the best artists win awards! I am so lucky to have these girls as students!

I also want to point out that Clare has won an award from Scholastic for the past 3 years! How awesome!

Guthrie County REC delivered STEM kits to the Audubon Middle School last week to help students learn more about electricity and renewable energy. We have 10 schools in our service territory that we have been donating STEM kits to and each school has selected unique kits to fit their curriculum needs. This project was funded by CIPCO, Guthrie County REC's power supplier, through an energy efficiency program.

We are proud to help students learn more about the changing energy landscape and their potential roles within it.",2.0,"Guthrie County REC

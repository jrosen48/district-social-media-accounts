Dear GP families:

As expected, the Governor has extended the “Stay at Home” order (including the closure of schools) through April 30th. Frankly, we expected this extension and are prepared to offer “remote learning” for an extended period of time if needed. Although we anticipated this directive, it is unfortunate news for our entire student body as they continue to face these unprecedented times. We are committed to helping every student during this difficult transition.

I will continue to keep you updated on future announcements related to District #6. I wish you and your family continued health and safety.

Good afternoon. We have been informed that the Governor’s Office has issued a mandatory closure for all public schools in Illinois beginning Tuesday, March 17th - Monday, March 30th, 2020. As a reminder, we do have a School Improvement Day still scheduled for Monday, March 16th that includes an early dismissal of 11:15 a.m. I wanted to share this information with you to provide adequate time for planning purposes. As other details unfold, I will provide further correspondence and information.

Without doubt, the last week has presented unprecedented obstacles for school districts. Please know that I could not be more proud of our student body and staff members. Simply said, they have been incredibly understanding as well as cooperative throughout this entire week.

I regret to inform you that the High School Play scheduled for this weekend has been postponed until a later date. Without doubt, this has been a very difficult decision as our students and sponsors have worked extremely hard to ensure that a performance would be enjoyed by all. However, with the recent guidance from the Governor’s office as well as the numerous area cancellations that have occured this morning, I feel it is in the best interest of our students, parents, and other spectators to postpone this event.

Tentatively, we have rescheduled the play performance for Saturday, April 25th and Sunday, April 26th. After logistical items are confirmed, we will send out additional correspondence regarding the times. In addition, Mrs. Cademartori will be sending additional information to the families of cast members.

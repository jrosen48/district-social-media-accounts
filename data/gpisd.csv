It was the final day of National Children’s Book Week and National STEM/STEAM Day. The students have been working with the book, ""I Got A Chicken for My Birthday"", which is about a girl who asks her Abuela for tickets to an amusement park but gets a chicken instead. In a funny turn of events, the chicken ends up building an amusement park for the girl.
After the story, the students were given two sizes of cups, craft sticks, pipe cleaners, and clothespins to construct their own roller coaster.

There will be more roller coaster coming, so be on the lookout!

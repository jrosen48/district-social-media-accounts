As my family and I continue to grieve the sudden loss of my dad, we have been so humbled and grateful for all the messages of love and appreciation for him. We have truly been held together over the last two weeks by thoughtful cards, texts, calls, and lasagnas.

He lived such a big, joyful, and generous life, it has been a tall order to know how to carry him and his legacy forward. This is what came to us, and we would be so moved if you considered honoring him by supporting a first-generation medical student in their research on heart disease and prevention.

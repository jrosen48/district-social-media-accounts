Dear GPS Parents & Guardians,

Greenville Public Schools will be implementing the attached plan starting on Monday, March 16, 2020. In addition, we will be making minor adjustments to our lunch program in order to assure all students stay safe and healthy.

Preschool and DK/Kindergarten Registration nights are both cancelled; however, each elementary building will be reaching out to DK/K parents who have already scheduled appointments to assure they are registered correctly and an individual screening time can take place. Please contact your local elementary school if you have additional questions.

As you know, things are changing quickly. We will continue to update you as additional guidance is received.

Thank you for your continued support.

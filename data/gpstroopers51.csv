The level in which we are at specific to COVID, will now be determined at the county level. However, if we have zero active cases or a manageable number of cases, we may elect to go to hybrid learning. These updated changes are now in both the Hybrid Learning Plan and our Safety Plan.

We are hopeful we are able to make these determinations locally, since county numbers have an immense variability.

Graduation will be on Facebook Live and zoom. We will also be recording it and it will be aired on our local RTC channel, as soon as they are able to upload it. The zoom link will be going out in an email later this week and posted to a variety of sites; however, we are recommending you watch it on Facebook because it can handle a larger volume of people to watch it.

Regarding graduation, only parents and siblings will be allowed on the football field. The first row of parking will be reserved for parents of graduates along the practice field offering a good view. We will be using an outdoor audio system, so it should provide for better sound. All of this is of course is contingent upon weather. The forecast is calling for rain. In the event it rains, graduation will be moved into the high school gymnasium.

Good Afternoon!!

We have some very exciting news to share from the FFA chapter!

Aaron Johnson has been selected as a State Star Farmer finalist and Skyla Folden has been selected as a State Star in Ag Placement finalist! Both individuals have earned their spots as finalists due to their passion for agriculture and their work in their Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE) projects. As a finalist, they are in the top two in the state that submitted an application in their award area. Each individual will be submitting a video of their SAE and we will be waiting to hear who the State Stars are, which will be announced the first week of June.

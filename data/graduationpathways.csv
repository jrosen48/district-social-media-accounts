In honor of the 2020 graduating class, Walt Disney World President, Josh D'Amaro recorded a special message supporting virtual commencement ceremonies for graduates across Central Florida - including many of our Cast Members and their families. We had to share his sentiment - along with our own best wishes - for the graduates, the friends and family, and the faculty and staff that have supported them each step of the way. Congratulations on your accomplishment - and all our best for a vibrant future!",2020-05-15 07:51:50,https://video-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/97440315_240649753809889_8545796432869720064_n.mp4?_nc_cat=108&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=PkF5fW9Y9eYAX-i5XBP&_nc_ht=video-atl3-1.xx&oh=8a654306f34fa5d6ced19fe47b0132f3&oe=5F5D1385,

The College Board is developing tools to mitigate the impact of school closures on students in the Advanced Placement Program. All AP students and teachers will be able to draw on the free online resources that were provided to every AP classroom this fall. Additional resources will be made easily accessible to AP students and teachers through mobile phones and other devices. These include free online AP lessons and review sessions from some of the top AP teachers in the country.

The AP program is finalizing streamlined AP exam options that would allow students to test at home, depending on the situation in May. We‚Äôre working to give every AP student the opportunity to claim the credit they‚Äôve earned. The AP Program will communicate the details of these additional solutions to educators and students by March 20.

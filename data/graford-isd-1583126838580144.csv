Our Lady Rabbits take on the Lady Cardinals of Lingleville tomorrow @ 4 PM.

Fans please be mindful that due to COVID-19 Mitigation Guidelines we are at 50% capacity.

We have new attendance guidelines for Graford ISD athletic events:

1. Attendees must wear a face-covering upon entering, exiting, and moving about the premises.

2. All attendees must have a seat in the designated areas to view the game (s). All children must remain seated with and/or supervised by an adult at all times. Once your family/group is seated and socially distanced, you may remove your face covering (s).

3. By UIL rule student-athletes must exit the facility in a separate designated location from fans/parents.

Any fan who does not abide by these regulations will be asked to leave the facility.

The first full week of May is traditionally Teacher Appreciation Week. I think we can all agree we see education, as a whole, in a brand new light. Our teachers have shown an ability to engage, encourage, and educate our students even with our world and its distractions.

I might be remiss not to mention the importance our ""at-home"" teachers have done to ensure our students are still completing school work at the moment.

Hey y'all! There are so many great companies offering free subscriptions right now for students who are learning from home. I was excited this morning to see that Breakout EDU has free ""virtual escape rooms"" available to students as well!

My 3rd - 6th graders have all worked through at least one of these virtual challenges in the art room, so they should be familiar. With a little help, kids as young as PK / Kinder can figure out how to navigate the ""escape room"" also!

Please use the link below to check out the options - there are challenges for students K - 12! These are seriously so much fun!

Students may color their hair with temporary color, students may wear pink track shorts with tights as appropriate (meaning modesty in mind), and students may wear pink attire in creative ways as long as it is appropriate.
Please note, any intent deemed less than supportive of the pep rally will result in students being asked to change.

23 Years ago Jerry Maguire and Twister were the most watched films on screen. Yankees defeated the Braves in the World Series and Derek Jeter was named MLB Rookie of the Year. Dallas Cowboys won their 5th super bowl by defeating the Steelers. Windows 4.0 and Internet Explorer 3 hit the computer screens. Tiger Woods made his pro PGA Tour debut. Ehhhh....you get the point.

The 1996 Jackrabbit Baseball team made the last playoff run UNTIL TONIGHT! To those who served on that team, we congratulate you also.

The 2019 ""Boys of Spring"" Jackrabbit Baseball team added to the piece of Rabbit history defeating Bluff Dale 17-2 tonight on Jackrabbit turf to secure a post season play off spot.

Let's give the boys and girl a big Congratulations on their hard work. Get ready to cheer them on!

Thank you for a great season Graford Jackrabbits. Although tonight didn't turn out the way you wanted, we are still extremely proud of you and all of the hard work you have put in this season.

To our Seniors, you will be greatly missed but we know there are great things ahead of you so always push towards your dreams!!

Looking forward to next basketball season!!",2019-03-02 15:44:53,,

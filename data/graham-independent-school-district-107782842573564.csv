Wow! It‚Äôs been a busy week but it is so good to be back!

Our students -in person and remote- have handled new expectations and procedures with grace. (Maybe we adults could take a lesson!)

In Art 1 we are drawing shoes in contour line. Our advanced students in Art 2, 3, and 4 are composing still life drawings with various media. We aren‚Äôt wasting any time.

So, pizza boxes might be a permanent thing now! They make for excellent and sturdy storage portfolios on the go.

Please refer to the graphic below for information about laptop return for Seniors on May 19. I know there are a couple of you who have AP testing and will need an extension - Make sure you have coordinated with Mr. Bozeman.

Additional thoughts:
Make sure you turn right into the bus lane from Calaveras - you will not be able to turn left:
Morning and evening times available
Remember that you get cords and graduation tickets during this time - Do not miss this event!
If you have pre-existing fines from the MacShop, you will receive an email notification.

Please refer to the graphic below for information about laptop return for Seniors on May 19. I know there are a couple of you who have AP testing and will need an extension - Make sure you have coordinated with Mr. Bozeman.

Additional thoughts:
Make sure you turn right into the bus lane from Calaveras - you will not be able to turn left:
Morning and evening times available
Remember that you get cords and graduation tickets during this time - Do not miss this event!
If you have pre-existing fines from the MacShop, you will receive an email notification.

Celebrating our Seniors! We will be doing daily Senior spotlights to recognize our Seniors. Support your Senior - They are the group most affected by school closures and remote learning as they are missing the spring semester of their senior year.

Graham High Senior Spotlight: Yanelli Miranda

Activities @ GHS: Lady Blues Soccer, Student Council, Key Club, Art Club!

Favorite GHS Memory: My favorite memory of my time @GHS was any time we came together as a school and community to celebrate those around us.

Best advice for future GHS Students: My best advice for students coming through GHS is to remember that going into high school things will change and it might get a bit hard, but KEEP GOING! It's only 4 years and I promise it is all worth it in the end.

GISD Staff Shout Out? I would like to give a shoutout to Mrs. Morris, she is not necessarily a teacher, but she was the best counselor throughout my 4 years of high school.

What are your plans after graduation: I plan to attend The University of North Texas in Denton and study psychology.",2.0,"Graham High School

Favorite GHS Memory: My favorite memory of my time @GHS was any time we came together as a school and community to celebrate those around us.

Best advice for future GHS Students: My best advice for students coming through GHS is to remember that going into high school things will change and it might get a bit hard, but KEEP GOING! It's only 4 years and I promise it is all worth it in the end.

GISD Staff Shout Out? I would like to give a shoutout to Mrs. Morris, she is not necessarily a teacher, but she was the best counselor throughout my 4 years of high school.

What are your plans after graduation: I plan to attend The University of North Texas in Denton and study psychology.",2020-04-30 23:17:44,,

GHS has opened up the online forms that all athletes, marching band and cheerleaders will need to compete to participate next year. It would be great to go ahead and get the Rank One forms completed now as opposed to having to complete during the summer. All forms must be completed prior to student participation in GHS events in the summer/fall @ GHS. You will need your student's student ID number. This number can be found on the Student Information tab of Skyward Family Access listed under ""other ID.""

UIL has not yet decided if new physicals are required for the upcoming year. We will let everyone know once something official happens on that front.

Here is the link that the parents would need to go to complete the online forms

Graham High Senior Spotlight: Natalie Minyard

Natalie has been involved in Bella Blues, choir, and the Student Activity Leadership Team at Graham high School. Her favorite memories at Graham High School are Friday night football games with the Bellas & band.

Natalie's advice to younger students is to not be afraid to go to any teacher for help, they are there for you, to help you. May it be home related or school related.

I want to shout out not just one teacher but all my teachers, they have helped me so much with my time here at GISD that I could not thank them enough. They have gone out of their way to help me when I struggled with my health.

Natalie plans to continue her passion for dance at TJC and go for a dance minor followed by a psychology degree.",0.0,"Graham High School

Haley's best advice to younger students is to not slack off. Just do your work so that you won't have to make up those credits. Go to school as much as possible to get your exemptions (it makes life easier).

Haley would like to shout out to Miss. Carrico. She‚Äôs always positive and her classes are the ones that motivated me to chase after my dream.

üé® Today 22 GHS artists traveled to Wichita Falls with a combined 28 original artworks to compete at the Regional VASE contest. Lots of time, thought, hard work, and energy went into this endeavor; I'm very proud we had so many brave competitors. We had *fierce* competition in the region this year.

üèÜ I'm thrilled to say that 20 of their pieces medaled at the event - meaning their artwork and interviews scored the highest possible rating of ""4"". Additionally, sophomore McKynna Bozeman's 3D artwork was selected to advance to the State contest in April! A well-deserved honor!

üíñ Congratulations to all of our competitors today! Our students represented Graham well - they were respectful and composed.

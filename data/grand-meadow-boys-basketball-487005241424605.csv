We hope you are all doing well!

We wanted to give an update on our softener salt fundraiser. The salt will be arriving in Grand Meadow by this Friday. We are leaving it up to each player whether they want to pick up their salt and start to deliver it or wait until the stay at home order is over. If you placed an order with a player, they should be reaching out to you to let you know their plans for delivery.

If you have any questions, please reach out to Sara Warmka or Tabitha Hoffman.

Thank you for all your support!",0.0,"Grand Meadow Boys Basketball

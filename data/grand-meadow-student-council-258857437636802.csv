Also dress appropriately for the weather - not sure what the forecast will be but remember sunscreen, sweatshirt if it's cold, umbrella & good walking shoes. We will be taking a school bus and a school van because some kids need to be home early. Our approximate arrival back in GM will be around 8:00 pm.

We're having it at this time so that volleyball players and football players will all be able to make it. This meeting will most likely be shorter than the last since we do not have so much to go over.

Don't forget that we are also meeting Tuesday, August 26th at 1:00 pm to decorate the school.

If you are unable to come to either of these you must let and executive member or the advisors, Mrs. Glynn and Ms. Collins, know at least a day in advance. As we said, if anyone skips without notifying an executive officer or advisor then they will receive a strike.

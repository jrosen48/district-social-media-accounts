Grand Traverse Academy enjoyed a beautiful commencement ceremony last night, drive-in movie style! It was displayed on a large screen on the school building, complete with virtual band & choir performances and prerecorded valedictorian & salutatorian speeches, while students and families tuned in on their car radios in the parking lot. Instead of applause afterwards, the class was surprised by a parade of staff members circling the lot in their cars, led by local law enforcement and firefighters. Thank you to everyone who made this special event both possible and memorable for our seniors!

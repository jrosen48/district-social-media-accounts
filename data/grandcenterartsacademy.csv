Hello class of 2020!

As many of you are probably aware, this weekend was supposed to be Prom, and given our current situation, we’re unable to show off the new outfits we bought during or before quarantine. While you’re unable to wear your outfits to Prom, there’s still a way for you to show off your outfits: send a picture of you wearing your Prom outfit to editors@gcaatoday.com! We’ll use your pictures on a spread in the Senior Magazine which will also include senior superlatives, senior quotes, and more! So if you’re interested in strutting your stuff, even if it’s just through a picture, we’ll be happy to put it in the magazine for everyone to see. Please make sure to include in your email what name you prefer to go by, and make sure that the pictures are of good quality. You will only have up to May 5th to turn in your pictures, or else we won’t be able to use them in the magazine. Thank you very much, and stay healthy!

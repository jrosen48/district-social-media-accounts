Dear Parents & Guardians,
At approximately 10:15 this morning, a recess supervisor observed and took into possession an empty diabetic syringe with a capped needle. An initial investigation determined that the syringe was found by the student on the way to school. Parents of the students directly involved were contacted and made aware of the situation. The contents of the syringe are unknown and universal precautions were taken by school staff. At this time we believe that no other students were involved or affected by this incident. The Police have been made aware of the situation and the school will continue to investigate.
Parents please take a moment to talk with your students regarding their safety and the safety of others. If they find items that they are not sure of remind them to report it to an adult immediately. Thank you for your help and support.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1570614982964005&id=1421268744565297,,0.0,"From Lake Roosevelt Elementary School

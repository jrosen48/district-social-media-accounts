I would like to update you on the petition that was circulating in regard to requesting a GO Bond Election.

The petition did not meet the required 20% active voter signatures required to pass.

This means that the school board will proceed with the LBA bond in order to build the new middle school. I want to clarify with the community that the board of education has been saving for this construction since 2013. The payment is in place and ready to go with NO tax increase. The petition was requesting that the school district not proceed with funding the construction of the middle school with an LBA Bond, but rather wait and run a GO Bond election.

In addition, the school district just received news that our bond rating improved from an A1 to a AA3 based on the financial stability of the district. This means that we will receive a lower rate of interest on the LBA bond than what was being communicated by the petition.

Sincerely,
JT Stroder

We have asked law enforcement to be present tonight at the prom. If there is any suspicion or concern that someone is under the influence we will ask law enforcement to run a test and if it is positive they will take their keys and call parents to pick them up.

We want your kids to have a great time at Prom while doing so in a safe and secure manner. I would like to personally ask students to enjoy time with their friends tonight and make memories and not to do things that would put them or their friends at-risk of safety or security.

Mason is originally from central Illinois. He graduated from Southern Illinois University in 2016 with a degree in Human Nutrition & Dietetics. The following year, he completed a dietetic internship in Cleveland, Mississippi (located in the Mississippi Delta) while pursuing a second degree in nutrition. According to Mason, the area he worked in has some of the highest rates of poverty and obesity in the country, and the area is widely uneducated. He worked in school districts that were 100% free across all of their schools and learned the importance of good nutrition, particularly when kids are often going hungry outside of school hours. He's excited to bring some new energy and new ideas to the table, and to be a part of the GCSD. He said he looks forward to serving the members of this community.

- Slow down in school zones. The slower speed limits exist for a reason. We will be doing extra patrol and violators will be cited.

- Please don't park in the handicapped parking spaces without proper authorization, even ""just for a minute"". If you do, expect to receive a citation.

PE, health, arts no longer middle school core requirements

Grand County Middle School
August 15, 2017 at 3:37 PM ·

Last week, the Utah State Board of Education voted in favor of dropping physical education, arts, health, and career and college readiness classes from the required middle school curriculum. At this time, we do not anticipate any changes to the programming at GCMS as a result of that decision. We believe that a school experience rich with arts and physical activity is an important part of educating well-rounded individuals, and we've worked hard to ensure that our class offerings reflect that belief.

However, in the event that the State Legislature decides to adjust school funding in response to the recent change (a decision that would likely be made next spring), we may need to consider some changes. If that happens, we will be reaching out to the community to help guide us in the decision making process.

Hey Moab friends! If you have a preschooler (DOB 09/02/12 - 09/1/13) and you haven't signed them up for preschool, July 31 is the last day to take advantage of the online UPSTART preschool! This is the 4th year MVMC has been helped register, train and graduate these online preschoolers and I can tell you that it has been a terrific and successful experience for the families. Even if you've already registered them for daytime preschool, it's STILL a great idea to reinforce those important reading, math and science concepts they will need to build upon in Kindergarten.

Plus, it's totally FREE (and you may qualify for free computer and/or internet)

Individualized programs like UPSTART allow your child to learn at his or her own pace, even if they are advanced or delayed.

ghaps.org",0.0,"On the evening of March 12, Governor Whitmer ordered the closure of all K-12 school buildings for three weeks, beginning Monday. Therefore, GHAPS will be closed March 16 – April 3, 2020. All buildings will be closed to students, which means there will be no activities or events at our schools. Daycare and Open Door are closed as well. Spring Break will proceed as scheduled from April 6 – 10, 2020.
We don’t have all the answers at this time, but we’re working nonstop to address the many complexities of this unprecedented situation. For more details, please visit https://www.ghaps.org/our-district/coronavirus-updates/.

People are often surprised to learn that there are many homeless teens in the Grand Haven area. We started Community Care for Teens four years ago to raise awareness of their plight and to fill the need these kids experience, especially during Christmas. To give them hope, inspire and empower them, and let them know they’re not forgotten. This Holiday Season, give a homeless teen the gift of a Merry Christmas.

1. Embrace your child’s difference. Make it clear how much you care about them, how their differences are a gift, not a liability, and how not everyone will view it as a positive.
2. Correct misperceptions the world has about people who are diverse. We certainly know the adult world is filled with misinformation after a racist incident makes news. Kids hear that too. Help them better understand that no one is less human than another.
3. Monitor your child’s emotions before, during, and after the conversation. Say, “this is an ongoing conversation.” You’re going to keep talking about these issues and they should too. When another incident makes headlines, follow up.

Puffy Sidewalk Chalk Paint Ingredients

1 cup flour
1 cup water
1 tablespoon dish soap – just about any dish soap will work.
5-10 drops food coloring or washable paint
How to Make Sidewalk Chalk Paint

* In a large mixing bowl stir together the flour and water until there are no lumps.

* Stir in the dish soap to the flour mixture.

* Add food coloring of your choice of color until the desired color is achieved.

* Pour the mixture into your squeeze bottle or use a ziplock bag and cut one corner off.

Use it all in one day, they explode if just left closed. Doesn't save well.

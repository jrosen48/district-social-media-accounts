There will be a plan drafted and available as soon as possible to all.

We want to return to full capacity and normal but most likely we have ES students here much of the week, MS/HS students will have a brick and mortar schooling combined with a distance learning model. This is all to increase social distancing and be as safe as possible.

For those parents who definitely do not want their children in school, we will accommodate them with a distance learning model so they can still be a Grand Valley student and return when they are comfortable.

Have a good week and we will update you with the plan asap.

All scholarships should be returned directly to those addresses or emails instructed in the applications. If a scholarship is a Grand Valley High School one and the directions say to turn it into the guidance office, mail it to Grand Valley High School with attention to the Guidance Department. If you need to make arrangements to drop off your documents, please contact Mrs. Gibbons via email or at 440-805-4545.

Again, please go to the school webpage and select ""Menu,"" ""Documents,"" and ""Grand Valley High School"" to find our scholarship folder. Much luck to our seniors as they work to secure these local scholarships!",2020-04-14 18:00:09,,

Subject: Lockdown

Date: November 5, 2019

Earlier today the school sent out a message indicating why we closed our doors and kept students on the buses. I should of not used the word ""funny"" as I was using it in the context of ""strange or suspicious noise"". It was actually a popping sound off in the distance that only one staff member heard. As a safety precaution, we put our safety plan into place. After much investigation and deliberation, the administration and law enforcement officials deemed the campus to have no danger. We take all safety concerns here at Grand Valley seriously.

Best Regards,

Subject: Lockdown

Date: November 5, 2019

Earlier today the school sent out a message indicating why we closed our doors and kept students on the buses. I should of not used the word ""funny"" as I was using it in the context of ""strange or suspicious noise"". It was actually a popping sound off in the distance that only one staff member heard. As a safety precaution, we put our safety plan into place. After much investigation and deliberation, the administration and law enforcement officials deemed the campus to have no danger. We take all safety concerns here at Grand Valley seriously.

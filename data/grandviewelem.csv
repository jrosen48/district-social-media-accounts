Favorite Book Character Challenge-
It is National Library Week!
If you were at Grandview last year, you might remember our favorite book character potato challenge. This year, I am challenging you to create your favorite book character out of whatever you wish. It can be done on paper, created from clay, legos, food items, or anything you can get your hands on and want to use. Email photos of your character to Mrs. Bell (bellc@huskersk12.org) or post in the comments here. There will be a winner from PK-2 and 3-5 just like last year as well as a Middle School, High School and an adult winner. Have fun and keep reading!

This filled my bucket so full today! Bummed that I had to leave all the fun! But while I was there I enjoyed seeing so many faces and waving. I miss my students and my coworkers! ❤️❤️❤️ sorry if I missed seeing you today! I only made it half way through town before having to leave the parade. We definitely have a great community! Join me at 11 tomorrow for another great art project!",2020-03-25 22:13:36,,

We wanted to update you on several items as we end this first week being absent from school.

For our district, our priority is the safety of students, staff, and the community. That priority is how we are making all other decisions. With that being said, starting next week, staff will reach out through electronic communication and provide learning materials, opportunities, and resources to students in order to maintain their essential skills while we are on this break.

Also, next week there will be a small change to our meal distribution. In order to minimize social contact, meals will be provided once a day and will include both lunch and breakfast. The schedule will be as follows.

Monday, 3/23 - 8:00 - 9:00, breakfast will be available. Then from 11:00 - 12:00, Monday lunch and Tuesday breakfast will both be served together

Each day thereafter, from 11:00 - 12:00, that day's lunch and the next day's breakfast will be provided during one pick-up time.

Please continue to practice safe hygiene and social distancing and stay healthy!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1151486111856057&id=514245392246802,,0.0,"Hello parents,

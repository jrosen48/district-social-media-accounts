Granite parents: We are working towards optimal communications with you! Please follow these prompts to be engaged with us so there is better daily, weekly, monthly communications. Thanks for partnering with us!!!

Looking forward to seeing our students tomorrow!!!! Remember face masks and some type of water bottle your child can refill during the day.

Also, your child's temp will be taken prior to entering their classroom.

If you drop your child off in mornings, please remember ONE WAY heading NORTH by 3rd grade, stopping in crosswalk. No parking cars in street nor blocking school buildings. 😉

New change for lunch:
.....4th, 5th, 6th, will eat with their teachers in the designated spaces in the old gym. Skip has set up tables and fans. It looks really good and is surprisingly cooler than lunchroom most days.
....7th and 8th: will meet in Old Gym before school and they will eat in the old gym with a teacher on duty.

Looking forward to our first week!🥰",3.0,"David Listena Prickett

Ok everyone, this is defiantly not perfect but I think it will be a blast anyway. Tomorrow is the first annual Granite Alumni Softball Tournament. Attached is the bracket and the teams that I know of. I know some of the teams may have changed a little and that is fine. Make sure everyone knows that it costs $25 per player to play and you have to alternate batting order and follow the previously posted rules on positioning. You can come pay Coach Snider in the concession ( He may be officiating a bit) or pay your team captain and they can bring the money. I will have Tee shirts in the concession split up by team. All of the basic slow pitch rules are in affect. Please come ready to have fun and not cause problems. We have volunteer umpires so please treat them with respect and just have a good time. See everybody there!!!",0.0,"Granite Baseball

Keep Saturday, August 1st open. This year we are going to try to increase our participation and get the alumni softballers involved as we change our annual baseball game to a 1 day coed slow pitch tournament. We plan to play the tournament at the little league fields with coed rules to speed up the tournament. Excited to see how this goes. I'll get more information out soon. Just wanted to let everybody know so they can mark it on their calendars.",2020-09-12 13:56:42.579482,,

Well this was not intended when we chose them but the Meinert’s would have ran away with the banquet this year if we would of had one. William Meinert was the Star Greenhand this year. Will was a three time state qualifier. 2 times in speeches and once in opening and closing ceremonies. He’s one more speech contest in the last year and a half then most kids win in anything. Great young man that will have an outstanding future. Next are our two honorary degree recipients. Terran Meinert was my right hand man this year. He covered my classes almost every time I was gone. He also helped to remodel the ag building and was there anytime the chapter needed him. Last but certainly not least is Mike Meinert. Without Mike, the ag building wouldn’t look the way it does now. He put the idea in my head to remodel the ag building and without his suggestion it wouldn’t look how it does now. Mike and Terran also came up on their own time and leveled the ceiling and gave great advice on the work. Thank you for your service to the chapter. Great men! Great family!",0.0,"Kyle Norvell is with Addisyn Nolan and 16 others.

Well we didn’t get to have a banquet this year but we still have great young people who earned recognition. This years “Never Settle” award winner is Karai Blakley. When Karai entered FFA last year she was a quite young lady who didn’t speak because she didn’t like the way she pronounced words. She really struggled speaking but decided to give speeches anyways. This year she spent three nights a week saying phrases I gave her to improve. She now speaks clearly and would have had an outstanding spring if not for the lockdown. Although she never had the successes like others in the chapter, she never quit, she never gave up, but most of all she never settled for anything less than her best. She understood that she wasn’t perfect but if she worked to correct her flaws she could become more so. Great young lady and hope others learn from her example.",0.0,"Kyle Norvell is with Addisyn Nolan and 14 others.

Granite Seniors:
We want to recognize and honor our seniors on Facebook. So here is a little creative project we need you guys to do. 👌
1. Have a photo shoot. We need a picture in your quarantine T-shirt for sure! (We'd also love a picture in your cap and gown. )Be creative on setting and poses. Best lighting is outside! Text or email those two pictures to Mrs. Coffin, your Sr. Sponsor.
2. Write 2-3 sentences about your plans for the future, what you love and what you will miss most about your school and your town, etc. Include this in your text/email. 👌

We will be posting these as soon we get them, hopefully 1 or 2 people a day.
Thank you! Congratulations 2020 Seniors ❤",0.0,"David Listena Prickett

Granite Seniors:
We want to recognize and honor our seniors on Facebook. So here is a little creative project we need you guys to do. 👌
1. Have a photo shoot. We need a picture in your quarantine T-shirt for sure! (We'd also love a picture in your cap and gown. )Be creative on setting and poses. Best lighting is outside! Text or email those two pictures to Mrs. Coffin, your Sr. Sponsor.
2. Write 2-3 sentences about your plans for the future, what you love and what you will miss most about your school and your town, etc. Include this in your text/email. 👌

We will be posting these as soon we get them, hopefully 1 or 2 people a day.
Thank you! Congratulations 2020 Seniors ❤",2020-04-23 10:37:00,,

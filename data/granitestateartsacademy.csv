In all the theatre classes, we compiled the names of male characters in all the scripts that we have read this semester (minus the villains and creepy characters.) Our goal was to give him a name that will help him be adopted faster and so would have some social media appeal as well. We also considered input from his foster family on his personality. A poll was created and the voting results are in!

Everyone, meet ""Baby Boy-C"" who is now named Herbie!
Herbie is a very lovable and loyal character from the musical, Gypsy.

I think this name will appeal to potential adopters and help this guy find a loving home!

Our first remote learning art project.

Consider the current situation we are in with the closing of schools and quarantine happening around us. Think about the feelings of panic, fear, confusion and anxiety that people are experiencing now. How do you feel personally about all of this? Think about those feelings and imagine what they might look like if you put a tangible form to them. Is it a familiar object? Is it a particular color? Write down some descriptive words regarding what it looks like and create a piece of art that represents how you feel.

Our 6th Annual Gala was a roaring good time!
Thank you to everyone who came out in support of our school and students we look forward to seeing you all at next year‘s Gala.

Some of our guests were unable to attend and asked if they could make a donation after the Gala was over so we made a giving link: www.gsaanh.org/gala

However we did fall short of our fundraising needs by $8,811.00. Many of you who could not attend or were concerned about attending have asked for a way to donate online.

Our best fundraiser of the night and one you can still help greatly with is our Fund A Future effort. This is a direct donation to fill the gap between the $14,500.00 traditional schools get per student and the $7,188.00 Charters get per student. This money goes to direct support of students and curriculum.

Please help us reach our goal !!!
Only $8,811.00 more to raise. We can do it. And you can help.",0.0,"Granite State Arts Academy added 41 new photos.

If all of our followers would give just $10.00 that would be over $14,000 that could double with Facebook Giving match, here is a little more information about GSAA.

As a public charter school in NH, we are funded at about 45% of the funding that a traditional public school receives. Yet, with half the budget, we are expected to provide the same educational opportunities as a traditional high school. This reality means we must fill that funding gap through various forms of fundraising.

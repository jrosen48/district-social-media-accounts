I wanted to make you all aware (if you are not already) that Consolidated Communications (aka Fairpoint) is offering free internet for students for two months – if the situation worsens they could potentially extend that period of time. When you call the number (877) 771-4338 you need to specifically ask if they are offering free internet (they are not able to actually put the offer out there first).

I hope everyone is doing well!!

COVID-19 has arrived in Maine. Based on recommendations from Governor Mills, the Maine Department of Education, and the Maine Center for Disease Control, all non-essential travel for school students and employees has been suspended. In addition to this safety measure, all outside and after school activities have also been canceled. These decisions will be reviewed and updated based on the recommendations from the Maine Department of Education and the Maine Center for Disease Control.

To make up a snow day and preserve instruction time, March 20th will now be an early release day for students. March 20th was originally a no school day for students and a workshop day for staff.

We appreciate your patience as we work to limit our potential exposure to COVID-19.

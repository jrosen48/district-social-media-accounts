Also, Dental safari will be coming to Grant and Illini in January 2021. I encourage all students to use this service, and as a reminder, all students in Kindergarten, 2nd, and 6th grade require a dental exam due May 15th of that school year.

These dental exams must be done within 18 months of the due date, so if your student will be entering one of these grades this coming year (2020) or the following school year (2021), this date will cover the requirement.

Parents you are crushing it, coping with it, navigating it, readjusting it, and at times fed up with it. Take a moment today to be proud of yourself. Take a moment to see how proud you are of your children, who also have had to ebb, flow, adjust, and flex. Many of you are still working as an Essential Workers and we want to Thank You. All of you have a new job title of educator you can attach to your thousand other titles you have to wear in a day. We hear you Illini, and we appreciate you. We are in this together and we are here for you. Keeping our kids and community safe has to stay our number one priority.

For some of you at this point it is like the end of winter break. The time together was nice, but let’s face it, it can be exhausting. The honeymoon is over and some of you might be struggling a bit. Remember we are here. Need a call from the principal to discuss a lack of wanting to attempt to try the work? Need a video chat with me or Ms Davis to talk about concerns you or your students are having? Maybe your student has a birthday and you’d like us to call or come by and sing Happy Birthday to your child in the driveway(a good 6 ft away promise). Maybe your child has been doing really great or worked hard on a difficult task and you would like a certificate of recognition sent from us in the mail.
Just know we are here to support you. We know your job as a parent was hard enough before this pandemic, and we understand the need for support now. I am just an email away. Feel free to reach out.

Many departments across the metro-east area are receiving more and more complaints of teens and young adults playing basketball, soccer, and participating in other outdoor gatherings, basically disregarding social distancing.

The past few weeks have been mentally exhausting for everyone of all ages. If we continue to follow the recommendations from the medical community, we know that we can lessen the spread of COVID-19. Please remember that everyone has an obligation to live responsibly and shelter in place.

It is critical for all of us to be thoughtful of our vulnerable groups, the elderly, and those with pre-existing health conditions. COVID-19 can cause death or severe sickness if contracted. Be a part of the solution and be mindful of others. We will get through this!",0.0,"Fairview Heights Police

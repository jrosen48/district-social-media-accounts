With the end of the school year coming to a close in a different fashion, we are offering two options for our families and their student's iPad. If you would like to keep them over the summer until the start of the school year this will be okay. Please remember to keep track of the charging cord and charging block and if you keep your iPad over the summer, please charge it and turn it on ASAP. We need the iPads to ‘check-in’ with our system.

Please email Mrs. Throop at bthroop@grantps.net if you plan on keeping the IPad for the summer.

We have created a tool for you to report any problems you might be having. The link for submitting a tech request is https://mi8.mlworkorders.com. Please use your school account to login to the work order system.

If you would rather return the iPad, charger, and cord, this can be done Thursday, June 4th from 8:00 - 12:00 at the front of high school. Please remove the passcode from the iPad if there is one.

To the Families, Staff, and Students of Grant Public Schools,

It has been reported overnight and this morning that Grant Public Schools passed a School Bond in the elections yesterday. That is not the case. The Board unanimously decided in March to pull the Bond off of the ballot because of the impending uncertainty with COVID-19. We did not feel it was right to ask families to possibly pay a little more in taxes when people would be facing the possibility of changes in their employment status.

We are not sure why it is being reported in this way, we will try to find some answers today. We just wanted to clarify that GPS chose not to go for the Bond at this time.

Students had been working on an argument essay about whether bugs should supplement protein for human consumption. As a culminating activity on Friday, students with permission slips were given the option of consuming mealworms, crickets, and grasshoppers. Our very own Mr. Zuver ate a cricket, along with Mrs. Pifer. Mr. Akin and Mr. Jones ate grasshoppers. Mr. Oatis and I ate mealworms. These staff members were kind enough to be videotaped so that I could show the students before the bug-tasting began.
Several students said the mealworms weren't that bad, were crunchy like corn chips, or tasteless. Grasshoppers and crickets mostly left an almond-like or nutty flavor in the mouth. Several did comment that they would have liked dental floss. (I will have to remember that for next year.)

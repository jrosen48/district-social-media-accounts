Beautiful weather and a reason to celebrate made for a memorable afternoon in Granvile over the weekend!

Like the rest of the nation, the Blue Aces' senior class missed out on a traditional commenecement ceremony, but that didn't stop the village from making recent grads feel special.

Storied Rivals was on hand to capture some of the highlights as the Granville Class of 2020 paraded through town like kings and queens.",2020-05-27 20:05:16,https://video-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/100047480_271113327601961_5255427815674740736_n.mp4?_nc_cat=110&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=Ep44ad_oyaoAX955nmz&_nc_ht=video-atl3-1.xx&oh=2a19ed2fbe1426dafd6584cdc2f57b40&oe=5F5F53B7,

The U.S. Census count of 2020 begins April 1, and it’s critical for every Ohioan to be counted. Why? An incomplete count could affect our state’s schools, families and students.

Population numbers make an impact on a state’s federal funding for quality-of-life areas like education, public safety, highways and health care. Districts, schools and educators can play a vital role in the success of the 2020 census by encouraging school families to take part, especially those associated with hard-to-count populations such as young children, immigrants, low-income households and people with limited access to computers.

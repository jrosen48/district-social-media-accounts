It is just what teachers do.

Every year lately we have been faced with difficult events. Harvey, Imelda, deaths, change. Are we perfect? No. Are we going to get everything right automatically? Probably not. Are we going to love the kids whole heartedly and do everything we can to show up and be their normal and assure them we are ALL getting through this TOGETHER? ABSOLUTELY!

Are we creating things that then will get tossed out? Sure. Are we wanting to know what this will look like? Of course. Are we on the inside freaking out because we need to seem we have it pulled together? Possibly.

BUT.....this is why I love education and my school district.

We are the calm in the chaos, the steady in the ever-changing, the certain in so much uncertainty. We will support our kids and our parents no matter what that looks like.",0.0,"Jenifer Allen Canter

Hello Everyone. Just reminding you that Band Camp is happening these next couple of weeks. There has been some time changes to accommodate our busiest students schedules. We start at 7 am every morning so students can get used to the new start time for band in the mornings this upcoming school year. The band will meet at 7 am and except for special circumstances, students who do not arrive on time will receive extra assignments in Band. We hope everyone is well and ask that you stay safe while we continue to build our program up during this difficult time. Thank you!",4.0,"Hello Everyone.

UIL Academic State Events Postponed Due to COVID-19

AUSTIN ‚Äî Amid growing concerns over COVID-19 (coronavirus), the UIL CX Debate State Tournament and the UIL State Robotics FIRST Tech Challenge will be postponed until further notice. Participating schools will be notified directly by UIL with updates as they become available.

‚ÄúThe health and safety of our students and schools is our number one priority,‚Äù said UIL Executive Director Dr. Charles Breithaupt, ‚ÄúIt is crucial we take every possible precaution to keep participants safe.‚Äù

As this is a fluid situation, the UIL will continue to follow the direction of local officials to monitor this situation and will make additional announcements as needed. Please continue to check the UIL website and social media accounts for further updates.

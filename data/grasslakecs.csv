Good evening everyone,

Recently I received an email from one of our Facebook followers, Kelli Nowaczck. She explained that her two daughters, Addison (age 11) and Avery (age 9) had been hosting lemonade stands this summer, while being mindful of the COVID-19 crisis. They told me they wanted to donate their earnings to help the homeless dogs at the Mikey & Me kennels. 😉

So I invited them out for an afternoon visit last week and Addison and Avery were able to spend time interacting with our current residents. 🐶 They then presented me with $100.00 they had raised at their lemonade stands this summer. The girls explained that some of their customers had rounded up their bill when they advised them that the proceeds would be used to benefit homeless dogs.

Thank you Addison and Avery for your selfless act of kindness. I know that hosting a customer-based fundraiser this summer had to be difficult and I am so very proud of your accomplishment.

Please enjoy these photos of Addison and Avery’s visit last week.

With the announcement yesterday from MHSSA that concession stands are being advised not to open it leave very little opportunity for us to raise the funds needed to support our sports programs however we would like you to join us in the GLRCC Golf outing on Friday August 28th. The profits
from this outing will be split between the Warrior Club, GLRCC and the GSYLL. If you would like more information on team registration/hole sponsorship/silent auction items shoot me an email at klwright72@me.com or call or text 517-392-8811 this has the chance for it to be the one and only fund raising opportunity for the fall.

EDITED!
I know this date is also the first football game of the season. It is a 8am tee off scramble. It will be over by 4pm at the latest. I did not pick the date. Personally I can’t think of a better way to kick off the season then taking the day off from work, golfing with some friends in the morning and afternoon and then head to the football game!

from this outing will be split between the Warrior Club, GLRCC and the GSYLL. If you would like more information on team registration/hole sponsorship/silent auction items shoot me an email at klwright72@me.com or call or text 517-392-8811 this has the chance for it to be the one and only fund raising opportunity for the fall.

EDITED!
I know this date is also the first football game of the season. It is a 8am tee off scramble. It will be over by 4pm at the latest. I did not pick the date. Personally I can’t think of a better way to kick off the season then taking the day off from work, golfing with some friends in the morning and afternoon and then head to the football game!

Mrs. Muto has been a Grass Lake main-stay for many years; seeing change after change after change in instruction, and rolling through it with grace and professionalism. Generations of Grass Lake students can recount Mrs. Muto's kind disposition and supportive nature. We all will miss her very much. Thank you, Patti, for your dedication. (Pictured with Mrs. Muto are colleagues l-r: Mrs. Clark, Mrs. Dentel, Mrs. Bullock, Mrs. Muto, and Mrs. Deedler.)",2020-06-05 16:13:41,,

A few UPDATES that may answer some frequently asked questions:

We are FINALLY able to do CDL Training and Testing. NO CARS/MOTORCYCLES

During the Stay-Home Order, We CANNOT do any driving tests for a regular driver's license, nor can we do any motorcycle testing. We will resume testing on 6/13. You may call us to schedule an appointment, but it will be on or after 6/13.

We CANNOT do any Driver Education at this time; not In-person OR Online. All of our classes have either been cancelled or postponed, including our classes that were scheduled to begin June 8. We do not have any answers as to when we can resume. When the State allows driver education to resume, we will then need to hear from our schools to see if/when we are allowed in their buildings this summer. When we get everything in line, we will be sure to notify the students who have already pre-registered.

2020 Youth Football

As we are all trying to navigate life through these difficult times I hope everyone has stayed safe and healthy.

With that said there is some changes that will affect some of our future players. First the 5th and 6th grade will remain tackle football. Second our 4th grade will play the 2020 season as tackle but the 4th graders for the 2021 season will be transitioning to travel flag football going forward. Third our 3rd graders for this year will be moved to travel flag football. We are following recommendations from the MHSAA and the league we participate in.

If there is any questions at all please contact Brent Jones either by phone 517-795-9712 or email warrioryouthfootball@yahoo.com

We will be opening our greenhouses to the public one week from today! Sales will take place from 10am - 3pm on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday (May 6-8). We will be following guidelines and requirements put in place by JCISD administration and the Governor's Executive orders, which means you will need to wear a face mask, keep proper distance from others at the sale and limit one person per vehicle (we'll have staff to help you). There will also be a traffic flow to follow, so pay attention to the signs when you arrive. This will be a FIRST COME FIRST SERVE sale, so please bring your patience as we work through the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic has brought.

Please take a look at the plant list below to help limit the amount of time spent browsing the sale. Thank you so much for your support and we look forward to helping you with your garden needs next week!",2.0,"Jackson Area Career Center

🌿🌺🌻🌸🌿PLANT SALE UPDATE! 🌿🌸🌻🌺🌿

We will be opening our greenhouses to the public one week from today! Sales will take place from 10am - 3pm on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday (May 6-8). We will be following guidelines and requirements put in place by JCISD administration and the Governor's Executive orders, which means you will need to wear a face mask, keep proper distance from others at the sale and limit one person per vehicle (we'll have staff to help you). There will also be a traffic flow to follow, so pay attention to the signs when you arrive. This will be a FIRST COME FIRST SERVE sale, so please bring your patience as we work through the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic has brought.

Please take a look at the plant list below to help limit the amount of time spent browsing the sale. Thank you so much for your support and we look forward to helping you with your garden needs next week!",2020-05-03 15:56:36,,

Happy World Book Day!

Because of today and what we’re currently going through, I wanted to honor my mom (“Ms. Pam”) and all of the other educators out there who are educating and reading virtually to their students. My mom and her co-teacher are making the best with what they have and are ensuring that their kiddos are still involved, even though they aren’t physically at school.

Reading to your child is super important 💕 To this day, I still love to hear my mom read stories; this is how I got to where I’m at today (working at a library and being a part of story times with young readers). She makes reading fun and this is why I enjoyed it tremendously growing up!

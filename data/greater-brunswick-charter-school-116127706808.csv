August 13, 2020
Based on New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy’s August 12 announcement that school districts may delay in-person learning related to concerns about safety standards, Greater Brunswick Charter School's Board of Trustees has authorized a plan to be submitted to the NJDOE that educates students through the Distance Learning model for the first four months of the 2020-2021 school year. This plan will follow Phase 1A - School Wide Full Distance Learning, as described in our Re-Entry Plan.

A decision regarding the learning model for January will be made at a future date.

We look forward to in-person teaching and learning, when it is safe to do so. Until then, our staff is busy designing rigorous distance learning practices that will increase student engagement, develop valuable real-time interactions, guide achievement, and more!

All the best,

We’re honoring the 5th grade winners of our #SpeciesOnTheEdge Art and Essay Contest with a virtual art show this year! Keep an eye out here on our Facebook page to see all 20 winners who were selected from over 3,000 entries across the state.

Today, we're celebrating Mayrin Reyes-Jackson from Greater Brunswick Charter School in Middlesex County for advocating for the blue-spotted salamander through an outstanding essay and original art piece.

Writing as the blue-spotted salamander in her essay, Mayrin tells us, “Hi there! I’m a blue-spotted salamander. I’m not a very well-known animal, so you probably don’t know that much about me. Sadly, my family has been endangered since 1974 because of those evil humans cutting down our trees!”

We would like to thank the PSEG Foundation, NJEA, Church & Dwight, GAF, Atlantic City Electric, Phillips 66, and Zoological Society of New Jersey for their generous support of this program.

closings caused by the corona virus, I have received many requests by educators to have my permission for them to read and record my books only for their students.

“And the people stayed home.
And read books, and listened, and rested, and exercised, and made art, and played games, and learned new ways of being, and were still.
And listened more deeply. Some meditated, some prayed, some danced. Some met their shadows.
And the people began to think differently.
And the people healed.
And, in the absence of people living in ignorant, dangerous, mindless, and heartless ways, the earth began to heal.
And when the danger passed, and the people joined together again, they grieved their losses, and made new choices, and dreamed new images, and created new ways to live and heal the earth fully, as they had been healed.""

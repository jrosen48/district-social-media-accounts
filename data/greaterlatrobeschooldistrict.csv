The students are fortunate to have these two passionate and caring adults guiding their curriculum and learning. Today I had the honor of presenting my leadership/communication lesson, ‚ÄúThe Art of a Good Conversation: The Hidden Force That Creates Great Leaders,‚Äù to students enrolled in Mrs. Pellegrino's Lincoln on Leadership class. The teens learned tips to become good listeners and speakers as well as the six habits of well-liked people. They now know how to avoid awkward conversations, politely exit a boring conversation, and 10 topics never to discuss. They were also introduced to a bold, counterintuitive new theory of leadership drawn from the captains who led the greatest teams in sports history. The students I met at Latrobe are well on their way to becoming wonderfully empathetic, strong leaders and I am proud to have been part of their learning the necessary skills to do so!",3.0,"Good Manners Group

He showed them an example of a Personal Planning Analysis, which he and his team create for each of his clients. Students learned about different types of investments, the stock market, asset allocation, and tips on how to manage investments as a young professional versus retirement. Aldo's best piece of advice for the students was to develop good budgeting habits now - saving a little bit of money each month and making it a habit that will carry on throughout their lifetime.

The students were led in the Star Spangled Banner by students from all three elementary schools.

Students then enjoyed outdoor competition at 8 different activity stations: basketball shoot, base running, soccer dribble, jump rope, 100m dash, sit ups, running long jump, and softball throw.

After the surprise, the two of them decided to help serve a nutritious meal to students in the elementary school cafeteria.

Secretary Rivera then visited 1st and 2nd graders who were creating kindness pennants for one another - each student wrote kind messages to their classroom neighbors. He then visited classrooms where students were performing the Blue Crayon Play (ways to be kind in a challenging situation), writing compli-mats, painting nice notes onto rocks, and more.

Secretary Rivera ended the visit with a special announcement to students over the school's loud speaker: 'You've made this day a special day, by just your being you. There's no person in the whole world like you, and I like you just the way you are.'",10.0,"Pennsylvania Department of Education

To help celebrate One Four Three Day, take a moment during your day to show kindness to someone ‚Äì like holding a door or picking up a piece of litter. Or, you can show gratitude to someone who has done something kind for you. This way, we can all reflect on how grateful we are to have each other.

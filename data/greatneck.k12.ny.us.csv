North High and South High graduates and their families celebrated commencement earlier this week with memorable drive-in movie experiences at the Town of North Hempstead Beach Park.

High school and district administrators welcomed families for the South High event on June 22, followed by the North High event on June 23. With social distancing measures and safety precautions in place, these events provided the senior classes an opportunity to come together as an audience to view the graduation movies from their vehicles.

The graduation movies featured speeches by students and administrators, and footage from recent senior events including car parades and diploma ceremonies. The movies were also made available online for graduates who wished to watch from home. Graduation movies for our secondary schools will air on GNPS/TV at a later date.

Thank you to the Town of North Hempstead for offering this beautiful venue for these memorable commencement events. Congratulations to the Class of 2020! #GreatNeckStrong #DiscoverGreatness",0.0,"Great Neck Public Schools added 28 new photos.

Last week, students in Health 8 created Mindfulness Logs. Each day, students selected one activity to refocus, relax and reconnect with themselves, and to get ready for the next month of remote learning. The students did an AWESOME job! Ms. Sergi, Ms. D'Oria, and Ms. Sicurella are proud of all our students and the hard work they are doing at home. The students of North Middle are dedicated and committed to keeping up with all their class work during this unpredictable time and we couldn’t be happier with the results.

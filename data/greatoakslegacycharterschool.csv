“Shout out to Ms. Domeville! Ms. Domeville is an amazing asset to our community and has gone above and beyond during our transition to remote learning in holding students accountable, creating student-centered, hands-on activities in ELA AND ART - projects and smaller assignments that are engaging and profoundly rigorous. She follows up with students and families every day, tutors students after the school day has ended, and works tirelessly to engage and support our KWLM. She's pushing our seniors to present independently, collaborate with peers in college level Socratic Seminars, and has designed projects that encourage them to brainstorm ways to have positive impacts on their community.

Despite having long locks, Stephen has been used to his wife doing his daughter's hair, so when she is unavailable right before a big event, Stephen will have to figure it out on his own. This sounds simple enough, but we soon come to find that Zuri's hair has a mind of its own.

When Marley Dias was 11 years old, she was an avid reader but she grew tired of the books she was being given in school because they were all about white boys and their dogs so she was determined about changing that.

In November 2015, Dias launched a campaign #1000BlackGirlBooks and her goal was to collect and donate 1,000 books that feature black girls as the main character. Today, Dias has accumulated more than 9,000 books and has landed a book deal of her own and is now the author of Marley Dias Gets It Done!

Now with the support of GrassROOTS Community Foundation Marley has launched another campaign to send black girl books out globally to Ghana and Jamaica. The deadline is April 1st, 2020.

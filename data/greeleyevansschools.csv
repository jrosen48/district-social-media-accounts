2. Use laundry detergent and the warmest appropriate water setting for the cloth used to make the face mask.
3. Wash by hand. Use a bleach solution - 5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) household bleach per gallon of room temperature water. Make sure the bleach is intended for disinfection. Soak the face mask in the bleach solution for 5 minutes, and rinse thoroughly with cool water.
4. Dry your face mask in the dryer on the highest heat setting or air dry the mask by laying it on a flat surface. If possible, dry your face mask in the sun!

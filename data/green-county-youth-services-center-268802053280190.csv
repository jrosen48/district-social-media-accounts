Yesterday at 12:55 PM ·

Creating a #safesleep plan for your baby is the best way to assure that they are protected from a sleep-related death or injury.

It really is as easy as remembering your ABC’s!

Always make sure that your baby is Alone, on their Back and in a safety-approved Crib for every sleep, at nap time, and at bedtime.

Your baby’s crib should be free of crib bumpers, blankets, stuffed toys, and pillows and should only have a tightly fitted sheet on a firm mattress.

Your baby should always be placed to sleep on their back and should never sleep anywhere other than their crib. Sleeping with your baby in an adult bed, or on a chair or couch can lead to tragedy.

If there is something particularly unsettling, participate in today's activity challenge and dance it out! This aerobic activity is great exercise for the body, but also for our mood. Turn on your favorite song and dance however you like during the duration. Having fun? Turn on a playlist and dance around the house for a few songs!

On behalf of Summer Servings, I would like to thank our community for the out pouring support given over the summer. We were able to provide grocery assistance for 20 families, and it would not have been possible with out the backing of our community and school system! I would also like to personally applaud our school system for allowing children back into the schools this week. I know so many of them needed not only the meals provided, but the love offered inside of those walls! With that being said, during the NTI weeks ahead, GC school system will be offering a meal delivery program . However, if you know of a student that needs supplements in addition to the meal delivery, please contact us! Proud to call GC home! 💚💛🐲",0.0,"Thank you Summer Servings!!

Juniors:
The GCHS Class of 2022 Google Classroom got accidentally archived, all of you all were deleted from the Class. We are working on getting an invite sent to each one of you.

This school year, you will have 8 classes instead of 7. We need you request another class. In the google classroom, there is a link but I have added the link below. Please complete this form ASAP. We CAN’T give out schedules until all students have registered for 8 classes.

After speaking with principals and several other school administrators last week, one thing is clear...no one knows.

When will school start, what happens if the numbers spike, will we be on NTI for the entire year?

The only thing that is clear is that our kids are online more than ever and the predators are online in force.

Our kids need to be educated in the dangers of pedophiles, cyber bullies and consequences of their own poor decisions.

They need to be protected and guided by knowledgeable adults.

We can help with both of those needs with our new online training:
•Safer kids
•Smarter parents and school staff
•Personal Development Hours (available if approved)

Could your school use help educating them and keep them safe, even if they are at home???

Give me a 👍 and I will shoot you a PM to start the conversation.

To all our FRYSC partners, teachers, administrators and school staff stepping up to the plate truly living the “Whatever It Takes” life...we see what you are doing and say thank you.

So instead of just saying thank you, we are going to give back to those that are giving so much.

Chris Brown made me these Bourbon Barrel Heads and Barrel Rings for the FRYSC Victory Over Violence conference (Chris said he can make more for you).

During times like this, I figure the least I can do is brighten a few FRYSC’s day.

So, no share the page, tag 5 friends crap.

If you are a FRYSC, just tag your FRYSC or school’s Facebook page in this post.

If you would like to nominate a Family Resource Youth Service Center Coordinator, just tag their center or the school Facebook Page in this post and they are entered.

This way we know who to thank for their service.

We will select 2 winners from the comments on Wednesday.

Thanks for doing what you do.

Due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, school closings, the CDC’s recommendation of no gatherings larger than 50 people, and the President’s request of gatherings no larger than 10 people, Youthfest 2020 has been postponed.

However, for the last 17 years Youthfest has been a staple in our community during the month of March. Therefore, on Friday March 27, Saturday March 28, and Sunday March 29 tune into Facebook Live to worship with us. We are confident that even as our service looks different at this time, the Word of God will go forward and not return void.

It has been a busy week for the Pratt Greenbacks! Homecoming, football games, regional tennis, golf, cross country and volleyball kept our student athletes, their coaches and families crazy busy. Oh, did I mention it was parent-teacher conferences this week too! The Greenback booster club would like to thank everyone for supporting our students. Whether you brought food for the regional tennis tournament we hosted or bought raffle tickets at the football game, or helped in so many other ways big or small, THANK YOU!

Thank you to Bill Rea for always taking great pictures. It is so nice of him to spend his time, his gas money, to share his talent and his photos, so friends and family can watch and cheer.

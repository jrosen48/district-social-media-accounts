An. Awesome. Day! 💚💚

Thanks to our community partners, today Green County Schools was able to deliver 1,934 meals to students AND around 300 food boxes with groceries to assist families over Spring Break. We can’t stress this enough... without these meals, many of our kids would be hungry and without nutritious food!

This was a MONUMENTAL task that could not have happened without our faculty, our staff, and the support of this community! This is not in their job description, but all of our employees have continually and willingly helped us meet the needs of our students during this challenging time.

We love Green County. We love our faculty and staff. We love our students.

Wishing you all a safe, healthy, and socially-distanced Spring Break. We will see you all when daily meal deliveries resume on Monday, April 13.

Also, we are requesting that each child in grades K-4 have an art supply bag. This was not on the original supply list.

Five Greene County/Paton Churdan seniors took the Seal of Biliteracy exam May 8th-12. The students that participated in the exam were: Sophia Ausberger, Kaleb Fisher, Emily Hofer, Kassie Lamoureux, and Angelica Moody. All five passed which will earn them a seal stamp on their transcripts and a medal. Governor Reynolds signed Senate File 475 into law in 2018 which recognizes students who have obtained proficiency in two or more languages. There are four sections of the test: speaking, reading, writing and listening. Students must score at least INTERMEDIATE LOW in all four sections to be granted the seal. This seal allows employers to identify those who are competent in two or more languages. We are extremely proud of the extra work students put into the test! They are all very deserving of this accomplishment!",0.0,"Greene County High School

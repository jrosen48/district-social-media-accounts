Census 2020 Update
The US Census has made two very important decisions. They will be closing the census to responses on September 30, 2020 and due to COVID-19 concerns, the Census Bureau is adapting their outreach efforts and may not have the same intensity as in previous Census counts, and thus may not have the same potential effectiveness. For many seniors and shut-ins, this is how they are counted, in addition, there are many people that do not have internet or Facebook. If you are reading this, and know someone that falls in this category, please take a moment to reach out and help them with their census. They can respond by calling 1-844-330-2020.

As stated before, due to the possibility of severe weather today, the superintendent and central office staff are closely monitoring the forecast. If the winds are too strong or the weather is too dangerous at dismissal time, we will delay the release of buses until the danger has passed. Our first priority is to keep our students safe.

If you choose to pick up your child from school early today due to weather concerns, we encourage you to do so prior to 2:00 p.m. Once the bus release process has started, we will not be releasing students who are scheduled to ride the bus for parent pickup. Students who are already scheduled for parent pickup (daily car riders) will be released as usual. Thank you.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3443176685724843&id=141999652509246,,0.0,"Dear Parents and Guardians,

Dr. Shirley Ann Jackson is an American physicist who received her Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1973. She was the first African-American woman to earn a doctorate in nuclear physics at MIT. In addition to her lengthy list of academic achievements, she also has an impressive number of inventions under her belt.

Her experiments with theoretical physics paved the way for numerous developments in telecommunications. We have Dr. Jackson to thank for caller ID, call waiting, the touch-tone telephone, the fiber-optic cable, and much more.

Yesterday, students from Mr. Thompson and Mr. Nesbit’s class had the opportunity to visit Plant Vogtle, a Georgia Power nuclear power plant in Waynesboro, Georgia.

Students toured the cooling tower and the control room training facility where future plant operators are trained. In addition to the tour there was a “lunch and learn” where information was given on how the plant and nuclear energy works as well as a brief history of Plant Vogtle itself.

We would like to thank Mr. Bobby Hildreth, Area Manager of Georgia Power, for coordinating the tour for our students, Mr. Mike McCraken for providing a wonderful tour experience, and GCCA CEO Mr. John Ellenberg for coming along to take part and see first-hand what our students are learning.",0.0,"This week, GCCA students visited a Georgia Power nuclear power plant in Waynesboro!

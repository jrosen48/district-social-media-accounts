Hi Friends,

Today the Governor announced a new tier system for what can be open in light of Covid19. These rules will go in effect this coming Monday. While we remain in the most restrictive category, there are some significant changes for us. Notably, Barbers and Salons can return to work indoors, also malls, or in our case, in door Mercados or markets can open again with lower occupancy numbers. Please glance over these to see if they impact you, and remain safe.

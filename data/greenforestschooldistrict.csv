There will be no 7th Grade Football this week. Our 7th Grade season starts a little later than JR High and High School so we have a little more time closer to the start of school to get this started.

Congratulations to the members of the Chamber Choir for the 2020-2021 school year!

This was NOT an easy decision by any means. I know this year's auditions were an anomaly, considering our current situation. I took extra care in trying to make the best of it for the students. If you were not selected for Chamber Choir this year, I genuinely hope that you audition again next year. If you would like to discuss your audition, I'd be happy to answer questions via email.

I don't have all the information about what this year is going to look like for us, but we will adjust and make the best of it. That's what Tigers do!

Congratulations again to those selected, and see you all soon.

Caps and gowns and umbrellas! Tonight, Friday, May 15, at 6 p.m., a bunch of Green Forest moms have planned a drive-by parade for the GFHS Class of 2020 in front of Cattlemen's Restaurant on Main Street.

""We are going forward as planned,"" says Jodie Parsons DeMeyer with the Tigers Booster Club. ""I told the kids to bring umbrellas!""

The plan is for graduates to stand six feet apart from each other in front of Cattlemen's, waving at friends, family and Tiger fans driving past honking, flashing lights and blowing kisses.

The procession will start on Olive Street between Blaine Andrews' Town & Country Veterinary Clinic and the back doors of First Baptist Church -- then will proceed past the grads and exit the Cattlemen's parking lot at the Butterball Feed Mill.

Our Athlete of the week is Emily Lozano!

Emily is a freshman at GFHS, so it is her first year playing for the Senior High Lady Tigers Soccer Team. She is an exceptional soccer player who demonstrates great ball control, determination, and fight in the middle of the field. Monday night against Berryville she scored 2 out of 3 of our goals to help beat the Berryville Lady Bobcats. Congratulations!!

Shout out to our partnering sponsors Jim's Drive In and The GF Tiger Booster Club for helping make this possible.

Congratulations to Brenda and Von Bishop and Gayla and Steve Newberry for winning the longest Green Forest married couple in attendance at the game last night . Originally we were only going to recognize one couple but with all things considered we decided we couldn’t stop at just one . The gift certificates are to Hometown Scoop which is owned by Summer Newberry and Jarod Newberry who are originally from Green Forest. So far the oldest Alumni and longest married couple have been recognized. If you have any ideas on how we can spotlight and recognize Green Forest success stories please let me know .

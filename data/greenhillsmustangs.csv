Through a topic study of Income Tax Tables, students learned about the application of a compound inequality in a financial situation. Students watched a video (Where Do Your Tax Dollars Go?) and then discussed the programs that income taxes support. Students learned to read and analyze income tax tables for Single and Married Taxpayers, and also the historical trends of the highest income tax brackets since 1958.

Preliminary test results are in, and while we do not have them in our hands, RK Environmental has shared that there was a presence (mod potential) found in 19 of 59 rooms. A professional company will be brought in to begin the cleanup process as this is not a job our custodians are equipped to do.

School will be canceled until further notice. An update will follow tomorrow. I wish I could tell you the timeframe but it is dependent on cleanup and the advice of our environmental expert.

It was shared with us that this could not have been avoided. The combination of the summer humidity, the amount of rain, our roof project, and the uni-vent project caused an insurmountable amount of moisture to accumulate in our school.

Once we tested and took the approach of moving classes we ran the risk of running out of rooms.

I am also a strong proponent of collaboration and look forward to working alongside you in the most important and meaningful endeavor of our lives: raising and educating our children.

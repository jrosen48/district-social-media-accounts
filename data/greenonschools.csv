Every Monday on Dragons social media, we will be featuring a Dragons MVP Program winner's story. This week’s #MVPMonday recognizes Cody P. from Indian Valley Intermediate School!

Cody is in the 5th grade and enjoys the challenge that every subject in school presents. When he grows up, Cody wants to be a veterinarian so he can help animals in need. Aside from horseback riding, Cody enjoys teaching his Australian Shepherd how to do tricks including “up”, “down”, “twist”, “go backward”, and “come forward”. When asked what he can’t live without, Cody said, “My family because they are always there. If I have my family, I don’t need anything else!” Cody said that if he had $1,000, he would help out his town by getting them all the food and supplies they need.

I hope you do not remember this as the time that the world was scary. Remember this as the time you learned something new. A time when your reading class consisted of reading to your younger siblings or your pets. When your math class was using measurements to learn to cook. Or, the time that your gym class consisted of a spontaneous dance party. So use your Tik Tok and Fortnite dances and get moving. But most importantly, remember this as the time you spent with your families and loved ones. A time of relaxation and taking care of each other and yourself. Right now the health, both physical and mental, of our Greenon students and families is priority number one. Be safe, be healthy and be kind. We are all in this together!

I hope you do not remember this as the time that the world was scary. Remember this as the time you learned something new. A time when your reading class consisted of reading to your younger siblings or your pets. When your math class was using measurements to learn to cook. Or, the time that your gym class consisted of a spontaneous dance party. So use your Tik Tok and Fortnite dances and get moving. But most importantly, remember this as the time you spent with your families and loved ones. A time of relaxation and taking care of each other and yourself. Right now the health, both physical and mental, of our Greenon students and families is priority number one. Be safe, be healthy and be kind. We are all in this together! We miss you more than you could ever know!

1) Does anyone have access to an industrial sewing machine?

Additionally, we would like double stitch a section of heavy duty tarp onto the sock.

2) Does anyone have access to a machine capable of transferring our logo and product name onto a tarp? This tarp will be out in the weather, so we will need something that won’t easily wear.

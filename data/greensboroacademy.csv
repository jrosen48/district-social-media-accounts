Some of our chromebooks are experiencing a connectivity lag. Meaning, when a student attempts to log in they either keep getting kicked back to the log in screen or they get kicked into the wifi connection window. NHA is working on a solution for this widespread issue.

The solution we have found to work is as follows:

Turn off chromebook for about 20 seconds.
Turn back on.
Leave chromebook sit open - DO NOT LOG IN - for about 10 minutes.
Then log in.

We are hoping this helps alleviate any frustration our families may be having with these new technology assets.

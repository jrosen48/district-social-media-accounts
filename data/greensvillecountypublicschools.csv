We are considering this option following state legislation amending the Code of Virginia regarding the setting of school calendars. Previously, schools had to obtain a waiver to start before Labor Day due to legislation known as the Kings Dominion Law.

Benefits of starting prior to Labor Day include ending the first semester prior to Winter Break and ending school by the end of May. A major concern regarding a pre-Labor Day start is the length of the summer break during the first year of implementation will be shortened. Another concern is the fact that some families have pre-planned vacations which may be impacted.

Greensville County Public Schools is the only school division in Region 8, without a pre-Labor Day start. The Board is interested in hearing from all of our stakeholders in order to make an informed decision. Thank you in advance for completing this survey.

The safety and well-being of all Greensville County Public Schools students is our highest priority. Bullying of any kind is not tolerated in our schools or on our school buses. The behaviors demonstrated in this incident are disturbing, and are being addressed promptly according to the Student Code of Conduct and school division policy. We share the concerns of our community about this situation and will be exploring more ways to clearly communicate to our students and families how to prevent this kind of incident from occurring in the future.

September 19, 2017 at 4:04 PM · Boston, MA ·

It is Teacher Tuesday! Our September Instructor Spotlight features Fain Riopelle, an EdForce instructor recently hired as a ninth and tenth grade English teacher at Greensville County Public Schools in Emporia, VA.

Fain states, “When the kids get it, their look of realization is great. I’m teaching some complex stuff; essentially, it’s all the things I wish I had known before going through high school and college. As such, some of it is stuff I would give to college students. So, when they can wrap their heads around it, I know we’re making progress—real progress that’s going to help them in the future.”

PCG Education would like to thank Fain for his inspirational dedication to students. We are looking forward to hearing stories of success and accounts of how he has positively changed students’ lives. #EdForce

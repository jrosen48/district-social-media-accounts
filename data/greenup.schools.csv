I will be honest that we have prepared for many options but the date 9/28/20 was never in the realm of possibilities. This date does not mean we can‚Äôt begin instruction via NTI and the GC Virtual Academy. Our team is working tirelessly to redo the entire action plan and calendar. I know you want and deserve answers. We will provide an update once we have had a moment to reboot, recreate, and share plans with our board of education and employees.

Later this week, we will release specifics about how a typical school day will look for an elementary, middle, or high school student. We are also organizing a Virtual Academy Orientation for you to review as you decide on enrolling in that option. The orientation will highlight the requirements of the virtual option and how it is very different from NTI that will be used if schools are closed at various times for the pandemic or inclement weather. As parents ourselves, we are giving tremendous thought and consideration to each aspect of our return to school plan. Our goal is to be transparent and informative.

Good late morning everyone,
I just want to send a quick message about a personal challenge. My family has been assisting with the direct care of my father-in-law while battling pancreatic cancer. This morning he lost his battle and we are grieving. At this time I have asked the central office team to cover any duties or needs that you may normally send directly to me. We did meet yesterday and revised some of our NTI services and that will be coming out publicly soon. My ""Sit Down with the Superintendent"" session has been canceled for this week. All communications will be going through the district main page until next week when I can return. Currently my family is taking my mother in law to my husband's home town in WV to mourn and prepare for private arrangements. I appreciate all that you are doing to take care of our GC families and I promise to be back on the front line soon. In the meantime take care of each other #TogetherGC #TogetherKY.

To our loyal customers, we are in unfortunate times. We hope and pray that everyone is staying safe and healthy. A lot of you have been asking if we would still be open and serving food during this time when restaurants and bars have to be closed. Of course, the bar cannot be open and we cannot be open for dine in. But we want you to know that we will be open for curbside pickup and will be implementing a delivery service for a fee of $2.00 within the Village of Greenview. We will be working with a limited staff and limited hours.

So hours will be as such starting tomorrow:
Lunch hours 11am to 2pm Monday thru Saturday.
Dinner hours 5pm to 8pm Monday thru Thursday and 4pm to 8pm Friday and Saturday.

Please call 968-2250 to make your order and let us know if it will be for pickup or delivery.

At this time they are saying this will be for the next 2 weeks. But we will keep you updated with any changes to that.

Again, please stay safe and we believe we will get through this trying time together. Thank you for your understanding from the owners, Bill & Connie Willis.",3.0,"Please consider support Chili Bears if possible!

The link on this page is to an excel sheet that demonstrates the increase to taxes a residential property could see with the March 17 referendum. You can enter a property value in cell B1 and the sheet will show the increase in taxes. You will need to have excel on your computer to use this form.

The referendum is to make renovations to the campus and the money that would be borrowed would be used only for building purposes. The anticipated raise to taxes would still keep CUSD #200 in line with neighboring school districts tax rates. We will have meetings to share information on March 3rd and March 12th both starting at 6:30 pm. Please contact me if you have questions about this project. This is a great opportunity to give our students an upgraded and modern learning facility!

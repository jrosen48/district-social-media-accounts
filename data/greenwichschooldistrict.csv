As we monitor the COVID-19 outbreak locally and globally, it has become abundantly clear that we must continue to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 by practicing social distancing.

By an executive order from Governor Murphy directing, ""All public, private, and parochial preschool programs, and elementary and secondary schools, including charter and renaissance schools, will be closed beginning on Wednesday, March 18, 2020, and remain closed as long as the Order remains in effect"". We are closely monitoring the situation and reassessing the duration of this closure.

The District will continue to implement our telelearning plan in order to provide student instruction during this executive order. At this point, the reopening of school will be determined by Governor Murphy.

It is with great sadness that I report the passing of one of our beloved 8th grade students, Jennifer Costaesilva, and her mother Petrizzia. Jen along with her mother and father were traveling in Virginia yesterday when they were involved in a fatal automobile accident. Jen’s father remains hospitalized.

Jen was a wonderfully sweet girl, who had a sharp wit, intelligence, sense of humor, and insight beyond her years. She was a great friend to so many peers and was a bright light in their day. This is a great loss to the GTSD family.

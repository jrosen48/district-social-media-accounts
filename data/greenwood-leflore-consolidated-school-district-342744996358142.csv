RE: SENIOR PORTRAITS

The Greenwood Commonwealth is in the process of obtaining senior portraits from Amanda Elzy High School, Greenwood High School and Leflore County High School for its annual graduation edition.

If you did not have your senior portrait taken by Lamb’s Photography, Bruckner’s Photography or any other photography company who knows to send your portrait to the newspaper, please tell your photographer to call David Monroe at the Greenwood Commonwealth at 662-453-5312 to ensure your senior portrait will be included in the special edition.

THE Commonwealth does not use casual senior photos. Only drape, tux or cap and gown photos are needed.

Also, if you decided to take a second senior portrait to replace the first portrait, YOU must NOTIFY the newspaper of the change.

Portraits below are proofs and have not been retouched by the photographer.

If you have any questions or concerns, you may email GLCSD Public Information Officer Margaret Dean at mdean@glcsd.org.

For our Winter Sports Intensive 6th, 7th and 8 graders got to take ski and snowboard lessons @powdermountain for 3 days. For their service day they filmed a professional video for @powdermountain, a ""how to"" for other schools. The students were very professional and did a great job! After that the students went to the @utaholympicoval and learned how to do the sport of Curling. @utaholympicovalcurling
They learned from Olympic medalist Derek Parra.

Thank you for coming to participate in Learner Goal Conferences! We had an amazing turn out and it was fantastic to see all of you involved with your students. If you were unable to attend please make arrangements with your child‚Äôs teacher to come in and set goals with your student. It was so powerful to see you in crew and then working with your students to set goals for their future! We have seen so much growth in our students this year both academically and in their character. We can‚Äôt wait to see the progress they make for their Student Led Conferences in November.

Let's have another great week at Greenwood! We only have 2 weeks before Fall Break comes and the quarter ends! We are already approaching the ¬º mark! Together we are ROCKING it this year! Please let us know if you have questions or concerns. We are so grateful for all of you!

Parent Suns,

Last Wednesday was our first Forest Crew (thanks Coach D!) and it went really well! We learned about the Trash Vortex and how to take care of our environment. You may want to ask your student how they are helping to take care of Greenwood. We committed to pick up trash and our equipment on the playground this month. We also touched a little on how being kind and the way that we speak are part of being an environmental steward. We had our first camp out of the year with Upper Grove! It was so fun to spend time with them outdoors. Thanks to our fabulous Upper Grove teachers and Dubois for planning and carrying out a really great outdoor experience for our students. This week we will finish up our beginning of the year testing and get fully into our targeted instruction time. I can‚Äôt wait to see how our kids excel this year!

I‚Äôm looking forward to another amazing week at Greenwood! We have awesome families and we are really ROCKING GREENWOOD this year! :)

Parent Suns,

Last Wednesday was our first Forest Crew (thanks Coach D!) and it went really well! We learned about the Trash Vortex and how to take care of our environment. You may want to ask your student how they are helping to take care of Greenwood. We committed to pick up trash and our equipment on the playground this month. We also touched a little on how being kind and the way that we speak are part of being an environmental steward. We had our first camp out of the year with Upper Grove! It was so fun to spend time with them outdoors. Thanks to our fabulous Upper Grove teachers and Dubois for planning and carrying out a really great outdoor experience for our students. This week we will finish up our beginning of the year testing and get fully into our targeted instruction time. I can‚Äôt wait to see how our kids excel this year!

I‚Äôm looking forward to another amazing week at Greenwood! We have awesome families and we are really ROCKING GREENWOOD this year! :)

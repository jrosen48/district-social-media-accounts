We really enjoy the art projects we have done as a family. The way we can do at our own pace. The support from our teachers has been wonderful.
What have you found to be challenging?
The most challenging is that we aren’t teachers. We don’t all have the patience or the skill level to teach our kiddos. It has made us much more grateful for the teachers at the school.

What do you like best about Distance Learning?
The peace of mind it provides by knowing our student and others are able to stay home, be socially distant, and remain healthy. Academically we love our bi-weekly class meetings via Google Meet.
What have you found to be challenging?
Balancing the demands of a full-time work schedule while helping and making sure our student stays on track. I’m very grateful to be able to work remotely but it definitely takes multi-tasking to a new level.
Advice for other families:
Do your best to keep to a schedule and routine. We start, take breaks, and end the day regularly at the same time. On Fridays, if all the work is turned in, our student gets to take the rest of the day off after our lunch break for “Friday Fun.” It has worked as a great incentive!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157134837227470&id=166473302469,,0.0,"Our Distance Learning Spotlight shines on the Schulz Family from East Orient Elementary School!

Motivation. Being the “only” student at the house can be challenging to keep a Kindergartener motivated and focused.

Oh Highland Community! Do we ever have great news to share!

Our Free Food Market was a HUGE success today!

We supplied food for 220 families today! 220!

Last week we ran out of food, and our community wasn’t having that! 😉 We had donations from many beautiful people today including a MASSIVE donation from our faith-based partner, Mountainview Christian Church. They put out a call to their congregation, and they showed up in large numbers with big hearts, giving hands, and donations galore! We served 50 MORE families than last week and we DID NOT run out of food!

Principal Sewell and her youngest son, Grafton, spent three hours converting our lobby into a storage pantry so that we are better organized and prepared for future Free Food Market dates.

We can’t say “thank you” enough to Mountainview Christian Church, all the good, giving people, the volunteers that make this Market happen, and the leadership of Ms. Betty, Ms. Dani, and Ms. Sandra.

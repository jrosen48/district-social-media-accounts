The primary fundraiser for the Fine Arts Programs each year is running the Football Concession Stand. The money we raise directly benefits students in art, band, chorus, drama and speech.
Due to state restrictions, we are unable to provide a concession stand at this Friday's scrimmage. Fans will need to bring their own beverages and snacks. Schools can begin offering concession stands on Monday, August 24th.
Next week, we will be emailing the sign up link for this season's football games. We host the first high school football game next Friday against Meskwaki. We are reviewing the state's recommendations for concession stands and will be including some information in the email for our volunteers. We will still need our awesome volunteers to have a successful fundraising season for the Fine Arts Programs.

The 48th annual Iowa Shrine Bowl was set for Saturday, July 18, 2020. We are very proud that our very own Gladbrook-Reinbeck Senior, Aidan Walters, was selected as one of the 42 athletes to participate in the North vs South All-Star Game. Due to the events over the past few months we regret to inform all of REBEL NATION that the game has been cancelled for the summer of 2020.

The Iowa Shrine Bowl Board of Directors met recently and made this very difficult decision. They evaluated the size of the event, and with the social distancing guidelines, they did not feel it would be safe to host this year's football camp, game, parade, or banquet. This is disappointing to all of the game's participants and everyone associated with the Iowa Shrine Bowl. We are very appreciative of those individuals, groups, and businesses who donated, as all money will benefit those in need at the Shriners Hospital for Children.

We are hard at work planning for our upcoming kindergarten class for the fall of 2020. With the closing of the building we won't be holding a traditional kindergarten round up. Instead we are working on a plan for kindergarten round up in August.

In the next week, we'll be mailing the kindergarten packets that we usually give out at the parent meeting. We'll mail these out to families we have in our school information system. If you know of any other families with students who will be attending kindergarten in the fall, please contact the school at 319-345-2822 and we'll get information sent out. As a reminder, students eligible for kindergarten must be five years old by September 15, 2020.

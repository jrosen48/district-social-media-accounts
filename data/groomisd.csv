Please remember as we return to school that the dress code has not changed. If your student has dyed their hair for summer it will need to be a NATURAL color upon return. Colors not considered to be natural are burgundy, magenta, blue, green, teal, pink, or designs.

Also remember that leggings are not appropriate dress for school with a t-shirt or hoodie. Tunic style shirts or dresses are appropriate with leggings. Jeans with holes are NOT acceptable.

Please pay attention to the pick up times for the materials of your students. We have to remember that the health of the students of #theG comes first. So we ask that you come at the allotted time to pick up the materials. If you have multiple students please pick the materials up at the time of the youngest student. The teachers have been hard at work ensuring that the students receive the education they are accustomed to. Please remember this can be changed as we see the need to. Many teachers are using electronic resources. The dates are confusing on the letter. Wednesday the 25th for pick up and meals will begin that day as well.

Many if you may not realize FFA isn’t divided into groups based on school size. We compete with EVERYONE based on geographical area. There is no 1A FFA, we are all thrown together. So all of our FFA teams compete against much larger schools often with multiple Ag teachers leading those departments and coaching teams.

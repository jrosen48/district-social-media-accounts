Huge thanks to New Boston Huron School District and Grosse Ile Township Schools for their donations of over 10,000 pairs of gloves, nearly 1000 masks, over 200 safety goggles, and boxes of sanitizer to Beaumont Health and Henry Ford Health System.

Also shoutout to some of my constituents who answered the call!

I dropped off this supplies on their behalf today. I’ll be going to Woodhaven schools and Gibraltar schools tomorrow for more.

Modification to our RTP Plan -
The use of masks for the GCASD off season workout and conditioning plan is being modified due to the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Governor Wolf's announcement on July 1. To comply with the new state requirements for wearing masks when in public, all student athletes and coaches are required to wear a mask while on school property and NOT directly engaged in physical activity. Coaches are permitted to remove their masks when speaking/coaching at a distance that maintains social distancing guidelines. It is the responsibility of the head coach for each team to communicate this change to all participating off season workout athletes and to require all program participants to comply.",3.0,"Grove City Area High School

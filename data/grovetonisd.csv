Her all-state band will perform at 9:00am Saturday, February 16 at the Lila Cockrell Auditorium in San Antonio. Megan will be featured in multiple solos in the concert directed by Dennis Johnson, Murray State University (Kentucky).

Making the Texas All-State Band is the the highest level of achievement a Texas band student can attain. Seats are earned through rigorous blind auditions (judges do not know who is playing). This school year Megan received 1st chair at All-Region (there are 22 regions across Texas), 1st at Area (1/5 of the state) and now 1st in the state. Ranking 1st chair in a Texas All-State band is an amazing accomplishment.

Indigenous peoples can provide significant global leadership in the development of food sustainability. Join Indigenous leaders Sachem Hawk Storm (US) and Sara Yawanawa (Brazil) and mycologist and permaculture designer William Padilla-Brown(PA) for an exciting multi-continental conversation on food forests: ecologically designed areas with perennial and annual plants that produce food and herbal medicine, enhance nutrition, promote food literacy, and provide a useful and safe place to gather and work together. By developing these spaces, people are stating that ecologically healthy green spaces and sustainable local food production are valued, especially in the face of global population growth and overconsumption of natural resources...One such food forest project located deep in the Amazon will be featured during this inspiring panel presentation.

COVID-19 is affecting all New Yorkers in one way or another, from
struggling with feelings of uncertainty to fear of the virus itself. Many people are also dealing with loss and grief. Some might experience higher levels of stress, depression or anxiety that can cause trouble sleeping.

Try these tips for better sleep:
😴Establish a sleep routine.
😴Avoid lying down or napping during daytime hours.
😴Lower the amount of caffeine you drink (such as coffee, tea, soda and energy drinks), and avoid drinking caffeine after early afternoon.
😴Increase your physical activity by moving more and sitting less.

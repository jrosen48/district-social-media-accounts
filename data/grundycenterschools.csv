Teachers change the lives of millions of children every day—their immense work and impact moves us beyond words, so we need emojis to say how we feel. And with the abrupt end to the physical school year, our teachers have done even more to continue education with virtual classrooms and learning at home lessons. All to ensure every student has the tools they need to reach their full potential.

So, let’s all shower teachers in appreciation and share how we love (❤️) like (👍), celebrate (🎉) and care for (😍) our teachers!

Grundy Center Elementary and GCP&CC Staff have worked to reschedule TK/Kindergarten Round Up due to CoVid-19 restrictions.

The new dates for Round Up are July 24 OR August 3 from 8:30am-10:30am with parent meetings running from 8:35am-8:50am on each of those days. We encourage attendance, but it is not mandatory.

There are 2 ways to complete Round Up registration.

1. Online at http://tiny.cc/aiqpnz by May 8, 2020.

2. Download the forms at http://tiny.cc/umqpnz and return them to Grundy Center Elementary by May 8, 2020.

Transitional Kindergarten selection will occur shortly after May 8, 2020.

Thank you for your patience. We are hopeful the new dates will still be an option as the summer progresses.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157123168501981&id=263463186980,,0.0,"Kindergarten/TK Round Up and TK Application Process

Grundy Center Elementary and GCP&CC Staff have worked to reschedule TK/Kindergarten Round Up due to CoVid-19 restrictions.

The new dates for Round Up are July 24 OR August 3 from 8:30am-10:30am with parent meetings running from 8:35am-8:50am on each of those days. We encourage attendance, but it is not mandatory.

There are 2 ways to complete Round Up registration.

1. Online at http://tiny.cc/aiqpnz by May 8, 2020.

2. Download the forms at http://tiny.cc/umqpnz and return them to Grundy Center Elementary by May 8, 2020.

Transitional Kindergarten selection will occur shortly after May 8, 2020.

Thank you for your patience. We are hopeful the new dates will still be an option as the summer progresses.",2020-04-24 15:18:06,,

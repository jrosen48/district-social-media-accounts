Another math game for you!

Ten Before Nine
Topic: Structuring
Materials: Cards 1-10
Directions:
Play begins with a student putting down one card at a time in rows of three.
As each card from the deck is shown, if it can be put with another card already down to MAKE 10, then it is placed directly on top of that number. (10 can be placed on 10)
If a card cannot be placed on any of the previous cards to MAKE 10, it is put down in its own space.
Play continues with it considered a WIN if all cards can be placed before filling 3 rows of 3 -so getting TENS before filling NINE places

Variations:
May be played with partners. One player turns over the cards while the other player-coaches them on where to put them.
Rather than 3 rows of 3, it could be one row of 9",0.0,"Another fun, educational game.

In the spring, before schools closed their doors, our elementary teams had started working on an important and very visible project. Each school was asked to work with an artist to update their mascots and logos. Each school went a different direction with their vision - one school stuck closely with tradition, another chose to update their existing look and another chose a completely new mascot.

As a district, we couldn't be happier with the results!

We want to thank our teams of administrators, teachers, staff and parents who helped shape the look and feel of our new mascots. A lot of thought and effort went into every aspect of these logos, from color selection to exact facial expressions to fonts.

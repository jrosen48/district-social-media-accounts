As you have probably heard on the news, Governor Newsom is requiring schools to remain closed in Counties that are on the States monitoring list. Public and Private Schools cannot physically open until the County has been off the monitoring list for 14 consecutive days. Unfortunately, Kern County has just been put on the monitoring list. Therefore our ability to open with students on campus is not an option at this time.
General Shafter School District will begin the school year August 12th using our online platform. We will look forward to the ability to educate students on campus.

If you have any questions feel free to contact me at chriss@generalshafter.org

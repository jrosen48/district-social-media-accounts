Dear Greensburg SalemSchool District Families,
The U.S. Secretary of Agriculture recently announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will extend several flexibilities for school meals throughout the remainder of 2020. The USDA stated, “As our nation reopens and people return to work, it remains critical our children continue to receive safe, healthy, and nutritious food.”

At this time the free meals for all students will only run until December 31, 2020 or until funding is no longer available at which time statuses will return to Paid, Free and Reduced rates based on qualifications and applications, so please continue to return free and reduced meal applications as soon as possible to avoid any gap in benefits.

We remain committed to providing students access to healthy, nutritious and wholesome meals while assuring the utmost food safety without compromising quality.

Thank you!

After School today around 3:30 at the Middle School, it was reported that a graffiti threat was found in the second floor boys bathroom. The City of Greensburg Police were called and consulted. We do not believe the threat is credible. For the safety of the students and staff, a dog was brought to the school to perform a sweep of the building. In addition to the dog and the K9 officer, two Greensburg Police officers performed the sweep with Mr. Jones later that afternoon. Nothing was found. School will open on time tomorrow and will operate under normal conditions. A Greensburg Police Officer and Officer Grabiak will be at the Middle School as an additional safety precaution.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1763282363801893&id=1374948945968572,,0.0,"Dear Parents and students-

Let’s provide some Christmas Miracles!🥰
We are so very fortunate to have a home to live in and food on the table. Unfortunately, there are many people in our community who struggle to provide a meal for their family. This Christmas the GVFD will be donating meals to some of Greensburg’s less fortunate.
All of these families have children. Let’s make sure these kids don’t go hungry on Christmas. If you are able to sponsor a family for $25 please comment “I’m in” and include your email for invoicing. All orders must be in by December 19th! Let’s do this Greensburg!💝",0.0,"Greensburg Volunteer Fire Department

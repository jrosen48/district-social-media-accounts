We performed an investigation within the school that included discussions with employees, students and involved parents. During the course of the investigation, we also exchanged information with the Salt Lake City Police Department. After spending two weeks on the investigation, we did not find any information or witnesses to confirm that the employee injured the student.

Guadalupe takes the safety of our enrolled students very seriously and we appreciate both students and parents bringing issues or concerns to our attention. We provide annual training to our employees on proper methods of interaction with and discipline of students. Guadalupe utilizes training provided by the State of Utah which focuses on preventing situations such as the one mentioned above. We believe our employee acted consistently with the training and Guadalupe policy.

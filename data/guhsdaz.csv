To celebrate readers and encourage them to keep reading, Sunnyslope Teacher and Librarian Patty Jimenez created the SHS QuaranTeens Read Program. It is a way for students and staff to share what they have been reading and to win new books. Each week, 10 names are drawn from those who shared what they read. Each winner receives two new books, one to keep and one to give to a friend. All prizes will be distributed when school resumes on campus. During the program's first week, participants submitted more than 80 books which were added to the virtual bulletin board. SHS QuaranTeens Read will continue through July 31, 2020. #ExcellenceContinues #SunnyslopeProud #WeAreGUHSD",0.0,"Amazing job to Sunnyslope Teacher and Librarian Patty Jimenez who created the QuaranTeens Read Program to keep her students engaged during remote learning.

The color wheel is an important tool for artists because it displays the relationships between the colors. In general, the way the colors contrast with each other can be defined as either analogous or complementary.

Complements to Ms. Norris and her art students for the creativity used to design their color wheels from objects found at home.

On February 15, NHS joined other City of Glendale volunteers at Sahuaro Ranch Park to glean grapefruit for St. Mary’s Food Bank. Some of the fruit is also traded with other states (like Idaho for potatoes) to add variety to food bank boxes. Along with other volunteers, we gleaned about 10,000 lbs of fruit!

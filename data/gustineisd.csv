1. We are to stay 6 feet apart - unless you live in the same house. When you are entering the field and during all other times, please maintain this distance.

2. Because of the deep cleaning/sanitizing guidelines that would have to be followed, we will not have buildings open for bathroom access.

Jacob Lester--

I was involved in football, cross country, track, basketball, tennis, UIL academics, and FFA while in high school. After graduation, I plan to attend Texas State University and major in kinesiology to become either a coach or personal trainer since I love fitness. Ten years from now I see myself working as a coach and hopefully have a nice family of my own. I’m going to miss my classmates the most. They are my family and the people I have spent the most time with and made the most memories with.

Comanche Medical Center has offered to help us with some of the costs. But, we could still use help to cover more of the costs. We just made the decision that we needed to do what we need to do to make this a special time for these Seniors. (We have some other things planned for the next couple of weeks.)

So, if you would like to help us with the extra expenses, donations would be greatly appreciated. You can mail them to the school: 503 W Main, Gustine, Texas 76455. Or, you can bring them by school - just ring the door bell and someone will meet you and take the donation.

Please do not come play on the playground at school.

I know it would seem safe since it is outdoors. But, based on what we know about the virus it takes hours, possibly days, for the virus to die on playground surfaces. Another issue is that we do not need a group gathering at the playground. Remember we are practicing social distancing which means stay about 6 feet away from each other. So, a game of basketball isn't a good idea either right now. Sorry!

We are not trying to ""get in anyone's business"" - we are just trying to make preparations for the safe return of all students on Thursday.

We have also been inquiring about internet access. We are thinking through what we will need to do if we have to enter into a longer shut down in the future.

Another question we are asking is if your student needs breakfast and lunch during our shut down. We want to make sure our kiddos do not go hungry and to minimize as much as possible the financial strain families may feel.

We greatly appreciate your cooperation as we work through the process keeping everyone safe and healthy!

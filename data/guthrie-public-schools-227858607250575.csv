GPS School Year Off to a Smooth Start

Guthrie students went back to school this morning and the early reports were a very smooth start. Some finishing work is awaiting completion at the sites who received new entrances and contractors are continuing their work.

According to Dr. Mike Simpson, Superintendent of Schools, “I did my customary tour across the district and principals at all buildings reported a very smooth drop off process. We had two buses that were running late, but that is to be expected on the first day. Moving the Senior drive to a time after other sites have started has made the first day much more manageable across the district. Many procedures are changing as we adapt to school with COVID-19 protocols. We ask you to please be patient with the many changes which include mandatory masks for visitors.”

We have not forgotten our senior students in the midst of this most unfortunate worldwide pandemic. As many high schools have been or are presently doing, we will be honoring the Class of 2020 by turning on the lights at both Squires Field and Jelsma Stadium on Friday evening from 8:20 until 8:40 or 2020 to 2040 military time. This tribute of solemnity is in recognition of their hard work and accomplishments and in no manner is intended to become a public gathering. CDC guidelines remain in effect including social distancing and the prohibition of groups of 10 or more individuals. Please keep this in mind if you intend to drive by to witness the display.

Many people including myself have used unprecedented to describe the event we are currently enduring. As it turns out, it is not unprecedented. On October 9, 1918, Guthrie Public Schools closed and did not reopen until November 11, 1918. The board minutes simply call it influenza but it would become known as the Spanish Flu.

Another interesting tidbit about that closure is they grappled with the support staff pay as well. In Guthrie, janitors were not paid if they were not called for work during that period. At that time, there was no Child Nutrition Staff, definitely no Technology Staff and probably no Transportation Staff as well.

GUIDANCE PROVIDED FOR COMING DAYS WHILE SCHOOL IS CLOSED

Guthrie Public Schools wants to provide students, parents and the entire community with an update as we begin looking ahead to the temporary closure of school until at least April 6th. Many immediate questions about next week can be answered at this time, while questions about the coming weeks are much more difficult to answer. Effective on March 17th all public schools in Oklahoma were ordered to cease instruction until April 6th. This included any online instruction. Yesterday, it was announced that a waiver seeking to cancel all state testing had been submitted.

The second offense carries a fine not to exceed $100 and the fine for the third or subsequent offense shall not exceed $250. The guilty party would also be responsible for court costs.

GPS School Year Off to a Smooth Start

Guthrie students went back to school this morning and the early reports were a very smooth start. This morning the entire central office administrative team toured all buildings.

According to Dr. Mike Simpson, Superintendent of Schools, “We did our customary tour across the district and principals at all buildings reported a very smooth drop off process. Some of this could possibly be attributed to most parents being familiar with their building. We had three buses that were running late, but that is to be expected on the first day. Overall, it was the smoothest start I can remember.”

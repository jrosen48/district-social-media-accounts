It's that time of year again - the yellow buses are back! Here's a reminder from the Michigan State Police what to do when you see them on the road. (Image: Grand Traverse)

- Prepare to stop when a slowing bus has its overhead yellow lights flashing

- Stop at least 20 feet away for buses when red lights are flashing, unless driving in the opposite direction on a divided highway

- Slow down in or near school and residential areas

- Look for clues-such as safety patrols, crossing guards, bicycles, and playgrounds-that indicate children might be in the area

- Watch for children between parked cars and other objects.
School buses are like traffic signals:
—When overhead lights are flashing yellow: Prepare to stop
—When overhead lights are flashing red: Stop
—When hazard warning lights are flashing: Proceed with caution",19.0,"Help us keep our kids safe. Please share this!

Hello 8th Grade Students and Parents

Just a quick update on the 8th Grade Great America trip that was cancelled due to the COVID-19 situation.

We would like to give the 8th students who committed to the May 2020 Great America trip one of the following two options:

1. A refund of parent paid money (this excludes ANY and ALL fundraising and concession earnings/volunteering) - if forfeited, this money will be used for upcoming PTO paid events on behalf of Gwinn Middle School students or can be transferred to an upcoming MS sibling

or

2. Attend Great America in May 2021 (current 8th grade students and upcoming 8th grade students will go together) - you will not be charged any additional fees for the trip.

We will be sending letters out at the start of the school year to all parents/students that have committed to the May 2020 trip and allow you ample time to make your decision and return the form to us with your choice. Once you make your decision, it will be final.

Thank you!

To understand the relationship between eruption frequency and volcanic explosivity, students played Jenga. Students keep track of the number of blocks pulled from the stack each game (mimicking the passing of time) and then measure the distance the farthest block flew from the ""volcano"" upon eruption when the stack falls (mimicking volcanic explosivity).

Through this activity, students discover that the largest volcanic eruptions will have the lowest frequency.

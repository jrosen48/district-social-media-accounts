As we mentioned earlier this summer, we kindly encourage all parents who are willing and able to transport your own child or children to and from school to do so for the 2020-2021 School Year. This will allow for our transportation team to accommodate for social distancing. We understand that many parents rely on school transportation and that this will be an unfeasible request. However, having students that can avoid the use of school transportation frees up room on the bus for those that cannot make other arrangements.

We ask that each family in the district please fill out the transportation form below. This form is also located on the homepage of our district website: http://www.hlcs.org . If you have any questions, please call your child‚Äôs building principal directly. Thank you.

Throughout the year, students in grades 7 and 8 earned S.O.A.R tickets each time they displayed positive academic and social behaviors. The tickets were then entered into weekly prize drawings. The PBIS program culminated at the end of June with a Celebration Day!

Students without any discipline referrals during the 4th quarter participated in games such as capture the flag, tug of war, and dodgeball, along with a free BBQ lunch and a make your own sundae party donated by Stewart's Shops. One lucky 7th grader and one lucky 8th grader had their names drawn from all the S.O.A.R. tickets submitted during the year for our final prize a $25 gift card from either Amazon, Target, Cumberland Farms, or Apple App Store.

The day ended with some students choosing to watch a movie while others chose to go to rooms that had board games, arts, computers, and some enjoying more games in the gym. We look forward to continuing PBIS next year with even more success!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2385505428329662&id=2274093199470886,,0.0,"Our Junior High students learned about Positive Behavior and Instructional Supports (PBIS) this past school year.

Thank you to everyone that gave pajamas and supported this cause. Because of you, 126 children in need will receive a new pair of pajamas and a new book during this holiday season.

2nd Grade students from Ms. Anderson's class sorted the pajamas by size, labeled the different size groups with index cards, compiled the information and input the data into google sheets. #HAWKSconnect #Scholastic #PajamaProgram #kidshelpingkids",2018-12-03 21:18:50,,

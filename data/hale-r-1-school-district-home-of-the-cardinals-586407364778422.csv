We are going back to more simple times when the kids or grandkids played outside in the yard, when we exercised by going for walks or bike rides, when we played board or card games with the family, when we called people on the phone to check in.

We know this can be a stressful time for everyone. It is important to get your mind off of the world's problems. Mental health can be just as important as physical health, so take some time off for yourself. Turn off the TV or radio. Take a break from searching the internet for updated news.

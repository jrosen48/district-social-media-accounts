asymptomatic, and we are hoping for a full recovery. As a result of the positive

Our community has been devastated by the tragic incident that occurred last night in South Boston. We offer the most heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of the victims.

Over the course of the day, we have been in frequent contact with law enforcement. Law enforcement officials do not believe this matter has a link to Halifax County High School nor were any of those involved in the tragedy current Halifax County High School students.

Concern and even fear are natural after such a tragedy. Therefore in the days ahead, we will have all metal detectors operational at the high school. We will have extra law enforcement personnel on site. Families and students should be aware that when we fully implement the use of metal detectors, there could be delays in entering the building.

In addition to extra security measures, there will be counselors available for students and staff.

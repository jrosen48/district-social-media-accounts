Out of an abundance of caution and as an additional preventative measure, our schools in Silver Lake, Halifax, Kingston, and Plympton are cancelled for Friday, March 13, 2020. This will allow the district to spend three days to clean all of our facilities and will provide us with more time to process information that may be forthcoming from our state and federal agencies.

All schools will be closed tomorrow and throughout the weekend. All after school activities and evening events are cancelled. We will return to classes on Monday, March 16th.

As more information becomes available, we will continue to communicate our plans.

Today we kicked off the Boosterthon program here at our school…this is our major fundraiser of the year! The students and staff are very excited to have the Boosterthon team on campus the next two weeks as we learn how to be 21st century heroes though the Mind Spark Mystery Lab and to help our school!

This year, we are raising $30,000 for our school! So, we need your help...

Today, each student will be coming home with a pledge book. This book provides the steps for how to log onto funrun.com and register your student.

Student registration code: 252-811
Be sure to check out the ""Student Star Video."" This is a fun and easy way to let potential sponsors know that they can support our school - and your child will love being the star in their very own movie!

Thank you for your help!

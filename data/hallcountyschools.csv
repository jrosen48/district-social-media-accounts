He was a man that my father felt like united a nation and stood firm on the things our country stands for. Things I feel like are getting lost in our world at times. I look forward to diving into his memoirs and finding out more about the man behind the Presidency.""

Ronald Reagan is the first President I remember as a child, and quite honestly was a man my father admired and loved. He was President of the United States when I was 6 to 14 years of age, and from my early teenage viewpoint one of the greats. He was a man that my father felt like united a nation and stood firm on the things our country stands for. Things I feel like are getting lost in our world at times. I look forward to diving into his memoirs and finding out more about the man behind the Presidency.""

What do you enjoy reading?

""Honestly I don’t prefer one genre over another. I read based on my mood and what strikes my interest.""

Why do you read?

""I was given the gift of the ability to read by my parents and some wonderful teachers in East Tennessee. It should never be wasted.""",2020-04-16 16:25:16,,

Principal Jeff Chandler says of Ms. Brown:

""LaChele is a great teacher leader who builds great relationships with students and teachers throughout the school and the community. She goes above and beyond to help others.""

Why does Ms. Brown teach?

""I teach because I feel that I can make a difference in the lives of our children. Every student has a voice that matters and I want to help shape them into young men and women. I want my students to know that I have their backs and that I support them; however, I have high expectations for each one of them as if they were my own children. I want them to feel that my classroom is a place of safety, compassion, and love.""

Ms. Brown's favorite quote?

""Every child deserves a CHAMPION- an adult who will never give up on them--who understands the power of connection and insists that they become the best that they can possibly be.""

What book is one of your favorites and why?

“The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis is one of my all-time favorite books. It is the perfect mix of childhood fantasy and deeper messaging. The message of hope that the book promotes encourages me greatly since we often live in a world where tragedy and evil seem to overshadow the beautiful and good things about life.”

What do you enjoy reading (genre)?

“I typically move in and out of various genres, but definitely lean toward historical nonfiction. I enjoy learning about the past and how it shapes our present and future world.”

Why do you read?

“I read for both pleasure and information. Reading opens my eyes to new thoughts, ideas, and ways of thinking.”",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=160313761991412&id=109858803703575,,0.0,"This week’s Leading and Reading Spotlight is Jared Belew, Principal at Spout Springs School of Enrichment

from The Academies of Discovery at South Hall Middle School

Principal Joey Millwood's comments on Mrs. Cole:

""Mrs. Cole is a true gem. She loves kids. She loves learning. She does LOTS of both! Her straightforward approach to teaching, along with her ability to meet all students at their point of need, ensures that her students learn and grow. Additionally, she exemplifies servant leadership as she takes new teachers under her wing as well as serving as a friend and mentor for many others.""

Why do you teach, Mrs Cole?

“It is a calling from God. I love the challenge of never knowing what each day holds and I live for those “light bulb moments” when kids grasp a concept or master a new skill.”

Mrs. Cole, What’s your favorite quote?

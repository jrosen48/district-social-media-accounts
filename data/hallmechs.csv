Congratulations to Chris Cruz from the Hall Site. Chris plans to weld for a few years before getting his real estate license. His favorite memory was the Washington D.C. trip where he was chosen to represent his school. Chris appreciates everyone at MECHS becuase they helped him with anything and everything! He wants to recognize Ms. Lloyd because he knew her before he went to MECHS, so he felt comfortable asking for help. #classof2020 #graduation2020 #senior2020 #seniorspotlight #mechsgrad #mechsgrad2020 #mechsgraduation #mountaineducationcharter #1stchoicefor2ndchance",0.0,"Mountain Education Charter High School

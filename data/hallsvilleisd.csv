This morning we had our alternative to walking Kaitlyn Anderson to class on her last day of school. Today would have been her last “real” day of school. Tomorrow they would be doing their Senior Walk.😢. So this morning I got her up so we could take her graduation announcements to the school to have them put in her teacher’s boxes. We pulled up to the school...”Why is Daddy here??” “Is that Peep’s car??” I told her that if this was the last time she is going in the school, her Daddy and I were going to walk her in. When we got in she was greeted so warmly by her kindergarten teacher and her last period teacher. The first and the last. Surprisingly I held it together! It was so sweet of her teachers to take the time out of their day to meet us at the school to make this special moment for her!!! Shout out to Mrs O’Dowd and Mr Mah!!!!!!I can not thank them enough!!! Mr Mah even had her walk in and out of his classroom for the last time😢😢. It may not have been the traditional moment we had been planning for years but it was just as great!!!",0.0,"https://www.facebook.com/100000162921312/posts/3745039378844789?sfns=mo

Danieli Parker is the principal at Hallsville North Elementary. A native of Roswell, New Mexico, she moved to Texas after graduating from New Mexico State University with a degree in Elementary Education. Her teaching career began at North East Independent School District in San Antonio, Texas.

Mrs. Parker moved to Longview in December 2007 after her husband’s job transferred him here. She taught at Longview ISD for the remainder of that school year and was then hired in Hallsville to teach second grade. In 2009, she was hired as the assistant principal of the Intermediate campus, and worked there for two years. She left for a couple of years, but returned to serve as principal at North Elementary.

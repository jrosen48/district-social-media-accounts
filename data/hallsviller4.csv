Part of the new literacy curriculum, Being A Writer, has students focusing on telling more in their stories. The process takes three days each week to complete. Before they write, the students think and talk about what they want to say. After they write, they revisit their drawings and writings and think about what they can add to them. Students write shared stories, choose topics for their own stories and share their forms of writing with peers. ✍

A very powerful part of this process is peer conferencing with each other. They each love showing what they have done in writing each day with other in the classroom.

They create altars in their homes with flowers, candles, pictures of the lost family members, along with their favorite food and drink items. One item on the altar is a candy Sugar Skull. It is to represent that life is sweet and not to be taken for granted.

As the students learned about a different culture and its' traditions, their objective was to create their own version
of a sugar skull. It is to represent the Mexican culture with bright colors, and symbols seen during Day of the Dead.
Some students got to paint and decorate a foam skull with puff paint and gems, while others use ink spray and metallic pens to create a vibrant sugar skull design on paper.

Hello Westwood Heights Family,

Attention, NEW days for Meals on Wheels!

On Mondays, we will deliver breakfast and lunch, which covers meals for Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday, we will provide breakfast and lunch for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

Also stay tuned as our buses may soon be delivering lessons and library books! We are also working with the Food Bank of Eastern Michigan to establish food distribution points.

Dear Hamady Middle School Family,

I hope that you are healthy and safe, staying inside as much as possible. These are uncertain times which we live in, but I believe we will come out of this with a renewed love for life, friendships, family, and our community. I miss seeing all of your faces and I look forward to greeting you in the hallways and classrooms again.

Many of you are wondering what happens next? That is a good question to ask, and the answer seems to change daily. Currently, our governor has made the decision to close the school buildings for the remainder of the school year. We have been instructed to continue your education using other methods than face to face instruction. So what does that look like?

This pantry is part of our Best Food Foward partnership that focuses on helping to connect students with the healthy food they need for success. The program intends to improve the way students learn, engage, and eat at school and home. By making healthy food accessible to students and their families, we are improving the way schools and communities work together.

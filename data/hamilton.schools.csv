I am thrilled that Cameron will be able to partner with Hamilton Community Schools with this assessment, as well as many other ways in the future. This assessment will allow us to better understand what our community finds necessary for our Community Wellness department to focus on even more. We will need as many responses as we can gather, within the time frame of the survey. The survey will automatically close once the Rural Health Association does so, we have no control over that. If you could share this with Hamilton families that would be great, I will post the link below. I am looking forward to building the community connections with Cameron Memorial Community Hospital and Hamilton Community Schools.

What a wonderful day! Nine of our responsible, hardworking Hamilton students were selected to walk to Kingdom Kids Childcare 🧒 to read 📚 to the infant and toddler room.

Afterwards, we enjoyed a nice lunch at Rose Bros 🍕 and stopped at Dollar General 💰 for a sweet treat!

I was so proud of our students for how well they worked with the children and what positive role models they were being for our future Marines! 💙💙💙

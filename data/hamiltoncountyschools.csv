Ten-year-old Ada has never left her one-room apartment. Her mother is too humiliated by Ada's twisted foot to let her outside. So when her little brother Jamie is shipped out of London to escape the war, Ada doesn't waste a minute—she sneaks out to join him. So begins a new adventure for Ada, and for Susan Smith, the woman who is forced to take in the two kids. As Ada teaches herself to ride a pony, learns to read, and watches for German spies, she begins to trust Susan, and Susan begins to love Ada and Jamie. In the end, will their bond be enough to hold them together through wartime, or will Ada and her brother be sent back to their mother?

Jones, a teacher in Hamilton County Schools, on her retirement! She has worked in Hamilton County Schools for 26 years, and served students at Lakeside Academy, Hardy Elementary, and Garber Elementary.

Favorite Memory: “After being recognized and greeted by one of the students that I taught in first grade, the memorable moment came during his conversation with me. He told me he was in his twenties and had a good career. He told me he would never forget me because I made learning fun. He then went on to say how I had talked to and comforted him at a difficult time in his life. This short conversation with this past student will remain a cherished memory.”

To find out the start time for your school, you may visit the district website. School-aged childcare locations will be open at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

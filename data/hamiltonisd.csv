This calendar is identical to the current school calendar with two exceptions. The bad weather day that traditionally follows Easter has been moved to Friday, April 23. This was done to accommodate final prep for STAAR testing on April 6. The other change to the calendar moves four early release days from the last Friday of each six weeks to the following Monday. The last Friday of each semester remain an early release day.

We are taking public comments through next week on the proposed calendar. The calendar will be sent to the school board for adoption at the February meeting on Tuesday the 25th.

Hamilton ISD",19.0,"The district site based decision committee adopted the 2020-2021 for recommendation to the school board.

This calendar is identical to the current school calendar with two exceptions. The bad weather day that traditionally follows Easter has been moved to Friday, April 23. This was done to accommodate final prep for STAAR testing on April 6. The other change to the calendar moves four early release days from the last Friday of each six weeks to the following Monday. The last Friday of each semester remain an early release day.

We are taking public comments through next week on the proposed calendar. The calendar will be sent to the school board for adoption at the February meeting on Tuesday the 25th.

Please note, this action does not affect the bond issue. It will continue as is; new elementary campus, HS upgrades, extracurricular upgrades. It is the opinion of the board that time is of the essence to get the best price and to begin the project.

This special meeting is a direct result of your voice being heard. Thank you for expressing your thoughts on this project. I would like to also commend our school board for listening, and being willing to make adjustments along the way.

Capturing Kids Hearts is a community builder that increases student achievement, improves student behavior and creates relational connections in our district. In order for the program to reach it's full potential, all teachers must be properly trained.

Consider sponsoring a teacher that has not yet been trained! Kids want to be in classrooms where teachers know how to connect with them and make them feel valued.

Initially, water pressure at the school was reduced but still functional. However, as time passed, all three campuses were left without water. This made it necessary to release school an hour early.

I want to thank everyone in the community, parents and our staff for the cooperation we received on such short notice. We used several different methods to get the word out. Specifically, an Alert Now message (phone call & text message) was sent out by the district at approximately 2:15pm. If you have a child in the district and you did not receive the call or text, we ask that you update your contact information in writing to the campus office as soon as possible.

We realize this early release today was inconvenient and placed a burden on many families. Together we made it work. That is what makes this community such a great place!

Initially, water pressure at the school was reduced but still functional. However, as time passed, all three campuses were left without water. This made it necessary to release school an hour early.

I want to thank everyone in the community, parents and our staff for the cooperation we received on such short notice. We used several different methods to get the word out. Specifically, an Alert Now message (phone call & text message) was sent out by the district at approximately 2:15pm. If you have a child in the district and you did not receive the call or text, we ask that you update your contact information in writing to the campus office as soon as possible.

We realize this early release today was inconvenient and placed a burden on many families. Together we made it work. That is what makes this community such a great place!

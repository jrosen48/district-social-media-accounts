This is the time of year for people to visit each other, open their homes to visitors, and share
their joy and excitement. It is also the time for us to pause and reflect on our busy lives and be
grateful for many of our blessings. This is one of the greatest times of the year.

I hope you will take this time to relax and spend time with your loved ones. Enjoy your family;
refill your batteries and have this well-deserved break! Safe trips to those of you who take trips
out of town. I ask you, too, to consider those who are less fortunate or in disheartening
circumstances and keep them in your prayers.

I want to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to all those who help make HCSS a
wonderful place. The new year brings new ways of learning, new challenges, and new fun. I
look forward to what lies ahead of us in 2020 as a school community. In this holiday season and
throughout the New Year, I wish you all love, joy, hope, and happiness.

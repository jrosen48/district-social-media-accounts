I am so proud to have my kids in Hampton City Schools. I have seen so many issues across other localities and I just wanna say HCS is on it. Not only did we have Chromebooks prior to the pandemic, they have implemented things to make this process so much smoother. Folks like to say when things are bad so I wanna say when things are good.

Thank you HCS school board, administration, administrators, teachers, and staff. This isn't easy and you all deserve all the props!!!

Families and staff are asked to plan accordingly.

* Friday, March 6, and Friday, May 22, 2020, will now be full school days for all students and staff. These dates were originally early close days.

In developing the 2019-2020 HCS calendar, a priority was placed on providing a full day off the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and a two-week winter break. Therefore, only one “banked student instructional day” was included in the calendar. This day was used for the school closure on Friday, September 6, 2019, due to Hurricane Dorian.

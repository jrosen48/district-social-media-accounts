Terry was always willing to help us out whether it was donating glow sticks for Fall Fest, judging our cookie bake off, donating a police ride a long to be auctioned off or bikes for the kids raffle. He was the driving force in starting Blue & Red Christmas for Hampton/Rapids City kids, which PTA was always happy to support.

Although the announcement was not unexpected and everyone fully supports any and all efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19, we share everyone's disappointment that our students cannot return to normal schooling at Hampton 29 through the month of April. Know that the staff at Hampton are ready to meet this challenge and will continue to provide quality learning opportunities. In the next several days we will post a Remote Learning Plan that will be helpful in allowing parents and students to plan when help will be available and how we will continue to provide assistance going forward. Rest assured we will help our students on their learning journey at every opportunity. We regret the inconvenience this undoubtedly causes and look forward to continuing to work with all of our Hampton 29 families during this difficult time. Stay safe and stay healthy! Hampton together!

Hampton 29",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2769331019787111&id=212140325506206,,0.0,"This afternoon Governor Pritzker announced the extension of our state wide Remote Learning Days through April 30th. Although the announcement was not unexpected and everyone fully supports any and all efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19, we share everyone's disappointment that our students cannot return to normal schooling at Hampton 29 through the month of April. Know that the staff at Hampton are ready to meet this challenge and will continue to provide quality learning opportunities. In the next several days we will post a Remote Learning Plan that will be helpful in allowing parents and students to plan when help will be available and how we will continue to provide assistance going forward. Rest assured we will help our students on their learning journey at every opportunity. We regret the inconvenience this undoubtedly causes and look forward to continuing to work with all of our Hampton 29 families during this difficult time. Stay safe and stay healthy! Hampton together!

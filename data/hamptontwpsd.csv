In the spirit of this special week, we are inviting students to partake in a special activity we have planned: “Teacher Appreciation: Chalk It, Draw It, Say It or Sing it.”

Students are encouraged to express their gratitude to their teachers in any of these ways, as simply or as creatively as they like from the comfort and safety of their home.
Students opting to “sing it” can easily use the tune of “Happy Birthday” and substitute “Happy Teacher Appreciation Week.” Or, they can let their musical creativity run wild.

Budding and skilled artists can use chalk, crayons or whatever is handy.
All submissions will be posted on our District’s social media and shared with our teachers.

All you need to do is email your student’s submission to Communications@HT-SD.ORG any time this week or text it to 215-808-3513. Be sure to include your student’s name, school, grade and, if you wish, the teacher they are thanking.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=914495135656096&id=179060225866261,,0.0,"Teacher Appreciation Week: May 4-8

Governor Wolf has extended his order to close all K-12 Pennsylvania schools “until further notice” amid concerns regarding the continued spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19).

The District’s closure will now extend at least until the statewide closure expires. Also, as the stay-at-home order was extended for Allegheny County, all HTSD facilities, including district buildings and athletic fields are closed until further notice.

We will continue to utilize our Remote Learning Days during the closure. Please note that the District will hold its Spring Break, in accordance with the approved 2019-2020 School Calendar, which calls for vacation days on Thursday April 9, Friday, April 10 and Monday, April 13.

Another Important Reminder on Instruction…

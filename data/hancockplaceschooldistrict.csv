Morning huddle. Big day today at Hancock Place School District. It’s the first district that has trained its kids Pre-K through 12th grade on active killer situations/tourniquet first aid. We teach stranger danger, earthquake, fire drills— (we have not had a fire death at a school since 1958) We truly believe you also need to have the kids trained, too, in this to make it all work. It’s all taught at age appropriate levels. We even have a mascot named Bill-E in honor of our 4E©️ program, who you’ll see later today at the elementary & pre-K. Hope you’ll follow us today on Facebook, Instagram & Insta Story to learn more about what it looks like. We think you’ll be surprised at the education the kids get without scaring them & the fun they have. Thank you to all the administrators, staff & teachers for ALL that you do every single day to keep our kids safe.

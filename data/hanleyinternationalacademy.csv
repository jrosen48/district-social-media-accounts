#PawnChallenge

On Oct. 1, 2019, Governor Gretchen Whitmer vetoed a $240 per-pupil funding increase for charter school students, while OK'ing funding for other public school students - all in an effort to bargain for road funding. The #PawnChallenge calls on charter educators, advocates, parents and students to share real stories, about our real kids - showing Gov. Whitmer & our elected officials that MI charter students are not just faceless pawns to be used as bargaining chips in their political game. You Can Help",0.0,"The Romine Group

Please Make Your Voice Heard:

No matter what side of the aisle you stand on, I challenge you to ask more of your elected officials and Governor Whitmer. Ask them to hear your story. Ask them why our charter students have been targeted with this funding cut. Let them know that we are NOT collateral damage, not a sacred cow, not a hostage - today, or ever.

We are the voices of Michigan's charter schools, and we demand to be heard.

Follow The Link - Tell the Governor and your lawmakers that your funding isn‚Äôt up for grabs - today, or any other day.

I wanted to take this opportunity to express my sincerest gratitude to ALL of you, staff and families alike, during Staff Appreciation Week 2020 because it has truly required all of us to work together, while being apart.

This is a time in which we have all experienced a myriad of emotions: confusion, sadness, loneliness, anger, wonder, happiness and gratitude, to name just a few. However, through it all, I remain humbled by the heart and commitment of the entire staff and Hanover community.

Collectively, we have pulled together on behalf of our children. There is nothing more honorable, humbling, or fulfilling than rising to meet this challenge time and time again. Take a moment today to celebrate that which is most important...the human spirit and being there for one another.

I am grateful for the work ALL of you have done for our kids and I am grateful that you are MY village.

Memories of Hanover: I think it would be tough to define one memory from all four years at Hanover as my favorite but dancing before one of the football games on the empty stage in complete darkness to the song ‘Scream’ from High School Musical is definitely up there.

Activities/Honors: Throughout my four years at Hanover, I’ve done many clubs and activities, but my main passion has always lied within music. I currently play saxophone, bassoon, and piano. I’ve been in honors band ever since I was a freshman, and decided to do beginning band my last semester as a means to learn the bassoon. I’ve been going to ISSMA state with either a solo or ensemble ever since I was a freshman and got a gold with distinction for a solo and my saxophone quartet this year! During the marching band season, I was drum major with Phoebe Tomac as well.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2827545557371660&id=651594898300081,,0.0,"Meet Our Seniors 2020

As we adjust to this ‘new normal’, we want to provide you with some academic, social-emotional resources, and other information that may provide assistance during this challenging time.

We are asking all families to take a voluntary brief survey so that we are attentive to the most pressing needs of our students in the weeks to come. If you have any concerns please feel free to reach out to any of our building principals, Superintendent Mary MacAulay or myself.

As we adjust to this ‘new normal’, we want to provide you with some academic, social-emotional resources, and other information that may provide assistance during this challenging time.

We are asking all families to take a voluntary brief survey so that we are attentive to the most pressing needs of our students in the weeks to come. If you have any concerns please feel free to reach out to any of our building principals, Superintendent Mary MacAulay or myself.

We need and want your input regarding the facilities and our growing enrollment at Hanover.

We are able to engage with parents, community partners, and staff using an interactive online tool called 'Thought Exchange'. A thought exchange allows you to post your ideas anonymously, as well as rate the ideas of others.

The question we are asking is, ""As one of the fastest growing school districts in Indiana we need to plan to meet this challenge. As we explore ways to improve facilities and provide more opportunities for our students what are the most important ideas we need to consider?""

Below is the link for the Thought Exchange. It will remain open until Wednesday, October 23rd. Please share your thoughts and comment on the thoughts of others.

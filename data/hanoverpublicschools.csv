This is typically a piece we play every year at our final concert. I'm so happy to be able to continue the tradition and embrace the power and beauty of this music even if it is in a non-traditional way.

The performance is dedicated to all of us dealing with this unprecedented time, especially those on the front lines.

The Credit for Life Fair is an interactive event held annually for the senior class.
The day began with a brief presentation in the auditorium where students viewed a Consumer Reports video about the student loan debt crisis. Students then moved into the gymnasium to visit fifteen booths, including Transportation, Housing, and Nutrition. At each booth, students were asked to make some of the financial decisions that they will have to make as adults. Students select the most appealing option presented to them by volunteers from the community, and then decide how to pay for it; whether it be using their net monthly income, a credit card, or by spending their savings. Students also participated in a mock interview.

The event was a tremendous success. We are very thankful to our volunteers and Hanover High School teachers and staff who made this event possible.

We know the coronavirus has created challenges for AP students and teachers. Here’s how the College Board will support you during this time:

1️⃣ We’re providing free, live and on-demand AP courses

To support AP students affected by school closures due to COVID-19, students and schools will have access to live AP review lessons, delivered by AP teachers from across the country. Lessons will begin March 25.

2️⃣ We’re developing a new at-home testing option

Because of the challenges created by COVID-19, we’re developing a new at-home AP Exam option. Students will be able to test on a computer, tablet, or smartphone.

We will invest so that every AP student impacted by COVID-19 has the tools and connectivity they need to review AP content online and take the exam from home.

During this challenging time, we will work to give every AP student the opportunity to earn the college credit and placement they’ve been working toward all year while maintaining a focus on the health and safety of our AP community.

We, your school nurses and psychologists, wanted to reach out to you to provide some information and reassurance to help you navigate the next few weeks.

When anything stressful or challenging is going on in life, it can be difficult to know how to talk to our kids of all ages. Kids, whether three or seventeen, look to adults to figure out what they need to know and how they should react. In the Hanover Public Schools, our staff and administrators always want to help support you with these conversations.

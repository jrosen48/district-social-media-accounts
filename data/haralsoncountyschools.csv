Healthy Haralson Task Force Member Spotlight:

Offering appreciation today for the hard work and dedication of Elena Schulenburg with Haralson County School District and Pam Armas with Bremen City Schools.

Elena: Being a part of the Healthy Haralson initiative has been very rewarding. Serving on multiple task forces and being the Jr. Leadership Team liaison has helped me see things from a different perspective. I enjoy being a part of teams that help make our community stronger and better.

Pam: Students are my passion and the Haralson Junior Leadership Team is close to my heart. These future community leaders fly beneath the radar in the school atmosphere. However, they are deep thinkers and process information at a unique level. These are the students who are going to change policy and make a difference in our society.

Oh, how awesome it is to be a Pirate, especially during times of uncertainty, like these we are in. Harbor Beach Community Schools is a united community of students, parenets and staff.

Students, you truly are amazing. You face so many challenges that are unique for this time. You have school work and you participate in sports and other extracurricular activities on top of your other responsibilities. Many of you work diligently at your family farms or at local businesses.

Staff, you show GRIT everyday. You put your own families on hold to be a family for your students. You work tirelessly to grade and create lesson plans while having bills and other responsibilites at home. You devote your lives to helping our students learn academic and life lessons - loving them like they are your own and guiding them through school and life.

Together, #WeArePirates! We are a community that comes together to help one another. We are unified in our passion to group to become our best selves and to help others become theirs. Together, #WeArePirates.

Students, you truly are amazing. You face so many challenges that are unique for this time. You have school work and you participate in sports and other extracurricular activities on top of your other responsibilities. Many of you work diligently at your family farms or at local businesses.

Staff, you show GRIT everyday. You put your own families on hold to be a family for your students. You work tirelessly to grade and create lesson plans while having bills and other responsibilites at home. You devote your lives to helping our students learn academic and life lessons - loving them like they are your own and guiding them through school and life.

Together, #WeArePirates! We are a community that comes together to help one another. We are unified in our passion to group to become our best selves and to help others become theirs. Together, #WeArePirates.

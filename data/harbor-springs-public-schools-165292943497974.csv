The fifth grade students will be visiting Harbor Springs for a “spring camp exchange and cultural experience” as part of a sister school relationship with Harbor Springs Public Schools. This partnership was formalized earlier in the school year. The main goals of the spring camp exchange will be to build connections, gain a greater sense of cultural awareness, and to learn about language, customs, and educational systems. According to superintendent of schools Michael Behrmann, “This is an amazing opportunity for our students to experience a culture that is very different from ours in every sense. The students from Luhe Primary School will attend classes, go to lunch, experience recess, and engage in cooperative activities with the Shay students.

The fifth grade students will be visiting Harbor Springs for a “spring camp exchange and cultural experience” as part of a sister school relationship with Harbor Springs Public Schools. This partnership was formalized earlier in the school year. The main goals of the spring camp exchange will be to build connections, gain a greater sense of cultural awareness, and to learn about language, customs, and educational systems.

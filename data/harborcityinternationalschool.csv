Show opens on Thursday Dec. 5th at 7pm!
Adults $10.00 Students $5.00
On the last day of his life, William Chesley Shaw is haunted by his past. The former superintendent of the New London, Texas school district, Mr. Shaw can't let go of his guilt over the events of March 18, 1937. It was on that fateful day that a gas leak beneath the school caused a huge explosion, killing over 300 people, mostly elementary school children. Some of the young victims, led by Amelia (the girl in the white pinafore), now haunt Shaw. Hurt and confused, Amelia cannot move on until she can both forgive Shaw and herself for her own mistakes. More a story of the search for redemption than an outright ghost story, ""The Girl In The White Pinafore"" asks tough questions about guilt and grief and is based on real events that touch our lives still.

To combat this, Google Play launched the Change The Game Design Challenge. To enter, students submit an idea for a game for the chance to win the grand prize of a $10,000 college scholarship and $15,000 for their school's technology program. 5 finalists will be selected to present their idea at E3 in Los Angeles.
No computer science skills are necessary, only an imagination and writing skills to share their vision for a game. If able, students are encouraged to share sketches or visuals of their game characters, settings, and more. It is suggested that students spend at least an hour on their design.
All entries must be submitted by Wednesday, May 16th.

Did you know that 65% of women play mobile games, making up half of all mobile gamers? Even though women are playing mobile games like never before, only 23% of the game developers identify as women.

To combat this, Google Play launched the Change The Game Design Challenge. To enter, students submit an idea for a game for the chance to win the grand prize of a $10,000 college scholarship and $15,000 for their school's technology program. 5 finalists will be selected to present their idea at E3 in Los Angeles.
No computer science skills are necessary, only an imagination and writing skills to share their vision for a game. If able, students are encouraged to share sketches or visuals of their game characters, settings, and more. It is suggested that students spend at least an hour on their design.
All entries must be submitted by Wednesday, May 16th.

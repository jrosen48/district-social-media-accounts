I would love to say we have developed a well-oiled process that is without flaws; however, the entire spring semester has been flawed due to COVID-19. We have developed a plan for Graduation, Senior Activities, End-of-Year Closeout as well as Instructional Packet Drop Off and Locker Cleanout. I ask that you please monitor the Hardin ISD webpage, Facebook and campus social media outlets for all directions regarding the aforementioned topics. If you have any questions or concerns please contact me at 936-298-2112.

The Hardin High School Hornets and Lady Hornets are hard at work this basketball season, but they aren’t the only ones taking the court. Move over Hornets, and make way for the donkeys. That’s right! Donkeys! It’s time for Donkey Basketball!
The Junior and Senior classes of Hardin High School are proud to sponsor the Dairyland Donkey Basketball Show at the Hardin High School gym on Sunday, February 9, 2020 starting at 3:00 p.m. It’s basketball played on real, live donkeys and it will be wilder than a rodeo and funnier than a circus! All local players will be riding, so come out and see someone you know try to ride a donkey and play basketball at the same time. It’s a thrill a minute, and a spill a minute. Laugh as you’ve never laughed before at the wild and crazy Donkey Basketball Show!
Come one, come all and see what new rodeo stars will be born during the wild and crazy Dairyland Donkey Basketball Show!
Tickets are on sale now. Contact Hardin High School at 936-298-2118 for more information.",3.0,"Hardin HS

Dear Hardin ISD Community -

We have had a large amount of rainfall the previous 2 days and a severe weather system is moving into our area at this time. Additionally, water being released from the Livingston Dam has added to our runoff and caused several roads in our District to flood. Jeff Linder with Region 4 is predicting several inches of rain throughout the night to compliment this situation. As a safety precaution for our students, staff and community, Hardin ISD will close all campuses Friday, May 10th as a result of these factors.

Good morning HHS Community,

Please note that the revtrak website which can be used to make Chromebook usage fee, traveling hornet, and food service payments has been restored. In addition, Chromebook cases can be purchased through the site as well.

Link:
https://hardinisd.revtrak.net/Chromebook

Parents/Guardians who elect to use this payment option will simply need to create an account, if they don’t already have one, then use their child's last name and lunch code. After the payment process is complete, a receipt will be sent to the parent/guardian and the Hardin ISD Technology Department.

Due to the delay of revtrak being restored, Chromebooks will not be deployed until August 28th (next Tuesday) to provide enough time for anyone who wanted to pay to still have time. The Hardin ISD Technology Department will begin the deployment process at HHS and work their way to HJHS. Thanks!",0.0,"HARDINISD.REVTRAK.NET

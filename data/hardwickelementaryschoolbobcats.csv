Hello OSUED Families,

Below are our tentative options for students when we open school this year. Given the ever changing guidelines and availability of resources these plans may be updated over the next several weeks. Please consider which option would work best for your child. We are asking that you contact the school this week if you are interested in the Remote Synchronous, or Vt Virtual Learning Cooperative. This will provide us with some idea of how many students we need to plan for in person learning.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=619836495312257&id=161144574514787,,0.0,"A message from Principal Pennock:

Face Mask Initiative

The Hardwick Area Neighbor to Neighbor group has set a goal to provide a face mask, free of charge, for every person in this area still without one. Currently 25 volunteer sewers are generously donating their time and materials to make this possible. This is one simple way that we can all care for one another.

If you or someone you know does not currently have a mask, go to the Hardwick Village Restaurant take-out window any time between 6AM and 8PM to pick one up. Or, head to the Hardwick Area Food Pantry Monday 12-2PM or Thursday and Saturday from 9-11:00AM. You do not need to be a customer at either establishment to pick up a mask. If you are in the East Hardwick area, contact Lisa at or call 472-6207 and she will arrange a pick-up with you at her house. Or, call or text 802-441-3301 or email to request a mask be delivered to you or someone you know.

Please, only one mask per person so that we can be sure that every individual who needs a mask has one.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=567760180519889&id=161144574514787,,0.0,"Hardwick Neighbor to Neighbor

Have you ever thought about volunteering at
Hardwick Elementary?

Hardwick Elementary School is in need of volunteers for a variety of activities throughout the school year.

If you would like to volunteer, simply stop by the office and pick up a volunteer form and a background check form. (If you’ve filled out the forms for the background check, you do not need to fill out another. The background check is good for three years). You do not need to be fingerprinted.

We hope you find volunteering at HES a rewarding experience. Your energy, generosity, caring, and dependability are all part of the positive role model you provide for our students.

I am writing to let you know that your son/daughter will be participating in the Fitness gram fitness testing program the week of April 29th during their p.e. class. The specific components of the test that Hardwick Elementary students will be participating in are the 20 meter PACER run, curl-ups, 90 degree push ups, and the back saver sit and reach. This year all 4th grade scores need to be reported to the Vermont Agency of Education. All students should try their best on these tests while at the same time being aware of how much to safely push themselves. It will be extremely important for any students who have inhalers to make sure they are at school the week of 4/29 for the testing, and the week of 4/22 to practice the events. I suggest talking to your child about what these tests are like, and they are of course more than welcome to practice them at home. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank You

• Students need to be aware that the Odysseyware grade does not reflect grades which will be given by their teachers. New guidelines have been set to allow students to attempt lessons 5 times, quizzes 3 times, and tests 2 times without having to reset or request to unlock.

OPENING WiFi ACCESS FOR HC STUDENTS

During these uncertain times, our students—whether in secondary or post-secondary schools— face significant obstacles as they strive to meet their educational goals. At Southeast, we feel that it is our job as the community’s college to offer support whenever possible.

Many of our schools rely upon remote delivery during the fall semester’s opening weeks, so we are providing free WiFi services in the parking lots on all five of our campuses—Cumberland, Harlan, Middlesboro, Pineville, and Whitesburg. Please inform your students that if they do not have access to the Internet at home, they are welcome to visit our lots and login using our KCTCS guest network.

The health crisis has forced us to use our creativity and adapt to our situation in ways that we could not have anticipated. Working together, we will be able to meet these challenges head on.

During these uncertain times, our students—whether in secondary or post-secondary schools— face significant obstacles as they strive to meet their educational goals. At Southeast, we feel that it is our job as the community’s college to offer support whenever possible.

Many of our schools rely upon remote delivery during the fall semester’s opening weeks, so we are providing free WiFi services in the parking lots on all five of our campuses—Cumberland, Harlan, Middlesboro, Pineville, and Whitesburg. Please inform your students that if they do not have access to the Internet at home, they are welcome to visit our lots and login using our KCTCS guest network.

The health crisis has forced us to use our creativity and adapt to our situation in ways that we could not have anticipated. Working together, we will be able to meet these challenges head on.

Warmest regards,

Vic Adams, Ph.D.
President/CEO",2020-09-02 11:30:39,,

All parents and guardians who chose the In-Person school option for your child/children will need to stop by the school one day next week (August 17th – August 21st) and complete an enrollment packet. Normally we would have just sent these forms home with the students on their first day of school, but with the delay of In-Person instruction this will not be possible. I will be at the school between the hours of 8:30 a.m. – 2:30 p.m. (Tuesday from 11:00 a.m. – 7:00 p.m.) Appointments aren’t necessary, but all CDC guidelines must be followed including wearing a mask and social distancing. You’re welcome to complete the packet at the school or take it with you and return it when you have it completed. This should only take a few minutes of your time. Chrome books will be distributed between August 24th – August 27th by appointment only. Chrome Books will first be distributed to those students who don’t have any access to a computer, tablet, smart phone, etc.

🆕: With #HealthyatSchool guidance set to be released June 24, Kentucky superintendents provide feedback to the Kentucky Department for Public Health and the Kentucky Department of Education on reopening schools in the fall.

Our society expects and backs up school leaders for students to keep their shirts on during school,” Interim Education Commissioner Kevin C. Brown said. “And so it’s generally not a problem to keep shoes and shirts on kids because our society backs that up. The problem we’re having right now is … we don’t have a societal expectation of wearing a mask, unfortunately.

“And it’s to some degree starting to become a divisive issue in our communities. And so that really is placing school leaders in a conundrum.”

KDE cancels K-PREP testing for 2019-2020 school year | Kentucky Teacher

Kentucky Department of Education
March 24 at 4:56 PM ·

NEW: We have canceled K-PREP testing for the 2019-20 year due to the COVID-19 crisis.

Kentucky Interim Education Commissioner Kevin C Brown:

“I hope this will help ease some of the anxiety being felt among our families. I want our teachers and schools to concentrate on providing a great education to their students through the NTI Program rather than worry about standardized testing. Let’s end this year strong despite the extra stress COVID-19 has placed on all of us.”

Harlem has gone above and beyond this year, keeping the less-fortunate in mind and teaching our youth that gratitude should be and ACTION word.

This time, they collected a mountain of warm coats, clothing, hygiene items and so much more for us! It was even organized and labeled!! That made it easier for ya to get it in the hands of the people who so desperately needed it last week. They delivered it during the first hours of a snow storm, too!

Harlem has gone above and beyond this year, keeping the less-fortunate in mind and teaching our youth that gratitude should be and ACTION word.

This time, they collected a mountain of warm coats, clothing, hygiene items and so much more for us! It was even organized and labeled!! That made it easier for ya to get it in the hands of the people who so desperately needed it last week. They delivered it during the first hours of a snow storm, too!

Hey, Harlem!!! We are so grateful for you and I know an awful lot of warm people who feel the same way ❤️❤️❤️",2020-01-29 15:53:52,,

HOOPER books for HARLEM MS

Over the past five years, HMS has hosted Mike Mullin, author of Ashfall, and Ben Mikaelsen, author of Touching Spirit Bear. Our goal is that our students will experience an author visit once while they attend HMS. This year our goal has expanded. We are working to purchase every HMS student a copy of our author’s book to keep. In March, HMS will welcome Geoff Herbach, author of this year’s One School One Book title Hooper.

This is no small dream. Harlem Middle School has over 1,000 students. We are exploring many funding opportunities. Andy’s Books for Kids has graciously donated 517 books, and HMS teachers have applied for several grants. Our goal is within reach.

We have two ways you can help us. Barnes & Noble will be hosting an HMS fundraiser on January 4 online or in the store. A portion of your purchases using our voucher will be donated to our cause.

If you are unable to shop the Barnes & Noble Fundraiser, you can make a donation at https://teacherfunder.com/harlemmiddleschool-shields/

Thank you for your support.

Huge thanks to Harlem District #122 for bringing us 1,583 sack lunches the students made us!!! Holy cow this was a blessing!

They pulled up in this big, giant trailer and the people we serve jumped right into unloading the mountain of lunches!

So many people will be touched by this act of kindness. The homeless, the hungry, the human trafficked...and the youth that lovingly decorated the bags, raised the funds and packed all of this food up.

This is what community looks like.

Absolutely beautiful ❤️",8.0,"Great job!!!!

Did you know that only 9% of children in low-income neighborhoods such as Harlem will graduate from college? That’s compared to 77% of students from more affluent parts of New York City, just a few blocks from our schools.
At HVA, we believe that a child’s opportunities in life should not be based on his or her zip code and that is why we work to ensure that 100% of our students go to college.

HVA students are beating the odds.

We provide an outstanding K-12 education for over 2,000 children each year because we know, as you do, that education is the most effective way to achieve equality and break the cycle of poverty.

Say yes to equality.
Say yes to education.
Say yes to HVA.

Please make your gift today.
Thank you from everyone at HVA!

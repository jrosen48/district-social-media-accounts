We hope that our graduates and their families will appreciate the opportunity to celebrate this accomplishment in an open, familiar venue while observing the current guidelines in place.

If inclement weather occurs, ceremonies will be moved indoors and the number of family members participating with their graduate will be reduced to seven (7).

Through our first two weeks, it has been very hard to anticipate the demand at each store, but we are remaining connected to our communities in order to help as many people as possible.

Here is the HCTV ""End of Year Highlights"" video without the intro. The ""Quarantine intro"" was originally planned for a different video project, it is well-worth watching and still on this channel, but some may just want to watch the main highlights video (especially if a 2nd or 3rd watch) without the intro. Have a great summer from the HCTV staff!

Governor Gretchen Whitmer has ordered all Michigan public and private schools closed from Monday, March 16th through Sunday, April 5th. I will be sending a district call out later this morning, but I wanted to get information out as soon as possible. I will also be talking about the closure on the FaceBook Live show at 7:00 AM.

At this time there are many questions and we will work diligently to keep you informed.

As a reminder, Friday, March 13th (today) is a scheduled day off for students and a professional development day for teachers.

This is an unprecedented time. We all need to pull together in the best interest of our community to help our kids through this difficult situation. We need to be leaders to reassure our kids that we are strong. Together we can do unbelievable things.

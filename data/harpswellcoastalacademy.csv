Harper is headed north!
Harper is an adult female great blue heron tagged with a GPS transmitter in Harpswell, Maine last spring with the help of students from Harpswell Coastal Academy and volunteers from Harpswell Heritage Land Trust. She wowed the world last fall with an amazing migration flight of 38 hours nonstop over the open ocean from New Brunswick to Florida. She then spent the winter in Cuba and has been on her way north since April 13th. She first stopped in The Bahamas, very close to Cornelia’s wintering area. She headed north but then took a sharp left turn and settled in Florida for a few days. We lost some data between then and April 18th when she showed up in Virginia. As of last night she was in Salisbury, NH. Where will she end up next? Will she stop in Maine? Where will she spend the summer? Will she nest this year or ‘float’ around like last year? So many questions! Stay tuned to Facebook for updates on Harper and our other tagged herons. [Note: points are true GPS locations; lines connect the points and don't represent the true path.]",0.0,"Harper!!!

Telling Room - HCA Book Launch
In the fall of 2019, fourteen students in Whitney Conway’s class at Harpswell Coastal Academy (HCA) set out to write a book of personal narratives. What began as a simple game of Two Truths and a Lie quickly evolved into something more profound than perhaps any of us expected. For two hours every Monday and Thursday, these students spoke truth to power. They dealt with loss. They questioned the rules. They recorded the strange and funny details that make up a life. Now they are ready to share those stories with others. Celebrate the students of HCA at this book launch for ""somehow i knew what to do"", an event open to the public and sponsored by HCA and The Telling Room. Light refreshments will be served.

AMAZING!!! Harper is in Florida after flying 38.6 hrs nonstop over the open ocean!

Map Text:
Harper is an adult female Great Blue Heron tagged with a GPS transmitter by biologists this past May in Harpswell, Maine. She spent the summer in northern New Brunswick, Canada, and departed on her southward migration on October 3rd at 5:30pm. She flew directly south to Saint John, New Brunswick, and rested and refueled for 13 hours before taking off for a long journey over the Atlantic Ocean. Her next landfall was on October 6th at 4:10am in Nocatee, Florida. She flew nonstop for 38.6 hours over the open ocean! Over the last day and a half she has leisurely (for her) made her way south to DeBary, Florida. Will she stay in Florida for the winter, or continue past the North American mainland? To follow her movements on movebank.org (typically updated at 6pm each night), follow the instructions here: https://www1.maine.gov/wordpress/ifwheron/tracking-project/1-2/.",7.0,"Harper has headed South for the winter!

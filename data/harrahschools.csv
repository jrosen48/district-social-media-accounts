First off, thank you so much for your patience and kindness today during pick-up and drop-off. Our pick-up system had a glitch that will, hopefully, be fixed tomorrow. We have a Plan B if not. You will do the same thing with one change that we implemented for some of you today. The purple line indicates an extension of our path for all cars dropping off in the morning. Kindergarten and first grade parents should use it when picking up. Just a reminder, please do not get in line to pick up your kindergartener and/or first grader until 2:50 at the earliest. If not, it blocks our pre-k from picking up at their earlier release time and blocks our school buses. Kindergarten and first grade do not release until 3:05 PM.

RBE’s Student of the Day is Cameron Scott.
Cameron is a 4th grader with a big personality. He is a very smart young man and a hard worker. He has a good sense of humor and is known for his awesome dance moves. Just like the rest of us, sometimes he makes mistakes, but he is working daily to be the best he can be. I’m looking forward to seeing him again soon!! Mrs. Lashley",0.0,"Russell Babb Elementary

💙🎉💙🎉💙🎉💙🎉💙🎉💙🎉💙🎉
Stephanie McDonald and Sarena Sanders
💙🎉💙🎉💙🎉💙🎉💙🎉💙🎉💙🎉

We are immensely proud of them. These two girls put in the WORK it takes to be recognized for this amazing honor. They are both true blue Panthers with a big love for the game and an even bigger love for their team. We didn’t get our season like we should have.. if we had, you’d be watching us in the state tournament this week, I have no doubt. But I am elated that these two were able to receive the honor of all-state, even without being able to enjoy their senior seasons.

They will both be playing college softball, so they’re not done yet! Look for Steph at Oklahoma Baptist University and Sarena at Independence Community College in Kansas.

So much love to you both and good luck in your future endeavors!!

Outside of school her number one love is softball. She loves to make TikTok videos, FaceTime her friends, and most of all annoy her brother.

Anyone with students 8th grade and up are invited to attend an informational meeting for our Spring Break 2021 trip to Ireland and Scotland. We will discuss the details of the trip, travel expectations and cost. The meetings last about 45 minutes.

This will be my 6th trip overseas and I hope that if you have any interest or know anyone who might, I encourage you to attend this brief meeting.

The meeting will be in the Art room behind the tennis courts at Harrah High School on Thursday, February 27th at 6 PM

His particular specialty is the ACT, as he tutors many students along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Mr. Eadie has helped dozens of Harrison Central students reach the ""ACT 30+ Club"". HCHS students who have scored a perfect 36 on their ACT have credited Mr. Eadie for helping them achieve that goal.

Mr. Eadie is also a five-time recipient of the STAR Teacher award and has received the HCHS yearbook dedication and HCHS Teacher of the Year award during his time at HCHC.

Based on his performance, Mr. Eadie has been recruited to serve as an ACT trainer to other educators in the future.

Our nurses will be training all teachers and staff at their schools to recognize students who may appear to be sick, along with encouraging important precautions like hand washing, sanitizing, and social distancing.

Our nurses will also be available should parents have any questions or concerns about student health. Plus, they will work closely with school counselors and social workers to assist students with their physical, emotional, and mental health.

“We are blessed and grateful to have a nurse at every school in the Harrison County School District. A majority of our nurses are veterans, so many of our families have come to know them on a personal level. Our nurses are well trained and ready to implement these extra measures for the health, safety, and well-being of our students and staff,” said Dr. Laretta Marks, HCSD Director of Student Services.

Team Palazzo is thrilled to welcome back Peyton Pope, only this time she’s in our DC office!

Peyton, a native of Gulfport, is the daughter of Pat and Karla Pope. She graduated from Mississippi College in May with two Bachelor of Arts degrees in English Writing and History. Peyton will be attending the Mississippi College School of Law beginning this fall and plans to practice criminal prosecution after graduation. She enjoys history and since being in DC has spent most of her free time walking around the city and seeing the major sights. She chose to apply for the DC internship so she could continue serving the people of Mississippi while gaining unique experience. She is passionate about giving back to the state that has given so much to her and loves being able to learn about and serve the cities she grew up in.

We are so happy to have Peyton back on the team and look forward to working with her this summer. #TeamPalazzo",0.0,"Way to go, Peyton Pope!!

Seniors lined up in their vehicles at Crosspoint Church on North Swan Road. With Harrison County Sheriff’s Deputies leading the way, the seniors traveled north on Highway 49, turned onto School Road, then headed toward the HCHS campus.

As the seniors’ names were announced, each student received a special yard sign and a bag of goodies. As the students left the campus, they deposited their Time Capsule memorabilia by the front gate. The Time Capsule will be buried on the HCHS campus at a later date.

Many parents, friends, and community supporters showed up with decorated signs and pompoms to cheer on the seniors. It was a memorable and emotional day for everyone!!

#HCSDClassof2020",,,0.0,"Harrison Central High celebrated our seniors today with a car parade, sign distribution, and a Class of 2020 Time Capsule!

Seniors lined up in their vehicles at Crosspoint Church on North Swan Road. With Harrison County Sheriff’s Deputies leading the way, the seniors traveled north on Highway 49, turned onto School Road, then headed toward the HCHS campus.

As the seniors’ names were announced, each student received a special yard sign and a bag of goodies. As the students left the campus, they deposited their Time Capsule memorabilia by the front gate. The Time Capsule will be buried on the HCHS campus at a later date.

Many parents, friends, and community supporters showed up with decorated signs and pompoms to cheer on the seniors. It was a memorable and emotional day for everyone!!

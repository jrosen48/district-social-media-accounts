Every day, our secretaries take hundreds of phone calls from parents and community members. They are the “Voice on the Phone” and in many cases, the main contact point for our schools. We appreciate everything they do to ensure our schools run smoothly and we wanted to shine the spotlight on them. We also wanted to let you “see” and get to know our “Voice on the Phone.”

Harrisonville Elementary Wildcats Attendance Secretary Beth Bullock has been working in our district for six years. She chose to work for the district because she knew it would be fun and rewarding to be part of the #WildcatFamily.

“Most of my days go by very fast, so I must be having fun:-)”

Beth’s favorite part of the job is helping students and their families.

“I love all of the happy waves I get from students who walk by the office!”

Beth’s family includes of a husband, three sons, one daughter and two dogs. When she is not working she enjoys traveling or just finding ways to spend time with her family.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10159339095678072&id=212101818071,,0.0,"#FeatureFriday

We want to celebrate our grandparents with a Facebook photo album. We'll be accepting photo submissions all week (through Friday at 4 p.m.) via email to communications@harrisonvilleschools.org. Please do your best to limit submissions - all grandkids in one photo with grandparents or multiple grandparents in a photo with their grandchild(ren). We'll post photos daily this week.

This school year our Food 4 Thought Weekend Food program will run differently than in the past. Rather than distributing food each week to students at school, we will hold monthly food distribution events for families to pick food up. Right now we aim to begin the program during the second week of September. If your child needs the program this year please complete the Google Form linked.

In order for us to prepare the food boxes for September, please have your form submitted by September 8th.

So, keep in mind there will be some bright minds coming and going to schools, those cross walks are going to be busy so please give the pedestrians the right of way. The reduced speeds in school zones will be going into effect and school buses will be making their stops.

Today we visited Harrisonville Early Childhood Center Wildcats paraprofessional Rose Ann Bostic's home to present her with the 2020 Outstanding Community Involvement Award. This award is presented annually to a staff member who gives back to our community through his/her volunteer efforts. Rose Ann has volunteered weekly at the Shepherd's Staff Food Pantry and beyond that, took it upon herself to raise funds for the food pantry with a pledge walk - she and her friends raised over $3,000. Additionally, Rose Ann helped organize and coordinate a salute to service members by the HHS volleyball team. She regularly volunteers and fundraises as she sees needs within our community.

While many things have changed over the last few months, our long-term facility & finance needs have not.

Proposition N is a no tax rate increase issue for $22,700,000 for providing funds to improve safety & security, replace roofs, HVAC units, and boilers; improve technology and playgrounds, and other repairs & improvements as identified in the Hollis+Miller (architect) facilities needs assessment. Passage would result in a 10 cent rollback of the levy.

The students in Mrs. Ory and Mrs. Cooper’s classes have concluded their study of Europe with a virtual museum project. The students researched one country in Europe using the learning goals of geography that had been covered the entire year. The students then created virtual museums highlighting their countries’ information. The museums are set up to be interactive, so have fun clicking on pictures and videos for added information. Enjoy these museums!

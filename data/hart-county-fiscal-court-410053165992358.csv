Why is social distancing so important? Social distancing can help slow the spread of #COVID19. This means staying home unless necessary, avoiding crowded places, and maintaining a distance of about 6 feet from others.

Remember, social distancing doesn't mean boredom! Friends and family are still a phone call, Face Time, or text message away. Other ways to pass the time include starting a new book, taking up a hobby like yoga (YouTube has great videos!), or learning how to play an instrument. It is also important to maintain a healthy diet, stay hydrated, and continue physical activity to stay healthy.

Here is some guidance from the Division of Child Care regarding the Coronavirus:
Since there are currently no confirmed cases in Kentucky, the Department of Public Health has not put out any specific information for child care programs on how to stop the spread of the illness. I would encourage you to continue diligent handwashing procedures, particularly when children wipe their noses or use the restroom. Be very careful about children washing their hands before and after Play-Doh or other sensory materials. Make sure to empty your water table more frequently. Other than that, we have no additional updates at this time. The Division of Child Care will let you know if that changes.

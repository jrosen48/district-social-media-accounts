The students did an amazing job and contributed in various ways in making the event a success. This event wouldn't be possible without the support of local businesses who donated items either for the pig roast or auction. The money they raised will go towards field trips for this year, but the majority of the money will stay in their account to go towards their prom and senior trip. This gives them a great head start!

Also, a special thanks to Ms. Dwyer, Mrs. Sutliff, and Ms. Stewart for helping with this. In addition, thank you to Mrs. Beecher and Mrs. Ward for helping in the kitchen Friday night too!

The students did an amazing job and contributed in various ways in making the event a success. This event wouldn't be possible without the support of local businesses who donated items either for the pig roast or auction. The money they raised will go towards field trips for this year, but the majority of the money will stay in their account to go towards their prom and senior trip. This gives them a great head start!

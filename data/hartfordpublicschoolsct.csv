Saturday is Connecticut's Free Fishing Day. On Saturday (May 9th) anyone can fish without a fishing license or Trout and Salmon Stamp. All other rules and regulations, including size limits, daily limits, and seasons, are still in effect. Free Fishing Day covers both the inland and marine waters of Connecticut.

Fishing is a great way to relieve stress, but anglers must continue to follow guidance from Governor Ned Lamont to stay safe and healthy. Maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from others unless fishing with members of the same household. If you arrive at a location and people are already fishing, grant them space and move on.

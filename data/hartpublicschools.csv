Good evening Lil' Pirates,

Since we couldn't hold our typical Open House this year, we have created a virtual one for you! Each grade level or team created a separate one because we didn't want the video to be too long. We incorporated our new technology skills we have learned these past two weeks. We miss our Lil' Pirates and we can't wait to see you on September 8th! The virtual teachers are making phone calls this week to families to set up an appointment for in person next week to discuss the contract, go over Google Classroom, check out a Chromebook if you need one, etc. We hope you enjoy the videos!",0.0,"Spitler Elementary

During this time I will be playing music. Seniors are invited to drive up to the gates on the north end of the field using the service drive, and get out and have a turn to 'ring the bell'. This can only be done by individual as we must continue to abide by and practice social distancing. We hope you will be able to make it.

Face-to-face instruction has been suspended for the year by the Governor. The buildings are working on a plan for the rest of the school year. One of the requirements for us is to submit a plan to the WSESD and we will move extremely fast to submit the plan. Any academic activities that we have been doing during the past week were to provide something to you until we had further clarification from the State. Our official plan will be more robust than what we are currently providing. I will be sending the community a google survey by tomorrow to our parents. The survey will be tallying responses so we can get a better understanding of your perspective of educational needs. This is uncharted territory for everyone and I think it is safe to assume stress is higher than normal. Ideally, I want for us to create a plan that doesn’t add more stress for you.

Please stay tuned for more updates!

Fourth Grade Blanket Project -

Spitler’s 4th grade students are going to start a community project. They will be making blankets for the students in the Kindergarten classes. This project will give the 4th graders an opportunity to be generous and show compassion. These life skills would be a great benefit to our youth. There are about 125 students currently enrolled in our Kindergarten. The blankets will be a fleece material. If anyone is interested in donating, you may drop off fleece pieces (1 ½ yards) or make a check payable to Hart Public Schools. Donations may be dropped off at the Spitler office or mailed to the address below. The deadline to donate is March 26th.

To encourage more families to take advantage of the healthy choices available for school breakfast, Hartselle City Schools will celebrate National School Breakfast Week during March 2-6, 2020.
Busy weekday mornings make it a challenge for many families to find time for a healthy breakfast.

Score higher on standardized tests
Have better concentration and memory

They set up a donation table and collected for the Heart for Kids fund. This fund benefits students who need help with fees, supplies, lunch money, or school activities. These HIS students raised over $1600 through their efforts. Other students wrote letters to neighbors and friends, helped serve at church, and for their family.

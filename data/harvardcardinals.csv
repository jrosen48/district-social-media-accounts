Enrichment activities are updated for this week on our website!

Why do we do these?

Think of it this way. If you are a track athlete and you take off two months from any athletic activity, workouts, or practices, how will it feel when you come back to track? You will be behind others who have been working, but it's more about you! You will be behind of where you left off because your body isn't used to the work outs and remembering where it was at.

This is the same concept as education. We want to bridge the gap and make it as small as possible. Rather than looking at this as an ""extra long summer break,"" we encourage families and students to complete the enrichment activities to help keep the mind in practice. Continue the ""workouts"" for the brain to help continue education and learning in order to pick up right where we left off when we return!

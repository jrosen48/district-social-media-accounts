Good morning Hornets, and happy last day for the 2019-20 School Year! It is very difficult to believe that we are at this point of the year, but with that being said, I want to take a moment to celebrate everyone for their perseverance throughout the past couple of months and am confident we will all come back to school stronger in the Fall as a result.

Prior to heading off for summer, I hope you have a few minutes to read this week's Harvard Herald. I look forward to reconnecting in August!

Dr. Tafoya shares the plan to prevent the “summer slide” of knowledge for students. Harvard students can take three-week summer courses called SOAR (Summer Opportunities for Academic Requirements) to catch up on material they missed due to recent school closures.

Students have the option to participate in one or all three of the sessions. SOAR will be online and free for all students. Students are highly encouraged to attend at least one session to ensure academic success when they return to school in the fall.

You’ll also see that HHS Asst Coach, Jeremy Gricar is a finalist for IWCOA Asst Coach of the year. Congrats to both of them!

What you won’t see is a post that HHS head coach, David Schultz is also a finalist for the IWCOA Head Coach of the Year. One of the many reasons Coach Schultz deserves this award is his willingness to give the spotlight to others.

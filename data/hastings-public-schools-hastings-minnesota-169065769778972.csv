When a test site is cancelled due to weather, the first thing we do is notify ACT. ACT then gets back to us next week with our options.

One option will be to have a “rescheduled test date” that is not one of predetermined national test dates. For example, they may tell us we can test next Saturday or the following Saturday. These are not standard test dates, but “rescheduled test dates” specific to our testing site. ACT will notify students of the rescheduled test date.

The other option will be for students to opt to take the test on another national test date. For example, they may not be able to make the rescheduled test date, but they can test on the next national test date (i.e. June 9th, 2018).

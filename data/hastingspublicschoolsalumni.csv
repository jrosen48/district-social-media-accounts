Thank you to everyone who attended our inaugural Athletic Hall of Fame Banquet last night. I think everyone had a great time seeing friends, teammates, and people that they admired and were inspired by in the years they attending Hastings High.

Congratulations to all of the Inductees, and their families who accepted their awards. Wonderful speeches were given by each individual, teammate, or one of their family members. It was nice to hear their stories, relive their glory moments, and to hear the excitement and admiration in their voice.

Thank you to Athletic Director Tracy Douglas, and her committee for organizing this wonderful event. Also thank you to those who donated items for the silent auction, and the corporate sponsors.

The HPSF Board of Directors and Staff wish to thank those of you who have helped to provide the scholarships that will help these students find the PATHWAYS TO THEIR HOPES AND DREAMS.

Staff Idea Grants are one of the most effective means of encouraging innovative upgrading of classroom materials and technology and promotion of staff development that is beyond the
resources of the Hastings Public Schools. For the 2015-16 school year, the Hastings Public Schools Foundation will expend $10,020 for Grants that will impact eighteen teachers and their classrooms. These particular grants are made possible through donations from the Hastings Philanthropic Yoga Society, Hastings Public Schools employees, and matching funds from the Kinman Oldfield Family Trust.

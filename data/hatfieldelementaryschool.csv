Tomorrow, the SA Class of 2020 will be receiving their diplomas, one at a time, in 10-minute increments inside the school, accompanied by up to four family members, all wearing masks. If you are one of those grads, or a family member, please consider donating a photo of yourself or your student receiving their diploma in cap and gown and MASK!

The Annual Town Meeting is coming up next Tuesday!

Here's what you need to know:
The meeting will take place outside at the Lion's Club Pavilion so that residents can maintain a safe distance apart.

Check in will begin at 5:30 and be done while in your car, two cars at a time, at a check point as you drive in to park.
People are also encouraged to bring lawn chairs so that they can sit while maintaining social distancing.

2020 Annual Town Warrant containing the articles the town will be asked to vote on is available on the town website: https://www.townofhatfield.org/home/news/2020-annual-town-meeting-warrant

ANOTHER SPONSORED PHOTO -- this one by Museum Volunteer Wunderley Stauder. Wunderley not only worked on the Marian Billings/WWI exhibit in the Historical Museum, but she found an article online that described and pictured the Vierzon, France, Red Cross Canteen where Marian worked during the war. It is the ONLY PHOTO we’ve seen of where Marian worked, and we now have a copy, courtesy of the Minnesota Historical Society, and of Wunderley, who funded its purchase.

We’ve added the photo to our WWI exhibit (see below), but you’ll have to wait to see it in person until it’s deemed safe for the museum to reopen. Thanks, Wunderley!

It’s also a great article, and you can check it out here:

Though her novels may seem like sketches of small-town life, her wit, clever use of dialogue, and unsettling undercurrents of tragedy prove her books have staying power. Her novel, Quartet of Autumn, was nominated for the Booker Prize. Jane Gardam's novels plumb the depths of the human experience.

LIFE IN HATFIELD DURING COVID-19. Today we’re launching a new project to document life for those who live and work in Hatfield during this pandemic.

Do you know what life was like in Hatfield during the influenza (“Spanish flu”) pandemic of 1918-1919, when 417 Hatfield residents contracted the flu, and between six and 11 people died from it?

Neither do we. Because we have no personal records.

This time, we want more than numbers. We want to know how your lives have been affected. YOUR history is Hatfield’s history.

For details on how and what to submit and to take a look at some early contributions, go to:

With 150+ years of tobacco farming on as much as 2,000 acres in the past, it has come down to just a few family farms keeping the tradition alive. We don’t want to wait any longer to capture the stories and pictures of working in Hatfield tobacco fields and shops.

Check out the website and please share with anyone you know who worked tobacco in Hatfield, or was from Hatfield and worked in a neighboring town. Then send us your stories!

The weather has not been ideal for the goats so they haven’t been playing as hard as usual. They love sunny warm (but not hot) days and we’ve had a lot of rain, wind and clouds this week! Towards the end of the video, you can see our Easter babies tentatively jumping off the beam with some beginner flair. #stayhomewatchgoats",2020-04-23 22:03:08,https://video-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/94073823_226018962168257_7316648956795027456_n.mp4?_nc_cat=101&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=Xp7qyLiO3_YAX-sS2f9&_nc_ht=video-atl3-1.xx&oh=342afaf8e8bc77050fbcc9151555188a&oe=5F5DCF1A,

Amber, our cataloguer extraordinaire, has a few good reads to recommend this weekend:

If you haven't read the trilogy beginning with A Discovery of Witches by Deborah Harkness, you are in for a treat. The first book is a fantastical love story, the second is an immersive journey back in time, and the third is a thrilling, scientific tale that wraps up the story and leaves room for spin-offs.

Class Mom by Laurie Gelman is just a really funny read about parents and kids in school. It is a good reminder not to take ourselves too seriously! At this point it's almost nostalgic...

Small Admissions by Amy Poeppel is another funny book about a woman facing adversity in the world of New York City private school admissions. She takes life on in the strangest ways but with a smile.

MAY 21 ANNUAL MEETING PROGRAM POSTPONED. After much consideration, the Hatfield Historical Society Board has decided to postpone the in-person program to introduce our oral history project at the Hatfield American Legion to a time when everyone will feel comfortable gathering. And since we don’t yet know when that will be, we are not setting a new date at this time. We hope you will understand this decision.

BUT, the debut of the VIRTUAL EXHIBIT, “Fifty Years Later: Hatfield Vietnam War Veterans Share Their Stories,” is still scheduled for Memorial Day of this year, and we will let you know once it’s finished. This new website will feature full interviews, highlighted clips and images for each of the 10 in-country Vietnam veterans and one Vietnam War nurse, telling stories that have mostly not been told outside of veterans’ circles.",0.0,"Hatfield Historical Museum

REST IN PEACE, PAT CADY (1935-2020). The Hatfield Historical Society is very sad to lose one of its board members, a past president and a dear friend. For more than a decade, Pat was one of the prime organizers of the Historical Society’s Hatfield Fall Festival and the Annual Jim Labbee Memorial Antique Classic Car, Truck & Tractor Show. Pat (Labbee) Cady grew up in Hatfield, raised her kids here, was a Brownie leader and Hatfield’s first female police officer (see photo). She’s also been a world-traveling member of the Young@Heart Chorus since 2006, even participating in a recent Zoom rehearsal (see their Facebook page).

THE MILL RIVER RISING. The Flood of 1936 post #3. Take a good look. Can you imagine how much water there needed to be for the dam next to the Old Mill to be flush with the water level? Here’s something else we’ve learned from examining old photos – even small differences can help you ID locations.

For the ’36 Flood, we have multiple copies of some of the images, but different collections give us additional IDs. Individually, the images are hard to place, but taken together, you see the edge of the same barn, or the same cut of a tree branch, and they begin to fall together and make sense.

Still some mysteries, though. Can you help?",0.0,"Hatfield Historical Museum

A Word on Exercise Intensity.

Dear Fitness Friends,
As you know, I’m a huge proponent for daily exercise for mind and body. This includes a minimum of 30 minutes daily. In addition to the obvious benefits of mood and general health, there is evidence that moderate intensity exercise improves immune function, the body’s ability to fight infection.

When exercise is taken from the moderate to the intense zone, such as running a marathon type exertion, there is a relative drop in immune function. That’s why many marathon runners, cross fitters, and triathletes get a cold 48-72 hours after a period of extreme exertion. I’m attaching a link on this phenomenon.

So.... my best advice:
1) Exercise every day for a minimum of 30 minutes
2) Outside is great if possible both for the fresh air and mental benefits
3) This is NOT the time to “crush”’your workout, not the time to go for the “max”
4) Keep encouraging everyone in your life to get off the couch and get outside and move

Social Media Dangers Exposed by Mom Posing as 11-Year-Old

Wait Until 8th

A 37-year old mom goes undercover as an 11-year old girl to expose the dangers facing kids on social media platforms like Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, and Kik. Left unsupervised, young children can be exposed to online predators, grooming, and psychological abuse within minutes.

They need you to set healthy boundaries to help keep them safe. They need you to monitor how their online world is unfolding. They need you to prepare them for not if but when they are asked to send a nude picture or meet up with a stranger. They need you to talk to them about sexting, child predators and grooming. They need you.

Stay tuned for resources to help soon from Wait Until 8th. We are about to launch a digital training program for families to help kids across the country use technology safely, appropriately and moderately.",0.0,"YOUTUBE.COM

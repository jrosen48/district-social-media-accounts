Under her guidance, Kindergarten and fifth grade book buddies wrote and performed musicals based on pictures books. Here is an excerpt of Mr. Caira’s and Mr. Higuera’s classes performing their musical stage adaptation of Rumpelstiltskin’s Daughter by Diane Stanley.

Lyrics:
Hope had an amazing idea.
She knew how to turn gold into a meal.
When the poor are too poor
And the rich are too rich,
You have to have hope.
Here’s my sales pitch.
If you have plenty, make sure to share.
From the good of your heart a garden can grow.
Greed can’t be the seed you sow.
It’s time to give. The time is now.",0.0,"Another highlight from Page To Stage performances on the last day of school.

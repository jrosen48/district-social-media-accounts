Posted at the request of the school department :
HVAC technicians from our air-quality consultant Leftfield have finished inspections of ventilation and exhaust systems at all 17 #Haverhill schools and have certified that assuming certain things continue to be done , the buildings are in compliance with the American Society of Heating and Air-Conditioning (ASHRAE) COVID-19 Building Readiness/Reopening Recommendations.

The School Department has also purchased more than 300 hospital-grade air scrubbers. I am attaching the Sept. 10 Leftfield letter here. It speaks for itself
The assistant superintendent also compiled 3 pages of addendum. they were attached to the report. That has been made available to the press and the teachers . We will be asking the school department to post that also.

It looks like this morning we would be ok getting everyone to school without much of a snow issue. However, this afternoon’s dismissal is not looking as promising. Our primary concern is getting all of our students and staff home today safely. The HPS storm team has been watching weather forecasts late into last night and early this morning. After great consideration, we have decided to cancel school in Haverhill today, Tuesday, December 17, 2019.

So, boys and girls, the official call is in…No School, All Schools, Haverhill Public Schools.

We expect to have the schools cleared for tomorrow and look forward to seeing all of your happy faces in the morning.",2019-12-17 05:11:23,,

Every day we all come to work to provide our scholars the best experiences we can to engage you and provide you access to the skills and opportunities necessary to reach your dreams. Today I want to thank Commissioner Jeffrey Riley for coming to Haverhill High School to discuss his plans to support teaching and learning and leverage the state’s resources to provide you all a world class education.

Commissioner Riley has proposed a set of plans described a Deeper Learning that provide real world learning experiences for all kids.

Many of these experiences already exist in pockets in our schools and across the state. Commissioner Riley is looking to support teachers and administrators through partnerships that will grow these experiences so that every student is engaged and has access and opportunities to prepare them for their college and career choice.

Your voices and advocacy will be shaping Haverhill High School today as well as into the future!

Sadly, a senior girl at Haverhill High school passed away last night in a car accident. Counselors are currently on site to support students and staff in need. Classes are continuing for those that are able to attend. Families who wish to pick up their students may do so however, at this time we are not releasing students to walk or drive themselves home. The high school will remain open this afternoon and counselors will be available for any community members in need of support. More details will follow about services. Thank you for respecting the privacy of the family in this time of great sadness.

We will be having a get together in the HHS Auditorium today after school. A vigil will be planned for later in the week and we will let everyone know the details when we have them.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=934896973376747&id=120345411498578,,0.0,"Dear Parents/Guardians,

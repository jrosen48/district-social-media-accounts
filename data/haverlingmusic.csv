The state qualifier game for boys soccer is now set for Tuesday night at Avon High School. Game time is set for 7:00pm. The Rams will take on the Class B1 champions, Pal-Mac.

For students in grades 7-12 that are interested in riding a spectator bus, You need to be signed up with a permission slip and $5 turned into your respective office by Tuesday at noon so we know wether or not we have enough for the bus.

In order to be a little more efficient, parents can send in a written permission slip with $5 tomorrow (Monday) as compared to waiting to get the printed up permission slips from the office. Or you print out the slip that appears with this post.

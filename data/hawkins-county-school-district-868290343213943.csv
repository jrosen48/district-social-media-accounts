Following the Governor’s recommendation yesterday, HCS will remain closed for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year. While this is not how any of us would have chosen to close out this school year, it is the right decision to ensure everyone’s safety. Please watch for announcements regarding end of year events such as prom and graduation. At this point, large group gatherings are still not allowed. HCS administration will make decisions in the next several weeks regarding these events and any necessary adjustments. Please continue to emphasize the importance of learning with your children while we remain closed. Make use of the resources our teachers and staff have made available and reach out to your teachers with any questions.

Thank you for your patience,

Hello To All My Chiefs!

First let me say thank you for your patience during this challenging time. We have had to change plans again. This was my mistake. Please forgive me!

The Shelter in Place order from our Mayor was meant to go into effect tonight. So, we will not be at school tomorrow to hand out hard copies of school activities. We will make an announcement after the shelter in place is lifted about when we will provide student work. Students may still access their classes online, but we will NOT be handing out hard copies tomorrow.

Again, I am sorry for misinforming you. Stay home and stay safe. I really do miss you and cannot wait for us to be together again!!

To that end, a group of female cosmetology students from Volunteer High School toured the facilities of Miyake Forging North America earlier today. Barry Reeves, General Manager of the Phipp's Bend Miyake plant, guided the students and explained what Miyake does and how manufacturing impacts all lives on a daily basis. I am incredibly thankful for Mr. Reeves and his willingness to meet with our students and give them a level of insight into manufacturing that they otherwise may have never had. #HCSProud",2020-02-05 09:47:32,,

CHS had fifteen students audition on Saturday. Of those fifteen there were eight that made the clinic. These students are competing with students from Chattanooga to Mountain City and everywhere in between. I think I heard someone say yesterday that over 1,200 students auditioned and around 2,400 were signed up. This is the highest number of students that have made the clinic in my time as director. We also have one students who is in the 1st alternate position. There is a good possibility she will get called up as well.

CHS had fifteen students audition on Saturday. Of those fifteen there were eight that made the clinic. These students are competing with students from Chattanooga to Mountain City and everywhere in between. I think I heard someone say yesterday that over 1,200 students auditioned and around 2,400 were signed up. This is the highest number of students that have made the clinic in my time as director. We also have one students who is in the 1st alternate position. There is a good possibility she will get called up as well.

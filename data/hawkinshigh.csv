Your input is very much appreciated.
In the coming weeks, HISD will share our Return to School Guidebook with staff and families. HISD staff, students, bus drivers, substitutes, parents etc… will all go through several training sessions and discuss all of the safety plans. In the meantime, please help us know more about your technology needs and your most desired pathway for learning in 2020-2021.

These two young men--Dalton Wages and Colton Payne--have really impressed me this year as a teacher. They both created CO2-powered vehicles and at first glance, these might look like toys. However, there was an extreme amount of precision and detail that went into the designs of these two cars. They had to consider the aerodynamic principles of lift, thrust, friction, drag, fluid dynamics, and many other factors.

Even though I knew that they had submitted excellent work, I am still amazed that these two will now have a chance to travel to Washington D.C. this summer to race their cars at the national level! The top ten cars at state get to compete at the national level, and Colton and Dalton both placed in the top ten!

Your input is very much appreciated.
In the coming weeks, HISD will share our Return to School Guidebook with staff and families. HISD staff, students, bus drivers, substitutes, parents etc‚Ä¶ will all go through several training sessions and discuss all of the safety plans.

Every year, TAME brings together students to compete and celebrate achievement in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). During a STEM Competition, students participate in both a math and a science test, and then team up in different engineering roles to solve real-world problems in a timed Engineering Design Challenge.

Ms Cranford is the STEM coach, and she has worked hard to start this STEM Club at HES this year. We are very excited for our students to represent Hawkins ISD at this event.",2019-04-26 21:00:20,,

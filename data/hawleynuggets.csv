Parents/Guardians/Students,

Hawley Community Education would like to share a few updates with you related to summer recreation activities.

It is with much consideration for the regard to safety that Summer Recreation classes and activities have been cancelled except for a few virtual activities for June. You will be able to register for these virtual classes next week on-line on the Hawley School Website under the Community Education Tab. We are not making any decisions for July classes at this time. It is possible that some activities that were planned for June could be rescheduled for July. We are committed to doing everything that we can to offer students opportunities to be active and participate this summer all while following guidance from the Governor, MN Department of Health and the MN Department of Education.

If you have any questions or ideas for virtual classes, feel free to contact Community Education at 218-483-3555 X1012 or bgottenborg@hawley.k12.mn.us.

Thank you very much for your patience during this time.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=891416867951878&id=337880099972227,,0.0,"May 14, 2020

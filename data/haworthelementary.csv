The State Board of Education met today in Oklahoma City and determined that all schools will be out for the remainder of the current school year. This also includes all extra curricular activities.

Currently, our meal program will continue into the first weeks of May. A specific cut off date will be provided at a later time.

Even though school is out, there will be distance learning required for us to participate in. This will begin Monday, April 6th. Our staff will begin the process of putting this area together. We will provide you further details of how this will work as quickly as possible.

Once again, we don’t have all the answers but as we learn more we will inform you. It is one step at a time. Continue to be safe and work together.

We will provide further information concerning upcoming academic requirements and other areas as the overall plan is organized.

Although we are in interesting times in education it has been a privilege to watch staff, board members, community members, and businesses come together and continue to meet the challenges we face each day. First and foremost, the well-being of our students is our #1 priority. Today, while handing out meals at Haworth, Goodwater, and Tom many children received food because of the willingness of a caring group of people to serve. It can’t be done alone and for those who have served I say “thank you!” Keep it up!

As for school itself, there are many questions that do not have answers yet as we continue to work with the Oklahoma State State Department of Education. As we receive answers we will pass them on to you as quickly as possible. Our goal is to do what is right and serve our students as well as possible as we are allowed.

Today we discovered a threatening message inside of our high school that caused us to evacuate the school. Although we are uncertain if it was a legitimate threat, we always hold the safety of our students and staff at the highest importance. After being notified we cleared the school and ran our buses as soon as possible. It was done in a quality manner. After the buildings were cleared with an outstanding effort from our staff, the Sheriff Department entered the facilities and performed a manual sweep of the area. Nothing was discovered. However, evidence was taken and information will be evaluated. As always, if information is received that we discover who is responsible, the highest level of action will be taken. School is a place for learning and we want to keep Haworth at the highest level possible. I hope you will continue to do your part in supporting our school as we continue to raise our standards. Thank you for your support and dedication to Haworth Public School.

It's that time of year!!! We are in need of your help in adopting Angels(students) for Christmas! Our Angels’ cards are at the Haworth Country Store and Kates Quick Stop, ready to be Adopted for Christmas; we really appreciate these businesses help! Our Haworth Community is the BEST and always pulls through in helping Adopt our Angels in need, and we have many that are in need this year. Please go and find the Angels that you would be willing to Adopt this Christmas season. Those that Adopt these Angels are Angels themselves. We have the Angels up early for those that want to take advantage of early Christmas 🎄 sales. Please write your name and contact number next to the Angel’s card number on the adoption check-out sheets by the registers. Ask for help if you don’t know the adoption process. Thank-you in advance for being a blessing to these students and their families!!! Happy Thanksgiving and MERRY CHRISTMAS 🎄🎁 😇",3.0,"Haworth Secondary is feeling blessed.

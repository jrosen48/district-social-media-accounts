Haworth Graduation Ceremony Update

The current weather forecast is predicting weather that will hinder our outdoor graduation plans. Therefore, we will be postponing our ceremony until June 6th-2:00 PM.
If the State’s Phase 3 plans are in place and we are allowed to have an indoor graduation we will do so in the auditorium. If guidelines will not allow us to do so, and we cannot meet in a large indoor group setting, we will change the graduation to outside and hold the same ceremony that would be held inside. We will provide that information as soon as possible.
We know this is not an ideal situation; however, we are dealing with unprecedented times and providing our seniors with a safe ceremony to recognize them for their years of hard work. More information will be provided soon as we work through this situation. Thank you for your patience.

First and foremost, the well-being of our students is our #1 priority. Today, while handing out meals at Haworth, Goodwater, and Tom many children received food because of the willingness of a caring group of people to serve. It can’t be done alone and for those who have served I say “thank you!” Keep it up!

As for school itself, there are many questions that do not have answers yet as we continue to work with the Oklahoma State State Department of Education.

I would like to thank everyone who came out tonight to support our students at the pancake supper and bond meeting! Money raised tonight from the pancake supper will help pay for end of the year expenses for our Elementary students. I hope everyone enjoyed their ""breakfast for supper"" and learned some good information about the upcoming school bond election.
Thank you to all the staff for your help tonight. Also, a big thank you to all of our donors for our pancake supper. Dollar General, Pruett's Food, Farmers Brothers Coffee, Mike Farley and the Haworth Country Store.

Today we discovered a threatening message inside of our high school that caused us to evacuate the school. Although we are uncertain if it was a legitimate threat, we always hold the safety of our students and staff at the highest importance. After being notified we cleared the school and ran our buses as soon as possible. It was done in a quality manner. After the buildings were cleared with an outstanding effort from our staff, the Sheriff Department entered the facilities and performed a manual sweep of the area. Nothing was discovered. However, evidence was taken and information will be evaluated. As always, if information is received that we discover who is responsible, the highest level of action will be taken. School is a place for learning and we want to keep Haworth at the highest level possible. I hope you will continue to do your part in supporting our school as we continue to raise our standards.

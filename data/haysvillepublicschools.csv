Booby Trap by Ed Monk set in the near future. An American soldier sits in a combat zone, trapped by a landmine. As he waits to see what will happen to him, scenes from his past, present, and future unfold around him.

Mockingbird is adapted by Julie Jensen from the National Book Award-winning novel by Kathryn Erskine. It centers around Caitlin, an 11-year-old girl who is autistic. She has always relied on her older brother to help make sense of the world. When Devon is killed in a school shooting, she and her father must come to terms with their life alone and together. With the help of those around her, she learns how to get close to other people in spite of the “messiness” of emotions. We experience this play from Caitlin’s point of view.

Michelle Kha was a finalist for the Lifelong Learning Scholars award and won a $7,500 scholarship. Amanda Phanivong was the one of two students to receive the $100,000 scholarship from the foundation.

The Lifelong Learning Scholarship is designed to do more than pay for four years of college tuition; it encourages a lifetime full of educational pursuits, far beyond a bachelor’s degree. The Timothy P. O’Shaughnessy Foundation became the fifth private scholarship program in the nation that provides $100,000 or more in education funding for students. While the other programs are open to students nationally or internationally, the Foundation’s “Lifelong Learning Scholarship” is open exclusively to Wichita-area high-school seniors.

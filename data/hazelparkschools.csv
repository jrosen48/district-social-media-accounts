Spot sharks, rays and other fishes as they cruise through our rocky reef.
Sevengill sharks, leopard sharks, spiny dogfish and the elusive Pacific angel shark all dwell in our Monterey Bay Habitats exhibit—like they do just beyond our walls in the cold waters of the bay. Designed with sharks in mind, this exhibit's 90-foot-long hourglass shape gives our big sharks plenty of room to glide and turn.
Watch carefully and you might see big skates and bat rays pass by the window, just like their shark kin. Plus, keep your eyes peeled for sturgeon coasting through the water, rockfish and giant sea bass relaxing by the reef, and flatfish nestling on the sandy seafloor.

This distribution occurs weekly on Thursdays from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. at Hazel Park High School (23400 Hughes Ave, Hazel Park , MI 48030) and runs through August!

It is first-come, first-serve and everyone is welcome to pick up the food. We will have 1,400 boxes of food for pick up. Large families can pick up multiple boxes and you are welcome to pick up boxes for seniors, people without cars, folks who are disabled or ill in any community, i.e., anyone really, just please don’t waste it.

Pick Up Procedures:
Please drive to the back of the school and enter at the second entrance on Felker Ave.
Please pull around to the sidewalk up to the first person available and open your trunk to be placed into your vehicle. Please do not get out of your vehicle.
Once you receive the box of produce you will exit out of the parking lot and turn right on Felker toward the tennis courts.",2020-06-18 08:07:33,,

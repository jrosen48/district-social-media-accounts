To reduce the strain on students, families and educators during the COVID-19 outbreak, California Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order today to waive, pending federal approval, this year’s statewide testing for California’s more than 6 million students in K-12 schools.

“I appreciate the Governor’s leadership here and recognizing that under the current circumstances, the last thing our students need is to be confronted with a test,” said State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond. “Our districts need some relief and this decision is in the best interest of our students and our state.”

We’ve heard a lot about social distancing lately, and you might have also heard the term “flattening the curve.” The two concepts are connected.

As explained in this brief video produced by OCDE’s Media Services, infectious disease experts say it helps to spread cases out over weeks or months so that health care systems can keep pace.

UPDATE: California public health officials announced late Wednesday night that large gatherings should be postponed or canceled across the state until at least the end of March.

Intended to slow the spread of #COVID-19, the updated policy from the state Department of Public Health says “non-essential” gatherings must be limited to no more than 250 people. Smaller events can proceed only if organizers can implement social distancing of 6 feet per person. Gatherings of individuals who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 should be limited to no more than 10 people while also following social distancing guidelines.

As affirmed this morning by the Orange County Health Care Agency, the guidance does not apply to regular school classes, workplaces or other essential services.

Transferencia Electrónica de Beneficios durante la Pandemia (P-EBT) por el COVID-19 | Salud y Servicios Humanos de Texas",8.0,"La Transferencia Electrónica de Beneficios por Pandemia (P-EBT, por sus siglas en inglés) es un beneficio de alimentos único para las familias que perdieron el acceso a comidas gratuitas o a precio reducido debido al cierre de las escuelas. A fin de mayo, las escuelas les enviarán instrucciones para realizar una solicitud a las familias elegibles para la P-EBT. La solicitud de la P-EBT estará disponible la primera semana de junio.

Los beneficios de alimentos de la P-EBT son para los niños que recibieron beneficios de alimentos del Programa Asistencial de Nutrición Suplementaria (SNAP, por sus siglas en inglés) para marzo de 2020 y para los niños que estén certificados para recibir comidas gratuitas o a precio reducido en Texas durante el año escolar 2019-20.

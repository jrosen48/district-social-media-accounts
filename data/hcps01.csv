Beginning with the 2020-2021 school year, students entering 12th grade will be required to have a booster (second) dose of meningococcal conjugate vaccine if they have not already received one.

An up-to-date immunization record indicating that your student has received the required immunization is due by the first day of attendance at school. If proof of immunization is not provided within 30 calendar days after school entry, your student will not be allowed to attend school until it is provided, as required by law.

Please contact your health care provider or local health department if your child needs this vaccine. For additional information about the vaccine, the disease it protects against, and other recommended vaccines your teen may need, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/by-age/years-13-18.html

Roanoke Electric Cooperative is pleased to announce they have an open hot spot for anyone needing a Wi-Fi Connection in the Aulander or Ahoskie area. This will be the first hot spot of many that we will be opening around our service territory. We will update our list of locations as the installations are complete.

The hot spot can be accessed by simply parking at our corporate headquarters office at 518 NC Hwy 561 W. Aulander, NC 27805 and logging on to your laptop and search for Wi-Fi connections. Our hot spot is labeled REMC Wireless demo and does not require a password. We know many students need access the internet for their assignments and we hope this will help students keep up with their classes while schools are temporarily closed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

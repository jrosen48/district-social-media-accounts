Both students did well in auditions...Izzy finished in the top third in a section of 24 students and Caden will move on to PMEA Western PA Region Orchestra as the top clarinet in the orchestra!! It‚Äôs the first time in more than 25+ years (maybe much longer?) that we‚Äôve had students participate in District Orchestra. Great job, Huskies!!!

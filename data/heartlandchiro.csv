✨Instead of asking WHY your kiddo should see a chiropractor, let’s address a more pressing question…✨
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
WHY NOT?
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
You get their eyes checked.👀
You get their ears checked.👂
You get their teeth checked.🦷
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Why on earth would you not check the most important system in their body? 🧠
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
A child’s brain and nervous system are rapidly developing in the first few years of life, therefore setting the stage for their future health. This rapid amount of change is why having your child’s nervous system checked as early as birth is crucial.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Your nervous system controls everything in your child like,
-digestive system💩 (colic, reflux, constipation)
-immune system ⚡️(ear infections, asthma, allergies)
-energy 😴(ADHD, sleep)
-focus 🙃(ADD)
-emotions 😫(anxiety, SPD)
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Life can throw a lot of stressors at our kids. Pediatric chiropractic adjustments are gentle, safe, and empower your child’s brain to better adapt to these inevitable challenges.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
You can’t bubble wrap them forever.

Are u suffering from chronic back pain? Could your wallet be the culprit?

Millions of guys drive or sit all day with their wallet in their back pocket, but they can't figure out why they moan whenever they get out of the car. But sitting on your wallet while you drive is a recipe for lower back pain and - if you do it often enough -- nerve pain that shoots down your leg. Riding with one cheek higher than other can trigger chronic pain in your back, hips, and shoulders. It can even set off foot cramps.

Sitting on your wallet throws off your alignment and compresses the sciatic nerve, which runs from each side of the spine down through the back of each thigh to the foot. A compressed sciatic nerve causes searing leg pain and numbness called sciatica.

But the fix is simple: Get that wallet out of your back pocket!",,,0.0,"ATTENTION: ALL Men!

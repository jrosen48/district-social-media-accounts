Henderson Summer Ball Update!

We haven't forgotten about our summer program. However just like everything else right now, we have to remain on hold until we get the ""safe to play.""

• Tball will still go on, just not during the normal season.
• Regular ball will look a little different but we as a league plan on getting a full season in once it's safe too.
• Adult Softball league will go on.

We can't give you exact dates but we can say we miss you and look forward to playing baseball/softball soon!

We encourage you to practice throwing, catching, hitting during the time you are at home with your families.

We will update as soon as we are able to.

Thank you and stay safe!

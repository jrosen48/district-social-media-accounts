Students who are taking concurrent classes, remember that CASC classes begin August 12, so even though high school classes are not in session until August 20, you must log in to your CASC classes and begin work to maintain your enrollment.

Enrollment is still open, so if you have qualifying test scores and GPA, and if you are on target with high school credits, you can still apply for concurrent enrollment. For incoming seniors who did not get to take the ACT, CASC is making exceptions by considering your GPA. Remember that students must pay the fees for each online class. Tuition is free for concurrent students, but fees run close to $300 per online class. Students with CDIB may qualify for assistance with fees. Contact the Choctaw Nation for details.

Good Morning Hebron Families,

Friday, May 1st is School Lunch Hero Day! Our Food Services Team have certainly been HEROES! They have been preparing, packaging and providing breakfast and lunch to over 800 children daily. Rain or shine, they have been keeping our children fed Sunday through Saturday.

I am hoping that many of our students will show their appreciation to our Lunch Heroes by sending a message to: eastconnfoodservice@eastconn.org Follow this link for some great ideas and templates. https://schoolnutrition.org/uploadedFiles/2_Meetings_and_Events/SLHD/LL01_SuperheroDay_all_3.11.pdf.

Please be sure to include your name and school on the messages sent and THANK YOU for letting these dedicated people know you are thinking of them on this special day.

Stay Well.

Best,

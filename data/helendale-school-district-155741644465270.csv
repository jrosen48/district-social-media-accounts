Due to Coronavirus (COVID-19), children who are eligible for free or reduced-price meals at school will get extra food benefits. These food benefits are called Pandemic EBT or P-EBT benefits. P-EBT benefits help families in California buy food when schools are closed because of the coronavirus emergency.

Families will get up to $365 per eligible child on their P-EBT card to use on food and groceries.

Families with children who get CalFresh, Medi-Cal or Foster Care benefits do not need to apply. Most will get their P-EBT card in the mail during the month of May. P-EBT cards will begin arriving around May 12, 2020.

Families with children who are eligible for free or reduced-price meals and who do not get their P-EBT card in the mail by about May 22, 2020 must apply online before June 30, 2020. The online application will be available beginning May 22, 2020 at ca.p-ebt.org.

With the decision that California HOSA will not be advancing any students to the ILC for 2020, the Board of Directors determined that chapters would receive information for their students if they were in the top 25% in a State Competitive Event (CE) test. Your students are listed below. Congratulations to your students as these scores are state wide.The actual test scores will not be provided in your chapter list.

After many conversations with many superintendents throughout Southern California and aligned with the National and State Emergencies that are now in place, the decision has been made to close Helendale Schools effective on Monday, March 16 due to the threat of the spread of the COVID-19 virus. There will be no Saturday School on March 14th. We will be closed until March 20th initially and will review the need for further closures by the end of next week.

We will continue to communicate with our Helendale Families through our Aeries Communication with updates. You can also check for updates on our website at www.helendalesd.com.

At this point in time the district will be closed through at least March 20th when it will be re-evaluated regarding the issue of the COVID-19 virus.

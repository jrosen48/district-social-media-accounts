This is how our heavenly Father is with us when we chose to go our own way, he never gives up hope and when we come to our senses, He is right there, filled with compassion and gathers us up in His loving arms.

Today was the Parable of the prodigal son, so many good lessons for us in this one. But the one thing that always gets me is how the father never gave up hope, verse 20 where it says, But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him, he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him. This is how our heavenly Father is with us when we chose to go our own way, he never gives up hope and when we come to our senses, He is right there, filled with compassion and gathers us up in His loving arms. Let us run to the waiting arms of our heavenly Father never to stray again!!",2015-02-15 01:12:39,,

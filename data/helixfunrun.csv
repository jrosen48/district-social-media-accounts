The big day is getting closer! We wanted to do a fun reminder on what the past two year's fun runs provided to our community. For those that don't already know, Helix had major flooding that did a great deal of damage to our town with a large portion of the damage destroying the park. The 2015 Fun Run raised money to purchase a swingset and the 2016 Fun Run added much needed park toys. Let's see how much we can raise in 2017 to keep the improvements coming! The nice thing about the run is you can see exactly where the money went at the Start and Finish line every year. Without all the support, these additions would not be possible. We sincerely thank you!",0.0,"Helix Heart of the Country Fun Run‎Helix Heart of the Country Fun Run 2017

We absolutely love our community pool, but unfortunately we do not have ANY shade which makes it very hard on those that want to spend time at the pool. This year's run proceeds will be helping us purchase much needed Shade Sails for our pool!

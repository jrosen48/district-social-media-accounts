This message is to inform you that HUSD has released its re-opening plan for the 2020-2021 school year. The document can be found on the district’s website at www.hemetusd.org. The document includes family survey results from the end of May and two options for students to receive instruction. Families can choose to enroll their children in traditional, on-campus, seat-based instruction, or a fully online instruction option. The document explains what families and students can expect with both options. In early July, all families will need to complete the revalidation process, and if you choose to enroll your child in the online instruction process you can fill out the application at that time.

As you may be aware, things change rapidly and we will, therefore, be sending two additional surveys before school starts in August. We understand that as orders are made or rescinded your decision to enroll your child in one of the options above may change and we want to make sure we are providing learning options that meet the needs of our families.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1412800242254694&id=389990687868993,,0.0,"Hello HUSD families,

In a short timeframe they were able to come together to create a user-friendly platform for our families that provides a wide range of meaningful resources for preschool through high school students, including support for English Learners and Special Education students. They also took the time to receive feedback from families as to their needs in terms of educational resources for their children and included them on the new website. They were mindful of the various situations our families may be in and included digital, television, and packet resources. They continue to add valuable resources and information for our families on the site, including social-emotional resources for our students and families. They continue to train and field questions from students, parents, and educators as HUSD moves from classroom to distance learning. Great job! #HUSDpremier",2020-04-17 15:00:54,,

Everyone meet Arnauld and Ariana Martinez. Arnauld and Ariana have been spending their time producing face shields for Doctors and medical staff throughout the valley. These two had a vision that the Principal and Vice Principal at Western Center Academy believed in, so their school loaned them a 3D printer, and Arnauld and Ariana made the magic happen. Keep up the great work.

This is Hemlock Huskie aka ""Hemmie"". He is sad. He misses all the kids, teachers and staff. It is quiet and lonely at the school.

It is ok to be sad sometimes. But just know that there are people around that care about you. Like the people at your school. If you need someone to talk to, reach out to a teacher, administrator or staff member. We are here for you.

Even though we are #hemlockstrong, everyone needs someone sometimes.",5.0,"Hemlock High School

We had a ""virtual staff meeting"" this morning with all HMS teachers! It was great to see each of them and hear each other's voices. We all miss being at school and seeing our students and each other. One topic of discussion was ""How are our students doing in terms of meeting learning expectations and preparing for the future when we return to school?"" The answers varied, but overall our kids are doing very well using online learning. Please remember--there is work to do on the part of both teachers and students to prepare for when we return--we need everyone engaged in learning to make this work. #hemlockteachersonthejobforkidsnomatterwhat #hemlockstudentsarecontinuingtolearn",0.0,"Hemlock Middle School

Middle school parents--you should be very proud of your kids today. As I met with them today by grade, they could have been grumbling, complaining, negative or simply delirious about having three weeks off. Instead, I talked to kids who were adaptable, who were ready to do whatever they could with this time off to extend their learning, who were positive and looking on the bright side, who were ready to accept this new challenge of complete virtual learning for a couple of weeks. We have great kids at Hemlock Middle School. And terrific teachers and staff as well. AND great parents who support their kids and our staff.

Last week, the Pride of 2020 MADE IT HAPPEN as the Pride achieved 100% acceptance to 4-year colleges or universities! This marks the second year that Henderson Collegiate has had a senior class, as well as the second year in which 100% of the Pride earned college acceptance.

We are so proud of the 2020, the Pride of Soul, for their commitment to the college application process, determination while confronting rejection, and enthusiasm during high stress times.

As we send another Pride off to the colleges of their choice, we know that we are sending out a group of young men and women who, like their 2019 counterparts, will surely achieve the HC mission – they will change the world.

We are proud of you, Pride of 2020! Keep making it happen!

At this time, we want to thank Henderson Collegiate’s leadership for looking into every detail, even at 5:00am, in order to make a decision that valued the safety of our students, families and staff. Because of their efforts, our families arrived to school safely, and are now in their classrooms learning.

We also want to thank our parents. We realize that our decision was different from those of some of the surrounding schools, and you understood that we did not take that decision lightly. We appreciate your trust and support in us by sending your students to school with us today.

Thank you for supporting the Pride!

Tomorrow morning, we will re-assess for safety by checking the weather and damage reports. Please be sure to check our school Facebook page, WRAL, and website as early as 5am tomorrow morning for any potential changes.

We are more than excited for Henderson Collegiate's first ever graduation for the Pride of 2019! Our staff and students have been working extremely hard for this day.

A few reminders are below:

1. All attendees must have a ticket to enter.
2. Doors will open at 4:45 P.M.
3. Doors will close promptly at 6 P.M. Please arrive before 5:30 P.M. to get a good seat!
4. In order to ensure that everyone has a good view of the stage, we are asking that parents/families hold off on bringing BALLOONS until AFTER the program.
5. Our event will be streamed live on Facebook for all to enjoy!

We are excited for this evening. As always, thanks for supporting the Pride!

Today, it was my pleasure to spend time with a group of parents that will set the bar for what parental support looks like. I’m grateful to them for their support, trust, commitment, and love. Without which, we would not be on the eve of such a historic night.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10162221010310647&id=245988000646,,0.0,"With our first graduation tomorrow, we often talk about 2019 setting the bar for other Prides.

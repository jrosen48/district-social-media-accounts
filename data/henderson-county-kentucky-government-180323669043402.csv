All of us at Henderson County Government are going to miss this great lady, Nancy Whitledge Watkins. She’s been our solid waste coordinator and recycling director since 2016 and has worked very hard at both assignments. She’s fun-loving, conscientious and multi-talented. She could write a state grant request at 9 a.m. and then be on a fork truck slinging cardboard bales at 10 a.m. She managed her team well and accomplished good things for this county. Sadly for us, Friday was her last day. She was offered a job at the US Postal Service that is a great opportunity for her, and she accepted. I know she’ll knock it out of the park in her new career. Good luck, Nancy!",0.0,"Bradley Schneider

Toured some storm-affected areas in the county this morning with Henderson Emergency Management Director Kenny Garrett. Graham Hill definitely had the highest concentration of damage to homes (see photos). Kenergy crews were there working feverishly to get power back on (as they are wherever there are still outages), but there are dozens of big trees down that took utility lines and poles with them. We saw wind damage all the way from Corydon up to Graham Hill, and I know there was more damage east of that in the Spottsville and Reed areas. From the folks we talked to, it seems insurance reps are out in full force helping their clients. County roads appeared to be clear, but comment on this if you still see blockages. Still no reports of serious injuries, thank goodness. We were impressed and inspired by the neighbors, friends and families who are out there helping each other clear debris and patch up homes.

Angela Buckman Comer organized the Henderson County Courthouse’s Ugly Christmas Sweater contest this year, and had me act as judge (imagine that). There was plenty of competition, but here are the top three: The UGLY sweater winner was County Clerk’s Office team member Amber Herdegen, at right. The UGLIER sweater champ was Jenny Crowder of the Sheriff’s Dept., at left. The UGLIEST sweater winner is County Clerk staffer Caren Gentry, center. Her prizes were an UGLIEST button to wear with pride and the use of my parking spot for two weeks. Congrats, Caren! #wehavefun #Budonesiesrock!",0.0,"Bradley Schneider

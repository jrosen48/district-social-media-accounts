The Henderson Varsity Lady Lions faced off against the Hudson Lady Hornets Tuesday night for the second time this season. In the previous game, Hudson eked out a 2-1 win. Last night’s match promised to be a nail biter, since Henderson and Hudson are the two top teams in the district. Those in attendance were treated to a game of high drama as each team traded goals on the night to tie in regulation play at two goals a piece. After regulation play, Henderson and Hudson equaled out again on penalty kicks. The game came down to sudden death round of penalty kicks, with Keeper Elise Schuster making critical saves helping Henderson get the WIN!

Goals scored:

•1 Gabby Bell, #14 (corner kick from Marin Love, #10)
•1 Marissa Aparicio, #8 (assist Marin Love, #10)

Penalty Kicks:

Spending hours at a desk won't help if your teen isn't really studying. To help her stop procrastinating and make the best use of her study time, have your teen ask herself these questions: What is one task I can do to get closer to my goal? (She'll learn that small steps make big projects easier.) How did I just waste time? (She'll learn her own pitfalls.) Can I do one more thing? (She'll learn that stretching herself pays off.)

Leap year's extra day is the perfect day to teach your teen to turn small bits of extra time into study opportunities. So if dinner will be in 10 minutes, have your teen spend the time reviewing Spanish vocabulary. If she's going out with friends, have her solve five math problems first. Such short sessions won't replace a longer study time, but your teen will probably find she's using her time more effectively.

Studies show that when parents monitor their teen's activities, the teens are less likely to take part in risky behavior. So, ask where your teen is going and with whom. Have her check in with you when she gets home from school. Get to know her friends and their families. Keep track of how your teen is doing in school. And let her know you expect her to tell you the truth about what she's doing.

If your teen breaks a rule, such as a curfew, try a ""community service"" technique to help her take responsibility for her actions. Add up the time her misbehavior cost the family. It might include hours spent worrying because she was late and time lost from a planned activity. Then have your teen spend the same amount of time doing ""family community service"": cleaning out a closet, caring for a sibling, running errands, etc.

Too many students never learn to see reading as something they can do for fun. To encourage your teen to read for pleasure, suggest he try reading a collection of short stories or poems. If he doesn't like one poem or story, he can move on to another. If he finds one he likes, suggest that he read other works by the same author. Your teen may also enjoy reading a biography of a writer whose works he likes.

I hope that this email finds you and your family safe and healthy. As you may or may not be aware of, Governor Cuomo provided guidance on the starting of interscholastic sports earlier this week. In the guidance, certain sports were allowed to begin on September 21.

Since then, concerns have been expressed to the New York State Public High School Athletic Association (NYSPHSAA) about starting on that date, due to the varying teaching models (hybrid or remote).

Throughout next week, meetings will be occurring with the NYSPHSAA. It is my hope that concrete plans will be provided to districts after these meetings. Until the plan is provided to districts, we cannot move forward with sports in the district.

I will continue to provide information as I receive it, and it will be posted on the district website.

Thank you, and have a nice weekend.

Held at the foot of the school’s front lawn, students were able to experience hearing their names announced as they walked across a stage to receive their diplomas, as “Pomp and Circumstance” was played. Each of the graduates was filmed and the footage will be compiled into a commemorative video for students and their families.

“These were two wonderful days for celebrating the accomplishments of our seniors and their families,” said Principal James Mackin, who posed for a photo with each graduate after they crossed the stage. “The entire school community has truly embraced the class of 2020 and have made this a memorable past few weeks. I am proud of each and every one of our seniors, and I only wish I could have hugged each of them, as I have traditionally done for the past 15 years. “",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=4734790759880164&id=108577962501490,,0.0,"Instead of the traditional commencement, with all graduates on stage and families and friends in the audience, the high school seniors took part in a “Walk the Walk” activity on June 19 and 20.

Thank you to the Hendrick Hudson school community for passing the 2020-21 School Budget and supporting our schools and our students. The budget passed by a vote of 2,274 to 1,169. Additionally, a proposition regarding new vehicle purchases passed by a vote of 2,155 to 1,281.

As a District, we are very appreciative of the tremendous support the results of this vote indicate, and we look forward to continuing to offer and expand educational programming and learning opportunities for our students. I want to thank everyone who took the time to participate in this important process in the midst of uncertain times.

I would also like to congratulate Cory Notrica and Alixandra Philbin, both of whom were elected to three-year terms as Board of Education trustees.

The New York State Assembly and Senate have introduced legislation designed to increase revenue to the Hendrick Hudson School District, specifically aimed at replacing tax revenue loss as Indian Point closes.

We are asking residents and staff to sign a digital petition as a signal of support and to urge lawmakers to approve this vitally important legislation for our school community.

Information on the legislation, and the petition, can be found here: http://chng.it/YDDWWWJJNs

This is a valuable opportunity for members of the Hendrick Hudson school community to weigh in on important policy shaping the financial future of our region.

Our community, the local taxpayers, need assurances that they will not be taxed out of their homes and that this legislation will create a guaranteed and reliable revenue stream to assist in the long-term financial planning of our school district and our local residents.

We wholeheartedly support this legislation.

Joseph Hochreiter, Superintendent",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=4573759519316623&id=108577962501490,"CHANGE.ORG

While you may have noticed the installation of a higher fence around the complex, we are in the process of installing cameras over the next month. Once the security cameras are in place and tested, the facility will be open to the public. We anticipate this to happen by April 4, 2020.

We appreciate the community’s patience as we ready this wonderful asset for public use. The district is taking great care to ensure that security measures are in place in order to protect this very significant capital investment.",2020-03-04 12:48:39,,

Each kit will include a sealable bag with three face coverings and flyers with information about the 2020 Census and COVID-19.

Dear Raider families,

First of all, let me thank you for your patience and understanding today. No parent, teacher or principal ever wants to go through an emergency situation like the one we had today, but I’m so proud to say our staff and students responded well and put into action what we have practiced.

Although the police investigation remains ongoing, we can say confidently, once again, that there was never an ‘active shooter’ on the premises. Still, we know our students may have concerns about school tomorrow [Tuesday], so we have arranged for an additional police presence as well as additional school counselors who will be on site tomorrow [Tuesday] to provide our school community with the necessary support.

Thank you for helping us keep safety as a number one priority, and we look forward to seeing everyone again on Tuesday.

Ms. Ferris, the teacher of the culinary arts program at Varina High school, was approached by her students over concerns they have regarding some of the police interactions they’ve seen in the news and she decided she wanted to do something to help educate the students. Ms. Ferris, with the help of the students, created a homemade lunch and asked officers to sit down and eat with them to discuss current issues and to break barriers by showing the students that Henrico Officers are real people just like them.

You complete demanding daily missions, despite a shortage of drivers.

You come to work every day, often completing extra routes and other work with a sense of urgency.

You make sure our children get to school safely and in good spirits, so they can learn.

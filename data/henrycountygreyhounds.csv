I am pleased to announce that starting tomorrow through the end of September, Henry County R-I has been approved to offer free breakfast and lunches to all children in our district through the age of 18. Once available, we will fill out required paperwork to try to get this extended through the end of the semester or when the funding runs out, whichever is sooner. If approved through the end of the semester, charges for meals will return to normal. If your child currently has a credit for meals, this will be held and then used once the program ends. If your child does not attend the district in person, and you would like to participate, contact Melissa Hall at (660) 647-3533 ext. 352. If you have any questions, please call me at (660) 647-3533.

Girls will need to be in gym clothes, tennis shoes, knee pads, and will need their own water bottles. (If they don’t have knee pads yet that is ok)

This mandatory meeting will be held at 5:45 for 5th grade parents and 7:15 for 6th grade. You MUST be present in order for your child to practice on Monday. Please make sure to have your health insurance provider/policy number for the meeting.

This plan is subject to change and will be in accordance with CDC and Henry County Health Department regulations. I know there is much concern over this situation.

Conference is next week-if you have been training please leave your time on the track-there is chalk there. I have asked the Smithton coach about “virtual times”, he said he would ask some kids.
The great part of this social distancing is you have to see what you have inside yourself and self motivation. Now is the time for experimenting-what is the best time to run? What is your best snack (my best snack is a cookie 🍪 or peanut butter on a banana 🍌-worst is McDonalds 🤮)or meal the night before? Do your sprint repeats - which is fastest: first, second, or third? Try a slow jog recovery and do another sprint.

Get out the door-you will never regret a run when your done! ✅

Proud of you guys!!

Attention H-Town:
We have decided to have a Senior Night Ceremony for the following FALL activities this Friday Night at 6:20 before our HOME Football Opener vs Okemah. Sr's and parents in Football, Softball, Band, Choir, Cheer, and Cross Country are asked to be at field by 6:05. Your students coach or director will help direct you to where to lineup. This will look at little different than the normal Sr Night. We want to be sure to give our Sr's and families an opportunity to be recognized and take pics sooner rather than later given the day to day uncertainty of activities. We will still plan another traditional ceremony for the last Home Game of season in November.

Be watching in the coming days for more info on GameDay and Facilities Procedures and Protocols for our Home Football games this Fall!!

Fishing Team Seniors!!
Quentin Story
Parents- Steve and Tammy Story

H.S.Activities- 3 band 4 years, basketball 4 years, fishing team 4 years, nhs 2 years

Future Plans- I plan on going to OSUIT and getting my basics in ecology and start fish college and pro bass fishing tournaments

Thoughts on Pandemic cutting Sr season short- ""This has really been a bad deal for me because I had made some great friends this year in fishing and in the general high school and it is killing me to know that I will never get to step on our new gym floor and play with the team one last time or wake up at 3 in the morning to see if my fishing partner and I are as good as we think we are. Or play the fight song with the band one last time. I have loved every minute of high school and no one can take away the memories my friends/family and I have made together. I know this is a weird situation for all of us but if there is one thing that I know about my fellow Henryetta high schoolers is that everyone will find a way to make the best of this.""

H-Town. We want to give you an update about our program and what we have accomplished, as well as, what is coming up in the coming weeks. Our scoreboard has been completed and looks unbelievable! Again, we thank our sponsors, First National Bank and American Exchange. We also want to thank the numerous alumni that also generously donated. We want to thank the crew of alumni that took down the old scoreboard, ranging from Fighting Hens to recently graduated Knights (Dirtbags). We also want to give a huge thank you to the HPS maintenance department that installed our new scoreboard. Lastly, we thank Pullium Electric for hooking it up and getting it game ready. The blessings we have received from our Henryetta community is not taken for granted, and we thank you.

Our season opens March 2, at Lincoln Christian, with our home opener the following day March 3, at 4:30. We hope to see you there and throughout the season. #HTownProud",0.0,"Henryetta Baseball

Coach Swallow is doing another order on the Henryetta Gear. Prices are not marked up and this is not a fundraiser; this is just an opportunity for you to get some gear to show your school spirit. You do not have to put a name or number on the items, but that option is available. The items run pretty true to size, except for the sweats; they run a little large. Coach Swallow will contact whoever orders when they come in for delivery.

I hope you had a great weekend!

This is a reminder to all students and parents to please continue doing work at this time. I know it is hectic and we all have different environments, but keep your heads up. Ask your teachers questions! If you have any issues whether it be connectivity or anything please contact the school. The best way to get ahold of people is by using email.

Also, we know there is a lot going on. If you are having any issues at all reach out. We are here for you. Although our building is closed, our educators are not. We are working many hours to get you as much information as possible. Please contact anyone and we will assist.

Reminder food package request can be done on our website and our Facebook page from the post on April 3rd. It is the same link each week. Pickup is still Thursday from 3 to 5 pm.

Thank you all!

We miss you, we can't wait to see all of you. Until next time have a great day, hug your kids, tell them you love them!

We miss them here at school and will be excited to get them back, but until then, keep hugging them, telling them you love them, and providing structured activities to challenge and help them grow. (I am writing this after losing three straight games of UNO with my five year old...I think he is cheating.)

Reminder on Tuesday we have distribution of materials for distance education. Ask teachers times that they will be available to answer questions during the day. They are currently finding ways to make themselves available to their students. Distribution schedule is: 8 to 9 am A-G last names, 9 to 10 am H-Q last names and 10 to 11 am R-Z last names.

Also, we are doing another meal distribution on Thursday from 3 to 5 pm. Sign up is below.

Food Package Request Thursday 3/26/2020",7.0,"Good Morning and I hope you are enjoying your weekend. This week has been full of ups and downs, but there is nothing better than having added time with your kids! We miss them here at school and will be excited to get them back, but until then, keep hugging them, telling them you love them, and providing structured activities to challenge and help them grow. (I am writing this after losing three straight games of UNO with my five year old...I think he is cheating.)

Reminder on Tuesday we have distribution of materials for distance education. Ask teachers times that they will be available to answer questions during the day. They are currently finding ways to make themselves available to their students. Distribution schedule is: 8 to 9 am A-G last names, 9 to 10 am H-Q last names and 10 to 11 am R-Z last names.

Also, we are doing another meal distribution on Thursday from 3 to 5 pm. Sign up is below.

We are currently working on plans for if this closure ends up being very long term. Those plans include how to get supplemental education materials for our students, how to provide the potential for sack lunches, and how to ensure that the integrity of our education stays intact. The Department of Health and Department of Education will be holding conference calls this week with superintendents to help them make decisions. Please be patient as we make decisions for the positive impact of all of our students.

This is new for all of us and we must come together in this process. I plan on sending a school reach tomorrow afternoon with more information. If you see a missed call from the school, it will be a school reach call with more information.

Stay safe, hug your children, spend time with them during this time!

Have a great week and I will update you when I receive more direction from our government officials.

The Snyder Police Department has their first official recruitment video!

We would like to give a huge thank you to the Hermleigh ISD Audio/Video Editing Class, who dedicated their time for this project and did an outstanding job!

We told them we wanted to capture the type of department we have become and the importance on positive community involvement as well and they knocked it out of the park!

We will continue to recruit and hire exceptional police officers who support our community, have the dedication for public service, do their job without discrimination, and have the moral character that our community demands and deserves.

This video is another tool to assist us in recruiting some of the best officers for our community!

This year we are doing Red Ribbon Week a little different. Instead of dress up days, we are focusing on positively noticing others and being kind in order to give people reasons to stay drug free. Those who feel noticed and accepted are less likely to do drugs. Each day we will have drawings and activities to go along with the day's theme.

Name Tag Monday
Everyone has a name, why not learn it? Wear a name tag all day and discover names of the many faces you see daily. Be sure to greet everyone by their name!

T-Shirt Tuesday
Wear your favorite t-shirt! Learn why others chose their shirt and find out who might share your same interests!

Guess Who Wednesday
Focus on what others might need - a simple smile, hug or kind word can go a long way. Leave a random note of encouragement in someone's locker or cubby.

Halloween
Say BOO to drugs! Dress in your costume, but don't let drugs make you scary!

Feel Good Friday
Everyone likes to hear nice compliments, so practice treating others the way you want to be treated!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1232502860278814&id=181888518673592,,0.0,"Red Ribbon Week - Oct. 28th-Nov. 1

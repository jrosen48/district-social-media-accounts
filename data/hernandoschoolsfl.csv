Shout out to all the Summer Crews that worked SO hard to get Westside looking beautiful and ready for our students and staff to return to campus😁

The exterior of our building was painted and new ramps/stairs were built for the portables. Every classroom, the office, the computer lab, and our Tiger Den got new carpet, and the back hallway has brand new tile!

Thank you to our hardworking EST team for cleaning and sanitizing our building all summer. We appreciate all the heavy lifting, moving, and setting up classroom furniture during our carpet install, and building and setting up our new Tiger Den furniture!

Thank you to the Hernando County painting crew, who did an amazing job on our hallways and doors! We are excited to have fresh paint all over campus!

Thank you to our AMAZING front office staff for putting in extra hours making phone calls and getting our Tiger families ready for the coming school year!

Our evening class schedule worked well with his day job and the cost of the program was relatively inexpensive compared to some welding schools. Affordability is a huge motivator!

Steven says he achieved all this learning goals throughout the course - and that his instructor was very knowledgeable. The small cohort classes really helped build a great experience, and having employers come to class to visit really opened up the opportunities available in the field.

Everyone meet former SunTech HVAC Graduate Jake Adlao of Kold Pro Air Conditioning & Refrigeration.

Jake has a Bachelors in Accountanting and worked in the bank for almost a decade in the Philippines. Coming to America in 2006, Jake had his share of challenges. He tried odd jobs from working as a dishwasher, janitor, factory worker (He assembled those 3D Glasses), sales associate, cafeteria assistant, Physical therapy aide and HVAC technician.

So why make the jump from Accounting to HVAC contractor you may ask. This is what he had to say...

“I realized after working for someone in HVAC, that this is something that I can do. This is a well-compensated industry, that you can literally practice anywhere in the United States. And who does not need AC in Florida, right?
Making a career change is not easy but it is not impossible.”

Everyone meet Robbie👋🏽

He is entering his last session of SunTech’s Cosmetology program. These are just a few words he has to say about our technical center and the program 🤗

“There were a few factors I considered with choosing to attend this program while being a mid-twenty college student. Those reasons were scheduling, tuition, financial aid, and the overall atmosphere of the school...When I used to think of an education center, I envisioned classrooms with monotone educators and book assignments. That is not the case with these programs! The atmosphere of the Cosmetology program is incredible with taking on a salon setting, learning to multitask, and manage a salon with clients.”

We found ourselves moving quickly to reduce the potential health threat to our students and staff and the shift to online learning required quite an adjustment for our students, parents and our teachers. In a profession that is accustomed to a slow and steady approach to learning, we felt this year, our typical way of evaluating student gains may need further consideration. Working in close partnership with our teachers, we added a step to our normal calculation of final grades. Our goal was to ensure students were buffered against an extreme academic decline because of their 4th quarter grade. This graphic shows the basics of the calculation. Essentially, final grades will be determined using two different calculations. The student will be awarded the higher of the two. In most cases, the difference is small but we believe our students deserve the benefit of this consideration. Thank you, #HernandoSchools #HernandoStrong",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1324962714377153&id=299729913567110,,0.0,"To our parents and students, we all recognize that the 2019-2020 school year ended in a most unexpected way. We found ourselves moving quickly to reduce the potential health threat to our students and staff and the shift to online learning required quite an adjustment for our students, parents and our teachers. In a profession that is accustomed to a slow and steady approach to learning, we felt this year, our typical way of evaluating student gains may need further consideration. Working in close partnership with our teachers, we added a step to our normal calculation of final grades. Our goal was to ensure students were buffered against an extreme academic decline because of their 4th quarter grade. This graphic shows the basics of the calculation. Essentially, final grades will be determined using two different calculations. The student will be awarded the higher of the two. In most cases, the difference is small but we believe our students deserve the benefit of this consideration. Thank you, #HernandoSchools #HernandoStrong",2020-06-02 10:14:20,,

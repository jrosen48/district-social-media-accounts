For several weeks, 3rd and 4th grade PALS students have been working on a sustainability project. They chose common items that could be found around the school and are usually thrown away. They then worked in groups to brainstorm how they could upcycle those items into something new and useful. Students also created characters out of recyclable materials and wrote a quick story to put it all together. The final step was recording the story and characters for a fun, interactive presentation. Students worked VERY hard on this short production, and hope you enjoy the final result!",0.0,"Hornet Pride Moments from last Fri. with Ms. Hanrahan & Heyworth Leap

Ms. Quinton’s 1st grade class had fun wrapping up their animal adaptations unit! Each student researched a different animal, identified at least one adaptation, and explained how the adaptation helps their animal survive.
They typed up their adaptation reports in Google Drive. They learned how to highlight sentences and then changed the font, color, and size within their document. They also learned how to search images within kiddle.co and then copy and pasted their image into their document. Thank you Ms. Harris for helping co-teach these Tech lessons!

Our annual “Pennies for the Pantry” drive starts November 7!
Did you know that last year, Heyworth Elementary provided pies to 90 Heyworth residents and donated $500 to the Heyworth Food Pantry to help offset their holiday food basket costs? We were also able to donate $700 to the local Angel Tree Committee to offset their costs in providing a Christmas for kids in Heyworth who would otherwise not have one.

This school-wide service project is a lesson in giving back and Heyworth Elementary students are the best at giving back! As the holiday season approaches, let’s think about those in our community who are less fortunate and give back!

Please bring in loose change, or dollar bills starting November 7th - November 15. The classroom that raises the most money will win an ice cream sundae party! We will be making announcements throughout the week, letting you know the classroom standings.

Let the season of giving fill the halls of Heyworth Elementary School and good luck to all classrooms!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1664895466975158&id=351138398350878,,0.0,"Important note from the desk of Principal Matt Andrews📣

Dear HFAA Families,

With less than a month remaining, Oklahoma ranks 40th nationally for participation in the 2020 Census. For every uncounted resident, an estimated $17,000 in funding is lost each decade. For a family of four, that's a staggering loss of $68,000, much of it federal education funding that our kids so desperately rely on.

We want you to know how critical it is to be counted and we want to encourage you to participate in the 2020 Census if you haven't already!

As you may have heard, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Joy Hofmeister, announced yesterday that she will propose a Continuous Learning Plan to the State Board of Education on Wednesday for their approval. The plan to be presented is intended to complete the school year for Oklahoma students without reopening school buildings during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Dear HFAA Families,

Keeping our students healthy and fed during this unprecedented crisis is important.

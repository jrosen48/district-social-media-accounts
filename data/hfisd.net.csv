Superintendents are often asked to give interviews to local media. Often reports ask hypothetical questions about certain scenarios. Such was the case in the article here. The hypothetical scenario is based on possible strict social guidelines that schools could face during the start of the 2020-2021 school year. District administrators will monitor federal, state, and local requirements for opening schools throughout the summer. Once plans are developed to operate within the set legal guidelines, district officials will communicate these operating procedures through multiple mediums.
However, we don‚Äôt anticipate having specific procedures in place until late summer due to the fluid nature of COVID-19.

Southeast Texas schools planning for future with coronavirus in mind",10.0,"**Official Statement**

Superintendents are often asked to give interviews to local media. Often reports ask hypothetical questions about certain scenarios. Such was the case in the article here. The hypothetical scenario is based on possible strict social guidelines that schools could face during the start of the 2020-2021 school year. District administrators will monitor federal, state, and local requirements for opening schools throughout the summer. Once plans are developed to operate within the set legal guidelines, district officials will communicate these operating procedures through multiple mediums.
However, we don‚Äôt anticipate having specific procedures in place until late summer due to the fluid nature of COVID-19.

As always we appreciate your patience and support!

All drop off in Fannett will be at the Elementary School on Burrell-Wingate. Grades 7 through 12 will be at the High School during our rebuilding phase. Middle school parents may drop off at the Elementary, and students will be shuttled to the High School. Middle School parents may also drop off at the High School. We look forward to our start of school.

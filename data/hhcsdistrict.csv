We are in the middle of an exciting hiring process for our next Wayne High School Principal. As an essential part of our process, the three finalists will each be asked to give a personal presentation to parents and community members, followed by a structured question and answer time. At the end of the presentation and Q&A time, you will have a chance to give feedback for each candidate. The candidate forums are scheduled from 4:30 - 5:30 p.m. on March 10, 11, and 12, 2020 in the Wayne High School library. Each evening will feature a different finalist. We encourage you to attend all three nights.

The forums will be the final part of a long process for each candidate, who in addition to going through two interviews on separate dates, will have spent the entire day at Wayne interacting/interviewing with students and staff.

This will be a great opportunity to participate in the process of hiring the next principal at Wayne High School. We hope you can make it.

Go Warriors!

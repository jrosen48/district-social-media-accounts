https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otlblSjsYzs&feature=youtu.be

Aces students, parents, and community … now it’s YOUR TURN! It is time to band together and show us what you are all doing to stay strong. Each week we will be asking you to upload videos or pictures to show us all the different things you are doing to stay safe, healthy and positive during this time. At the end of the week, videos will be downloaded and edited into a weekly montage. The final product will then be posted to social media weekly. If you have any questions, please email Mr. Freese - freesej@hicksvilleschools.org

Below is a link for you all to share your own videos

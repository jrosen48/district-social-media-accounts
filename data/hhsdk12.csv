This is the special time of year when we honor our Hatters Heroes, and given the circumstances, it's going to look a little different:

NAME A HERO: Because there are heroes EVERYWHERE right now. You can honor an HH student, graduate, or teacher. You can also honor a healthcare provider, grocery store clerk, or first responder making a difference in our community.

BE A HERO: Your donation to honor your hero will support an HHEF fund providing WiFi services for HHSD children who lack internet access at home. Help us ensure all of our students, regardless of circumstance, can participate in remote learning!

New this year, you can also upload a special video for your hero. Learn more at www.hhef.org",0.0,"Hatboro-Horsham Educational Foundation

With spring just around the corner, the District is looking with anticipation toward the opening of the new Crooked Billet Elementary School in the fall of 2020. This state-of-art building will have the capacity to serve 600 of our students.

With this new school’s completion on the horizon, it is time to consider the possibility of closing Pennypack Elementary School, a beloved but aging building, and merging the attendance area with Crooked Billet Elementary School.

On February 25, 7 PM at Hatboro-Horsham High School, the Administration will hold a public hearing to present the rationale for closing Pennypack Elementary School at the end of the 2019/2020 school year. A period for public comment will be provided at the end of that meeting.

Novelist Terry Pratchet once wrote, “The thing about football - the important thing about football - is that it is not just about football.” At Hatboro-Horsham we know that behind every great game is a team of dedicated individuals.

Over the past five days, two Hatters players have been injured on the field – causing great concern and stress among fellow team members and coaches alike.

Recognizing that the health and wellbeing of the team must take precedent over cordial play, Hatboro-Horsham has cancelled its game against Germantown Academy for Friday, October 4. This was a non-league, non-PIAA game. While our players had been enthusiastic about playing against GA, they are still bearing the stress of witnessing two teammate injuries in the past 5 days. As a community, we believe our players need this time to heal.

We thank Hatters fans for their support and understanding and look forward to seeing them in the bleachers during a future game.

A little late on pride month. However, this month has been the most important pride month in recent years. It’s reinforced for us that our freedom is tied to everyone’s freedom. This month and EVERY month we stand in solidarity with Black Lives Matter. In the Stonewall riots, black and brown queer bodies were at the forefront in fighting for freedom of the LGBTQIA community. To recognize, name that, and power the voices of BIPOC people is our responsibility now and forever.

So happy pride to the most authentic pride we’ve had in a long time. Let’s fight for justice and liberation!

Last week, we had our Career and College Panel to open the mind of students to learn more information about careers they have interest in and to give them insight on college. The event was a success!!! We want to thank all the volunteers who came and participated on the panel.

Community partners, HaoPay Lee Violence Free Minnesota , Representative Hodan Hassan Minnesota State Representative for 62A, and Yee Kue MANYC Technology Solutions.

College students, Yamileth Carachure Flores, Arianna Antone-Ramirez, Houa Thao Daniela Fragale Augsburg University and Pasuaha Yang University of St. Thomas for being transparent on how it is navigating college as students of color and sharing tips to set up students for success.

To our sister school Hiawatha Collegiate High School , we appreciate you sending students over to share their perspectives on what it takes to be high school ready. #onehiawatha

Today's #ThankATutor comes from Hallie at Hiawatha Academies Morris Park:

""This is Pam's second year tutoring with Reading Partners. Pam is amazingly flexible and energetic with the two students she tutors, a fourth grader AND a second grader. Her two students have very different personalities and learning styles, and Pam adapts very well. Pam also stepped up recently to help her fourth grade student, who is more quiet, and learns best when there is trust and consistency. When this student's other tutor, a college student, left after last semester, Pam started working with this student twice a week. This is so incredibly helpful because this student and Pam have built a trusting relationship. Instead of being anxious around a new person and rebuilding trust, this student can focus on learning. Thank you so much for setting this student up for success, Pam!""

""I'm excited to be back. Obviously I believe in the importance of education and I'm glad it's continuing in some form. And I think we all need to unpause our lives as much as health advisories allow.

The way to keep teaching fresh is to continually try new approaches. This year is going to provide ample opportunity! So I'm looking forward to the challenge of teaching the same content in an entirely different way and learning strategies for doing that. (Of course, I have some trepidation about that, too.)

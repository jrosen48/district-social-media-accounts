Thanks to Mrs. Shacklett for taking care of this and doing a great job for all the wonderful Hico Elementary Teachers:

Next week is Teacher Appreciation Week!! What better time than now to celebrate the amazing job our teachers are doing for our kids! This year we have to get a little more creative than usual.

There are a few options as to how we can do that. There will be a tub marked for the elementary teachers in the Secondary Campus foyer. Feel free to label and drop off any items you have for your teacher and I will ensure that it gets to them (nothing perishable, please)! If you'd like to mail them something but don't have the address- put it in that box also with your name and where you need it to go and I'll make that happen for you!! Send them an email! Add a sweet note with work when you turn it in! Text a thank you via remind text! If you have any other ideas and you need assistance, please let me know and I'm happy to help 😉

Now is the time to show up for these special people and express how grateful we are!

We only had one bag of Pepperidge Farm labels turned in last week, and someone forgot to put their name on it. So we will keep going till the end of January. So gather those Pepperidge Farm labels and put them in a bag or envelope with your name on it so you can get credit for each label. The more labels the better chance you have of winning the drawing. There is a label on every package, it looks like this.

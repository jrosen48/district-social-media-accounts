He shared, ""Many say good weather and natural beauty are Hawai‘i’s greatest assets. But what makes us great are our people and culture. Our families, teachers and students must be committed to honoring our culture while developing our young to reach their full potential as productive citizens in a diverse community.

As a Farrington High School grad, I’m proud to see the excitement in students and teachers at our innovative schools as they work together to not only “learn to live” in our fast-changing world, but also become passionate to “live to learn.” I see it when I visit our schools. I know that we can make this happen in all of our schools.""

Diamond Head Tragedy Families In Need of Help organized by Whitney Mahoney

The tragedy that occurred over the past weekend impacted several of our families, two of whom lost everything. One family is the Patterson family, a family of 7; one is the Ricardi-King family, a family of 3.

The fire that razed their homes took with it all their belongings. They will need to replace everything; clothing, backpacks, laptops, food, and more.
At this point we would like to focus our energies on addressing their financial needs by providing our support through this fundraiser.

Both the Pattersons and the Ricardi-Kings have been active members of our school ohana. They would be the first in line to help a community member in need. This time they are the ones who need our support. We welcome your monetary donations, even if small, knowing full well that every little bit helps.

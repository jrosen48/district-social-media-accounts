My name is Brook Nervig from Roscoe, Texas. Where the wind blows and the plowboys grow! I will be a senior at Highland High School this upcoming year. I spent the last year serving as the Nolan County 4- H Club President, a Texas 4-H Livestock Ambassador and will also serve as the FFA Lone Wolf District Treasurer. I have been involved in showing steers, breeding beef heifers, market lambs and breeding sheep. While being the fourth generation in my family to do so, I have been showing market lambs for the last nine years keeping it my main focus. The lessons learned, memories made, and people met through this industry have influenced who I am today and I’m so grateful for the countless opportunities it has presented each year. I’m extremely excited for the chance to serve as a member of the NRS Show Team for my last year in the show ring!""",0.0,"Proud of Highland Senior Brook Nervig!

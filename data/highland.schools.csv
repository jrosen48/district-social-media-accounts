In preparation for the upcoming school year, the district will need to collect all Chromebooks that were loaned to families last spring. We have established a collection process for the smooth return of these devices. We ask that you please return the equipment to Highland High School between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 4 p.m., beginning Monday, August 31 through Thursday, September 3.

When you arrive at the high school, enter through the lower level entrance doors of the building (lower level parking lot). Facemasks are required.

It would be helpful to include your child’s name and student ID on the Chromebook(s), but not necessary, as each device was registered during the checkout process.

The Highland Board of Education held a special meeting on 8/3 to discuss the updated reopening plan for the 2020-21 school year. As with the initial draft plan, the first priority remains the health and safety of our students and staff.

The recommendations within the plan are based upon the best scientific and medical information available to us at this time. We ask that you carefully review the plan, which includes the district's facemask requirement and updated start dates for the school year. The board also adopted a newly revised 2020-2021 academic calendar. It is attached for your convenience and also available on our website at www.highlandschools.org.

As stated previously, we realize there is no one perfect solution that will meet the needs of every single person affiliated with the Highland Local School District. However, we remain hopeful that we can continue to work collectively on behalf of our school community.

In the early 1900s, Marie Curie discovered radium, a substance that soon became known for its ability to shrink cancerous tumors. It also glowed in the dark and was seen as miraculous. But for the women who used radium paint to make glow-in-the-dark watches, radium became their death sentence. World famous in the 1920s, the Radium Girls, as they came to be known, sued the company they worked for, fighting for women's rights, worker's rights and the acknowledgement that their lives - and deaths - were worth something.

The Highland High School Thespians will perform on the main stage of the Highland High School Auditorium.

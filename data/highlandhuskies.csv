Please note that the SEISC Board of Controls have decided to make things easier with gate money & it will now cost $5.00/person to attend baseball and softball games, this does also include students & senior citizens. This is SEISC Conference wide so these will be the prices at every SEISC BB/SB event.

All Highland event & staff passes that have been purchased for the 2019-2020 as well as lifetime passes, etc. from the school year will be honored.

Also please remember that there will be no concessions this season as well and you will be allowed to bring in your own drinks and snacks. If you are bringing coolers into the property those will be inspected as well.

Please cleanup after yourselves at the end of the evening as well.

Highland Students and Community,

I regret to inform you that after much careful consideration, we have decided to cancel our Prom activities. This decision was not made lightly. We have sought advice from other school administrators and public health officials. After discussing our options with others and referring to CDC recommendations we have decided that having Prom could not be done in a way that would adequately protect the health of our students. While I apologize for the inconvenience of delaying this announcement, I chose to wait in the hope that regulations might be lifted and students would be able to enjoy a traditional Prom. I empathize with your disappointment in having another significant event cancelled. The health and safety of our students is foremost in our thoughts and concerns.

Class of 2020

Plans after graduation:
I plan to attend Kirkwood Community College and take the Diagnostic Assistant Program. Then transfer to Mercy and St. Luke’s School of Radiologic Technology to pursue a career in Radiology.

Activities:
I have been a part of the Highland Shooting Sports team - trap shooting. I have also been a member of NHS (National Honor Society) at Highland.

Favorite Memory:
My favorite memory was my junior year, as it was a full year of school and memories.

Most Influential Staff Member:
Mr. Ball has been the most influential staff member I have worked with at Highland. He has helped me make the right educational decisions/choices on what classes to take that would benefit me the most. I am now one big step ahead on college classes, as well as being more prepared for college thanks to Mr. Ball. So, thank you Mr. Ball!

Class of 2020

Plans after graduation:
I plan to attend Mount Mercy University and study Nursing.

Activities:
While at Highland, I have been involved in: Basketball, Track, Volleyball, Softball, Choir, Band, recording the musicals, and NHS

Favorite Memory:
My favorite memory of attending Highland is when we had a Softball game and Zane Arnold was on the roof of the school and he fell through one of the skylights and landed right in front of Mrs. Schaffer. He scrambled for his glasses, got up, and ran. I still wish we would gotten this on video!

Most Influential Staff Member:
The most influential staff member that I have worked with is Mr. Ball. There were often times I would go into his office and not have a clue what I was doing, just in a bad mood, or couldn’t find the confidence to do something. He was always ready to help me in the best way he could.

Logan Shepard at Elite Sports challenged us to the We Got Spirit Challenge! I was challenged by Dan Ruth and the Ruth family! Principal O'Leary was also challenged by Clay Eaton.. and seeing as how we’re all huskies and #unitedwefight .. we collabed and did this fun challenge together with our little huskies!
I challenge Hannah and Dallas Petersen, Jacky and Jared Mills, and Tina Sweeting and Silas Garcia!
Should be fun to see everyone get into it!

Class of 2020

Plans after graduation:
Attend the University of Kansas and major in Computer Science.

Activities:
I have been involved in Baseball, basketball, track, and the National Honor Society.

Favorite Memory:
My senior basketball season will be something I will remember for the rest of my life. The entire season as a whole is my favorite memory.

Most Influential Staff Member:
Mr. Zywiec easily. I first met him as a staff member when I took Pre-Algebra in 7th grade. He instantly became one of my favorites. As the years went on, I grew more and more fond of him until our senior year, he became the basketball coach. As our head basketball coach, he showed me just how much he cares about each and every-one of us. I can always count on him if I need anything. Mr. Zywiec is not just a staff member, he is our friend, and has created a relationship that will last him forever.

A small but mighty group of Highland Staff and their hubbies helped put together 1100 Breakfasts and 1100 Lunches today for the kids that will be handed out this upcoming week. We cannot thank Rachel Cerny, Our Food Director for working so hard getting all the details ironed out; Our Fearless Leader Angela Hazelett, who will always step in when and where needed to get things done; Jenny McClanahan and Her husband Craig for always stepping up and helping when asked; Gina Trower and her husband Zach who is always willing to lend a hand; & Cindy Mize (taking the pic) who is always working hard to help Rachel do whatever it takes to make things happen. Thank You ALL for the hard work you did today.

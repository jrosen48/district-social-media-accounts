The district's Social-Emotional Learning Committee, with the support of Dr. Maurice Elias' doctoral students, worked all day on articulating the many things we're doing. Standardizing what we do to support kids' social, emotional, and psychological well-being and showing the common strategy thread from one school to the next is the best way to assure achievement of the skills we want them to acquire.

Bartle School has been discussing the importance of being kind. Every morning reminders about kindness and the students are taught that even the smallest act of kindness makes a huge difference. Here are two of our Bartle Dolphins who go above and beyond in the kindness department, and they were nominated by their teachers for the kindness they display in their classrooms.

Chloe Wirkerman is an exceptional student in her classroom. She goes above and beyond in the classroom socially and academically. She is continually looking for ways that she can help others and make them feel their best. She does small acts of kindness every day.

Mason Rohan has been extremely kind to his classmates and goes out of his way to encourage students when they are upset or are feeling alone. He often reaches out to his peers that he sees are alone and invites them to play with him.

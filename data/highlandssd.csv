Starts on Monday, June 8!

Free meals will be distributed ""grab-and-go"" style this summer at Natrona Community Park to all local youth. Meals will be distributed each weekday (Mon-Fri) at the park from 10:30-11:30 am.

No registration is required but please text, email or FB message us to let us know how many kids you'll need meals for this summer (this helps us order enough). Note: If you've already provided this information during the school lunch program, you do not need to message us again.

Adults or youth may pick up the meals - we'll be providing breakfast & lunch at the same time.

You may take meals for all of the youth in your family when you pick up.

We are doing the grab-and-go distribution due to ongoing health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. All volunteers will be wearing gloves and masks.

The program is scheduled to run from June 8 through July 24.

It’s #143Day, a day inspired by Mister Rogers who equated 1-4-3 with I (one) Love (four) You (three). It’s fitting that today the Tomorrow campaign, powered by @RemakeLearning, launches to share hopes for today’s young people.

Highlands Superintendent Dr. Monique Mawhinney hopes that everyone remains healthy and safe throughout this pandemic and that everyone achieves their goals.

Speaking to Highlands High School today was one of the most rewarding experiences to date. I did two assemblies back to back and I was so impressed with the school’s effort to make mental health a priority for their students. After my presentations, there was a line of kids waiting to connect with me, to thank me and to share their story with me. Some of these stories were heartbreaking, some were funny and some reminded me just how much work our society needs to do and why it is my responsibility to do the work I am doing. No child should feel unsafe, unwanted, unloved, hopeless, a mess or uncomfortable in their own skin. We have an obligation to make the world a more accepting place so that people feel safer to speak up and ask for help.

Oberg Event Welcomes Juniors From Highlands and Freeport Area High Schools
Oberg held an open house event last evening for local STEM-focused students (and their parents) seeking to learn more about Oberg's educational pre-apprentice program and future career opportunities available in manufacturing. Dr. Malobicky and Mr. Santucci of Highlands and Mr. Dempster of Freeport participated in a discussion about the promising future of advanced manufacturing in the region. A panel of current Oberg apprentices, Megan Huston and Lysle Reichenbaugh, was on hand to talk about their experience in the program with attending students after a tour of the Oberg facility. Freeport even demonstrated their current BotsIQ robot that they're fine-tuning for upcoming preliminary competitions.

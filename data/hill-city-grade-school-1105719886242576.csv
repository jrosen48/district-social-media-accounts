Mr. Granberry",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1626166484197911&id=1105719886242576,,0.0,"To all students, families, and friends of HCGS. I want to let you know that I am thinking about all of you as we navigate these rough waters ahead. As many of you are aware, Laura Kelly, the Governor of Kansas, held a press conference today along with Dr. Randy Watson, the Kansas Commissioner of Education, to inform the public that all schools in Kansas will be closed for the remainder of the school year. This is an unprecedented time in our state and nation.

School officials will be meeting tomorrow to discuss this situation and to provide you more information as we move forward.

Please take care of yourself and your family members.

Sincerely,
Mr. Granberry",2020-03-17 21:31:41,,

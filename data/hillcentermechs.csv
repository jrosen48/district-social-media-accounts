Emily Torres is a Class of 2020 graduate from the Hill Center Site. Emily is also the recipient of a $5,000 scholarship. Her future plans are to study hard and get good grades in order to get into the Radiology Program at Lanier Tech. Emily's favorite memory at MECHS was trivia night and decorating cookies and ornaments at the December family night. Emily says, ""The teachers in the peak room are very special to me, they encouraged me and motivated me when times were difficult. They even sent me a card in the mail when I started college. This simple action showed they cared for me and my future."" Emily also enjoyed the non-traditional learning environment at MECHS while having her own independence and making her own decisions. Emily says, ""I decided when I would go to school and how long I would be there. I set my own pace. I felt as I was taking control of my future."" Congratulations Emily!

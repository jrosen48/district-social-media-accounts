Kansas Statute requires that anyone who tests positive for influenza or who is being treated with antiviral medication for influenza be in home isolation for at least 5 days following onset of illness AND until fever free for 24 hours without the use of Tylenol, ibuprofen, or similar fever-reducing medications.

This also means that if you meet these criteria, you must be excluded from SCHOOL, WORK, and DAYCARE to prevent the spread of disease. This policy will be enforced at schools and daycares to limit illness transmission to others!!!",2020-01-09 11:55:54,,

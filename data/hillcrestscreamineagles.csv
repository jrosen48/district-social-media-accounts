Dear Mr. Story:

The submissions for the 2020 Congressional Art Competition are rolling in! I know the COVID-19 social distancing has placed many obstacles in this year’s competition but I hope you will make every effort to submit your students’ artwork by the May 20th deadline. We understand there will be a much lower number of entries this year, but that increases your students’ chances of winning!

Please make sure you name each individual artwork attachment in this order: Title of artwork, student full name, school, grade, teacher, medium category.

The congressman and all his staff look forward to seeing the creative artwork from your students!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2896518417135278&id=255926371194509,,0.0,"IMPORTANT REMINDER! PLEASE SHARE AND REVIEW OUR PREVIOUS POSTINGS ON THIS TOPIC.

I would like to take this time to congratulate all of our seniors graduating from Hillcrest Class of 2020. What an amazing group of students we have in this year’s senior class. I am so proud of each of your accomplishments. I know this is not how we “drew up” the final few weeks of your senior year. However, even if there is no traditional ceremony tomorrow, that does not diminish how we feel about you.

I have never been one to utilize social media, however, I couldn’t think of a more fitting time to start. This is my “first” post, or whatever it is called. I could not think of a more worthy cause to post on social media about. I have watched almost all of you start school, and now finish school. I feel so honored to be a small part of your lives for the past 13 plus years.

May God bless the paths each of you choose. We will always be here for you when you need us.",2.0,"A post from Superintendent Greg Crabtree, to the Hillcrest Class of 2020

Hillcrest 5th and 6th graders,

Good morning guys and gals!! I spoke with all the teachers and Mr. Rose yesterday afternoon, and it is SO evident you are loved and missed like crazy. I am praying that you are all well, giving your best effort in your AMI work, minding your parents, and finding time for some fun as well. Below I have posted an assignment on www.noredink.com that is OPTIONAL and FOR PRACTICE ONLY. I chose this not only for you to practice the specific grammar skill, but also for the cool nonfiction article. I hope if you attempt this, you enjoy the article as much as I did.
Parents, if you need user names and passwords, please message me for those and any other questions or concerns where I may be of assistance.
Students, I miss you more than you will ever know and I'm praying that we will get to see one another soon. Be good, do good. :)

Love,
Mrs. Deanna

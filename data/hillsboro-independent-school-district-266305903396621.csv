Sorry for the miscommunication and not being clear the first time!

A little bit of housekeeping:

We are not allowing visitors on campuses.

We are not allowing food deliveries.

If you need to pick up your child for a doctor's appointment, please self-screen and ensure they have a doctor's note upon returning. If you are taking your child out for a reason other than a doctor's appointment, they cannot return that day.

We are continuously cleaning and sanitizing all high traffic areas. We aren't using water fountains - but have refill stations for clear water fountains. Sanitation stations have been placed throughout buildings. We are social distancing where possible. Masks or face shields are required for kindergarten through 12th grade and all staff.

These are all to help slow the spread of all illnesses. These are not set in stone for the entire school year. These will be evaluated regularly.

Letters have been mailed out, but we wanted to let our 8th grade parents know that Pre-Enrollment/Planning Conferences will be taking place at Hillsboro High School, on Wednesday May 20th from 1-5. Each 8th grade student will have a 15 minute appointment with an advisor to discuss the student‚Äôs plan for the four years in high school, and what he/she plans to do for at least two years after high school graduation. Every student and parent/guardian must meet with an advisor to develop a personal graduation plan.

We will be taking all social distancing precautions to make sure that everyone is spread out and safe during this process.

I am very proud of my 8th grade reading students for the time they invested in their writing assignment this past week. They filled in a 5 slide Google doc about quotes. They picked a quote that means something to them. They stated the author, why the quote was significant and important to their life, and illustrated how it is exhibited through choosing symbols and pictures as representations. I was inspired and enlightened by what some of them chose. It was one more instance where I felt like their authentic work showed me another piece of who they are. I pasted about 20 of their chosen quotes onto a doc to share with you all.

We will have materials pick-up from 7:30 to 9:30 AM (Friday) here in front of FES -- Chick-fil-A style. Just have your normal pick-up tag in your window. I will call it in on the walkie, and your child's materials bag will be brought to your car. If your child is a bus rider, don't worry. Just roll your window down, give me the info I need, and I will call it in that way. If you can't come during those times, please let your teacher know so that we can work something out. It is very important that you pick these materials up as they are an essential part of the distance learning plan we have designed for your child.

This event has over 20,000 participants through their weekend races. 6th grade volunteered at the 5k water station on Saturday. 8th Graders put in some serious work at the fluid station for mile 30 of the Ultra & Mile 25 of the Marathon on Sunday. Arriving at 7am for set-up and steadily giving water to runners from 9am-2pm. Being the last water station after hours of running, our kids gave out well over 3,000 cups. I have been on both ends of this event and I will tell you that I have gained a new appreciation for the volunteers. It was a great experience for them to be in a running environment, learn the value of service and bond with their teammates along the way. Proud Coach,

FCA starting the day and ending the week with a positive, encouraging word. Thank you Coach Hewitt for being our guest speaker today. Students share their amazing takeaway below.

Today, in FCA Coach Hewitt did a really good teaching over our spiritual bag. I know now that everything that you carry in your bag can affect the way people see in you and how you show yourself to people. Everything you carry in your spiritual bag may feel light but really it's holding you down. The most important thing that I took from this lesson was how Coach Hewitt lived. Its was basically like his testimony to how he gave his life to God. It was powerful.

Going to FCA in the morning inspires me everyday to look forward in life, to always lean towards God in whatever I do, because in the end he is always there.

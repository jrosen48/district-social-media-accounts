Even if you have lost track of your self-response invitation number that was mailed back in March, you can still go online and respond by simply entering in your physical address or by calling 1-844-330-2020.
Additionally, the Census will NOT share personal information with other divisions of the government: local, state, or federal and will NOT ask about income nor citizenship status.

Dear Hillsboro Parents,

With the district closure through the end of the school year, we wanted to provide general information regarding continued student learning and grading. Additional building specific procedural information will be forthcoming.

First and foremost, we want to emphasize that students will not be penalized for situations that are out of their control. While we strongly believe continued learning and engagement is important, we know learning has not looked the same in this atypical environment. We also want to stress that at home learning will continue through May 27th.

Please click the link for the full letter from Dr. Isaacson and Mrs. Hildebrand. - https://5il.co/fr38

Have a great weekend! 🙂

ATTN PARENTS: The following information is from De Soto Public Library. We were given permission to share it with our district! They are offering a FREE library ecard for people over the age of 13, but parents can sign up for our students! Please share with your students' families!

We know this is a difficult time for our community and for the world and we just want you to know that the library will eventually reopen.

When we do, we'll be better prepared to serve you than ever before with new computers, a new network, stronger and more protected Wi-Fi, a computer lab, and a clean library literally full of materials waiting to be checked out.

Thank you for doing your part to flatten the curve and make sure to utilize our online resources in the mean time. http://dspl.missouri.org/books-media/

Temporary eCards are available for free. Just fill out this form.

Here we are again! Another week, another storm. We are watching the weather closely. This afternoon, we participated in a conference call with the National Weather Service.

The current forecast is calling for a potential band of Ice/Sleet that could be up to a 1"" in the northern part of our district developing during the day. The current predicted onset time is 9 am, which is immediately after the busses drop off at the Primary.

As I have said before, calling school based on a forecast is always difficult. Especially in light of the past storms that we have had the last couple weeks.

This evening, we will continue to watch the weather. Our hope is that the forecast changes or the storm timelines change.

If the storm continues to track as anticipated a decision MAY be made this evening between 8-9 pm, to allow parents to plan for child care tomorrow.

Our focus will always be student, staff, and parent safety. We will keep you updated.

Due to the forecasted timing of this storm, it could make it extremely difficult and dangerous to get students and staff back home.

This morning (01-09-2020) the district was notified by law enforcement of an active domestic issue that involved threats against the children and the mother. The children were Hillsboro students. The district went into a lockdown (not letting anyone in or out) and diverted busses away from the buildings.

The individual who made the threat is now in the custody of law enforcement and we are resuming bus drop off and normal activities.

We apologize for the inconvenience and the resulting panic that we know all parents, staff, and the community has when events such as this occur.

The safety and security of our students and staff is our top priority.

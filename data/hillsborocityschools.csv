To honor our winter competitive teams, we are having a pep rally and spirit day this Wednesday, February 12th. That evening, our HHS Indians Basketball team will take on Blanchester, and our HHS Co-Ed Bowling Team will travel to Miami Trace.

This pep rally/spirit day will be a little different. We will be making it a class competition, from middle school through seniors. Classes will be awarded points for the most spirit dressed class and then for being the most spirited during the crowd chants at the pep rally.

The money used to purchase the Christmas gifts was made by the Tractor Raffle. Instead of having the annual FFA 5k, the chapter held a Tractor Raffle and earned a total of $1,118.

The Winter Sports Parents Meeting NOVEMBER 6TH is mandatory UNLESS you attended the meeting in the fall. HOWEVER, most coaches will hold their individual team meetings immediately before or after the overall parents meeting run by the Athletic Director. Check with the coaches to see when they plan on having their individual team meetings.

The times for the meetings are as followed:

6:00 p.m. Boys Basketball, Cheerleading, and Wrestling
8:00 p.m. Girls Basketball, Swimming, and Bowling

However, if you cannot make the time slot you are scheduled, you can attend the other time slot. For example, 8th grade boys basketball will not find out if they make the team until 6:30 on Wednesday, so it would make the most sense for those parents to attend the 8:00 time slot.

The meeting is for student and parent/guardian. Even if the student is 18, their parent/guardian needs to be here as well.
If you can't make it to the assigned meeting, make sure you come to the other one.

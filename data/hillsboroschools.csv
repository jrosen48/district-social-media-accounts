All HSD parents are asked to complete our 2020 Distance Learning Experience survey so we can better understand your experience with the distance learning model while physical schools have been closed.

The survey is voluntary, but your responses will be very valuable to us as we seek to enhance our distance learning processes and protocols in the event this model needs to continue into the future.

All survey data will be summarized so that each person who answers will remain anonymous. Nothing in the survey will be used to identify you.

In partnership with St. Vincent de Paul and The Salvation Army of Hillsboro, the City of Hillsboro launched its “Food 2 You” food pantry delivery program on Tuesday, April 7. The program accepts requests and delivers food two days each week to community members who are medically fragile or elderly – those for whom getting to a food pantry may be difficult or dangerous to their health. Requests are taken by phone at 503-681-5090 on Tuesdays and Wednesdays only, from noon to 4 p.m. Orders are filled and delivered the following day (Wednesdays and Thursdays). Community members also have the option to leave a voicemail message to request a callback to take their food request. Food is left at the door in order to maintain social distancing, but with perishable food items, the person must be there to receive the food. Due to high demand, dietary needs or special needs cannot be accommodated.

February 16 through 22 was National Engineers Week - a week-long celebration of all things engineering with an emphasis on bringing STEM skills to life for students. To commemorate the event, more than 160 Intel volunteers spent Thursday and Friday, Feb. 20 and 21, leading a fun, hands-on engineering activity with more than 1,500 fourth-graders across the District. The activity involved groups of students working with their adult mentor to build catapults that could launch a ping-pong ball into the air, allowing a team member to catch it like a “pop fly.” This is Intel’s third year collaborating with the District and Portland Metro STEM Partnership for National Engineers Week: www.pdxstem.org

February 16-22 is Engineers Week - a celebration of the important difference engineers make in our lives, and an invitation to provide every child an engineering experience.

Most students don’t know what engineering is, so Engineers Week is a great opportunity to tell them about the wide range of careers available in the engineering field, and to engage them in a fun, hands-on learning activity.

The School Board will open its work session on Tuesday, Feb. 11, for up to an hour of public comment on HSD’s proposed Student Investment Account (SIA) budget (http://bit.ly/HSDSIA) for the 2020-21 school year. SIA is the portion of money collected through the Student Success Act (SSA) that is coming directly to K-12 school districts through a non-competitive grant process. Feedback has been sought on priorities for SIA funds since the fall, and the draft budget has been crafted based on that input.

This week's social and emotional learning focus is on Relationship Skills, the ability to establish and maintain healthy and rewarding relationships with diverse individuals and groups. The ability to communicate clearly, listen well, cooperate with others, resist inappropriate social pressure, negotiate conflict constructively, and seek and offer help when needed.

Instead, Landric used that $100 to start his own charity where he would read books to preschoolers and give them their own copy of the book!

His dream has become a reality. He started Landric's Read and Share... And on January 22, he read and shared books with 240 preschoolers!

On Monday morning, February 10th at approximately 7:45 AM, a Crocker student was walking in the area of Chateau and Ralston when a man slowly approached him in his car. The man asked the student if he wanted a ride. The student said no. We were just made aware of this information today (2/12) and immediately called the Hillsborough Police Department (HPD) who came to Crocker Middle School to speak with the student and his parent.

Your child’s safety is of utmost importance to us. Parents are asked to remind their children about the importance of avoiding strangers and reporting any incident of contact by strangers to their teacher or principal.

As educators, we strongly encourage parents to talk to your children about stranger awareness. Please click on this link: http://archive.ncpc.org/topics/violent-crime-and-personal-safety/strangers.html for helpful talking points from the National Crime Prevention Council.

The Hillsborough Police Department is investigating a report of a suspicious person and vehicle near Crocker School that was reported today (02-12-2020). The incident occurred on 02-10-2020 between 7:45AM and 8:00AM. A student who was walking to school was approached by a gray or silver 4-Door newer sedan, and the driver asked the student if he needed a ride to school. The student refused the ride and the driver left without further incident. The student described the driver as a white male adult, approximately 60 years old, with gray and white hair, clean-shaven, and was wearing sunglasses. The driver was wearing a white shirt with buttons, a red tie, and dark colored slacks.

If you have any information that would assist us in identifying the suspicious person, or vehicle, please call our Communications Center at 650-375-7470.

Walk & Roll, Hillsborough!
Our first district-wide walk/bike to school day is coming up this Friday, Nov. 15. We are encouraging all HCSD students to walk or ride their bikes to and from school on Friday. We hope that this (and future monthly dates) will help raise awareness around safe routes to school, encourage healthy habits, reduce our carbon footprint, and foster a community that prioritizes our students getting to school safely!

Hillsborough Police Department has kindly offered to support this effort by monitoring school intersections and providing a bike meet-up area for North School participants at the Walnut Lot across the street from Town Hall starting around 8am.

Drivers: Please be extra vigilant on November 15th in the morning and afternoon as there will be more foot and bicycle traffic than usual.",0.0,"Walk & Roll, Hillsborough!

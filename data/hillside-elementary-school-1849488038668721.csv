Meal program changes!

Thank you for your patience on our first day of meal delivery! We did have some small issues that we are working diligently to overcome.

Due to the overwhelming response, we are making a change in the survey process. If you have signed up for meals this week, you will remain in the program and receive meals until we return to school. You do NOT need to fill the survey out more than once.

Since meals and checklists are separated by bus and stop, please pick up the meals at the bus stop you indicated on the survey.

For those of you who have not signed up already and would like to start receiving meals please fill out the meal survey. We will work to add you to the prep and deliveries within 48 hours.

The free meals are available to all children under 18. Those over 18 are eligible as long as they are a student. For Sau 3 students that live in Milan, Dummer or Errol, please call Candy Richard, our Foods Director at 752-4122 x1510.",0.0,"Berlin Public Schools - SAU3

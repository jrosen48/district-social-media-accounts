Under the leadership of Principal Ms. April Lowe, Hillside Public Schools is proud to announce that A.P. Morris has been awarded a $198,255 State grant through the Preschool Education Expansion Aid. With this funding, the district will create a new Pre K3 Dual Language Immersion Program for the 2018-2019 school year.

Research affirms that the ability to speak and read in more than one language offers social, cultural, cognitive, and economic benefits. This new program will use a dual-language model, in which the Pre K3 children will receive instruction in English and Spanish.

Ms. Lowe and the AP Morris staff believe this new program will help the children increase their literacy skills and become proficient readers by the end of third grade.

The Arts are alive within the Hillside Schools! Actually, the Arts are growing at our schools. With the addition of new music staff this year we have seen an increase in opportunities for students.

Unfortunately, we have been unable to maintain Saybrook as a viable satellite school for the Arts. The programs offered at Saybrook for the past two years will continue to be offered at Hillside High School.

Saybrook School will be converted to offices and a Board of Education meeting room. The movement of offices will allow for increased classroom space at Hillside High School for the 2014-2015 school year.

We continually strive to improve both our facilities and academic programs to provide every student, every learning opportunity, every day.

The Hillside Schools are establishing this Facebook page to keep the public informed of what is happening in the Hillside Public Schools. Hillside is a diverse learning community of over 3,135 students in pre-kindergarten through grade 12. Our motto of providing every student, every learning opportunity, every day is practiced daily by a committed staff. In the coming months we hope to post upcoming school news, academic, sporting and social events to increase communications between school and home. We hope you find this page helpful and interesting.
Sincerely yours,
Dr. Frank Deo

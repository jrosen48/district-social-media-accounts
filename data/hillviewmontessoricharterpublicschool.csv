This morning I visited #Haverhill’s Hill View Montessori Charter Public School, 75 Foundation Ave. in Ward Hill. I met some great teachers and administrators and many, many great students. This is a K-8 tuition-free public school and most of the kids said they are looking forward to attending Haverhill High School, with a few saying they hope to attend Whittier Voc-Tech in Haverhill. One group of students is building picnic tables and they asked if they could donate one to the city. Another group told me about how they recently excelled at a model United Nations competition at Haverhill High. Great kids and a beautiful and spacious building...

* We chose the world and the person above it because it is our school logo, and Montessori education is global.
* The key is there because Maria Montessori said that children are the “key to education”.

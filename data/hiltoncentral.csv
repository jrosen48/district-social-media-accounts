Emma Doughty, a graduating senior at Hilton Central School District and a member of NYSED’s Youth Advisory Panel, has excelled in many endeavors, and her hard work has been recognized locally and nationally.

The Youth Advisory Panel is one of NYSED’s primary stakeholder groups. It is composed of students with disabilities who are appointed by the Assistant Commissioner of Special Education to advise NYSED from a first-hand perspective on ways to improve the quality of special education services and student outcomes. Emma’s work with the Youth Advisory Panel figured prominently in her college entrance and scholarship essay, which resulted in multiple scholarships and awards.

Emma’s efforts have stretched outside the classroom as she has taken her focus and skill into her job as a lifeguard. Her influence continues into the community-at-large, where she has presented to large groups of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students about her personal experiences being deaf and the importance of inclusion.

Jason is a member of the class of 2020!

Jason owes his happiest moments of high school to the theatre program! He has participated in the musicals all four years of high school, but got his first chance to be on the HS stage when he was only in fourth grade and played “Village Boy” in Beauty and the Beast. Jason reports that ""Some of my favorite memories include: dancing as “sisters” in White Christmas with Noah Martella, singing “Her Voice” to Taylor Tydings in The Little Mermaid, and jamming to “Dancing Queen” with Marianna Ban in Mamma Mia! I have had the greatest counterparts and I’ve also been so lucky to share the stage with incredible ensembles and cast members. I’d like to thank all of my stage family, especially those listed above, the many directors and choreographers, and all of those behind the scenes that have helped us put on such great shows!""

Jason will be attending SUNY Brockport this fall where he will be studying Criminal Justice and Forensics.

Be sure to watch Jason perform ""Her Voice."" The video recording is posted in the comments.

Kloee is a member of the Class of 2020!

As a performer, she wants to inspire someone in the audience to pursue theatre. Kloee's favorite theatre memory is playing the role of Queen Elsa in Disney's The Little Mermaid. Elsa and the other Disney princesses competed for Prince Eric. Providing a silly joke and a way for the children to see all their favorite characters. Knowing many children would be excited to meet their favorite characters, Kloee wanted their experience to be as authentic as she could make it. Kloee learned how to autograph programs as Elsa. She loved the idea of one of these children going to Disney and meeting Elsa and receiving the same signature. Kloee felt this would keep the magic of Disney alive in the children's eyes.

Kloee will be attending SUNY Oswego this fall, majoring in film and business. She plans on starting her career with event and wedding filming/photography and perhaps making short films on the side. After writing her first screenplay and creating her first short film, Coping, Kloee knew this was passion that she wanted to pursue.

Marianna is a member of the class of 2020.

Just one favorite musical moment from this year’s Mamma Mia! Is probably the hardest question you could ask a girl who loved and lived for every moment of it. But when forced to pick just one moment, Marianna reports that singing “Winner Takes it All” was her favorite memory. Marianna found beauty in portraying both Donna's heartbreak and her strength. Marianna stated that "". . . having Jason as a scene partner was everything because the way we played off of each other was absolute magic that I would kill to have again!!""

Next year, Marianna will be studying Musical Theatre at Pace University in her favorite place in the whole wide world, New York City!

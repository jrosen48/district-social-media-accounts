Our National Art Honor Society students just finished a large mural painting project for the mayor of Darien, Mr. Joe Marchese. He requested a mural design for the foyer halls of the Darien City Hall building that displayed images relating to the 50th Anniversary of the town. 24 students spent many hours outside of school and they have finally added the finishing touches after working on the project for 5 months. Their hard work and commitment to this project were truly remarkable and we are so proud of them. The mayor has invited the community to celebrate the completion, with a coffee and dessert reception prior to the Town Hall meeting on Monday, March 16th at 6:00pm. He will honor each of the artists and present them a letter of commemoration. Thank you to art teacher Ms. Jen Belmonte for making this happen!",0.0,"Hinsdale South High School

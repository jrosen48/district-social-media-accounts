A little update for tomorrow’s market! Market on the Square
🎃🤎🍁🧡🍂🤎🎃🤍🍂🧡🍁🤎🎃

Super excited about this new little bunch of hand painted pumpkin pillows. (Orange pillow is sold) I still have a couple left from last weekend too! These sell fast! I’ll also have more country prim ghosts, candy corns, black cats & more! 👻 And those livestock tea towels with pumpkins....oh my!😍

New items are coming each week as we get them made. Everything is made by hand so you’ll never have 2 items alike. Once they sell, that’s it! So stop by to see what we will have tomorrow! Too much to list! But if you love old things & repurposed items...come check out what we’ve got from old windmill parts! 🙂

Of course I still have plenty of soaps & lotions in yummy fall scents! And rustic candles! I haven’t re-stocked what I’m out of but there are currently new ones curing as we speak that will be available in the next few weeks!

See y’all tomorrow from 7-11! 🧡",0.0,"Oh my gourd!🎃🍁🍂 We love our Fall!🍂🍁👩‍🌾👨‍🌾🚲Visit Delhi at the Market on the Square this Saturday morning! Never to early to celebrate the holidays!💃🍂🏈🛍#MOSQUARE #mosruralmarketpc

Energy
Karma
Sunny Herb Garden

🎃🤎Shop update post for today! 🤎🎃
We’ve got some super cool woodworking projects that are available. My sister in law Katelyn Valentine made some pumpkins and these beautiful barn quilt style wall decor pieces! She will also have some rustic metal pumpkins with stakes that are super fun for outdoor fall decorating!

And...since it’s almost time for those yummy fall soups...we’ve got some fun new bowl cozies, pot handle hot pads and more 8”x8” hot pads!

I still have some more stuff to post before Saturday for Market on the Square...but I can’t share everything so be sure to come see us! 😉

I can ship anything I post. And if you are local and want to reserve something, you can pay now and pick-up Saturday.

I’ll go ahead and post these tonight too.
✨✨✨NEW ITEM! Boomerang bandanas. ✨✨✨
Available this Saturday (Market on the Square) in baby and children’s sizes. These are designed with cooler weather in mind. Don’t mess with a long dreaded scarf that doesn’t stay in place. Just snap these in the back and go. Super simple! Tuck them inside their coats to keep the wind out and their body heat in. You can even use these as a heavy duty bib for the babies. Lined with super soft velvet/minky dot fabrics so they are very comfy without being too bulky. I’ll have select colors available this weekend but will be adding more to the shop as we get closer to fall and those cooler temps! 😍

(The only thing missing from these pictures was her horse she says....)

Today’s farm shop update post. Sorry it’s nothing pretty tonight! ❤️
These masks are reversible with various coordinating fabrics on the other side. Some fabrics were limited so I have done a fun mix and match design for the main side. Soft elastic so it doesn’t get scratchy on your ears. Kids & adult sizes. No custom orders at this time. First come first serve. You can purchase now through PayPal and I can hold until Saturday for local folks to pick up at Market on the Square or if you aren’t local, you can purchase (with shipping) and I can send out ASAP. No guarantees on fabric designs so if you see something you like...don’t wait. You might have to zoom in on the photo to see the design but please ask if you have any questions!

Thinking about today being the last day of July - my heart flutters just a little. I’m a girl who loves all things fall. We are that much closer to my favorite season! 🧡🖤🎃🍁🌻🖤🧡

Since August is officially here tomorrow, I will be at Market on the Square with a few more new back to school items... & all my other usual goodies as well. Hit me up if you’re in town from 7-11!

Saturday August 8th I will be joining some other vendors at the Lucerne fair so I won’t be in Unionville that weekend. We might be taking off a week or two to catch up on all our fall stuff and will launch all those goodies when our pile is big enough. 😉 I’ll keep weekly updates posted though. I am still doing custom orders and remember...it’s not too early to start thinking about Christmas shopping! See y’all tomorrow! And enjoy this beautiful 78° afternoon! 😍 I know me and the critters (my children included) are! 🤗",0.0,"Come by the Market and visit Delhi!

Week #12 of Market on the Square, summer is flying by!

🍞🥖🍪

Baking started at shortly after 5 this a.m. so I could enjoy some afternoon and evening time with family. It's all done now, here's what will be available tomorrow: potato bread, French bread, chocolate chip cookies and cinnamon rolls. (No tomato bread this week, sorry folks!)

🐐🧼

These hot, sultry days surely have us all taking lots of showers...tired of the same old soap? Come see what I have in stock, lots of old fashioned lye soap made with goat milk.

🍅🌶🍅🌶

Fresh farm raised tomatoes will also be available in the morning. I'll also have some hot banana peppers (great for just a hint of kick in salsa) and the cutest little mini peppers you've ever seen...not all veggies can be described as cute, but these can!

Market begins at 7 and closes at 11 on the west side of the square in Unionville, Mo...come see us! 👩‍🌾

Week #12 of Market on the Square, summer is flying by!

🍞🥖🍪

Baking started at shortly after 5 this a.m. so I could enjoy some afternoon and evening time with family. It's all done now, here's what will be available tomorrow: potato bread, French bread, chocolate chip cookies and cinnamon rolls. (No tomato bread this week, sorry folks!)

🐐🧼

These hot, sultry days surely have us all taking lots of showers...tired of the same old soap? Come see what I have in stock, lots of old fashioned lye soap made with goat milk.

🍅🌶🍅🌶

Fresh farm raised tomatoes will also be available in the morning. I'll also have some hot banana peppers (great for just a hint of kick in salsa) and the cutest little mini peppers you've ever seen...not all veggies can be described as cute, but these can!

Market begins at 7 and closes at 11 on the west side of the square in Unionville, Mo...come see us! 👩‍🌾

Happy Friday everyone! 🤗
Farmer’s Market update:
Our farm shop will have more of a variety of pencil bag styles, new fabrics for other various things, little back to school items for your child’s backpack and much more. I’ll still have soaps and lotions in summery scents, hand painted pillows & tea towels and beef sticks. I kind of feel like the time between July 5th until the end of August is the “doldrums of summer”. Just hanging in there until we can unleash all things fall! We have started working on our autumn 2020 collection of goodies! I can’t wait!
Stop by and see us and all the other vendors as we wrap up ‘Christmas in July’ and move on with the next month! Market on the Square",0.0,"Always find what you need for all events! 🚲☃️🎄🚲💃😎

Hand painted pillows, goat milk soap, tea towels, beef sticks, hair towels and several new baby bibs & burp clothes! (Lots of new styles)

Now, I know there are uncertainties about school this fall & many opinions on that topic...whether your kiddos are going back or they are staying at home...I will be adding back to school items for the next month that they will NEED in their list of items!! 😉
This weekend we will have several of these cute pencil pouches!! They are fun for the kids regardless of how school will be for them this year. Make learning fun and exciting! I’ll be adding new designs as I can over the next several weeks! Get yours while they last! They are larger and lined with a fun braided lanyard! I can ship too!

💥EXCITING NEWS!💥
This Saturday, July 4th, I will be selling session gift certificates & Photo prints at the Market On The Square from 7-11!☺️
Feel free to ask any questions and SHARE for your Facebook friends you know would LOVE THIS!💕
•
These prints make GREAT gifts and can brighten anyone’s day as many photos were taken at beautiful locations like, Paris, New York, Rome, and of course the great town of Unionville😉
However if that’s not your style, gift certificates are the way to go! Giving someone beautiful photos of their family, newborn, friends, or even a senior session will be SO much more memorable than that t-shirt you (almost) gave them instead!💛
Prints and frames ARE limited, so be sure to stop by or message me to claim yours now! And if you can’t make it, no worries! Message me to plan shipping, or other conveniences for you!☺️",0.0,"Great time to purchase for special events and moments! We look forward to having you at the Market!😎✌🚲💃👏

It is beautiful outside today and I've been stuck inside baking for the majority of the day...but at least I have a good view! Those two girls in the background are our current family milkers, Alice and Rona. We bought the latter of the two this spring and decided naming her Rona would help us remember when we bought her, I mean 2020 and Corona will not soon be forgotten. 🙃

If you are a carb lover, be sure and come see me tomorrow at Market on the Square in Unionville from 7 til 11, cause I have ya covered! Fresh breads...French, Potato (the only traditional loaf white bread I make, try it & you'll see why) and Oatmeal (haven't brought this one to market this year, but it was well loved last year). Two choices of cookies, molasses and chocolate chip.

Fresh from the high tunnel will be swiss chard and kale and maybe a few other surprises.

The hens have a nice supply of eggs to bring in also. 🐔🥚

I'll have a great selection of goat milk soap on hand as well.

Some of the new material! (the Boer goat, cattle & retro western ones haven’t came in yet.)

I will be making some more baby bibs, burp rags and other various things with these! I am also going to make some fun bags! The fabric I will use on them is heavier...you can use them as makeup bags, hold-all bags inside a purse, diaper bag etc. even pencil bags for the kids.

AND....
I am going to make some little handbags like the one in the picture. It’s my own personal one and made with pendelton wool which will be coming also!

Also a little reminder, I can customize things with names.

I will be working over the next few weeks to get as much finished as possible. I had several custom orders come in so I’m trying to finish them! But there will be new things at farmers market this Saturday. I’ll post pictures of those goodies later! 🖤",2.0,"So creative...we so enjoy having Delhi at the Market on the Square!🚲👏🚲👏👩‍🌾👨‍🌾🚲🚲#MOSQUARE

Do you know what true love is? True love is watching this strawberry ripen more each and every day and not picking it for myself...the very first one from our high tunnel and I'm saving it for my sweetheart. ❤

Fresh salad is on the menu for tonight's supper; along with some morel mushrooms. Our family loves to eat and we love to eat well! 😃 I made a fresh batch of Greek yogurt yesterday with a gallon of raw cow milk. I ran out of time/energy at the end of the day and waited to strain it until today, if you haven't had ""real"" yogurt you are missing out. I reserved some for making more, left some plain and then used two cups to make one of Rob's favorite breakfasts...overnight oats with raisins, cinnamon and some other wholesome goodies that he doesn't even notice (chia & flax seeds).

Things here are growing well...two legged kids as well as four legged kids, and calves. Lots of fresh veggies are looking great and the hens and ducks are laying well too. New soaps are cured and ready to go. I LOVE this time of year! Farmers Market is just around the corner...anyone ready?",0.0,"We cannot wait!! 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾🚲🚲😘

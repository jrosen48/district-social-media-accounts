Members of our Assay Development Services Division (ADSD) have been working wonders in the Galveston National Laboratory. Led by ADSD co-director Dr. Rick Pyles, they developed the SARS-CoV-2 test system being used in the GNL, enabling UTMB to substantially increase its COVID-19 testing capabilities. Their work included validating the test in the clinical lab and working tirelessly to conduct the vast majority of COVID-19 tests that UTMB has conducted to date. By sharing the assay with other institutions, they have also allowed for more widespread testing of patients across the nation.

It was brought to our attention that a group of people used the football stadium today without the districts permission. The gates were locked and these individuals (between 30-40 of them) climbed the fence to play football. We do have several cameras at the stadium and we will be reaching out to those individuals we identify.
Just a friendly reminder that unauthorized use of Hitchcock ISD facilities can carry a criminal trespassing charge. Currently the city is also under a stay at home ordinance which can also carry up to a 2,000 fine for violators.",2020-03-29 21:25:15,,

She had gone to the restroom and saw water spilled in the hallway. She got paper towels and cleaned it up, not realizing that another teacher had seen her act of kindness. She is always finding other friends to help, and she is a super student. She is a rock star!

Marc Munoz in Ms. Perkins Second Grade class goes above and beyond when he sees someone that doesn't understand he helps them by trying to explain things. I watch him work in stations as a leader in his group. He shows kindness while others do not help. I am very proud of him overcoming his own obstacles in class and then using his experiences of struggles to help others become successful. Way to go Marc!",2019-12-09 09:30:30,,

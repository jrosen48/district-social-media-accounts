Yes the Junior high will practice at the high school and we are not practicing with Fulda for junior high because of of busing numbers. We are also offering these practice dates for our 6th graders to join us as well. So any 6th grade girl that is interested in volleyball may join the Junior high for these 6 practices. Also just a heads up to the 7/8 grade girls that we could possibly go up to Fulda one of the Varsity practice days of week 2. Trying to work out busing to allow for one practice together week 2.

Students that received enough points and turned in their tracker sheets will receive a complimentary ticket to a Timberwolves game and an opportunity to shoot a free throw on the court afterwards.

Many students said they played outside in the snow, shoveled snow, played basketball, played football with friends outside, did exercises in the house, walked the dog, had dance class, and hockey practice. Wow! So many ways to keep the body and brain healthy!

The Bismarck Veterans Memorial Public Library is inviting all youth to “Imagine your story!” Summer Reading is definitely not the same this year, but one thing that is the same is that we all still love to read! For this summer, children and teens are offered two chances to log 10 hours of reading in June and July.

There will be separate incentives and prize drawings for both months. The children’s program is for babies through kids going into 5th grade. The teen program is for youth going into 6th grade through 12th grade. Both reading challenges are available through Beanstack, the Library’s online reading application, or by submitting a paper log accessible from the Library’s web site. Completion of the Library’s reading challenges also qualifies children and teens to receive the Bank of ND College Save Reading Champion award.

The Bismarck Veterans Memorial Public Library is inviting all youth to “Imagine your story!” Summer Reading is definitely not the same this year, but one thing that is the same is that we all still love to read! For this summer, children and teens are offered two chances to log 10 hours of reading in June and July.

There will be separate incentives and prize drawings for both months. The children’s program is for babies through kids going into 5th grade. The teen program is for youth going into 6th grade through 12th grade. Both reading challenges are available through Beanstack, the Library’s online reading application, or by submitting a paper log accessible from the Library’s web site. Completion of the Library’s reading challenges also qualifies children and teens to receive the Bank of ND College Save Reading Champion award.

Scribbles become more than just scribbles when eyes and a smile are added. Somehow a personality leaps onto the page and with it, encouragement for children to grow and express themselves. The positive result looking back at them spreads a surge of joy that is infectious.

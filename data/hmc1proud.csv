SLA is a partnership with PREP-KC and the Kansas City Metropolitan Bar Foundation offering 6-week paid internships to students interested in careers in law. Throughout their time in the program, SLA Scholars learned from legal professionals via interactive sessions, discussions, and special projects. They virtually visited courts, witnessed dockets, depositions, and learned about the legal system and careers in the law.

A special thank you to our partners for helping our students learn more about their passions and interests in a hands-on, collaborative and engaging way.

Ms. Nutter taught at Walker Elementary School in Merriam, a segregated school known for its run down exterior and lack of indoor plumbing. In 1947, a new school was built, but when enrollment came along, African American students were denied access to the new school. In protest, Ms. Nutter organized a home school for children in her community, holding class in church basements and neighborhood living rooms. She also joined a group of individuals who built a case against the district and sued the state.

“Her fundamental principle was we teach children. We have to do what is right for all children because they all deserve it.

Ms. Nutter taught at Walker Elementary School in Merriam, a segregated school known for its run down exterior and lack of indoor plumbing. In 1947, a new school was built, but when enrollment came along, African American students were denied access to the new school. In protest, Ms. Nutter organized a home school for children in her community, holding class in church basements and neighborhood living rooms. She also joined a group of individuals who built a case against the district and sued the state.

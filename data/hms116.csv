Dear High Mount School 116 Parents and Guardians,

On Friday, August 7th, I sent out a communication indicating that based upon the County Health Department guidance, we will begin the 2020-2021 school year with remote learning. While we are disappointed that we will not hear the sounds of student laughter or have the ability to offer in-person instruction, we understand the guidance and will always prioritize safety.

This late announcement has again caused the administration and teachers to regroup and make adaptations to our original Return to School Plan. With that said, we will push back the first day of student attendance to Thursday, August 20, 2020.

Once again, I apologize for the inconveniences this may cause you and your family. We are doing our very best to be prepared and offer the best possible remote learning experience. I assure you, we are committed to making this plan student centered!

Thank you in advance for your understanding.

Sincerely,

It's Voting Time! The Gallery Award is the defining legacy of our art program at High Mount School. Since 2001 the best 8th grade artist has been chosen by the whole school and their artwork professionally hung for all of the High Mount community to see. It's been a pleasure teaching this group, the most talented I've ever had! Please help us select 2020's best 8th grade artwork. It's hard to select just one!

The HMS Family Program provides a platform for character development and service learning projects. Our students become a member of an HMS Family when they enroll, and remain a part of that family until they graduate from HMS. Each family consists of an HMS educator and a child from each grade level. Atleast once a month, HMS families gather to participate in a group activity and/or discussion, typically focusing on a specific character trait, team building, and service learning. Through the HMS Family Program, students develop relationships with children across all grade levels and an adult with whom they may not otherwise have regular contact.

This is a Code Red from Chief Steve Johnson of the Swansea Police Department.

It was just reported to us that a 13-year-old girl got off her school bus today at 3:15 PM in Stonefield Crossing subdivision (northeast end of Swansea). As she walked towards her house, there was a person who drove up to her and said, “Hey can I tell you a joke?” She did not reply and kept walking towards her house. He continued talking but she walked away. She felt he was “very creepy.” We do not know his intentions but thought the community should know this happened.

The truck is described as a small green pick up and the driver was a white male, about 50 to 60 years old and was bald. Once again, we do not know his intentions but it was, as she described, a little creepy.

Information in the hands of parents is powerful. That is why we send this message out. Talk to your kiddos about safety and to do exactly like this young lady did. Sorry for the late message but we thought this information was important for you to know about.

As she walked towards her house, there was a person who drove up to her and said, “Hey can I tell you a joke?” She did not reply and kept walking towards her house. He continued talking but she walked away. She felt he was “very creepy.” We do not know his intentions but thought the community should know this happened.

The truck is described as a small green pick up and the driver was a white male, about 50 to 60 years old and was bald. Once again, we do not know his intentions but it was, as she described, a little creepy.

Information in the hands of parents is powerful. That is why we send this message out. Talk to your kiddos about safety and to do exactly like this young lady did. Sorry for the late message but we thought this information was important for you to know about.

This has been a Code Red from the Swansea Police Department.",2019-08-27 21:54:59,,

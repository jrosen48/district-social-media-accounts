The testing center at NMJC is currently closed, and they currently do not have a date to reopen for Accuplacer testing. Likewise, we are not allowed to test on HHS campus. I have been in contact with the Vice President of New Mexico Junior College, and we are working on a plan to insure that students get an equitable opportunity to apply for Hobbs Dual Credit Academy (early college). Hopefully, we will have a plan in place about requirements for acceptance and application due dates and instructions for turning those applications early next week. As soon as I get clear direction, I will send it out via School Messenger and post it on our school website and announcement page. Enrollment at NMJC has also been postponed until later this semester, so no one is being left out or not being given the opportunity to apply.

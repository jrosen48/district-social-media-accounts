It appears one of our security vendors has had a major issue that has caused the reset of 250+ student and staff Google passwords.

What does this mean?

Those affected will be unable to login to their Google/Zoom/Schoology/Seesaw/Clever accounts until the issue is resolved.

Can it get fixed?

Yes. We anticipate elementary passwords will be reset before secondary. This means that the passwords will be reset to what was used successfully earlier today. Secondary (Grades 6-12) is a little more problematic; a reset may involve a manual reset with HSD support or a mass reset using a new assigned password.

What is the HSD doing?

Our tech department is currently reaching out to affected teachers to help them get their passwords reset so they can resume instruction. Please understand that instruction may not happen today. If they can, teachers will reach out to families with an update.

We are also working with the vendor to figure out what happened, create a solution, and ensure that this does not happen again.

Thank you for your patience.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10163916755805244&id=366871540243,,0.0,"Parents:

This hardworking herd has been practicing in the evenings and weekends since October.

But this is more than a team -- it's a community effort that includes four volunteer coaches and a volunteer parent/bookkeeper, two of whom don't even have students in the high school, and many others.

""This team would not be possible without our sponsors, parents, admins and superintendent's support,"" writes team adviser Jessica Ambrose.

Go Hawks!

Atholton Elementary School fourth graders recently made 50 blankets for the local Project Linus, whose mission is to provide homemade blankets “to children in hospitals, shelters, social service agencies or anywhere that a child might be in need of a big hug.”

The students led the project by creating the blankets themselves, with the support of school staff and local community members and materials paid with reimbursable PTA funds. Paraeducators Barbara Garnett and Jackie Maisel helped rotate small groups of students throughout each day for about a month, so each student could take part in making the no-sew blankets, which require cutting the fleece ends into strips.

There is an outbreak of respiratory disease (which affects breathing) caused by a novel (new) virus centered in Wuhan, China. Here's what you should know:

If you traveled to China in the last 14 days and have a fever and cough or shortness of breath, you should seek medical care right away. Before you go to a doctor’s office or emergency, call ahead and tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms.

The CDC recommends that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to Wuhan, China.

Based on the current information, the immediate health risk from this virus to the general American public is considered low at this time.

There is an outbreak of respiratory disease (which affects breathing) caused by a novel (new) virus centered in Wuhan, China. Here's what you should know:

If you traveled to China in the last 14 days and have a fever and cough or shortness of breath, you should seek medical care right away. Before you go to a doctor’s office or emergency, call ahead and tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms.

The CDC recommends that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to Wuhan, China.

Based on the current information, the immediate health risk from this virus to the general American public is considered low at this time.

The budget proposal reflects the school system’s commitment to fiscal responsibility by fully funding health care costs and reducing the Health Fund deficit, finding savings and efficiencies in all programs, and seeking budget-neutral means to accelerate the system’s diversity, equity and inclusion work.

The proposal totals $964.1 million and represents an increase of $62.7 million, or 7% over the FY 2020 budget. Of the total, $670.4 million is requested from the county, an increase of $63.2 million, which includes $43.8 million above the Maintenance of Effort funding formula plus a one-time request of $9.0 million to reduce the Health Fund deficit. Also included are $277.8 million in anticipated funding from the state and $8.0 million in federal and other funding support.

Superintendent Presents 2020–2021 Operating Budget Proposal",0.0,"ICYMI - Superintendent Martirano last week presented his proposed FY21 Operating Budget to the Board of Education.

The budget proposal reflects the school system’s commitment to fiscal responsibility by fully funding health care costs and reducing the Health Fund deficit, finding savings and efficiencies in all programs, and seeking budget-neutral means to accelerate the system’s diversity, equity and inclusion work.

The proposal totals $964.1 million and represents an increase of $62.7 million, or 7% over the FY 2020 budget. Of the total, $670.4 million is requested from the county, an increase of $63.2 million, which includes $43.8 million above the Maintenance of Effort funding formula plus a one-time request of $9.0 million to reduce the Health Fund deficit. Also included are $277.8 million in anticipated funding from the state and $8.0 million in federal and other funding support. State Kirwan funding is expected to be consistent with the $8.7 million received in FY 2020.

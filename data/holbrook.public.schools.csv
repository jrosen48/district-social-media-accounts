I just wanted to touch base regarding a very unfortunate and FALSE news story that was created and posted to a local Facebook group page. The story was generated through the use of a realistic app called Break Your Own News. In the false story, someone claimed that there were two cases of Covid-19 identified in the Holbrook Public Schools. The initial post has since been taken down as it contained completely fabricated information. To be clear, there are no cases of COVID-19 in our schools. I thank you in advance for your patience and support as any attempts to make light of such a nationally and globally concerning issue is upsetting to everyone.

Our greatest resource in the classroom isn’t a textbook, a Chromebook or a program...it’s our teachers and staff, so wanted to validate how important they are to the success and fulfillment of our student’s dreams.

After re-assessing the water issue with the Holbrook Director of Public Works, it appears that the boiled water ban will NOT be lifted by tomorrow. As the safety of students and staff is our first concern, we will have to cancel our drama program, summer school program and special education in-house programming for tomorrow Friday, July 12. The Champions Program will also be closed until the boiled water ban is lifted.

We are so thrilled to be able to finally share with all of you the X2 Aspen Family Portal. Aspen is a secure, web-based student management system created by X2 Development Corporation for school districts to manage all facets of student data from attendance to conduct, grades to schedules, health to special education. While we have used Aspen in-district for many years, this new module will allow parents and guardians to log into Aspen via the Family Portal to view information about their child(ren). We will be fully implementing the Family Portal in the fall of 2019, but would like to have the summer to give parents and guardians time to set up accounts and troubleshoot any issues with logging into the website. Many have already received welcome emails and are in the process of setting up family accounts. If you have not received your welcome email by June 1st, please contact our technology department at jgonzalez@holbrook.k12.ma.us.

Our leadership team felt it was time to provide an update on our 12-Point Plan, provide more insight into our online learning platforms and provide an opportunity for parents and students to ask questions about our current plan; as well as, our next steps for HUSD #3.

Thank you all for your kindness, patience and dedication to Helping our Unique Students Develop. Our goal from the onset has been to create a safe, healthy and educational environment for all Roadrunners. We will continue that charge and together we will help our students become who they are capable of becoming.

Last night, August 25th, all 3-5 and 6 at IWE passwords were set to Runner20. This will be a one time password and you will be asked to create a new one. It will need to be at least 8 characters long, have at least one uppercase, one lowercase and one number. It cannot have any part of your name.

Password Examples:

HappyDog7! is a bad password, too easy to guess!

h4ppYd0g7! is better, it adds numbers and uppercase

h4Ppd0Gsvn! is best! Not easy to guess but easy to remember

It needs to be easy to remember but hard to guess.

Be internet awesome!

Welcome to the 2020-2021 School Year. We are excited to get started. On Thursday and Friday (July 30th/31st) one of the Junior High Teachers will be reaching out. This will be your child's Homeroom Teacher and/or Success Coach. They will walk you through what you can expect when starting in Distance Learning on August 3rd. In addition, they will supply you with login information for your child to connect with their teachers.

If you have not completed registration or scheduled a Chromebook Pick-Up please contact the Junior High Office at 928-524-3959 to schedule an appointment.

We look forward to connecting with you and we are excited to get the new school year started!

""While driving home from a short trip Johnny Cash's ""Ring of Fire"" came on the radio and my 8 year old son started to sing along exclaiming that he loved this song because Mr. Goodman would sing it to us in class. Another of my children said ""Mr. Goodman is my favorite teacher!"". Another said ""Mine is Mr. Bob.""

This decision is not made lightly, but it is the right thing to do to bring certainty and consistency to all Arizona schools. With schools closing, we are working together to provide assistance during this time and lessen the impact on all Arizona families.

Geocaching is a popular past time that requires participants to search for hidden log books and prizes using GPS and clues. Coordinates are posted to www.geocaching.com for anyone to find. There are literally millions hidden worldwide including many in the Holbrook area. It is the worlds largest scavenger hunt!

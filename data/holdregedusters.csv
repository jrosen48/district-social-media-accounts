QB POWER!! 3x12s today on bench and hex bar deadlift.... laying the foundation for great things to come. Kids love them of course 😬😂

A good HB deadlift with good weight is another prerequisite to earn the back squat.

Notice how he is coaching himself using the mirror. If you coach them up the right way they shouldn’t even need you after a while.",0.0,"Dusters Strength and Speed

We have had lots of parents asking us to reopen the online store for masks, so here it is!
The black masks are definitely smaller and would be great for the little kiddos.
The gray ones (adult or youth) are adjustable and fit nicely.
Both are very good quality!

Saturday morning retests since we had some tired guys from doubling up testing and conditioning this week. Two more guys broke over 8-0 in the broad jump along with this kid running a 4.83 laser 40 which is one of our more impressive performances on the guys side. When converted to handheld we are the talking the 4.55-4.6 range. The scary thing is once he fine tunes his sprint mechanics (straighten out his arm action) he is going to be even faster.

A glimpse of the Duster girls squat max day. Most repped previous maxes several times or had to add weight.

As a group on average (30 kids) they added 2” to their verts and shaved .13 secs off their 40 times.

More updates to come later today and this week when the rest of our athletes come in to test.

Intent is everything, especially in power training. The sensor measures speed which gives us a power reading off the iPad.

This summer, Dusters Strength & Speed has had 159 athletes grades 7-12 participate with a 93.12% attendance rate. Hard to believe! That is over 13 times more kids than last summer. This speaks volumes about the hunger for success that these kids have. We will continue to take one small step forward towards our goals everyday.

Can we keep this momentum up as it gets harder?

Holdrege Public School 2019-20 Pre-Participation Physical Exams (PPE) will be ACCEPTED for the 2020-21 school year. You will NOT need to get a new physical if you are a returning 9,10,11 grader.

The requirement for students entering the7th grade to have a physical exam is Nebraska state education law and we do not have the ability to waive that requirement. However, the physicals that the current 7th graders have for the 2019-2020 school year can be used for NSAA purposes for the 2020-2021 school year.

Due to our catastrophic insurance requirements, all current 8th grade students that are going to enter the 9th grade in 2020, will STILL be required to get a PPE for the 2020-2021 school year.

Several artists in Holdrege armed with brushes have illuminated our town with bright window paintings. Holdrege senior, Emily Gustafson, has painted six of the windows so far with more requests in line from local businesses. Generally, each business has an idea of what they want painted: a theme to inspire the community in these difficult times.

Emily has been president of Holdrege’s National Art Honor Society for the past two years and takes her induction pledge seriously: “I will in my life to the best of my ability through my talents in art help to create a more beautiful world for myself, for humankind and for all living things.” Watch for more brightly colored windows in the near future and, as it says in the Sweeney Wealth Management window, let’s “stay strong”.

Check out Emily's work at the following locations:
Sweeney Wealth Management
Spirit of Grace
Salon 31
Holdrege Soft Water
The 308 Boutique

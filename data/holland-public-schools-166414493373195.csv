We are encouraging everyone to write a letter or make a card thanking Dave for all his years of service and how he has impacted you as a student. We will have a bin to drop the letters/cards in as you drive by. Mr. Elenbaas does not know about this celebration but his wife does. Let's keep this a secret (he doesn't do Facebook).

A SURPRISE Celebration for Mr. Elenbaas! The West family would like to honor Mr. Elenbaas for all his years of dedication to the students of HPS and help him celebrate in his RETIREMENT!

On Wednesday, May 27th, we will have a parade past Dave's house from 5:00 to 6:00. We cannot post his address so if you would like to join in, meet us at Christ Memorial at 4:45 and we will head over to his house at 5:00. Everyone must stay in their vehicle as you drive past his home.

We are encouraging everyone to write a letter or make a card thanking Dave for all his years of service and how he has impacted you as a student. We will have a bin to drop the letters/cards in as you drive by. Mr. Elenbaas does not know about this celebration but his wife does. Let's keep this a secret (he doesn't do Facebook).

Monday we begin Remote Learning. Use the link below, scroll down and find your child’s grade. Attached is the daily weekly lesson plan for every grade. The lessons are easy to follow with links for guided teacher lessons, interactive reading and math for every day. Each day provides a different special activity.
Many teachers will link this to your child’s Google Classroom or class DoJo depending on what your students class is using.
We look forward to continue learning with our students for the remainder of the school year. Contact your child’s teacher with any questions! #hpsProud #hpsisrightforme

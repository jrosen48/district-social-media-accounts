First and foremost, your student’s safety is our number one concern.

Recognize that the current situation we find ourselves in is fluid and ever-changing.

Your students will be able to remove their personal items and empty all lockers and cubbies between the hours of 4 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. today, March 17, 2020, only. Bring a garbage bag, please. Building access will be controlled and only one individual per family will be allowed entrance.

ES parents will take home personal items and receive instructional materials for their students.

MS and HS students will remove personal items, clear lockers and be sure they have their computers and chargers.

Personal calls will be made to those who need to pick up medication.

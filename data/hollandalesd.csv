Good evening Parents and Students of Hollandale School District,

Today the Governor had a press conference regarding school opening. In this conference he announced an executive order that affects the Hollandale School District. Below are the details of the order as it pertains to each school:
Sanders Elementary School - Classes will begin virtually, as planned, on August 5. For details concerning links, work to be completed, and start and end times, please visit www.trsanders.org.

Simmons Jr/Sr High School - In the executive order, the Governor delayed the start of school for students in grades 7-12 in Washington County, and some other counties, until August 17. We are seeking clarity from the Governor's office and MDE to see if this pertains to virtual learning. Once clarity is provided, we may start virtual learning before August 17. Please look for updates on the district's website and Facebook page. We will also do an automated call when we have more information.

This is a survey posed by Hollandale School District to access the readiness of the district to offer distance learning. For the district to provide the best learning options we need accurate data. We ask that the parent or guardian complete this survey so that we can map out our next plan of action for continuing to educate our students. Thanks!!! Rosalyn Brockman, Technology Director

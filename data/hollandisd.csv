Tonight the JV and Varsity played in Granger.

JV had a slow first half, but put it on them the second and won 27 - 21. Scoring was Hohhertz 8, Ralston 8, Coats 6, and Burton 5.

Varsity played their hearts out tonight, but lost a close one 40 - 37. Scoring Burton 11, Frei 10, C. Evans 6, Tomasek 4, Brown 4, and Ward 2.

Both JV and Varsity played extremely hard tonight and I couldn't be more proud of the effort they gave. They left it all out on the court.

The physical and mental health along with the safety of our students and staff remains our highest priority; we cannot create an environment that is conducive to teaching and learning without it. While it is impossible to eliminate all risk, every decision will be made with an eye to minimize it to the greatest possible extent.

We wanted to give you an update on the status of the 2019/2020 Yearbook order. Please see what Lifetouch, the company that produces our yearbooks, has stated:

“As COVID-19 has changed the way we live from day to day, we made a promise to you to keep you informed about your Yearbook. At this time, due to COVID-19, we have had government-mandated shut-downs that have reduced our capacity for printing yearbooks. As we work to safely return to our production facilities, be assured that everyone who ordered a yearbook will receive one. However, in certain instances the delivery of your yearbook may be delayed.”

We have been in weekly contact with Lifetouch, and unfortunately, we still do not have a shipping date.

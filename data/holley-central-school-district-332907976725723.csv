Hi everyone,
Like many of you I was shaken by the Governor’s statement that we will stay closed down until May. I miss you all and truly wish I could help. All I can do is to remind you that if you have a library card -use it. Also, if you are having difficulty with WiFi, please go to the parking lot by the library and use our WiFi. I DID NOT TURN IT OFF. The password for Holley library public Is: HolleyLibrary. Please feel free to use it and all our databases.
May God keep you all healthy, until we can see each other again.

Hi everyone, from what I gather from the Orleans legislature, they are looking at the schools and the library being closed until at least April 15th. But, they highly believe that it will be longer. So please do not worry about any of your items being overdue. When we open, all items will be checked in fine free so enjoy your books as long as you want to - read those story books many many times to the littles. Please, with everything to worry about - do not worry about the library- we are yours and we will do everything in our power to see you through these hard times. And as Lawrence Welk used to sing “Adios, Au Revoir, Auf Wedersehen “, goodnight!

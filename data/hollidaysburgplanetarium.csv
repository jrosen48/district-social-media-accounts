Professor Fred, Professor Emeritus of Earth & Planetary Sciences, Santa Barbara City College & former astronomy teacher at Hollidaysburg High School, will be leading this hour of Cosmic Treats this Thursday June 23 at 6 PM at the Hollidaysburg Area Public Library.

Everyone attending will make a simple AstroFinder or Astrolabe and learn to use it just as people did 2000 years ago. With this instrument they could tell the Earth was round, they could determine the size of the Earth & how far they were from the equator (their latitude), and they could mark the daily positions of the planets on a star chart.

All the materials will be provided free for each person, and hands-on instructions as to how to use your new astrolabe will be included.

Of course, there will also be snacks!

This free program is a partnership with Dr. Lanika Ruzhitskaya, Director of Science Outreach, Saint Francis University. All are welcome; no signup is needed, children must be accompanied by an adult.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=811353962332757&id=796389073829246,"THU, JUN 23, 2016

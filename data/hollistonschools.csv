Project 351 is a statewide initiative that brings together young people from almost all 351 cities and towns in the Commonwealth to collaborate on service opportunities and harness critical leadership skills through a year-long program. Project 351 is a great opportunity for both town ambassadors and other young people in the community, and I look forward to connecting with it more in the future.

Megan is an exemplary Project 351 alumna. A member of the Alumni Leadership Team, Megan spoke of her years of involvement with Project 351 as well as her own initiative, The Beautiful Mind Campaign. The Beautiful Mind Campaign, which Megan started at Holliston High, works to destigmatize mental illness and support wellness for adolescents, who face increasing pressure at school and home both.

We are pleased to invite parents/guardians to a Parent/Guardian Education Evening on the topic of Mindfulness. Secular mindfulness strategies are increasingly being used in education and other fields to support positive well-being. Research studies support that Mindfulness has positive impacts on the brain, relationships, and physical and mental health.
Educators in Holliston are beginning to learn how to use some of these techniques and learn about the benefits in the classroom. We would like to extend this learning to interested parents/guardians.
The presentation is tailored toward parents/guardians of elementary students, however middle school and high school parents/guardians are certainly welcome as well.

Dear Holt Public,

Yesterday, we reported that one of the Chromebook orders we placed in May had yet to arrive. This is an issue affecting schools across the nation. We also shared that to ensure access, in some cases; students may need to be temporarily issued a refurbished Chromebook. We later learned this week that some families left their assigned material and Chromebook pick-up time without a device. I am happy to report that for families still in need of a Chromebook, K-8th grade building principals will be reaching out to schedule a device pick-up time! We are still working on the final details of our high school device pick-up plan. We apologize for this inconvenience. While the devices we are deploying today are not new, they will provide a bridge to a newer device once they arrive. We remain committed to making sure your child has the tools needed for their academic success in these challenging times!

John and I enjoyed our conversation today with co-owner of Real Estate One 1st in Holt, Bob Garchow. Bob and his co-owner, Dale Ryckman have determined that the real estate market in Holt/Dimondale is light on inventory, which means people enjoy living in our school district! In addition, John discussed some Township news including two new large housing developments and I reflected on our recent Town Hall meetings and our decision to start the new school year on August 31 remotely.

Along with the picture will be a caption that might give you a clue where to find it. If you find the object, please DO NOT MOVE IT! These are fixtures on private or public property and do not belong to the library. Your goal is simply to find them! Once you have found it, send an email to dimondalelibrary@gmail.com with SCAVENGER HUNT in the Subject line, and the location of the object (nearest building or address) and your name and phone number in the body of the email. You can even email us a picture of you with the object or the address of the object. All correct answers will be entered into a weekly prize drawing! Get scavenging!

Each year, many Holt students participate in DECA Inc., an organization that seeks to “prepare emerging leaders and entrepreneurs in marketing, finance, hospitality, and management.” Students who participate develop these skills through academic conferences and competitions throughout the year.

“DECA is an amazing program for business-focused students, as well as anyone looking to obtain better leadership skills. One of my favorite parts of the DECA program at HHS is the trip to Detroit for the State competition. You meet amazing mentors and students while growing closer with your teammates,” said Holt participant Jacob Toomey.

Students 9th through 12th grade who are enrolled in a Business Technology course can sign up. If you are interested, talk to a Business Technology teacher at the high school or check out http://bit.ly/SecondaryPrograms for more information.",2020-06-30 16:00:38,https://video-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/103013433_336891827299073_4448604896939407163_n.mp4?_nc_cat=104&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=c8G-67FCpdcAX8FSMke&_nc_ht=video-atl3-1.xx&oh=8fd1418a98acca71f2c5a5c406a5ab48&oe=5F5E3FB8,

Young readers enrolled in the Summer Reading Program are invited to take the Scavenger Hunt Challenge! Once a week, we will be posting a picture of an interesting object in the Village of Dimondale. Along with the picture will be a caption that might give you a clue where to find it. If you find the object, please DO NOT MOVE IT! These are fixtures on private or public property and do not belong to the library. Your goal is simply to find them! Once you have found it, send an email to dimondalelibrary@gmail.com with SCAVENGER HUNT in the Subject line, and the location of the object (nearest building or address) and your name and phone number in the body of the email. You can even email us a picture of you with the object or the address of the object. All correct answers will be entered into a weekly prize drawing! Get scavenging!

We are now on Phase 2 of our reopening plan. If you need any copy, scan, or fax services, please call the library to schedule an appointment.

We hope to start Phase 3 next week, with vestibule or curbside pick up of requested materials. You can use our catalog at dhl.agverso.com to request materials you would like to check out when we are able to offer those services, or give us a call and we'll place those reserves for you. And our drop box is now open for returns if you have materials you'd like to bring back to the library.

John and I enjoyed our conversation today with Delhi Township, Parks and Rec Director, Mark Jenks. Mark discussed the Delhi Park system and highlighted the food program at the Senior Center. In addition, John discussed the Township and I shared my concern for our learning community. Now more than ever, we need to come together to find peace by talking to one another with empathy and compassion. Please keep an eye on and find ways to help a neighbor, a community member, or even a stranger. As you have heard me say for years, we are better together.

This program allows students to apply hands-on learning onsite at Power 4 America and can lead to a work-based learning placement with Consumers Energy or Lansing Board of Water and Light. The Energy Industrial Fundamental program at Holt High School is the first step for students into a high-demand, high-wage career. There are only three seats left for the class in the fall.

K-1: While you read with your child. Help them stretch or sound out unfamiliar words!

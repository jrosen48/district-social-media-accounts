The US 2020 Census will be finishing soon. I strongly encourage all of our families to complete the census and be counted! The 2020 Census count impacts the federal funds that communities receive each year for programs and services that are critical for schools, students, and younger children, such as:

Special education, Head Start, after-school programs, and classroom technology.

Food assistance, including free and reduced-price school lunches.

Maternal and child health programs.

So far, our community has done a great job completing the census! Holton, Cedar Creek, Blue Lake, Bridgeton, and Greenwood townships currently have over 68% who have completed the census. In 2010, we had approximately a 73% response rate. Help bring the response rates to above 75% or higher! Visit 2020CENSUS.GOV to complete the census.

Parents... we have had several kids coming to school this week at HMS without a mask.

We were lucky that the school was able to offer every student 5 white cotton masks at the beginning of the year. We were even able to keep some masks back as extras to help out students when they do forget...however, eventually, even our back up supply will run out.

In today's world, we all know that face masks are important and a requirement for school. Please make sure that your students come to school everyday with a mask.

The Jackson County Health Department has decided at this time to cancel all three Jackson County School for this coming week, March 16 through March 20. Also, the Kansas State Department of Education in a conference call at 4 p.m. today is strongly recommending that all schools in the state be out of session for this coming week as well. I want to commend Angie Reith, The Jackson County Health Official for her leadership in these trying times. She has worked extremely hard the last few days keeping us informed of what is going on in our county and in our state. She is looking out for the safety of our children and our community and we are lucky she is helping with this crisis. 12-month staff will follow building closure guidelines for reporting for work and custodians will be using this week to do more extensive cleaning of our facilities. All other staff are to stay out of the buildings at this time but later you may be called upon if needed to plan for what we do next. Thank you and please stay safe.

This morning, the Jackson County Health Department asked all three superintendents in our area to attend a meeting with the experts in healthcare in our community to specifically discuss schools. Throughout the day today, there are several other meetings and webinars scheduled that will give us more insight into what to do moving forward. After all of these sessions today, we plan to discuss what is best for our community moving forward and I will issue a statement by 6 p.m.

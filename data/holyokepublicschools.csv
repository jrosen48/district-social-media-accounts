Face masks help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Because it’s possible to have coronavirus without showing symptoms, it is best to wear a face covering even if you think you are healthy. If you have COVID-19 and are not showing symptoms, a face mask reduces your chance of spreading the infection to others. If you are healthy, a mask may protect you from larger droplets from people around you.

Why are DESE and the medical community recommending in-person learning?

After weeks of discussion with many stakeholders, including members of our Return-to-School Working Group, infectious disease physicians, pediatricians, and other public health experts, and given low transmission rates of COVID-19 in the state, there is a clear consensus that in-person learning is the preferred model. While remote learning has improved over the course of the school closures, there is no substitute for in-person instruction when it comes to the quality of students’ academic learning. In-person school plays an equally important role in supporting students’ social-emotional needs, including their mental and physical health, and mitigating the impacts of trauma.

COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact (within about 3 feet) for a prolonged period. Spread happens when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, and droplets from their mouth or nose are launched into the air and land in the mouths or noses of people nearby. The droplets can also be inhaled into the lungs. Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19.

McMahon, which holds a special place in my heart as the school where I attended Kindergarten, had a wonderful staff and community but lacked a committed leader. That all changed the day Noreen Ewick rejoined McMahon School as Principal. Ms. Ewick came to McMahon with a vision and dedication previous leaders lacked. Hard-working and committed to her vision of strengthening our McMahon Community, Ms. Ewick’s ability to recognize the potential of McMahon students and staff and to provide a supportive, safe environment with high expectations made her an exceptional boss.

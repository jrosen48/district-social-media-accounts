We think these are really great opportunities for our students and parents (there are adult classes too!).

Classes start June 15th and run through July 31st. Registration closes the Wednesday before the start of each class so definitely have a look sooner than later if you can. There are scholarships in the form of 25%, 50%, and 100% available as well as class material kits available for anyone needing extra help or who may be interested in a series of classes. Check out all the great classes by visiting www.calibraska.org

We encourage you to keep doing all those recommendations--wash your hands often, disinfect, stay home as much as possible, and wear a cloth mask when you are out in public. Officials encourage limiting essential shopping to only once a week with one person doing the shopping.

It’s safe to say we expect more cases to be announced in our area, but there are people that have recovered and are doing well. That’s encouraging news in a time when we need some positive vibes!

Teachers will be expecting students to remain engaged in alternative learning through Thursday, but we encourage a break for the long Easter Weekend. We would have been out of school Friday and Monday, so we will also be out of alternative learning those days.

We encourage you to keep doing all those recommendations--wash your hands often, disinfect, stay home as much as possible, and wear a cloth mask when you are out in public. Officials encourage limiting essential shopping to only once a week with one person doing the shopping.

It’s safe to say we expect more cases to be announced in our area, but there are people that have recovered and are doing well. That’s encouraging news in a time when we need some positive vibes!

Congratulations to our State FFA Degree recipients today.

We were supposed to be in Lincoln, watching you walk across the stage to receive your degree and charm. While we feel the heartache and disappointment, we have to remember that our time in the blue jacket lives on after our accomplishments.

We are so proud of each of you for dedicating your time, energy, passion and knowledge to our chapter for the last 4 years.

I wish we could be together today, but we WILL honor you as soon as we are able to. I can't wait to add your hand prints to the wall of the ag room and to the growing list of State FFA Degree's from our chapter.

The latest revision reflects input from the community, staff, and board; and ongoing conversations and guidance from health care professionals.

Particularly, I direct your attention to page 2 – the two essential objectives and the three fundamentals, as it pertains to successfully returning to school.

Please email or call Mr. Lembke or me with questions, thoughts, and concerns. We welcome face-to-face conversations.

Also, Sunday, August 16 and Monday, August 17, virtual meetings will be held. The purpose will be to share the plan, take questions, and listen to input. More details will be shared later this week through email, the website, and the district Facebook page.

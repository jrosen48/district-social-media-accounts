Return to School",13.0,"Choice of Instructional Setting
Even with the postponement of the start of school, Hondo ISD will still offer two options. Parents can choose between On Campus or Remote learning for their students for the first six weeks of the 2020-2021 school year by logging into their Skyward Family Access with their credentials August 3-14. The custodial family will be able to set the instructional method by completing the Method of Instruction Form for each student.

More information about the two options is available at the Return To School page: www.hondoisd.net/returntoschool including a step by step tutorial video.

Because Pearsall does not have “B” teams, the McDowell “B” teams will travel to Loma Alta (Medina Valley Middle School) on Monday, October 28. The 7th grade “B” team will kickoff at 5:00 p.m. followed by the 8th grade “B” team.

Monday is a student holiday, so players will need to report to the dressing room by 3:00 p.m.

The “A” team schedule will remain the same. They will travel to Pearsall on Thursday, October 31. The 7th grade “A” team will take the field at 5:00 p.m. followed by the 8th grade “A” team.

I want to inform everyone that parent/teacher conferences will continue as planned. However, the Kenmare Board of Education has decided to cancel the community meeting previously scheduled to begin after conferences. Also, the PTO will not be providing childcare during conferences.
For parents: if you feel ill in any way, we ask that you please not attend conferences. For parents who are ill or do not feel comfortable attending, teachers will make themselves available for a telephone conference. If you will not be attending but would like to have a conference with your child's teacher, please contact that teacher.

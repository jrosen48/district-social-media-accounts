December 4, 2018 at 2:50 PM ·

As we're seeing Gorge roads and trails open back up, here is a heartfelt story from behind the scenes.

Last year, the Hood River Valley High School girls' soccer match with Hillsboro High was rescheduled due to smoke from the Eagle Creek Fire. At the rescheduled match, Hillsboro surprised our team with a $500 donation to help our community rebuild post fire. Kevin Haspela, our soccer coach, then challenged our girls to double the donation. They ended up raising $1,330 to bring the total to $1,830. The team selected to donate funds to Crag Rats Search and Rescue, Hood River County Fire & EMS (with funds earmarked for Wildfire Prevention and Urban/Wildfire Interface Evacuation); and the Cascade Locks FISH Food Bank to support families, food pantries, and businesses adversely affected by the fire.

But that wasn't enough for them! This year, the Hillsboro High girls brought a $1,500 donation to our match. These two rival teams have now donated at least $4,000 to fire relief in the Gorge! Our team also spent a day volunteering with Trailkeepers of Oregon.

PROJECT PROGRESS
Aerial photo showing a recent concrete pour at May Street Elementary School in Hood River, Oregon. This new school is currently being built on the southern end of the existing property. Students will end this school year in their existing building and start the 2019-2020 school year in their new building.

While the new May Street Elementary School is being built, Wenaha is actively coordinating and executing renovations/upgrades at other Hood River County School District facilities. Those facilities include Westside Elementary School, Parkdale Elementary School, Cascade Locks Elementary School, Mid Valley Elementary School, Pine Grove Elementary School, and the District Maintenance Yard. We look forward to the continued partnership with Hood River County School District!

Did you make any New Year’s resolutions? Here are some we can get behind!

1. Attend school on time, every day.
2. Make time to read each day.
3. Try a new activity, club or sport.
4. Set a goal to get good grades. If you're struggling, talk to a teacher.
5. Spend time organizing your calendar and binder.
6. Make your classmates’ day with a daily random act of kindness!
7. Parents, ask your child something specific each evening, like “Who did you hang out with at lunch?” or “What was the best part of your day?” These targeted questions will get a better response and drive a more meaningful conversation.
8. Parents, find a new way to get involved. Volunteer with clubs, sports, site councils, PTOs, SMART reading, tutoring for AVID, etc.

Last year, the Hood River Valley High School girls' soccer match with Hillsboro High was rescheduled due to smoke from the Eagle Creek Fire. At the rescheduled match, Hillsboro surprised our team with a $500 donation to help our community rebuild post fire. Kevin Haspela, our soccer coach, then challenged our girls to double the donation. They ended up raising $1,330 to bring the total to $1,830. The team selected to donate funds to Crag Rats Search and Rescue, Hood River County Fire & EMS (with funds earmarked for Wildfire Prevention and Urban/Wildfire Interface Evacuation); and the Cascade Locks FISH Food Bank to support families, food pantries, and businesses adversely affected by the fire.

But that wasn't enough for them! This year, the Hillsboro High girls brought a $1,500 donation to our match. These two rival teams have now donated at least $4,000 to fire relief in the Gorge! Our team also spent a day volunteering with Trailkeepers of Oregon.

A year ago, the kids in Cascade Locks were evacuated by the Eagle Creek fire burning in the Gorge. This summer, we spent the day with 30 kids and visited the charcoal forests along the Pacific Crest Trail.

Like the forests, the kids are young, resilient and full of life.

Please LIKE and SHARE this film with your friends.

Thanks to the wonderful teachers and kids in Cascade Locks for inviting us out to spend the day in the woods. And thanks to Mark Larabee from Pacific Crest Trail Association, Brenna Bell, Mia Pisano and Ember Summer from Bark, Caroline Park from Thunder Island Brewing Company, Aurora Del Val, Hood River News, Apricot Irving and many others for participating in this special day in the woods.

Thank you for your patience as we navigate morning drop-off for the first few days of school. In an effort to make it less congested in the parking lot, we are going to try to divide drop-off into two rows. We anticipate that this will move much quicker within the coming weeks.

***If your child is in 3-6, please pull down the middle row and a staff member will meet you at your car, take your child's temperature and guide them into the building.
***If your child is in UPK-2, please pull up in front of the school where a staff member will meet you at your car, take your child's temperature and guide them into the building.
***If you have children in multiple grades, please pull into the UPK-2 lane in front of the school.
***If you have UPK/K students, you are welcome to park in the parking lot and enter through the kindergarten side doors, or if you feel that your child is comfortable, you can pull up to the school and we will help them in.

Please remember that drop-off is from 8:45-9:00

Dear Hoosick Falls Students & Families,

Our apologies for the delay with the 2020 yearbooks. Our yearbook production facilities were impacted with COVID-19, and were shut down for some time. Since we have reopened, we have been limited by state mandates around social distancing and cleaning requirements, and other restrictions around people working in manufacturing facilities. We are printing yearbooks, but are simply faced with a backlog currently. Mr. Viera and the yearbook staff met their deadlines, and in a normal year, you would have the yearbook.

Hello All,

I regret to inform you that our 2020 little league baseball and softball season is canceled. We as a board have decided that it is in the best interest for everyone involved to not have a season and to put safety above all other things. We would like to thank all of you for being patient during this time and allowing us to make the best decision possible. We would also like to thank everyone who signed their child or children up and to all the volunteers and sponsors who were willing to help out as well. Everyone will be given a full refund...please just be patient we will get them to you as quick as we can. We are sorry for the boys and girls who would have been graduates this year but your career is not over and we wish you all the best in the future. We hope to see everyone back next year and it will be great to see our young boys and girls playing ball again. Stay safe everyone and we look forward to seeing you all next year.

Hoosick Falls CSD Campus Access Guidelines – Hoosick Falls CSD

Hoosick Falls Central School
April 30 at 12:24 PM ·

As our Hoosick Falls CSD community continues to mourn the loss of Coach Ron Jones, we have had many visitors to campus, specifically the football field. We are touched by the outpouring of compassion that our community is sharing. We are all hurting over this sudden loss of a beloved and respected colleague.

While our school and fields are public property, at this time our campus is closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we anticipate that community members will want to continue to visit the field so they can pay their respects to Coach Jones. HFCSD wants to make sure our community has access for that purpose, but we also need to make sure that everyone observes social distancing protocols.

PLEASE READ these guidelines via the link below for information about when it is okay to visit and how that should be handled: http://hoosickfallscsd.org/hoosick-falls-csd-campus-access-guidelines/",3.0,"🐾 Please remember social distancing even during our time of mourning.

Hello Folks,

I have set up Google Classrooms for UPK-K-1-2-3 Music, and 5/6 Chorus. Please follow the instructions below to join.

1. Go to classroom.google.com

2. Enter your child’s HFCS email which is their last name and first initial i.e. connollyr@hoosickfallscsd.org (you have to use @hoosickfallscsd.org) and click next.

3. Enter your child’s password, which is their Lunch pin number, two times i.e. 12341234

4. Once logged into your child’s account accept the invitation to the classroom.

5. Once you accept, click on the class name and you will then have access to the classroom information!

6. Some students have siblings with the same first initial. In that instance please try their last name followed by the first two letters of their first name i.e. connollyr might be connollyra. If you have any problems then please send me an email connollyr@hoosickfallscsd.org and I will provide further assistance.

In the late 1940s, Florence ""Midge"" Jones had to leave Hoosick Falls Central School to help care for her family. Proudly admitting she will be 92 next month, the one thing Midge has said she would have loved was to get her high school diploma. With that, our hospice team quickly got to work. VNAHSR Hospice Chaplain, Melissa O'Brien reached out to the current principal, Michael Hall and with a little research into Midge's schooling at HFCSD he, the Board of Education for Hoosick Falls School and the Superintendent were proud to present her with her long-wished diploma. Friends, family, her husband Tom, Melissa O'Brien and many of her friends from VNAHSR, surrounded her at this joyous and tear-filled moment.

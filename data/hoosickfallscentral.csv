Fall Sports 2019 sign ups are now being held in the Nurse's office. This is strictly for the coaches to have an idea of what their team will look like. In July, you will still need to make sign up official by using Family ID.

Parents/Guardians, THIS WILL BE THE ONLY TIME PHYSICALS WILL BE OFFERED FOR FALL SPORTS.

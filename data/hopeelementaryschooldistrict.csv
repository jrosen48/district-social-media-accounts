The next week starts a new chapter in public education. There is a huge learning curve that students and teachers will be navigating together.
As we embark on this thing called ‚ÄúDistance Learning,‚Äù I am asking you to refrain from publicly scrutinizing your children‚Äôs teachers/schools/district for the way they are teaching or the lessons they are assigning.
Please offer grace to your child‚Äôs teacher and other school personnel. I promise that educating your children is still our #1 priority. ‚ù§Ô∏è
They are about to navigate unchartered waters with little, to no prep time. This is a crisis, not a time to be playing armchair quarterback. They love our kids and will be doing their absolute best!

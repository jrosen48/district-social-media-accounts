Thank you to a number of members of our community who have reached out to me tonight concerning comments made on Facebook by a district staff member. I have initiated an immediate investigation into this matter and am making it my highest priority at this time. While it is a personnel issue and I cannot comment specifically on the details of the investigation, I want all HCPS stakeholders to know the core beliefs of our school system. We are fully dedicated to an organizational culture that honors diversity, inclusivity, equity, social justice and liberating our students and staff from all systems of oppression. As such, we take very seriously any actions by an employee that are not in line with these non-negotiable values. We appreciate your patience while we swiftly conduct a thorough investigation.

Hopewell High School - Black History Month Celebration 2020",0.0,"HHS held their Annual Black History Month Program to pay tribute to the rich origins and history of the African culture. Contributions that are, and will forever be, a dynamic part of our America today. The program was diverse, celebrating all the parts of the African-American culture, from an original rap song by Anthony Crawford and Josh Williams, to a number by the Jazz Band. The stage was also filled with spoken word, cheerleaders, African dances, step team, and vocal solos!

Distinctive Unit Insignia, more commonly known as Unit Crests, can be dated as far back as 1902. Unit Crests show the official coat of arms authorized for units in the United States Army. Unit Crests are designed by the Army's Department of Heraldry and reflect the heritage of each unit. Special thanks to The Kiwanis Club of Hopewell for their donation to support our acquisition of these Unit Crests! Very few JROTC programs have their own Unit Crests and we would not have been able to do this without our community's support.
Blue and yellow are our school colors. Blue symbolizes loyalty; yellow suggests excellence. The blue bend alludes to Hopewell’s location along the James River.

Hosting this special event was none one other than, HHS alumni, Eiizjarae Dillon; who hosted this event previously. Starting the show was an incredible Annie act, performed by Sonia Valencia. The last act of the night was a Whitney Houston act, performed by Cheritta Ruffin; a show stopper. Taking the 1st place trophy for the second year in a row was the multi-talented, Kiante “Kiwi” Paige. Second place went to Cheritta Ruffin while the 1st and 2nd runners up were Sonia Valencia and Naneriz Pineiro.

HHS held its 3rd annual Lip Sync Battle this past weekend. There were countless acts that spoke determination into the audience. Students came up with their own choreography and left their marks on the HHS auditorium stage. Hosting this special event was none one other than, HHS alumni, Eiizjarae Dillon; who hosted this event previously. Starting the show was an incredible Annie act, performed by Sonia Valencia. The last act of the night was a Whitney Houston act, performed by Cheritta Ruffin; a show stopper. Taking the 1st place trophy for the second year in a row was the multi-talented, Kiante “Kiwi” Paige. Second place went to Cheritta Ruffin while the 1st and 2nd runners up were Sonia Valencia and Naneriz Pineiro. The group performance by Dymond Davis, Cathryn Kyles, Alysah Pollard, and Shamora Waterman won the Crowd Favorite award. (Submitted by: Myra Brooks, '21)",2020-02-04 14:59:00,,

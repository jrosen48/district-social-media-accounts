The ultimate goal of the Anti-Racist Task Force is to create a new Anti-Racist District with educators dedicated to creating environments that elevate students and staff of all backgrounds.

Are you someone who lives in, attends school in (including our 6 Hopkins Schools sites), works in, or visits the City of Minnetonka? Kissy Coakley Minnetonka City Council & Hopkins School Board Chair Jen Bouchard want to hear from you!

As we collectively navigate a global pandemic and a global uprising for racial justice, we must engage in truthful and robust conversation about what we want our Minnetonka community to be like now and moving forward.

We’ve created a collaborative process for engagement and idea generation this summer, which will result in a list of community recommendations that we will share with our respective elected bodies - the Minnetonka City Council and the Hopkins School Board - in September.

Will you join us in this urgent, hopeful work?

The weather forecasts for tomorrow (February 7th) are ever changing, and how it will impact Hopkinton remains uncertain. However, the nature of this particular storm may result in an early dismissal and I want you to be aware of this possibility to give you time to have a plan in place. Should we decide to dismiss early tomorrow, we will follow the Early Dismissal Schedule that is used the day before Thanksgiving. That is, no lunches will be served, and dismissal would take place as follows:

High School 10:45 AM
Middle School 10:45 AM
Preschool No Preschool
Hopkins 11:25 AM
Center 12:10 PM
Elmwood 12:10 PM

I will make a decision regarding whether or not an early dismissal is required before 9:00 AM tomorrow morning and you will be alerted through our district’s listserv and emergency notification systems.

The weather forecasts for tomorrow (February 7th) are ever changing, and how it will impact Hopkinton remains uncertain. However, the nature of this particular storm may result in an early dismissal and I want you to be aware of this possibility to give you time to have a plan in place. Should we decide to dismiss early tomorrow, we will follow the Early Dismissal Schedule that is used the day before Thanksgiving. That is, no lunches will be served, and dismissal would take place as follows:

High School 10:45 AM
Middle School 10:45 AM
Preschool No Preschool
Hopkins 11:25 AM
Center 12:10 PM
Elmwood 12:10 PM

I will make a decision regarding whether or not an early dismissal is required before 9:00 AM tomorrow morning and you will be alerted through our district’s listserv and emergency notification systems.

Respectfully,

Cathy MacLeod, Ed.D.

While I had planned to hold off on this decision to determine the possibility of a delayed opening for Wednesday, I have learned that it will not be possible to have the roads cleared sufficiently at any time tomorrow morning. We anticipate a regular schedule for Thursday.

Keep safe, everyone,

I have been in touch with the Superintendents in surrounding towns, town officials, Transportation and the Department of Buildings and Grounds. We have notified the transportation department and Principals that bus students will enter the buildings as soon as the buses arrive. Given the predicted weather pattern, conditions will not change enough to warrant a delayed opening.

It will be important for students to dress appropriately for the weather.

Introducing A Facebook Guide for Educators and Community Leaders
Today, we are releasing the Facebook for Educators and Community Leaders Guide , a new resource that helps adults be supportive partners so that teens make safe, smart and responsible choices throughout the online world.

Today’s teens were born into a digital world. They are connecting, sharing and learning through the latest advances in technology. This is creating a vibrant world full of interactivity and learning, where young people make new things and connect in ways that enrich their lives in the classroom and in their communities.

By all accounts, teens are mindful of how to behave and interact using social media. Still, the adults in teen’s lives – the parents, the educators, the community leaders -- need to be supportive partners, assisting teens as they navigate safety, privacy, digital literacy and citizenship. That means that they need to understand the digital world – and Facebook, in particular.

The Facebook for Educators and Community Leaders Guide provides resources to help you do that. The guide includes a focus on:
Digital Hygiene and Digital Citizenship – The guide features expert resources from the Family Online Safety Institute’s Platform for Good initiative as well as resources from WiredSafety on how to engender digital citizenship and literacy among teens.Mobile – ConnectSafely.org provides guidance on the impact of mobile technology on safety, so that adults can consider the best ways to guide teens.Developing Guidelines – Many organizations are developing social media policies. Our partners at Edutopia – The George Lucas Educational Foundation -- have provided guidance on how to develop these policies and guidelines, for the classroom and for community organizations.
Thank you to the many organizations who helped us develop and distribute this guide, including the Family Online Safety Institute, WiredSafety, ConnectSafely.org, the Girl Scouts of Northern California , the PACER Center , Edutopia, the U.S. Council of Catholic Bishops , Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America , and Cartoon Network’s Stop Bullying: Speak Up initiative .

Finally, thank you to author and parenting expert Rosalind Wiseman – author of the newly released book, Masterminds and Wingmen – for her tips for adults on how to engage with teens in the social media world. Take a look at her Facebook Story released today.

Safety is an ongoing conversation where everyone plays a role – parents, educators, teens, policy makers, and all members of the community. We hope you take advantage of the guide and stay tuned to the Facebook Safety Page to participate in the conversation.

“Government and responsible corporate citizens alike have an interest in teens being smart and safe when using social media.  But it is fundamental that parents understand social media and their teen’s use of social media and that they help their teens make safe and informed choices.   The Facebook for Educators & Community Leaders Guide is a guide to help parents, teachers, and community leaders do just that.”
--Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen, President, National Association of Attorneys General

“PACER’s National Bullying Prevention Center hears from thousands of students and their parents every year who have been bullied. With this excellent guide by Facebook, parents and educators can take an active role in helping to keep students safe from bullying while they’re online. Social media has allowed for many new and exciting opportunities for children and teens, but parents and educators need to become active participants in order to encourage responsible digital citizenship and safe online practices.”
--Paula F. Goldberg, Executive Director, PACER Center

""We're seeing more and more schools and districts create social media guidelines to help teens and educators navigate the digital world in a safe and effective way. This new guide, developed by Facebook, comes at a perfect time for parents, educators, and community leaders.""
--Elana Leoni, Director of Social Media Strategy and Marketing, Edutopia

“Religious communities are about relationships. So is Facebook. We’ve found our collaboration with Facebook on developing sound, holistic and ethical standards to be particularly helpful. According to the latest research, teens understand privacy and how to control their information online. From religious leaders to parents, the adults in our teens' lives need to be just as fluent as teens are in order to provide guidance. This new guide, we hope, is the first of many tools that will encourage religious leaders, parents and others concerned about our children’s welfare to utilize Facebook as a positive force for young people.”
--Helen Osman, Secretary of Communications, US Conference of Catholic Bishops

""This guide is both practical and timely.  Educators and youth leaders are keen to find ways to safely and productively engage teens in social media.  The resources in this guide will help steer kids away from negative behaviors, while directing them to the best uses of Facebook and encourage good digital citizenship.""
--Stephen Balkam

""Our teens turn to their educators and community leaders for guidance on important life issues. This simple and comprehensive guide makes it easy to understand and provide guidance to teens about using social media to lead, become empowered and improve their world, safely, effectively and securely.""
--Parry Aftab, Esq., Executive Director, WiredSafety.org

""We look forward to adding the ""Facebook for Educator's and Community Leader's Guide"" to Cartoon Network's STOP BULLYING:SPEAK UP list of resources.  The new guide offers concise information to adults working with young people; providing clear, accurate direction on the appropriate use of social media.""

“Government and responsible corporate citizens alike have an interest in teens being smart and safe when using social media.  But it is fundamental that parents understand social media and their teen’s use of social media and that they help their teens make safe and informed choices.   The Facebook for Educators & Community Leaders Guide is a guide to help parents, teachers, and community leaders do just that.”

“Religious communities are about relationships. So is Facebook. We’ve found our collaboration with Facebook on developing sound, holistic and ethical standards to be particularly helpful. According to the latest research, teens understand privacy and how to control their information online. From religious leaders to parents, the adults in our teens' lives need to be just as fluent as teens are in order to provide guidance. This new guide, we hope, is the first of many tools that will encourage religious leaders, parents and others concerned about our children’s welfare to utilize Facebook as a positive force for young people.”

Today, we are releasing the Facebook for Educators and Community Leaders Guide , a new resource that helps adults be supportive partners so that teens make safe, smart and responsible choices throughout the online world.

Today’s teens were born into a digital world. They are connecting, sharing and learning through the latest advances in technology. This is creating a vibrant world full of interactivity and learning, where young people make new things and connect in ways that enrich their lives in the classroom and in their communities.

By all accounts, teens are mindful of how to behave and interact using social media. Still, the adults in teen’s lives – the parents, the educators, the community leaders -- need to be supportive partners, assisting teens as they navigate safety, privacy, digital literacy and citizenship. That means that they need to understand the digital world – and Facebook, in particular.

The Facebook for Educators and Community Leaders Guide provides resources to help you do that. The guide includes a focus on:
Digital Hygiene and Digital Citizenship – The guide features expert resources from the Family Online Safety Institute’s Platform for Good initiative as well as resources from WiredSafety on how to engender digital citizenship and literacy among teens.Mobile – ConnectSafely.org provides guidance on the impact of mobile technology on safety, so that adults can consider the best ways to guide teens.Developing Guidelines – Many organizations are developing social media policies.

School starts on Wednesday, August 15th! Here are a few important notes:

1. If your student will be riding the school bus, please give the Youngstown City Bus Garage a call THIS WEEK to see what bus number and location your student will be having this year. The number for the bus garage is (330) 744-5905.

2. Please remember to write a note stating how your student will go home on the first day of school and how your student will go home normally. This is important for the teachers to know!

3. Homeroom teachers are now posted on the lobby windows.

4. If your student gets dropped off by the school bus at a location other than your residence (grandparents house, Boys & Girls Club, etc.), PLEASE stop up to the school to fill out the alternative transportation papers so we can send those to the bus garage in time for the first day of school!

4. If you need to stop into the office, our hours are still Monday-Friday from 9:00AM-3:00PM.

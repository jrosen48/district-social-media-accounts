As we get ready to honor our senior class in a most-unusual ceremony, please make sure you read through the attached graduation ceremony program so you know what to expect.

The condensed version:
- Seniors will line up on Pioneer Rd. @ 9:45a.m. on Saturday, May 30
- The parade to school will begin at 10 a.m.
- Unless you have a parking pass (reserved for the graduates' friends and family), you will not be allowed to park in the main parking lot. This is to ensure that family and friends have the best view of their graduate. Please join us in lining the highway and cheer, yell, and wave for the graduates as they pass by.
- All slideshows, speeches, and the graduation ceremony itself will be filmed and posted here on the school's Facebook page. The speeches will be posted in the morning BEFORE the ceremony begins, so you can view them at your convenience.
- Any questions should be directed to Alex Mayer, senior adviser. Her email is mayera@hsbschools.org.

www.hsbschools.org",4.0,"Late last week, Governor Little released his “Idaho Rebounds” plan for re-opening the state. In his plan, statewide social distancing restrictions, including restrictions on gatherings of 10 or more people continue through the end of May. The Governor's plan, together with the Idaho State Board of Education's re-opening criteria that states, ""No statewide or local social distancing restrictions..."" can be in place before schools can re-open, unfortunately make it clear that returning to school this spring is going to be impossible, and remote learning will have to continue through the end of the 2019-20 school year.

The Idaho State Board of Education met today to discuss whether or not to extend the soft closure (the initial soft closure extended through April 20). The board’s decision was to extend the soft closure indefinitely until re-opening criteria established by the Idaho State Board of Education have been met.

So what does this mean? Will students return to the classroom this school year, or will they not? The answer to this question looks like it all depends on what happens going forward in regards to the COVID-19 threat. The State Board of Education is going to create a set of criteria that must be met before schools will be allowed to re-open, and that criteria will be shared with us next week. While we are all hoping and planning on the return of our students as soon as possible, we are also preparing for the soft closure to last through the end of this school year (May 28), and we would recommend that parents also prepare themselves for this possibility.

The phoenix is a mythical bird from ancient legend. It would fly for hundreds of years before landing and bursting into flames. From those ashes, the phoenix is reborn to start a new, long life.

Middle school is where a lot of kids leave behind their old selves and become young adults. Like the phoenix, our middle schoolers make this change by choice, knowing that they need to leave their old ways behind and start new ones.

At A+UP we work with students on their ownership. They understand that they need to develop self-control in order to manage their habits and behaviors into ones that will help them become who THEY want to be.

A+UP faculty work side-by-side with our scholars and their families, helping them to find and develop their voice. We love watching our scholars become empowered people who will help themselves, their families, and their communities.

""Social distancing"" is a terrible way to describe what we should be doing. A colleague of mine pointed out to me that the goal is ""physical distancing"" and that it should be described as such. When we say ""social distancing"" we are creating the secondary reaction in our brain that we should stay socially separated from others--no eye contact, no nods, no social interactions.

That is not who we are as people. We are social animals by nature and design. And many of us (especially kids) are having horrible and silent reactions to this social distancing that accompanies the physical distancing.

What is our program? It's a mix of 51% academics and 49% character development. We know that middle school years are rough. Simply put, even kids who have many advantages on paper are still 13 years old. And that's not easy for them.

Our approach starts with an understanding that every kid is good at heart. The next 3 years are all about helping that child become a young woman or young man.

Our program can do this with you and your child.

Yesterday, we chanced upon an intriguing group of middle school students and their teachers from A+ Unlimited Potential, a Houston area charter school. The group was taking METRORail's Redline to a wellness class at 24 Hour Fitness - Elgin & Louisiana, TX. It was so neat to learn that these kids experience an incredibly hands-on learning environment which does away with the brick and mortar walls of a traditional school. Instead, the city is their backdrop for learning. Their ""classrooms"" being museums, parks and universities! An impressive group, the kids were polite, inquisitive and excited about learning! #RideHoustonMETRO",0.0,"Thank you Houston METRO for helping us break down classroom walls and pave new pathways for learning!

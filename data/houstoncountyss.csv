You may have heard about a pretty awesome announcement that USDA released yesterday. While we are VERY excited about the opportunity to serve our community with free meals, we have not been given a start date for when this will officially go into effect.

Because of this, tomorrow's meal service will continue as usual where student's accounts will be charged based upon their meal status eligibility/enrollment.

Once we are given the official start date, we will let you all know immediately with full detail.

We wanted to share a few things we were able to learn from our first pizza pick up last week to help the process be a bit smoother:

Please roll your windows down as you approach the line. We will be visually verifying the number of children in the car, and some windows are a tad dark to see through.

We are grateful that local law enforcement was on hand for traffic control. They have asked for families to come closer to 4:00 so that traffic is not backed up onto the streets.

We have increased the number of pizza packs available at each site, however, it will still be a first come first serve basis.

We are so glad to hear such a positive response about our upcoming Pizza Pick Up. We were well prepared to continue our regular service through May, and have plenty of pizza on hand. However, quantities will be limited to the number we can store at each site and we will have more available on the next date.

We also have multiple types of pizza, including cheese, pepperoni, buffalo chicken, and even some personal pan pizzas. The assortment will vary at each location.

All pizzas will be frozen. Cooking instructions will be provided attached to the box.

Meal packs will be given based on the number of children in the car. 1-2 children will receive 1 Pizza Pack, 3-4 children will receive 2 pizza packs, and so on.

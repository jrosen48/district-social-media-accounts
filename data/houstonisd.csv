Join us for the opening of our first Virtual Senior Show from our Visual Arts department featuring the work of Leah Clemons, Gabrielle Lansangan, and Evelyn Wattenbarger. Prepare your favorite drinks and enjoy your favorite at home hors d'oeuvres.
One of the highlights for seniors at Kinder HSPVA is a culminating performance or art show celebrating the four years of work that every student has created. Because of the transition to virtual learning, many of our seniors did not have that experience.
For our Visual Arts students who did not get to have a physical Senior Show, some have created a virtual show that will be able to celebrate their work with friends, family and the community.
“Looking Glass” celebrates the work of three seniors and represents how all of us interpret lives through our own eyes and our own art.

• Gabrielle Lansangan – will study Biology at University of Houston
• Evelyn Wattenbarger – will study Biomedical Mechanical Engineering at University of Ottawa next year",0.0,"Join Kinder HSPVA today at 4 pm on Facebook for their first HSPVA Visual Arts Virtual Senior Show. Celebrate the hard work of these amazing students!

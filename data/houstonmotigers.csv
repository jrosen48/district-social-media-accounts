The City of Houston is proud to announce that in partnership with Joe Ward Photography, and Houston School District we have finally placed a banner of every graduating tiger in our downtown.

We received all of the banners this morning and by this afternoon we were able to place every banner we received. If you notice that there is a senior that is missing please contact us and we will get it placed as soon as possible.

The amount of community spirit that our businesses and residents have is another reason why we love our small town. Without all of you and your continued support, we couldn't have made this possible.

Congrats to the 2020 TIgers we are all very proud of you! Once a Tiger-Always a Tiger!",9.0,"City of Houston Missouri

We are asking our community to assist Bright Futures Houston and the Houston R-1 School district with the donation of snack treats to be served to students during MAP and EOC testing. For the remaining month of March and during the month April. We will use our bucket locations to collect the items or people can drop items off at any of the offices at the school.

The list below is not a comprehensive list but it is good for suggestions. If you would like to make a monetary donation for this cause you may contact Glenda Jones at 417-499-3570 or at brightfutureshouston@gmail.com we then would make the purchase of snacks.

Granola Bars
Fruit Snacks
Peppermints
Mini Chocolate Bars
Capri Suns
Individual Bags of Chips
Individual Bags of Cookies (i.e. Oreos, Chips A-Hoy, etc.)

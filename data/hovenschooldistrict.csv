COVID-19 Update
September 8, 2020

Data on cases in Potter County has started to trend in the right direction. In the last four days, our county had only one new confirmed case and in that time there have been nine recovered cases.

Currently there are ten (10) active cases of COVID-19 in Potter County and our community spread has been reduced to Moderate. We do not have any new cases of staff or students at the school.
Good signs for our school and our general health. üëèüèΩüëçüèº

All signs are leaning to us staying in our current Level 1--GREEN stage as long as this trend continues.

To update our school community, Potter County is currently identified as SUBSTANTIAL community spread. As of today, there are no new cases since Sunday, with 11 active cases in the county. It is thought that many of the cases are from the Southwest portion of Potter County, but this is unverified.

In conversation with the majority of staff today, we feel that keeping with our LEVEL 1--GREEN mitigation strategies is appropriate. We did have a few students today wearing masks and this is certainly a personal choice that we will support. We encourage you and your families to take the necessary precautions to help keep everyone safe. We hope this is an isolated wave of events, but we will continue to monitor the situation and let you know if anything changes. Thanks for your support.

Cases in Potter County Increasing
August 29, 2020

We are keeping a close eye on the rising cases in Potter County. In a little over a week we have gone from just a couple of cases to a total of 11 cases, with 8 of those 11 current active cases. Seven of the eight active cases have come in the last three days.

Since these cases are not known to be in the town of Hoven and because at this time we have no active cases in our school, we will stay at LEVEL 1-GREEN for now as we compare the numbers within our school community. In addition, the SDDOE also has our spread level as MINIMAL, which aligns with our plan to stay in GREEN.

Considerations may be given to a move to YELLOW if necessary. A school board meeting will take place on September 8, so we will wait and see what the next week brings and determine if we may need to move to YELLOW shortly after the Labor Day Weekend.

We will continue to monitor this situation daily and will keep you posted if anything changes.

Thank You.

Did you conduct a Student Symptom Screening Check this morning?? We ask that parents remember that if you child is sick, STAY HOME!!

We had several students who indicated they did not do a screening today. Yikes!

Students were reminded today to make sure this is being done at home prior to school. Save this image to your phone and please make sure to take your temperature each day and stay home if you have any of these symptoms. Your role in keeping your student home if they are not healthy helps us make sure we can keep our school open.

Let's make sure we all join together in keeping our students healthy, happy, and in school.

Holy Infant Hospital in Hoven, SD was built in 1943 and was a 45 bed facility. This structure has personal meaning for me as I was born in this hospital in 1959.

Sadly, the hospital was forced to close in 2010 due to the inability to sustain itself financially. In a odd twist of fate, a few years after the hospital closed, the Hoven High School building was consumed in a fire.

The closed hospital served as the the temporary high school during the construction of the new high school. The first picture of the collage was the hospital building when it served as a temporary high school.

Since the new school was built the hospital building remained abandoned. My research did not indicate whether the building has fallen to the wrecking ball. Hoven was trying to find a new use, but indications were the old hospital was going to be demolished.",2.0,"Monte Schatz‚ÄéSouth Dakota History of Cities, Towns, places and people who made it great!

Sarah says her favorite part of student teaching has been interacting with the middle school children. She says ""They can be such a blast!""

When asked, Sarah says she is #taggedtoteachag because ""I don't come from an agricultural background, I was a military brat. However, when I joined FFA I found that I loved biotechnology, horticulture, and that led to discovering other interests I had in agriculture. I also love creating DIY projects with my family. Teaching was a career I was always interested in, and Ag Education seemed like the perfect fit.""

This week, our Student Teacher Showcase is on Sarah McClure! Sarah is student teaching and is from Hoven, South Dakota!

Sarah says her favorite part of student teaching has been interacting with the middle school children. She says ""They can be such a blast!""

When asked, Sarah says she is #taggedtoteachag because ""I don't come from an agricultural background, I was a military brat. However, when I joined FFA I found that I loved biotechnology, horticulture, and that led to discovering other interests I had in agriculture. I also love creating DIY projects with my family. Teaching was a career I was always interested in, and Ag Education seemed like the perfect fit.""

Good luck Sarah with the rest of your student teaching experience!",,,

K-5 PARENT PICKUP

Elementary K-5 Parent Packet Drop-Off and Pick-Up is ready to go for tomorrow Friday, March 27 from 7:45 AM-4:00 PM!!

Come to the front doors of the high school in the foyer to drop of completed work and pickup your child‚Äôs/children‚Äôs learning packet for next week. Your child‚Äôs teacher should have sent an e-mail about pickup tomorrow.

I know we have some hard working teachers who are still putting packets together, but they will be there in the morning ready to go!

If you participate in the lunch program, that would also be a great time to get your packets! We will serve Grab and Go lunch from there as usual.

Thanks everyone!!

March 24, 2020

Thank you to you and your staff for all you‚Äôve done over the last two weeks to support students and families. In these unprecedented times you‚Äôve made quick shifts in your delivery and opened access to your resources in heroic ways. I appreciate your willingness to do what‚Äôs been needed as we‚Äôve lessened the impacts of COVID-19.

School closures and social distancing are helping us flatten the curve and ensure our healthcare facilities are able to provide essential care. Our modeling suggests that the impact of this virus will be felt for months, not weeks. It‚Äôs possible that our COVID-19 cases will peak in May here in South Dakota.

Because of this, I am asking you to continue your practices of the last two weeks and keep schools closed through Friday, May 1st.

A decision has been made to postpone the remainder of the Girls 'B' basketball tournament in Spearfish.

Per the SDHSAA:

""At the request of Governor Noem, the remainder of the SDHSAA Class B Girls Basketball Tournament is postponed. In addition, all SDHSAA state basketball tournaments for next weekend, along with the Visual Arts competition, are also postponed. The Student Council Convention, all Region music contests, and All-State Band scheduled for later this month are canceled.

This is a difficult decision and comes amid constant conversation and information sharing between the SDHSAA, the Governor‚Äôs Office, and the Department of Health. We will evaluate the future of the postponed events in concert with those same entities. The safety of everyone involved is our foremost concern, followed by exploring all options to provide the student-athlete with the opportunity to finish their season.

We thank everyone for their patience and understanding in a very difficult time, and we apologize for any inconvenience that this may cause."" - Dan Swartos, SDHSAA Executive Director",0.0,"SDPB Sports

Today at around 11:45 AM our fire alarm system was activated and our fire alarm monitoring service contacted 911 and the Fire Department was dispatched. I want to report that this was a FALSE ALARM and there was no damage or concerns to anything at the school.

I want to thank the Hoven Fire Department for their quick response and for Mark Weber for arriving at the school to assist in the situation in the hazardous weather conditions we are having.

Thanks everyone and I hope you all stay safe and warm this weekend.

We just wanted to make sure everyone knows that the Hoven School District will begin classes today at the regular time. Snow accumulations have not impacted roads significantly and wind speeds are low. However, the wind chill is currently -16 below zero with temps in the single digits. Please make sure you bundle up this morning and if you are walking to school, consider wearing multiple layers. I thought that sharing this little graphic again would be helpful.

Thanks everyone and we will see you at school on time!

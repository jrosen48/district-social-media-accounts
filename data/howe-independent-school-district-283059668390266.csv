Some exciting news from Howe ISD Superintendent, Kevin Wilson!!

We have a contract on the Summit Hill property for the site of our new Elementary/Primary School!!! It is a 15 acre tract located on the NW corner of Summit Hill Pkwy and the US 75 service road (just north of the entrance to Summit Hill housing development). While nothing is final until closing, we are very happy to have identified the site and begin the final stages of site plan development.

Our timeline is going to be very tight, but we are still on track for an August 2019 opening. Cross your fingers for a good old-fashioned hot and dry Texas summer so we can move dirt in July/August without rain delays.",2.0,"Bulldogs 4 Bulldogs

News Release -
America’s high school students are graduating at a rate higher than ever before, and new data from the U.S. Department of Education shows the same is true for minority students. Nearly every racial and ethnic subgroup has seen a growth in graduation rates that outpaces that of white students – a sign that the achievement gap is incrementally closing. Specifically, in two years the graduation rates for black and Hispanic students increased by 3.7 and 4.2 percentage points respectively, compared with 2.6 percentage points for white students.

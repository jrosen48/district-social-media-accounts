We end the week with our 3 of our Comets making the All Decade Teams for Boys & Girls Track.

Of course, none other than Stephen Ogochukwu Mozia, Class of 2011, making 1st Team on the All Decade List.

A multiple time All-American at Cornell, the U.S. Junior shot put champion and the Nigerian record holder in the shot put, throwing in the 2016 Olympics.

Before that he starred at Hackensack, placing second twice in the shot and fourth in the discus at the state Meet of Champions. He won a group title, and was second in the high school Nationals in the shot. He ranks fourth all-time in the Bergen shot (63-8¼) and second in the discus (187-11).

Also making the list are:

CONROY WALKER, Class of 2010, (100-200-long jump)

AMARYS BERRY, Class of 2016, (shot put/discus)

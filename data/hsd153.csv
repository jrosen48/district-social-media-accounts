Please note that there is an added “School Wish List” that shows for each school, when you sign in to order your child’s kit. These are extra items that the schools would greatly appreciate donations of, for this upcoming school year! As always you can customize your kits for your learning experience.

Please note that there is an added “School Wish List” that shows for each school, when you sign in to order your child’s kit. These are extra items that the schools would greatly appreciate donations of, for this upcoming school year! As always you can customize your kits for your learning experience. Even if you are 100% remote, having some supplies around will be helpful!
This is a service that Homewood PTA provides, just to make life a little easier. Order online and have the kit shipped directly to your house, it’s that easy!",2020-08-07 05:40:19,,

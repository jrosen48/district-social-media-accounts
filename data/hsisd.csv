Please notice that lines for 2nd ‚Äì 5th grades are in the bus lane instead of the parking lot. This will allow us to keep the kids under cover closer to the buildings.

We will not allow cars to enter the bus lane until the buses have left at 3:30. So there is no need to arrive early as you will not be able to enter the bus lane.

Please have patience with us and fellow parents.

Due to the forecast we are adjusting the Elementary car lines for Thursday, August 27 ONLY.

We have attached a map of the updated lines. A copy will also be sent home today in your child‚Äôs folder and emailed to all Elementary parents.

Please notice that lines for 2nd ‚Äì 5th grades are in the bus lane instead of the parking lot. This will allow us to keep the kids under cover closer to the buildings.

We will not allow cars to enter the bus lane until the buses have left at 3:30. So there is no need to arrive early as you will not be able to enter the bus lane.

Please have patience with us and fellow parents.

We, along with other area schools, are monitoring the weather situation closely.

Please contact the Elementary if you have any questions, 903-639-3881.",2020-08-26 11:54:50,,

So great to be back in my box tonight! Something normal for me was so sorely needed. We quietly hosted a closed event in which I got to announce our senior softball and baseball players and allow them to walk a final time across the diamond since they never got to properly say goodbye.

Make sure to check out our broadcast of the sports awards tomorrow at 7:00 and senior scholarship awards Saturday at 7:00.

Governor Issues Executive Order that Includes Statewide Closure of Texas Schools

Gov. Greg Abbott announced today that he has issued an executive order that aligns with the standards set by the president and the Centers for Disease Control. The order, which is effective at midnight Friday, March 20, through midnight Friday, April 3 (and subject to extension) requires:

‚Ä¢ all Texas schools to temporarily close, but offer online or other learning options to students
‚Ä¢ all Texans to avoid gatherings of 10 or more people
‚Ä¢ all bars, restaurants, food courts, and gyms to close

The governor said that this is not a shelter-in-place order. It does not prohibit people from leaving their homes or from traveling domestically. All critical infrastructure will remain open; government entities will still provide essential services.

In light of this, HSISD will not open until Monday, April 6, 2020!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2550391188560413&id=1700604336872440,,0.0,"March 19, 2020

This is special, as my Senior year (1976-1977) was the first year for Girls' Basketball at RHS. We started something and these girls are marching now to State. I was on the team that first year, but only remember playing in 1 game and shooting for 1 basket, which I missed. That's OK with me. I was part of something new and special.

Our girls are competing in the Elite 8 Monday night at 7pm in Dekalb. To help cheer on our girls, we are arranging a fan bus for students. The cost is $9 per student and money needs to be turned in before school starts Monday morning. (The $9 covers the $8 entrance fee to the event and the transportation to and from the event). Starting at 4:30 there will be free pizza for those students who ride the bus. The bus will be departing from school at 5 p.m. We anticipate it returning to school between 9:30- 10 p.m.
Make sure you sign up and pay before school Monday if you want to go cheer on our Lady Rams.

*In addition, we also have a fan bus going to Rock Falls on Tuesday for the Wrestlers. The cost is $7 and sign up needs to happen by 8:10 Tuesday morning. The bus will leave at 5pm.

HAPPY ARBOR DAY!!! We would like to congratulate Lila Johnson of Frankfort on winning the state Arbor Day Essay contest. Her essay is below...

Old branches sway down by the river. My favorite tree on the farm is home to eagles. On our farm, we call it the Bald Eagle Tree. The tree has been through a lot from fires, floods, drought, and many more. It has also watched my farm grow from small to big. The tree has stood tall and strong for a long time. The eagles have a huge nest to have their young. Every year, the eagles fly away but they always come back. The baby and its parents will fly around while we plant our fields. The tree watches the eagles fly. If a storm comes, the tree will protect them. If the tree were to die, everyone would be sad. But the tree protects them through it all. That's why I think people should plant trees. Trees are very important.",0.0,"Spink Conservation District

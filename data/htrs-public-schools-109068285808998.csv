To effectively address the COVID-19 outbreak, HTRS is doing everything possible
to keep our students and staff healthy. It is our goal to keep our school open unless
the State of Nebraska government agencies issue a mandatory closure. However, to
address health concerns, we will be implementing the following guidelines.
‚Ä¢ All vendors and delivery persons will be screened by our school nurse before entering the building.
‚Ä¢ Parent drop off and pick up will happen outside the main entrance. HTRS staff
will be present to assist in this process.
‚Ä¢ The Fitness Center will be closed to the public until further notice.

HTRS has implemented these guidelines and will continually evaluate and communicate
updates. We want to be proactive rather than reactive when it comes to the safety
of each of our communities and those at risk. We appreciate your understanding and

If you've been keeping up with the HTRS Lady Titans basketball, you may know we've been having a decent season. So right now I want to give a huge shoutout to a few of our girls.

Katilyn Glathar is sitting 4th in the state (out of ALL classes, A-D2) for Double Doubles, and 7th for Rebounds

Carissa Allen in sitting 7th for Double Doubles and 18th for rebounds

To give you an idea of what the means, Husker Volleyball Recruit Kalyn Meyers from Superior is #1 in both areas, and we're 4th and 7th out of the entire state.

These girls are doing amazing, and couldn't do it without their teammates behind them.
We still have a lot of the season ahead of us so come cheer us on!!

Our focus this year is being kind to one another and there are some mean things going on this weekend. The HTRS staff cares deeply for all of our students and unfortunately the result of these behaviors get brought back to our environment after the weekend. This damages the positive climate that we have been working so hard on.

The best advice we can give to parents is to block those that are engaging in this type of harassment. However, sometimes parents don‚Äôt always know what is going on.

Every year we have a speaker come in to talk about using social media responsibly and how to use it to build one another up instead of tear each other down. It seems when the weather changes there are more reports of this.

HTRS does have resource officer Lyle McMann who spends a day or two a week with us at school and he has also had some informal conversations with kids on this topic. Please let us know how we can help.

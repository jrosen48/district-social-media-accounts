My greatest high school accomplishment is passing freshmen year.

Most memorable moment in high school is coming back to Hubbard and making jokes on the wrong day.

Advice I’d give my underclassmen: Don’t let nobody hold you back.

Message to my classmates: Surprised I could do it?

My favorite class was Spanish because what happens in Spanish stays in Spanish.

My favorite thing to do on the weekends is making memories.

After high school I plan to start a new chapter.

In ten years I see myself sitting on success.

Thank you, Mrs. Cuevas, for pushing me to be a better kid and a man. Thank you for having high hopes for me. That keeps me moving. Thank you to Ms.Griffin for getting me started on a new life and helping me turn around.

I love listening to music, especially Family First by Lil 2z.
I also like watching That 70's Show on Netflix.
I love Body Armor and going fast.

I could live without social media, spiders, and people who judge from looks.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2920386661349094&id=725333587521090,,0.0,"SENIOR SPOTLIGHT 2020

Deysy Avelino

Daughter of Zoe Avelino

Nicknames: Pollo, Flaca

HighsShool Activities/Accomplishments:
Performing the Heroic Act of CPR

Most Memorable Moment in High School: Working with Mrs. Fletcher in the Greenhouse

Advice I Would Give My Underclassmen: Stay in School, and Don’t do Drugs ( Literally).

Message to My Classmates: Don't worry over the little things in life. Life is a journey. Trust every step you take.

Mrs. Fletcher's class was my favorite because she was always so sweet.

My favorite thing to do on the weekends is pending time with my family.

Plans After High School: Stack my bread.

In 10 years I see myself having a big carne asada in my own backyard with my whole family dancing to some Cumbias, enjoying life.

S/o to my girls , my sister and my mom for being my 2 best friends in this world. Without you guys life is meaningless, and I promise to leave you something big before I leave this world .

Favorite Bible verse : “ If anyone is not willing to work , let him not eat “-Thessalonians 3:10

Advice for the underclassmen: Have fun, and make memories!

Message to My Classmates- I hope you all accomplish your biggest dreams and have fun while doing it.

My favorite class in high school was Mrs. Smithey’s Anatomy and Physiology class because she made it fun.

My favorite thing to do on the weekends is ride horses, rope, and hunt.

After high school I plan to become an EMT or an Ag teacher.

In ten years I see myself bringing up old memories at our ten year reunion.

Thank you to my family and teachers for pushing me and inspiring me.

I loved reading Little Britches, playing with all of my nieces and nephews, riding a horse at dawn, and working.

School Administrators,

Thank you for your patience as we work to navigate this ever-changing and unprecedented situation. As the situation stands, all UIL contests are suspended through March 29 due to COVID-19. As new information is released, we will continue to make informed decisions and provide amended plans as we have them.

We have received several questions concerning rehearsals, practices and spring football. At this time, all rehearsals, practices and workouts conducted outside the school day, as well as spring football, are postponed until March 29. This means that no rehearsals, practices or workouts outside the school day can be conducted during the time period of March 16 through March 29.

In the case that spring football is canceled altogether, football workouts would resume on August 3rd and teams would be able to add an additional scrimmage.

As this is a rapidly changing situation, please look for future correspondence from UIL.

Thank you,
Jamey Harrison, EdD
UIL Deputy Director

Do you/your child have what it takes to take on the wings of the Junior Eagle? Junior is the Hubbard Eagle's sidekick, known to be 'his little brother' who attends various sporting events at Hubbard Middle School and even some High School varsity games! The intent of the Junior Eagle program at Hubbard School's is to get those younger students interested and trained for when it comes time for High School and the passing of the previous Hubbard Eagle mascot performer. This audition should be a fun experience where you can submit a video of you showing your school spirit while staying at home!

Due to COVID-19 cancelling Easter events, The Hubbard Eagle, along with Hubbard School Administration and Mayor Ben Kyle, would like to bring some Easter Joy to the children & families of our community with a physically distancing compliant visit from the Easter Bunny himself.

Our Hubbard Eagle and the Easter Bunny will drive through the streets of Hubbard this Saturday, April 4, 2020 from 10:00a.m. – 4:00p.m. We invite the entire community to participate by decorating your front windows or lawns to signal the Bunny. Then, be on the lookout for the Hubbard Eagle and the Easter Bunny as they drive through your neighborhood.

Hear a police siren coming up your street? Don’t be alarmed! We will be having a police car escorting them to let our streets know that we are on our way.

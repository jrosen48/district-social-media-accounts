Tomorrow at Our Saviour Lutheran Church in Hudson there will be free produce available in front of the church after 11:00 AM.

During these difficult times we realize our local food establishments are being hit hard. We want to thank Boot Jack Tavern and Hudson Subway for generously giving to help others even in the midst of their own struggles. Don‚Äôt forget to thank them when they open again!

Please do not pick over the produce. We are trying to reduce contact. Drive in, take what you need, and go.",0.0,"United Hudson Churches

Lincoln Students‚Ä¶

Tis‚Äô the season to spread Christmas cheer, be proactive & synergize to collect non-perishable food items for the Hudson Food Pantry!

Here is how we will do this‚Ä¶

Bring in non-perishable food items, for example: canned food, pancake mix, tuna etc.
If you send in items for the pantry you will decorate an ornament at school then‚Ä¶

On Thursday when we watch a movie together in the gym, bring your ornament & you can help decorate me like a Christmas Tree!

We look forward to giving back to our community this holiday season! Let‚Äôs make it our goal to completely cover me with decorations!

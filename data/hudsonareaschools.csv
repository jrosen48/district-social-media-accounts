Lincoln Elementary Classroom Supply Lists!

Hello Lincoln families...attached to this post are the supply lists for each grade level.

Kindly keep in mind, our Phase 4 Return to School Plan states we are working hard to keep students safe & healthy and in minimal contact in all areas. With that as a goal, we are asking that students keep their supplies to themselves. Our staff will be helping and supporting this mindset in every way possible to keep our students safe. Having back-ups for supplies is a great idea to proactively plan for!

We certainly will support you and your child everyday while at school with everything they need. Your support with this is also greatly appreciated!

Stay, safe, healthy & connected!

Next week I will be talking about some different sites that offer free books to view and listen to. If you do not already have a Hudson Carnegie District Library card, you can sign up for one online! There is a program called Bookflix that is great for our students! Bookflix has books to read and listen to, along with vocabulary and other games.

The directions for getting a library card online are as follows: go to the website: www.hudsoncdl.org there is a green banner below the library picture. One of the selections is : Library Catalog. If you click on that, there is a new page opening up and on the right hand side there is a large square that says Library Card Registration....Sign up for a library card today!! If they fill this form out, we will get back with them with their new number and passwords the following day or two.

I have been on the varsity bowling team for 4 years and I went to states for individuals taking 5th place in our regional. I was first team all conference my junior and senior year and won the blast-off tournament my junior and senior year. I bowled a perfect 300 back on November 17, 2018. I been on the varsity baseball team for 3 years and was on that run when we went to the MHSAA finals as a freshman. We ended up being the runner ups. I was an all-district catcher last year and been on a team that has won 3 district titles in 2017, 2018 and 2019. I also been on a regional champion team in 2017.

Rachel Sallows Stiverson has some wonderful 2' x 3' banners with grommets for seniors to purchase to place in their front yards for $20 each to help families celebrate their senior. All she needs from parents is a picture and $20. She is taking orders until Tuesday at 4pm then she is not going to be able to offer this price any longer. The price will go up. She is not making any money on the sale of these banners. She just wants to give parents an opportunity to celebrate their senior.

Hey guys Mrs A here üëã- This week in honor of Spring we made bird feeders for our crafty art project.üê¶
Everyone picked some items we had around the house and turned them into a feeder. Milk container, water bottles, popsicle sticks, tin cans, toliet paper rolls etc. Be creative.
Make your own feeder and then count how many different kinds of birds it attracts. We have counted 12 different species of birds, some squirrels, and a chipmunk

Post a picture of your feeder in the comments.

Also if you want to learn more about birds visit the Facebook page- Window to the Wild

Hello families!

We have another resource that will help DK-8th grade students stay connected while having some academic support as we continue to navigate through these unchartered waters. üí¶

Thank you Brian-Heather Harper for sharing the website. Attached to this post is a family letter from ‚ÄôAge of Learning‚Äô with a code to connect to 3 sites...

ABC Mouse: Dk-2nd
Adventure Academy: 3rd-8th grade
Reading IQ: DK- 6th grade.

They are having issues still with ABC Mouse- once I receive further guidance how to connect I will pass that info on. The other two sites I tested & they work! Yay!üôåüèª

Hudson's winningest coach, Coach Chris Luma, Class of 1977, has announced his retirement. Chris was quarterback during Hudson's legendary football Streak where the Mighty Tigers won 72 straight games between 1968-1976. He began coaching in 1982, and became head coach in 1997. Over the course of his outstanding 22 years as head coach, Hudson's win-loss record was 180-70, including 5 undefeated regular seasons. He led our team to 13 LCAA titles, 5 regional championships, and the state championship in 2010. With a record like that, it is no surprise that he was inducted into the Michigan High School Football Hall of Fame in 2017.

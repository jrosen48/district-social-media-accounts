There has been a lot of discussion around April break and the end of year.

Many people would like to work through April vacation and get out of school earlier in June, when we might have the ability to be more active.

We also have heard from many people that really need a break. Their circumstances mean more work and more stress with remote learning.

The school board made two decisions tonight.

Days to Hours
The school district is shifting from counting ‚Äúdays‚Äù to total hours. That changes the last day of school from June 18 to June 10.

April Break
After much discussion and public input, the board made the decision to shorten April break.
April 27 - 28 will be vacation days.
April 29 ‚Äì May 1 will be school days. Wednesday, April 29 will be a TAB day.

This moves the last day of school to Friday, June 5.

It was awesome to welcome your kids back to Jamestown Upper. Our staff was so eager to be back with them and there are so many positives to take from day #1. You can see students here taking one of their safe mask breaks while socially distancing outside. The wall of staff pictures with masks on and off helps our students to recognize us either way.

You read that right.

Unfortunately, ALL the water bills got printed with the water usage of a large downtown account, which means when you open up your water bill, it's going to say that you owe $3,000.

KCI recently printed and mailed The City of Hudsonville‚Äôs Water/Sewer Bills.

There was a clerical error made by KCI on these bills which is no fault of City of Hudsonville. KCI takes full responsibly of this error made and has added quality control checks to help so it does not happen again.

Your water bill is wrong.

You read that right.

Unfortunately ALL the water bills got printed with the water usage of a large downtown account, which means when you open up your water bill, it's going to say that you owe $3,000.

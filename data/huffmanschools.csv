HHS Seniors and Parents,

Due to the current statewide restrictions enacted by Governor Abbott’s executive orders, we will, unfortunately, have to make changes to our May 30th graduation ceremony plans. The May 30th ceremony date has been canceled.

We will instead hold our traditional graduation ceremony on Saturday, June 27th, still at Ford Park in Beaumont, at 4:00 PM.
We are happy to report that we will still host the 2020 prom as planned for our seniors at the Chateau Cocomar, but with a change in date to Friday, June 19th. Ms. Pack will be sending out information soon with more details.

As we prepare for both events, we will continue to monitor the orders and guidance issued by the CDC, Governor Abbott, and both Harris County and Jefferson County (Beaumont) officials so that we can ensure that we are able to move forward with these events, and that we do so in the safest manner possible.

Today we celebrated Big Art Day in Huffman, Texas! We had plenty of art activities going on in our Huffman ISD community.
The Hargrave High School Art Club and advanced art students taught a cross curricular literacy and art lesson to 1st graders. This week was Dr Seuss’s birthday so they read Fox in Socks and then created Fox in Socks themed art. Both the Hargrave High Schoolers and the Huffman Elementary 1st graders from Mrs Cobbley’s class had a great time teaching and learning from each other.
We also had our Hargrave High School students create positive designs around the Huffman Elementary School campus. They created a mural and made designs in different bathrooms from PreK to 3rd grade.
Finally along with help from Huffman Middle Schoolers we painted ceiling tiles for and representing Huffman EMS to be used at Memorial Herman Northeast ER room.
Our students had a wonderful time spreading art awareness, positive inspiring messages, and art for all of our Huffman community to see.

It was a beautiful and cold day on Lake Sam Rayburn. Our Falcon Anglers had 14 boats competing out on the lake. All fought hard for 8.5 hours and 11 managed to walk across the stage, keeping 100% of the fish healthy and alive for release. Our Falcon Anglers are some of the most dedicated kids I know.

The Hargrave Bass Fishing team as a whole, came in a respectable 3rd place out of 21 schools. This is calculated from a cumulative top 3 weights for each school. Hargrave’s top 3 teams were AJ and Luke Tabb, captained by Jeff Jackowski; Evan Mainord and Blake Turner, captained by Catfish; and Rustin Mueller, captained by Albert White. They all had limits and together, had a total weight of 35.91 lbs.

HCOE Education at Work and Student Events would like to invite you to view the annual Gary Robert's Industrial Technology Showcase of Excellence 2020 in its first ever VIRTUAL format.

Traditionally this event takes place in late May or early June as a way to celebrate high school Industrial Technology students in woodworking, metal, architectural design/drafting, industrial prototyping, and automotive technology. Students are nominated based on passion for their trade, pride in workmanship, innovation, and work ethic.

This year teachers were encouraged to submit projects/students they wanted to showcase ""virtually"". A big thanks for those teachers who participated! Please take a moment to view the slideshow and celebrate the excellent work of the teachers and students in these wonderful programs.

Update as of Tuesday at 5:15 p.m.
According to PG&E representatives, “Due to diminished weather conditions, Humboldt County is now beneath the wind threshold for a Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS).” The information we are receiving from PG&E is that Humboldt County is no longer in scope and will remain with power throughout the evening. Continue to be prepared for future outages and follow updates from the Humboldt County Office of Emergency Services (OES).

There are still communities in Humboldt who have not been restored from the previous PSPS. PG&E advises they hope to re-energize tonight.

At this time the National Weather Service does not foresee any weather patterns that would result in a PSPS event in the near future.

This release is intended to update the public on PSPS activity information provided by PG&E. This office is not able to guarantee the accuracy of the information provided and the public should consider this release as general information and be prepared for a PSPS event that may have different timing and/or duration than predicted.

Hey, Humboldt. Good news and (mostly) bad news.

Good news:

-We have received a weather “all clear” for this weekend’s wind event.
-PG&E will begin restoration efforts in areas of Humboldt County as conditions allow.

Bad news:

-A second wind event is forecast to begin at 6 a.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 29.
-PG&E is looking at another Public Safety Power Shutoff prior to the beginning of this weather event.

Be prepared:

Based on PG&E’s latest information, we expect a small window of time between restoration from the current outage before powering down again on Tuesday.

During the window, we suggest:
-Restocking emergency supplies including medication, food, water, fuel, etc.
-Charging all devices.
-Making arrangements for medical needs.
-Signing up for Humboldt ALERT at humboldtgov.org/alerts
-Following @HumboldtCountyOES on Facebook and Twitter for the latest information.

Keep in mind, the information and weather is ever-changing, and we are giving you information as soon as we get it.

HUGE congratulations to Michael Davies-Hughes, Assistant Superintendent Educational Services at Eureka City Schools, for not only qualifying for his next RAAM (Race Across America) race (June 2020), but coming in FIRST PLACE in the qualifier, Race Across Oregon, this past weekend! The qualifier was a 1,000 km loop course with nearly 50,000 feet of climbing! In June 2018, Michael and his Team Red Dragon competed in his first RAAM and, in doing so, raised $30,000 for the Early Literacy Program. For his June 2020 RAAM, Michael will be fundraising for Hopecam, which uses technology to connect children undergoing treatment for cancer with their friends at school. It has made a difference in the lives of 2,000 cancer-fighting students nationwide. Michael will be racing each day in honor of a named child. Eureka City Schools greatly appreciates Michael’s dedication to bettering the lives of children, both at work and in his personal life. Congratulations, Michael, and happy training! Only 326 days until RAAM! (Photo Credit: Race Across Oregon)",2.0,"We are all rooting for you, Michael!

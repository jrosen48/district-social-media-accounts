I love living and teaching in a small, supportive community where I am privileged to sponsor the HNHS Riley Dance Marathon team. These kids work year round to raise awareness and money for Riley Children's Hospital. They are creative, kind, talented, and selfless. Although we would have loved to have held our actual dance marathon to celebrate the achievements of these kids and to reveal the money raised for Riley, today we are celebrating 6 ft. apart via social media. The HNHS RDM team far surpassed their goal of $8,000. We could never have accomplished this without the help from the Huntington North High School faculty and staff, the Huntington County Community School Corp. along with the community of Huntington. How much did we raise? Take a look at our Reveal Video!",0.0,"That's AMAZING!! Congrats to our RDM team...all of your hard work paid off!!! So proud of you all!!

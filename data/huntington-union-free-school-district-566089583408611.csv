No pandemic could stop the kids and staff at Jack Abrams STEM from concluding the first full year of the school's House program (modeled after Hogwarts House in Pottermore) with an exclamation point.

Students were assigned to houses randomly at the beginning of the school year during an invigorating ceremony. Teams met periodically throughout the year to plan, develop their brand and associated cheers, and engage in service-related activities.

Each house is built on an important virtue ...

Altruismo - House of the Givers
Amistad - House of Friendship
Isibindi - House of Courage
Reveur - House of the Dreamers

It truly came down to the wire, but this year's winner is ... you'll need to watch to the end to find out. (In actuality, all students and staff are winners for participating in the program with tremendous energy and excitement!)

News 12 reports ...

A 9-year-old go-kart driver has been extremely driven to help out during this pandemic in a big way.

Huntington's Darren Krantz Jr. started racing just two years ago with the logo for Angela's House all over his vehicle. It's a cause very dear to his family -- it works with hundreds of medically frail children every year.

""I just wanted to help the kids at Angela's House to make them feel better,"" says Krantz.

A little over a month ago, Krantz asked people to donate any amount they liked for every lap he raced. All of the money would go to buy food for Angela's House.

The result -- a tractor-trailer filled with food. Darren's dad says they raised over $50,000.

""I feel good about all the laps - because every lap I feel happy about it,"" Kratz says.

They plan to deliver the food to Angela's House Friday.

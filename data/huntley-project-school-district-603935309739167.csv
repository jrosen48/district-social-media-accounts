For Remote Learners: We are establishing our support systems and we look to have our educational setting by September 8 to be consistent with MTDA. WE may have some staff begin earlier. If you need devices please email mbranger@huntley.k12.mt.us to set up a time and pickup location.

Activity Access-

If a student is a remote learner they CAN participate in our activities. This is a change to adjust to the needs of our students. Please contact Mr. Tim Bastian at tbastian@huntley.k12.mt.us if you have any questions.

Lunch-

Any remote learner that needs lunch, Monday through Thursday, should email Marlene Krum at mkrum@huntley.k12.mt.us to let her know you need lunch. The meal can be picked up from 11:00-11:15 at the JH door entrance.

We will have meals available for the student's normal standards in our school setting. This means if a student is free and reduced the meal is free or reduced but if they normally pay they would need to pay the normal fee for that meal. http://edne.tw/n659201",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2082232421909441&id=603935309739167,"HUNTLEY.K12.MT.US

The Huntley Project School District will be suspending the free summer meal program until further notice. The continued suspension is due to a person testing positive for COVID-19 who was in/around the HP kitchen. We have been advised by several health organizations, and the OPI, that our kitchen employees may have been in contact and must quarantine. The result is a suspension of school meals until further notice. All our staff has tested negative but safety is a necessity.

We are continuing to develop plans for providing meals through alternative means for the summer meal program. We will notify the community when we have service resuming. Unfortunately, this may mean no service for the week of June 29-July 2.

We will send new information as soon as we get an action plan and details of support. We apologize for the inconvenience.

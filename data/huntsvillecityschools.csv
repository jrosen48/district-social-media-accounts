Welcome Mrs. Jessica Donahue to our Whitesburg Elementary family as one of our 1st grade teachers!
This year will be Mrs. Donahue’s fifth year teaching. She is so excited to continue teaching first grade after spending the last three years teaching in Mobile, AL. Born and raised in Huntsville, she and her husband have just moved back after 8 years away. Although she is still a Bama fan, she received her Early Childhood Education degree from Auburn University.
When She is not teaching, she enjoys reading, photography, watching Netflix, cooking, being outside, traveling, and spending time with friends and family (especially her husband Heath and very spoiled dog, Ellie).
Mrs. Donahue states she loves teaching because of the relationships she gets to build with so many fun, awesome kids and the chance to see their knowledge and character grow!
She can’t wait to kick off a great year as part of the Whitesburg team! @huntsvillecityschools #atthewb",0.0,"Whitesburg Elementary

Shout-out to Sonnie W. Hereford III Elementary School. When we took our Youth Tobacco Prevention program to an assembly of fourth, fifth and sixth graders, a lot of the students wanted to know what they could do to get family members to stop smoking or vaping.

We always tell kids to be respectful but also let their loved ones know they’re worried about them. Trained counselors at 1-800-QUIT-NOW can provide the support to kick nicotine addiction.

As businesses in Alabama open up under relaxed public health orders, access to childcare is becoming a greater concern for working parents.

The Huntsville/Madison County Chamber is partnering with the Alabama Partnership for Children (APC) and others across the state to learn how the parents/guardians of young children are navigating childcare during the Coronavirus pandemic.

🦁 Whitesburg Elementary Hero Highlight🦁: Michal Massey is originally from Tuscaloosa and moved to Huntsville to play softball and receive her teaching degree from the University of Alabama-Huntsville. She has taught 1st grade, 2nd grade, and PE at Whitesburg Elementary (PE is her favorite because she gets to play ALL day long.) She also coaches volleyball for Whitesburg Middle and softball at Grissom High. She married her wonderful husband in 2018 and has two great pups. She loves being active, still enjoys playing softball, going on runs, and pretty much any outdoor activity. She loves playing with and taking her pups, Sadie and Nelli, on long walks. She also enjoys spending time with her family. She has 5 brothers and sisters, and they are a very competitive bunch. She loves teaching and coaching because she gets to be with her kids all day. She states she could never work with only adults, she is too much of a kid herself 😊. #atthewb @huntsvillecityschools #hcstrong #hcsteacherappreciation",0.0,"Celebrating our Teachers!

Many of us at Common Sense are working parents at home with our families. As we talked about how we were all coping, we realized what we really wanted was a way to capture candid stories, recommendations, and tips for maintaining some semblance of ""normal"" in these very not-normal times.
So, we decided to launch a podcast, which we're calling Parent Trapped. Each episode will feature interviews with experts and tips on everything from making learning at home more fun to finding movies and shows the whole family can enjoy.
The first episode of Parent Trapped is live now.

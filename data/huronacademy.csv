Every year the Parent/Teacher Club (PTC) tirelessly raises funds for our school through many activities, programs and gatherings throughout the school year. This year, however, is very different. Due to covid-19 and restrictions from the state of Michigan, we are unable to put in place any gatherings or fundraisers until the end of the year. We will revisit any and all activities beginning in January 2021.

Even with these specific restrictions, the PTC is happy to announce that our fundraising efforts through the sale of Huron Academy spirit wear will go on throughout the school year. Please visit CuttingEdgeEmbroidery.com to place all your orders.

Thank you Huron family and friends for your understanding and support throughout the years and please bear with us as we navigate these rough times along with you all.

Respectfully yours,

Today is World Elephant Day!

In 2005, the Detroit Zoo became the first zoo to decide solely on ethical grounds to no longer keep elephants, and Asian elephants Winky and Wanda were moved to a sanctuary in California. In the decade since, many other zoos have made the same decision.

Learn more about the life journey of the last two elephants at the Detroit Zoo from Detroit Zoological Society Executive Director and CEO Ron Kagan, and enjoy his reading of the children's book inspired by their time with us.

Alright parents, there have been a lot of on-line 'tips' for eveyone as we stay at home. We talk a lot about the behaviour of the kids but let's take a moment and talk about yours....
Some of you may be ready for a little check in, so I made you a chart. That's right a chart for the parents! It's a check in to remind you that your kids take their lead from you. Just like we help the kids track what they are doing here is one for you. You can put whatever is important to you on your list. Writing it down and posting it will help you remember it in the moment when you are not at your best, cause you are human and trying to navigate this new reality.",0.0,"Parent's Sticker Chart ‚ù§

Mrs. Harkonen is Huron Academy's technology teacher for grades K-2. Many students, especially Kindergarteners are just beginning to use computers, iPads, and other devices. This is not an obstacle for Mrs. Harkonen. She has a great deal of patience and this shows in her kind and gentle manner. Mrs. Harkonen is truly vested in Huron Academy and we are proud to have her on our team.

Have you met Mr. Achs? Mr. Achs is in charge of computer classes at our Utica campus. Which means he teaches everything from Microsoft Office to video editing and web design. A jack of all trades, and master of most, Mr. Achs is known for his help throughout both buildings in terms of technology, being an advocate for digital literacy amongst staff, students, and parents (he has done many tutorials for our recent online learning procedures) as well as being a major part of our state testing. His devotion to student success is unrivaled, and his contributions to Huron Academy are immeasurable. Thank you for your great work Mr. Achs!

Improvements to the Lakeland athletic field and track are nearing completion, but the job is not done yet. While it may appear to be ready for use, the track in particular still needs to have lane lines and other elements painted on its surface.

Many activities are project based: using measurement to bake, researching a region of the U.S., writing letters and doing interactive projects and science experiments. He’s also encouraged students to use online platforms like Moby Max, Readworks, Think Central and Kahn Academy.

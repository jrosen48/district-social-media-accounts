Hello there-

I am the Director for the Council on Aging in Adams, the Adams Senior Center and we have a request if you'd be so kind to assist. Every weekday we hand out on average 30 Grab n' Go lunches to older adults within our shared communities. Everyday we see several of them smile, frown, wipe back tears and linger longer and longer each day.

We think your beautiful and kind children can help! We're hoping you might get your child, of ANY AGE, to draw a picture with or without a message. If you choose they can sign it with their age. Then if you could mail that image to the Adams COA at 3 Hoosac Street, Adams MA 01220 we would SO GRATEFULLY appreciate it! We plan to take one image a day, make colored copies and place them into their lunch bags each day.

We hope this will put smiles back on their faces, let them feel the connection to a greater part of the community they have lived in and supported each passing year. We plan to get a supporting turn out so really we only need one picture per child. If or when we need more, we'll reach back out.

I know what we’re going through could not have been envisioned, but I also know after participating in the event today that our community is as strong as ever. To our seniors, I admire your resilience and resolve to get through these last 11 weeks. It is difficult to remain focused and motivated with so much going on in the world around you. Despite the challenges, you made it to the finish line! You should be proud of accomplishing this milestone in your life and please know that we are all VERY proud of you. Congratulations!

Nordic Ski championships are moved to Thursday! Here are the reasons why it was moved....

· High wind of 50-75 MPH thru Monday night will continue to spread branches (small & large) on the trail system.
· Notchview will need at least thru Tuesday to clear the trails if not into Wednesday.
· Today thru Wednesday temperature are cold with wind chills forecasted to be in the single digits or below zero during that period.
· Chance of fresh snow Wednesday with temperature in 20’s on Thursday will provide the best conditions for the three dates noted for the MIAA Nordic Championship.

Happy New Year!!
On Wednesday the 19th, the HVHS Outing Club did a Solstice Hike/Thunderbolt Cafe on Mt Greylock with Mr. Koamaya and Mr. Lemeiux.

Seth, John, Aiden, and Erica hiked up the Bellows Pipe Trail from the Glenn to the 4 Corners where they stopped for hot chocolate provided by Mr. Lemeiux, who taught them how to use two types of lightweight backpacking stoves. The larger pot is on a stove that twists onto a small fuel canister and lights right up. The smaller pot is with an ultralight canister stove that uses denatured alcohol. He showed them a cheap alternate fuel source of Heet, a gas treatment to remove water.

This year in Introduction to Timber Framing we had the great pleasure of welcoming one of the most well known timber framing experts in the country into our classroom and shop. Jack Sobon teaches and lectures on the national and international circuit and just got back from 2 weeks in Sweden. This year Jack came to Hoosac for 6 sessions in the classroom and the workshop to share his extensive knowledge and to pass on his love of timber framing to our students. He literally ""wrote the book"" about timber framing that we use in our class and donated several other books he also authored for future classes. A great guy, Jack is also an Adams native and a Hoosac alum.",0.0,"Hoosac Valley High School

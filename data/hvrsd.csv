In light of the current uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 virus, the decision has been made to postpone the Hopewell Valley Parenting Conference scheduled for March 28, 2020. This was a prudent decision considering the possible health risks.

Plans to reschedule the conference in the fall are currently underway. The program will be identical, so those who have already registered will automatically be re-registered for the new date once it is established.

We would like to thank everyone involved in planning this conference for all their hard work over the last 18 months to bring this event to our community. As soon as a new date has been established, we will send an additional communication to the community.

In light of the current uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 virus, the decision has been made to postpone the Hopewell Valley Parenting Conference scheduled for March 28, 2020. This was a prudent decision considering the possible health risks.

Plans to reschedule the conference in the fall are currently underway. The program will be identical, so those who have already registered will automatically be re-registered for the new date once it is established.

We would like to thank everyone involved in planning this conference for all their hard work over the last 18 months to bring this event to our community. As soon as a new date has been established, we will send an additional communication to the community.

Sincerely,
Hopewell Valley Parenting Conference Partners

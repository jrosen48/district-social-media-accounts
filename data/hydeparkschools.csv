Juneteenth (also known as Freedom Day, Jubilee Day, and Liberation Day) is celebrated annually on the 19th of June in the United States to commemorate Union army general Gordon Granger announcing federal orders in the city of Galveston, Texas, on June 19, 1865, proclaiming that all slaves in Texas were now free. Although the Emancipation Proclamation had formally freed them almost two and a half years earlier and the American Civil War had largely ended with the defeat of the Confederate States in April, Texas was the most remote of the slave states, with a low presence of Union troops, so enforcement of the proclamation had been slow and inconsistent.

Our second project is new this year and was created by our Sources of Strength team, as part of their thankfulness campaign. The team has been collecting photos from students and staff that represent something they are grateful for. Senior Sandra Ksar and Sophomore Sarah MacEntee then spent time working together after school to create a display that not only displayed gratitude, but also focused on the foundations of the Sources of Strength program: Family Support, Positive Friends, Mentors, Healthy Activities, Generosity, Spirituality, Medical Access, and Mental Health.

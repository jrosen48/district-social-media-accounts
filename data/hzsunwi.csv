Horizon Elementary School collected 57 gallons of can tabs for the Ronald McDonald House – surpassing its goal for the 2019-20 school year of 50 gallons, even though school was closed in March. The collection was organized by Horizon custodian Deb Eder and collected by retired Horizon aide Cindy Lorenz & her husband, Burnie, who retired from the district maintenance staff. The Lorenzes, who have collected about 14,000 gallons of tabs over the years, said: “We want to thank Horizon Elementary School and families for collecting can tabs for our camping group!”",0.0,"Way to go Horizon!!

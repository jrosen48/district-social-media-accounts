Do you remember seeing recently, the I35 driveway paintings that were done for Seniors only? Well, we have decided to sell them to all Roadrunner fans within the Interstate 35 school district. We are charging $30 and will come out to your house and paint a red, white and blue sign on your driveway, sidewalk or any concrete surface. We have also sprayed on wood and mats. The size is 2 1/2 by 2 1/2 feet. When requesting one of these, we do ask that you make payment before hand. We will contact you once we have received payment. Then we will ask you to mark off the spot with tape, just in case you are not present when we come. You can mail your payment and contact information to Interstate 35 Booster Club, I35 Schools, Box 79, Truro, IA 50257. If you have any questions, please contact via messenger.

Hey everyone!

The I-35 elementary teachers really miss our classroom kiddos! We’ve been seeing posts about teachers driving through town to see their kids, and we decided we wanted to do that as well!

You can have your kiddos stand on the front porch or in the front yard and wave as we drive by! If you live out of town, it would be awesome if you could find a sidewalk or somewhere to stand in the nearest town, but we also understand the importance of social distancing during this time!

We plan to do this next Wednesday, April 1st.
Here’s the schedule:
1:00- Start in Truro
1:45- St. Charles
2:30 New Virginia

These are rough estimates on times, plan to be ready 10-15 min before and after.

Hope to see as many students faces as possible! ❤️",0.0,"Lexi Crozier

All I35 Girls Basketball Players. I have sent you a REMIND invitation through your school email. This is for all girls playing basketball this coming school year. PARENTS: if your daughter is 13 or younger, you may sign up for this also. I sent this out to 7-12 graders. Please take a few moments to sign up as this will be an excellent way to communicate with the entire program. I have also sent a message to all HS girls who have indicated they will be playing to join a REMIND group for the Hs team. I know Coach Reid has done the same for MS girls.",0.0,"Jeff Douglas

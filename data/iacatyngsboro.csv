Dear Parents & Guardians -
In the event that we adopt our hybrid model, half of our students will be coming on A days and the other half will be coming on B days. Families may need to have certain students attending school on the same day due to carpooling needs. We are already aware of siblings that would need to be kept together for the same days, so you do not need to include siblings for this survey. This survey is for you to indicate other students that your child will be carpooling with.

This information is needed for us to complete the scheduling process for all students. This survey will only be available until Tuesday, August 18th. Any request for changes to our A/B groupings after the 18th will likely not be possible unless there is a request from another family that allows us to keep the groups balanced.
You do not need to complete this survey if your child does not carpool with anyone.

Just a reminder that we are selling roast-to-order gourmet coffee AND tea as a fundraiser.
Giving Bean is a gourmet roaster with a variety of delicious whole bean and ground coffees, K-cups, gourmet cocoa, chai... artisan blended teas, and shortbread cookies.
It's Fresh! - not just the idea of selling something people consume every day, but all of Giving Bean's coffee is freshly roasted!
Easy support - A couple bags of coffee or tea bought by a supporter can go a long way to help us out!



Here is the fundraiser schedule:
Start Date: 1/31/2020 - forms handed out
Order Input Date: 2/21/2020 - orders dues in

Product Delivery Date: 7-12 business days after orders are due in.

Thanks in advance for helping to make this a successful fundraiser!

Please contact me with any questions.
Thank you,
Cindi

Today people around the world will come together to celebrate generosity and make an impact. On this Giving Tuesday, IACS has a goal to raise $10,000 to create a path to wellness here at school. With your help, we can make this a reality and we'll provide updates later on today about our progress towards this goal.

Your gift can also make TWICE the impact, thanks to a generous donor who will match the first $5,000 raised, dollar-for-dollar!

Donations of any amount will help our school continue to provide the excellent project-based education that drew you to IACS. No donation is too large or small.
A donation of $100 will help defray the cost of improvements to our trails and increase their safety and walkability.
A donation of $500 will fund one fitness or mindfulness station and will include sign recognition for your family or your business.

Make your tax deductible donation today!

You should have received a paper copy of the routes that we mailed home to Seniors last Friday. Here is a digital copy you can share with loved ones so we can fill the route from IAF to FIA with as many people as possible to cheer our Seniors on! Please note, that only one car per Senior is allowed in the first parking lot at FIA. We will have parking monitors there so they will be able to direct you and others that decide to join us on where to park.

Please expect to receive an email and letter mailed home regarding our COVID-19 plan. We HAVE to have a copy of this plan signed by each Senior parent. Once emailed out or you receive in the mail, you can print out, sign and take a picture of it and email it back to us at iaf@sabis.net or send us a picture of it on FB Messenger.

If we do not receive one by Thursday morning, expect to have someone get you to sign this at IAF while setting up for the parade.

Cumberland Elementary School (CCES) is in the process of getting new flooring. The school, which was built in 1996, still had the original carpeting. Flooring had been on the list of capital improvements for quite a few years, but was not able to be funded until last year. Replacement of the floor began May 26, 2020, and it is estimated that the new floor will be complete by late July, prior to the opening of school for the 2020-2021 year. Installers have already finished the front hallway and quite a few classrooms.

New new floor will be tile, which was selected because it is durable, easy to maintain, and easier to disinfect—which is now a major concern with the current COVID-19 outbreak. Tile is also better for students and staff members who have allergies.

Dr. Chip Jones, Assistant Superintendent, while inspecting the progress of the installation, noted, “It might be looking dreary outside right now, but it’s bright inside!”",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3340085032671301&id=243780738968428,,0.0,"CCES Gets New Floor

Good Afternoon,

The yearbook online order site has closed, and we are no longer be able to accept online orders for the 2020 Duke. The website is designed to switch over to in-person sales at the school once the book is sent for publication. The current situation with Covid-19 will only allow us to accept mail in orders at this moment.

The website closure coincides with the final change in the yearbook price to $50 per copy. Please send orders to the address listed below. Be sure to include a short message as to how many copies you are ordering and how much you are including as payment. For example: 1 Yearbook @ $50.

As soon as we receive a publication date, it will be posted here and the school will determine the best way to make sure those who purchased books receive them.

Thank you all for your patience, and we hope that everyone remains safe and healthy.

Sincerely,
The Yearbook Staff

We hope to have answers for you by Friday and develop a Frequently Asked Questions document for our staff, families, and the community as a reference. However, I can tell you now that we are committed to providing breakfast and lunch meals to our students for the remainder of the school year and will still hold prom and graduation ceremony for the Class of 2020 when it is safe to do so.

Mark your calendars: Thursday, October 24, 2019, CCES will host parent conference night with a twist! Not only will you have an opportunity to meet your child’s teacher to discuss progress and learning targets, but you will also have an opportunity to learn about many after-school, weekend, summer opportunities for CCES children. Did you know the YMCA is coming to CCES? Are you ready for the next round of recreation ball? Do you know all the events that take place at our public library? Have you ever checked out all that the 4H, Bear Creek, the Scouts have to offer? What is Girls Who Code?
You won’t want to miss this day. But that’s not all.... participate in a stem activity with your child. That’s right-Parent Conference Night is sure to please all when combined with Innovation Night AND our Community Partners. Join us from 4:00-7:00. Contact your child’s teacher for a specific conference time but everything else is Open House Style. Hope you can make it!",2.0,"Virginia Silveira Gills‎Cumberland County Elementary School

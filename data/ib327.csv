Late yesterday the IESA reversed its decision and will now allow fall sports including Softball and Baseball to happen. That means Illini Bluffs will have both sports and the tryout schedule is as follows:

Softball: Tuesday and Wednesday 9-11 at the Illini Bluffs Softball Diamond.

Baseball: Tuesday and Wednesday 4-6 at the Illini Buffs MS Baseball diamond.



All students will need a physical on file or bring it with you to the tryouts. Students will also need a mask for those times when they cannot social distance from one another.

I wanted to convey information regarding end of year dates.

The last day of school for seniors will be Monday, May 4th and the last day of school for all other students will be Monday, May 11th. We will be utilizing remote learning planning days and our unused emergency days from May 12 to May 22 which will only involve staff, not students.

More information specific to senior students and information in regard to picking up of student personal items and returning loaner Chromebooks, wifi hotspots, library books, etc. will be communicated out next week.

Undoubtedly, you have seen media coverage on the Coronavirus. A meeting was recently held with Jason Marks, Director of Emergency Management and Preparedness, from the Peoria City/County Health Department, the Peoria County Regional Office of Education, and superintendents from Peoria County. The purpose of the meeting was to educate the superintendents about this virus and to answer any questions.

At this point in time, there are no known cases of Coronavirus in Central Illinois. If it appears in our schools, it will be handled like any other virus has been handled in the past. This includes educating our students on the importance of hand-washing, staying at home when exhibiting signs or symptoms, and appropriate cleaning practices within school.

Good afternoon,

We are so excited about school starting tomorrow. Please remember that our health and safety depends on families and parents being honest and keeping their kiddos home if they have fever or are sick. Also, you are required to report to the school if your student has Covid 19. There is a list of three requirements that will allow your child to come back to school. For detailed information, review our reopening plan on the district website. We want to be able to stay in school, and you can help us make that happen!

We found several workout cards for you to choose from to get workouts in at home - some harder than others (you can find more on the internet). The truth is with these works as with any workout, you only get out of it what you put into it! If you want to add weights to some of the movements you can fill milk jugs with water, use old tires, cases of bottled water, etc. Be creative and be sure to share your ideas with others (if they work 🤣)!

Since we can't have practices, find ways to work on your skills by yourself or with your immediate family. You can always find places to run - so do conditioning workouts like we always do. Modified running (12 sec jog, 8 sec sprint), build-ups, ladders, plyo's, etc. Hit golf balls in your yard, play catch with siblings or parents, play tennis somewhere with your own equipment and with family, play basketball, etc., all while following government/UIL guidelines and recommendations 😬.

Let us know if you need anything out of the locker room and we will get it for you.

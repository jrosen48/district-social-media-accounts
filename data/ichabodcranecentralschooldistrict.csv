Alaina is a student-athlete who’s played on the Ichabod Crane Riders Athletics Softball and Indoor Track & Field Teams. She’s also been a member of S.A.V.E.

Alaina thanks and shouts out Mrs. Hebert and says in her own words: “ I wouldn’t have made it through high school without my girl, Mrs. Hebert. She always (and still will) took the time to help me out. I would be sitting at lunch, and she would come up and talk to me. She always made sure I was okay, I’m very grateful for all of her help. I’m going to miss her restricted study halls!”

She’s moving to San Diego this summer and will be attending a community college to major in business once settling down out there. Alaina would ultimately like to use a bachelor’s degree in business to own an ice cream shop of some kind.

During his time at Ichabod Zachary has competed on the Ichabod Crane Riders Athletics Football (Varsity) and Wrestling (Varsity) Teams. Zachary’s varsity wrestling career, in particular, has been noteworthy for his 22-17 record and for winning the Most Improved Wrestler Award.

He’s shouting out Mr. Farley as his favorite teacher for always making people laugh and keeping a positive attitude with his students.

Zachary thanks Coach Sarno for everything they’ve been through in the wrestling program, sticking with him when he felt he wasn’t the best and helping him overcome his toughest physical challenges.

Special guest readers included Primary School Principal Williams, Deputy Sam Plass, Superintendent Jason D. Thomson and many district parents. Primary School Librarian, Mr. Moss, wishes to sincerely thank all the readers who volunteered their time!",2020-03-13 12:25:16,,

The math department at IHS is hitting on all cylinders (haha get it)? They have totally restructured the whole department. There are kids who choose our math department over engineering classes. There is not any other math department around that can compete! They came to me and said they needed some things in order to do what they wanted to do, about $2500 worth. I told them we would find a way somehow. All of our textbook money was already spent, but we went to work finding money. Thanks to many special people and one business owner who wished to stay anonymous, we were able to get their entire wishlist.

The entire math department now has new doc cameras, web cameras, and new digital books and teaching material! Every kid can download their book 9-12! All of this to go along with the best math teachers in a 100 mile radius! Go Warriors!

Mr. Wyrick is truly one of the best teachers and most respected educators I have ever met! He is someone I have learned a lot from. I ask advice from him a lot. He has a classroom full of people. If you notice there is a laptop on his podium. Behind the screen of that laptop and through cyber space is virtual and blended IHS students attending class from home! Warrior Nation is on a roll! #getonthewarriornationtrain #jointhemovementatIHS",2020-09-01 11:54:07,,

However, I‚Äôd like to encourage parents to consider that most schools are going to offer a virtual option before you decide to enroll elsewhere. Schools are the hearts of their communities. Odds are your small-town, local school has invested in your children. Why not consider riding out this storm together.

‚ÄúMy name is A.J. Smith and I like choir because it‚Äôs a really fun program. One of the reasons I joined choir was to try something new, aside from sports. But if you're a 5th grader coming into 6th grade I highly encourage you to try out. Mrs. Clay is one of my favorite teachers and will make your first year awesome.‚Äù",2020-05-02 16:49:19,,

‚ÄúHi, my name is Emma Bundy. I'm in 7th grade and have been in Show Choir for two years and love it! I also enjoy band, horseback riding, art, and baby-sitting(I have six little sisters). I'm the third of eight kids, and also the second of seven girls. I love singing and dancing for Show Choir. Mrs. Clay is an amazing teacher and is so much fun. The way she teaches is encouraging and helpful. We also get to go to competitions. This is a great way to make friends and learn new things.

If you are interested in trying out, don't hesitate. If you don't try, you won't learn new things. If you want something, don't just sit back and wait. Take a chance! Reach for your goals! Follow your dreams! Keep trying and work hard.If you do this, you will succeed.‚Äù",0.0,"GO WARRIORS!

After being on the call with State Superintendent Hoffmeister then listening to Governor Stitt as he announced the phase 1 reopening of our state on May 1, I am optimistically ready to announce the dates for this year‚Äôs baccalaureate and graduation ceremonies. I have attached a flyer for each of these events and will be posting flyers for the other end-of-year events shortly. Please understand that circumstances could change due to this pandemic and the uncertainty that surrounds it. In order to put the safety of our students and families first, we will always follow CDC recommendations and the governor‚Äôs orders. At this time, I believe it is safe to schedule graduation in the summer. If things were to regress, we would look for an alternative way of having these events on the same dates. As of right now, though, we are scheduling a traditional graduation and baccalaureate service for the dates shown in the flyers. ~Principal Austin",0.0,"GO WARRIORS!

Attention 2020 Seniors and Parents:

Yesterday you should have received an email with a survey attached to it. This survey asks questions about graduation. I want to personally hear your opinion. Your voice matters to me, and I will do everything possible to make sure you are honored and get to have your special events that you so much deserve. Please take just a couple of minutes and fill out this survey. Make sure that you discuss these options with parents before making a decision. I will let you know the outcome of the survey as soon as it is completed.

Thanks,

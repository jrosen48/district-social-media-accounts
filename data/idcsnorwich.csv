We just received the following updates from the Connecticut State Department of Education:
Connecticut schools/IDCS will be closed until April 20. IDCS will be taking Spring Break from April 13 to April 17. Neither teachers nor students will be working this week or on Good Friday, April 10, which is a statewide holiday.
The statewide SBAC tests have been waived; consequently, IDCS students will not be taking this test.
I realize this is a very difficult and challenging time for everyone. The IDCS staff are working diligently to ensure that they are preparing and delivering student work as effectively and successfully as possible. Please contact your child's teacher if you have any questions about the school work. Please contact me if you have any general questions or concerns. We miss and love our students and our IDCS community!! Be well and be safe.

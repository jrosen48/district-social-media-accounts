Juneteenth, it is a commemoration of the day that slaves in Texas learned of their freedom. While President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed the emancipation of slaves on January 1, 1863, many slave owners ignored the order. However, on June 19, 1865 Union general Gordon Granger read federal orders to the last known Confederate slaves, freeing them two and a half years after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed. Imagine, years after slavery ended, they did not know that they were free.
.

The best way to honor our ancestors on this day is to take good care of ourselves & our community, and to support Black-owned businesses.

Currently, the planning guide from the Minnesota Department of Health states that face shields may be used in the following situations:
 Among students in Kindergarten through grade 8, when wearing a face covering is problematic.
 By teachers (all grades), when wearing a face covering may impede the educational process.
 For staff, students, or visitors who cannot tolerate a face covering due to a developmental, medical, or behavioral health condition.
 For staff providing direct support student services, when a face covering impedes the service being provided.
For optimal protection, the face shield should extend below the chin anteriorly, to the ears laterally, and there should be no exposed gap between the forehead and the shield’s headpiece.

Currently, the planning guide from the Minnesota Department of Health states that face shields may be used in the following situations:
 Among students in Kindergarten through grade 8, when wearing a face covering is problematic.
 By teachers (all grades), when wearing a face covering may impede the educational process.
 For staff, students, or visitors who cannot tolerate a face covering due to a developmental, medical, or behavioral health condition.
 For staff providing direct support student services, when a face covering impedes the service being provided.
For optimal protection, the face shield should extend below the chin anteriorly, to the ears laterally, and there should be no exposed gap between the forehead and the shield’s headpiece.

While picking up their cap and gowns today, the FHS Seniors received their gift bags from our fundraiser.

Each senior received a gift bag of items worth approximately $60. We were able to put $4600 back into the community and were able to spread those funds out between 10 different area businesses.

In addition, we received donated items from Molly French & Bob French (Pens By Bob), Cherie Serrano, Thunderbird Lodge, and the students at St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic School.

THANK YOU to everyone who contributed to this fundraiser, to those who supported it, and to those who offered a kind word or offered to help. While I know this gesture can’t make up for how their senior year was so suddenly upended, I hope it brought them some joy and put a smile on their faces. It was also a great way to put some money back into our small businesses during this chaotic time. I wish we could’ve supported every small business in our area, but I did my best to spread it around.

Thank you again!!! 💙💛",0.0,"A huge shout out to Nikki Skifstad for the amazing Senior Bags! 💜💛 The kindness and generosity of this community is amazing!

With that said…instead of canceling everything all together, we have chosen to go the “Virtual” route! Please take the time to get dressed up and get those creative juices flowing! And just so you know, all the wonderful donations for post prom prizes will now be drawn for any participating student!

Who~ Juniors and Seniors
What~ Virtual grand march for you and the public
When~ Saturday, June 13th
Where~ Any place allowed, following the
social distancing guidelines
Why~ To have the chance to get dressed up for all to see

This is Tim Everson from Falls High School asking you to complete a Distance Learning Family Survey. We now know that we will be continuing with distance learning for the remainder of the school year and we are reaching out to families to get feedback regarding our current distance learning delivery and your technology at home.



I have included a link below for our survey that I’m asking you to complete. I have also shared the link on the school’s Facebook page. We will be reviewing the results and making changes to try to make the distance learning instruction as successful as possible for both students and families in upcoming weeks.



Please feel free to contact us at any time if you have questions or problems accessing the curriculum or if you need additional devices. We want our students to be as successful as possible through this change of delivery.

Thank you,

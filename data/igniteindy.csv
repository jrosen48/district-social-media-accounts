In a continued effort to keep all families safe from COVID-19, Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb has ordered all Indiana schools remain closed until at least May 1, 2020. The governor also announced all state assessment testing scheduled for this spring is now canceled.

Effective Monday, March 23, IPS meal service will be expanded to 16 sites around the district including two community locations serviced by the Bus Stop Café food bus. Check out the IPS website at www.myips.org for locations and service times.

A full plan for home-based learning will be shared with families within the next week.

We recognize this is a challenging time for our families. Rest assured our top priority is educating our students and supporting our families. We’ll continue our efforts around the clock to ensure that work continues and share more updates as they become available.

Thank you for your support during this unprecedented time. We will get through this as we remain stronger together.

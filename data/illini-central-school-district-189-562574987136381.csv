Please allow me to help by using this link to request Technology assistance...it can be found right in the middle of IC's Homepage for now. I included a screenshot.

Illini Central Technology Help Desk link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1r4wkal9dlNKedXHdF-vSVEsOyPf7DukLOh9XoRwioHA/prefill

Just a note...this link is your best bet to get a quicker response (over calling the school) as I can access this information at home. Also...I won't check this specific post on FB too often, so comments here could get missed. Please just access the Help Desk from that link above.

Thank you & take care,

Mr. Wherley

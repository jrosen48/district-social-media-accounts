Striving for educational excellence is a combined effort between home and school, therefore your input is invaluable to the process of returning for the 2020-2021 year. Below are links to the Return to School Family Surveys in both English and Spanish. We would very much appreciate if you would take a few minutes to have your voice heard. While we did not plan the type of ending to school we had this year, we can certainly look ahead with purpose in both academics and the safety of our learning community.

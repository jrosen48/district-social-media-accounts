So we are blessed of course that in Little Chute, Wisconsin Raymond is a very accepted boy. But I had to share a quick picture. Raymond was water boying for his homecoming football game and his team won 42 -0 over the Green Bay East Red Devils. Typically we don't end up in the ""good game"" handshake line but tonight we ended up on the side GB walked out on.

Well one kid looked at Raymond, a good 6-8 feet back from the line and just said guys we missed him. And that's all it took. Some of those boys (a pretty good chunk) doubled back just to wish him a good game and give him first bumps.

I was in awe and could only quick grab one picture on my dying phone.

Anything from a table in the corner of the family office, the dining room table, or desk space in the child's room are great options. Here are the things we recommend for this learning space:

1. Quiet, or the option for headphones.

2. A clear, free space for them to write.

3. Free of food and beverages during learning time to avoid damaging spills.

4. Enough space away from siblings to prevent quarrels.

5. Separate from tempting toys and distractions. Even just facing their chair toward a window or wall so they cannot see their toys is a great option!

End summer with a 'BANG' and take some time to dedicate your creativity to making some fun family memories. Here are a few ideas to create a lasting memory this Family Fun Month:

1. Family at-home sleepover:
Indoor camping anyone?! Set up your family's sleeping bags on the floor together and have a ""sleep over."" Complete the night with a fun movie, popcorn, and flashlights!

2. Family game day:
Create a list of fun outdoor games such as baseball, water balloon fights, a chalk drawing contest and more. If there are enough people in the family, you can even form teams and compete against one another!

3. Family baking day!
Gather ingredients and have an old-fashioned baking day! Make a cake, cookies, or even a pie!

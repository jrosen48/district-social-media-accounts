The easy roads are crowded,
And the level roads are jammed;
The pleasant little rivers
With the drifting folks are crammed.

Where you get a better view,
You will find the ranks are thinning
And the travelers are few.

Where the going's smooth and pleasant
You will always find the throng;
For the many, mores the pity,
Seem to like to drift along.

But the steps that call for courage,
And the task that's hard to do,
In the end results in glory

in our series featuring influential Asian/Pacific Americans throughout history, we are talking about Vera Wang!

Vera Wang is arguably the most prominent designer of bridal wear in America. Wang has been honored with a number of awards for her achievements, including the 1993 Chinese American Planning Council's Honoree of the Year Award and the 1994 Girl Scout Council's Woman of Distinction Award. Previously a figure skater, Wang was frustrated with the lack of wedding gowns available when she got engaged, so she sketched and designed her own and had a tailor create it for her. The following year, Wang opened her own bridal boutique in New York City.

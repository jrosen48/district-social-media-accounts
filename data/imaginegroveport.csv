Following the recent decision made by Columbus City Schools in conjunction with Columbus Public Health and Franklin County Public Health, Groveport Community School has re-evaluated our reopening plan. The positivity rates, case counts, and trend lines are not conducive to opening schools in a hybrid model. They are recommending a continuing trend of decreasing rates before blended learning takes place. In alignment with this guidance, we will be starting the 2020-2021 school year in a 100% remote learning model for at least the first quarter.

The hybrid model we have been preparing for will need to change. It is our hope that our students may experience face-to-face learning at some point throughout the 2020-2021 school year. This will be an ever-changing situation and we will strive to make the safest decisions for our students and their families with the guidance and data from the health department.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2529276713842657&id=432679543502395,,0.0,"Dear Imagine Groveport Grizzly Families -

Thank you for all the remarkable work you have been doing this year, especially during these last nine weeks of the 2019-2020 school year.
Why not close out the school year with this exciting event? NASA begins a new era of human spaceflight as American astronauts will once again launch on an American rocket from American soil to the International Space Station. While they may not be able to welcome us in person, they have invited us to join them virtually to Kennedy Space Center to witness this historic launch. Launch is scheduled for 4:33 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, May 27. Register to let them know you’re in, and NASA will keep you up to date! You’ll get a chance to interact with NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine and Kennedy Space Center Director Robert Cabana on the day before launch. You can find out more information to prepare for launch day at NASA.

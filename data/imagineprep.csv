Within the next few weeks you will begin receiving weekly email updates from Edgenuity on your child’s progress in each of their courses.

In addition to the progress emails, we suggest that you check your child’s dashboard regularly. Through the dashboard you have access to their progress and grade for each course. For a more detailed breakdown of what your student completes in a day, you can access this information by clicking “student profile” and then “attendance report.” The attendance report will list the amount of time spent on each course as well as the number of assignments submitted. Idle time is the time spent logged in, but not active. If you have questions pertaining to any of this information, please contact one of their instructors.

The IPS Key Club would like to send out a positive message to help everyone get through this difficult time.

We know that switching to virtual learning is very hard for all of the students and staff. As a club focused on service, we feel the need to let you all know that we will get through this and we will be made better because of it. To the students, keep in mind that even though we are not sitting in classrooms, everything still counts towards your grade. This is especially important for the seniors, in order to graduate. Seniors, we understand how hard this may be on you all. It is important to keep your spirits up and persevere through the changes to the end of the year.

We also want to show our support to the teachers and admin through all of this. You are all working very hard to continue to set us up for success, even with everything else going on. We send all of our gratitude.

As some departing words, we want to leave you with a quote: “Tough situations build strong people”. #pantherpride

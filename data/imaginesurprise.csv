Hi All!

I’m the foreign exchange manager for Education, Travel & Culture. We are so excited to have 7 exchange students attending Imagine Prep this year! We have a host family that opened their home to Maximilien & Kerman as a welcome family. They are able to host until October 1st.

I’m posting here to see if any families would be interested in hosting one or both of these students? The host family must be able to provide 3 meals/day & a room. They can share a room with someone of the same gender & similar age.

Our students have their own spending money & health insurance. If you want more information please feel free to call/text/email me!

Gabriel plans to attend Northern Arizona University and obtain a degree in Biology and to work towards innovating the field. he also wants to work in Environmental Science/Marine Biology to help further research clean energy and waste cleanup in our oceans.

Gabriel did sports such as Cross Country & Track & Field during his freshman year. Then in 10th grade, he joined the National Honors Society and was a part of Crew Me 2 We. Outside of school life, he also loves to do photography, music, and baking.

A staff member that has really impacted Gabriel is Ms. Franco, her class and her as a person taught him so much about life and how to become a better person, he doesn't know who he'd be now if he didn't take that class.

Originally, Memorial Day was known as Decoration Day, meant to honor the Union and the Confederate soldiers who died during the American Civil War and it was celebrated on May 30th. By the 1900's, it became a day to celebrate all American soldiers who died while serving in the military. It wasn't until 1967 that it was legally renamed Memorial Day and in 1971 a law was in place to make Memorial Day the last Monday in the month of May.

Originally, Memorial Day was known as Decoration Day, meant to honor the Union and the Confederate soldiers who died during the American Civil War and it was celebrated on May 30th. By the 1900's, it became a day to celebrate all American soldiers who died while serving in the military. It wasn't until 1967 that it was legally renamed Memorial Day and in 1971 a law was in place to make Memorial Day the last Monday in the month of May.

***Ear Savers Update***

I am overwhelmed by the response we have received from our community in regards to the ear savers we began printing due to the plea for help from the huge-hearted Youngs family.

Regrettably, I must announce that we can no longer take requests for ear savers at this time. The amount of requests that we have currently received is substantial and in order to keep from burning our personal 3D printer up we have found the need to manage expectations. The requests that have currently been confirmed by me will be filled as soon as physically possible.

Special thanks to Mr. Kevin Lancaster, IPS Science teacher, for his support with his own personal 3D printer and Principal Chris McComb for allowing the use of the Imagine Prep printer.

I understand & empathize that the need for ear savers is great. I encourage others with access to 3D printers to help in the efforts to save our essential workers from pain. I will share the public domain file via email with anyone who asks.

Thank you again!

Sincerely,

Look what’s going out to nurses in Colorado & local Banner hospitals!

Mrs. Youngs made me aware of the need for 3D printed ear savers & shared a pattern. My husband got to work & printed 58 of them in 2 days. Our very own Ryley Youngs packaged them & sent them out on our behalf.

If you have access to a 3D printer & would like to help out let me know. Front line staff need all the help we can give!

Also, let me know if you have any ideas of how else we can help.

We may have to keep our distance but no one can limit our hearts!",2.0,"This is fantastic! Great job @imagineprephonorsocieties

We’re joining together to keep Arizona’s kids, families, and school communities safe and healthy. Arizona is united, and we’ll get through this. Superintendent Kathy Hoffman

This decision is not made lightly, but it is the right thing to do to bring certainty and consistency to all Arizona schools. With schools closing, we are working together to provide assistance during this time and lessen the impact on all Arizona families.

It’s important for families & parents to know that while this will address operational issues, closing schools will not stop the spread of #COVID19. It is the recommendation of public health officials that kids who are not at school remain at home to the greatest extent possible.

Attention Parents & Students. We need your help! We are in the final days of our big school fundraiser, called Raise Craze. Our goal is to raise $20K to build an outdoor amphitheater that will provide much needed usable space for students and teachers. So far 184 students & teachers have raised $5,255. Great job! We need the remaining 500+ students to donate at least $30. If every family would help, we could do this!

We have currently raised $2,730 and completed 85 Acts of Kindness. If everyone registered and raised only $25, we could easily meet our goal. Let's get rid of those rocks and create a great usable space for everyone.

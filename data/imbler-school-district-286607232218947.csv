Parents and community members,
I wanted to update you on the progress of our planning for opening school in the fall. The task is a very large one, and I am thankful that we have staff members willing to volunteer their time to assist in completing it. We had our first committee meeting yesterday. Because the needs of the elementary and secondary students are different, we have decided to divide our group into two-one group for each building and plan to meet again next week. As we make progress on the plan, we will be posting it to receive your input and feedback. Until that time, if you have questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me at the elementary school office.

Parents and Community Members,
I’m sure most of you are aware that the Oregon Department of Education has released guidelines for schools to reopen in the fall. Mr. Mills and I have spent much of the past two days reading them as well as sample plans developed by other districts throughout the state. Like many of you, we do not believe that distance learning is suitable for the students of the Imbler School District. We have begun the initial stages of planning and are committed to creating a plan that will allow for face to face instruction in the fall, which will no doubt look different than it has in the past. The state will mandate much of our plan, and it will undoubtedly change as the summer and school year progress. We ask for your continued patience and support as we work our way through the new school year. Along with the patrons of our district, we continue to be committed to excellence in education!

Mr. Mills and I have spent much of the past two days reading them as well as sample plans developed by other districts throughout the state. Like many of you, we do not believe that distance learning is suitable for the students of the Imbler School District. We have begun the initial stages of planning and are committed to creating a plan that will allow for face to face instruction in the fall, which will no doubt look different than it has in the past. The state will mandate much of our plan, and it will undoubtedly change as the summer and school year progress. We ask for your continued patience and support as we work our way through the new school year. Along with the patrons of our district, we continue to be committed to excellence in education!

I’m guessing many of you are aware of Governor Brown’s most recent press conference closing schools for the remainder of the year. It is with a broken heart I write to tell you that I have teachers reeling because they will not be allowed to have your children in their classrooms again this year.

As I have visited virtual classrooms over the past week, I have seen teachers connecting with students. Entering into this distance learning, I had a bit of anxiety about our ability to reach our students. However, I have seen teachers show love and concern for their students, and I was able to feel the emotion even through a screen.

If Mr. Mills and I had asked our teachers to develop distance lessons for our students, we would have rightly received pushback. However, when it has been our only option, teachers have put in countless hours learning how to serve students in this new way. We will continue to do our best to give your child the best education possible.

Your child should be meeting with his/her teacher(s) regularly, and teachers are providing work for students. Teachers are taking attendance as they connect with students.

We ask that you encourage your child to complete the work that has been assigned by their teacher. If the tasks assigned are too much, please communicate with your teacher as we calibrate expectations. Also, as questions and confusions arise, please do not hesitate to reach out for assistance.

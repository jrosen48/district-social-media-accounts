We have some great news to share with you. The Michigan Department of Education announced just this week that every public school student will be able to receive breakfast AND lunch for FREE.

Beginning Tuesday, September 8, all of our students (In-person learning or Virtual/Remote learning) are eligible for free breakfast and free lunch. The only exception to this is students who bring their lunch from home and want to purchase milk. In that case, students will be charged for milk.

Since we do not know how long this will last, we strongly encourage all families to still complete the Free and Reduced Lunch Program Application. Completing this application will ensure eligibility for future free meals. If you have questions about the application or require assistance completing it, please contact our Food Service Department at 810-724-9855. Here is a link to our application website for ICS:

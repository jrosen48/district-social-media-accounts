To assist LEA leaders planning for teaching and learning in this new COVID-19 context, the CCEE has created two easy-to-understand online Playbooks: the Distance Learning Playbook and the Hybrid Learning Playbook. Each suggests nine areas of focus to guide planning: setting goals, creating schedules, communicating with families, assessing student needs, supporting social-emotional learning, building capacity, supporting English language learners, supporting students with special needs, and leveraging ancillary programs. Both also bring a special equity lens to the nine areas and offer practical resources, tools, and tips leadership teams can consider adopting.

Today we will recognize senior, Michael Higgins. Michael has been on the track team for four years. Each year his times have dropped and he was starting to really take off as a track runner. This year Michael decided he wanted to leave the sprinter group and join the middle distance group. I thought this was a little odd because he had been a sprinter for three years. He joined the middle distance group and was doing an awesome job! I was eager to see how Michael was going to do in his new races! Michael we wish you the best of luck next year in the Iowa National Guard.

The senior we will recognize today is Kenzie Fischels. Kenzie has been part of the track program for all four years of her HS career. She has scored several points for the team in shot put and discus. My favorite story about Kenzie was when we needed her to run a 4x200 leg for an injured athlete. She was very nervous but when she took off all of us coaches looked at each other. We looked at our watch when she was finished and were shocked! This girl has some speed! Kenzie we wish you the best of luck next year at Kirkwood.

Whether he is on the football field, basketball court, baseball field, or on the track you can always expect greatness! Logan really started to shine his sophomore year in track. He was part of the Sprint Medley relay that broke the school record. Last year he was on the 4x400 meter relay that qualified for state. He was looking the fastest he had ever looked this year and I am super sad that we will not get to watch the great things he was going to do! Logan we wish you the best of luck next year at Kirkwood.

Parents-
In response to Governor Reynolds' announcement for schools to remain closed for the rest of the 2019-2020 school year, we would like to offer students the opportunity to check out an electronic device for the remainder of the school year. This would be iPads for grades K-2 and Chromebooks for grades 3-6.

We will have devices prepared for curbside checkout in front of East Elementary from 2:00-6:00 PM, Tuesday April 21, 2020. Administration will be there to get you the devices you need for any students in grades Kindergarten- 6th. We will do our best to make the process as efficient and safe as possible. Administration will be developing a plan next week for families to retrieve any classroom/locker materials left in the building at a later date.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us.

As you may have heard, Governor Reynolds announced yesterday that schools in Iowa should remain closed through April 30 in response to the COVID-19 crisis. While we are disappointed knowing that it will be several more weeks before we see our students, the safety of our community and state comes first.

Our board will be meeting on Monday evening to review options outlined by the Iowa Department of Education for continued learning during the closure. We want to ensure that we have the ability to provide learning experiences in a virtual environment and to provide educational opportunities for all of our students.

We know that you have many questions. Rest assured that as soon as we have more specific information about how we will move forward with learning, we will share it with you.

Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions.

Best wishes and stay safe,

Parents/Guardians-
If you are planning to attend conferences on Thursday, March 12th, from 2:15-7:45 pm or Friday, March 13th from 8:00 am-12:00 pm, we are requesting you access your student(s) grades directly through the Parent Portal and have it readily available. In doing this, we are hoping to expedite the process and minimize the need to print out a hard copy for each student. You can simply by-pass the main office and go directly to the teacher's classrooms.

Someone will be available if you do need a printed copy, help with accessing your Parent Portal, and/or have questions.

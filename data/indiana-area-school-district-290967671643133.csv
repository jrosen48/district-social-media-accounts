We have started to use the School News app by Edlio, an activity feed for consuming alerts, news, and events for participating schools. It’s a simple way to view the school’s news feeds and calendars, and also receive push notifications directly from us.

It’s free to download to your iOS or Android phone and quick to set up:
1. Go to the App Store or Google Play and search for “School News by Edlio” to install.

2. Open the app and search for the school; tap “Add School.” If you have kids in other Edlio-powered schools, add them to the app too. We are asking that you select Indiana Area School District as their school since that is where the most pertinent news is released.

3. Enable push notification by going to the Alerts tab and tapping “Enable Notifications.”

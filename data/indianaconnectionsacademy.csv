We cannot remain silent. As a school community, we are here for each other, and more than ever we need to reach out to our friends and neighbors and show the compassion, empathy, and humanity everyone deserves.

I should be clear that hatred and racism have no home at our school. Bigotry, bullying, or discrimination will not be tolerated. We treasure and hold dear the relationships that create our unique community -- those between teacher, student, and parent, all to support students’ academic and personal growth.

For students who want and need additional support at this time, I encourage you to reach out to your school counselor.

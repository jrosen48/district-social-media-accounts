Victor Hugo said “music expresses that which cannot be said and on which it is impossible to be silent.” When discovering Grace Coberly’s recent composition, I was struck not only in the beauty of the text and melody, but in the lyricism and how it fit our own “haven in the woods.” Though originally planned for our Spring concert, this piece truly encapsulated the essence of the Indian Hill High School choir program during the ongoing pandemic. Dedicated to the Class of 2020, please enjoy our virtual choir performance of Homeland.

Hi IH Families,
Brave-A-Thon is about Time Travel.

No we don’t have those cool Time Turners from Harry Potter, but we do have PIONEER DAYS!! And they are upon us!

The ES 4th graders travel back in time to do things the pioneer way. Cook stew on an open fire, make baskets from reeds, dip candles, make corn husk dolls, learn about pioneer music, and much much more. They even dress up.
I think one of the sweetest parts is watching them all sit and share a meal together that they all played a role in making with the candles they dipped on the tables!

An unknown wise man once said:""No event is successful without the volunteers who help to make it happen!""
This goes for all the events including our Pancake Breakfast!
From the day it started 22 years ago as the sole yearly fundraiser for our district's music program, they key to its success was the proud parent volunteers who helped where they were needed.
This year is no different, we are in need for parents to volunteer and be part of the success story of the 22nd IH pancake breakfast.

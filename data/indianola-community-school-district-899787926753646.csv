Indianola’s Census response rate is currently at 71.1%. This week, the US Census Bureau will be sending reminder postcards to households who have not yet responded to the 2020 Census. This will be the final mailing before census takers begin visiting non-responding households in mid-August.
If you have not already responded to the Census, and to avoid a visit to your home by a census taker, please respond online (https://2020census.gov/en/ways-to-respond/responding-online.html) or by phone (844-330-2020) today.

I recently saw another resource for learning at home, WideOpenSchool.org , that people might find helpful. By way of an update, I want people to know that lots of work, planning, and learning is going on behind the scenes right now. We want to provide continuous learning opportunities at home in the most practical ways while trying to ensure equity and access. We have some staff for whom online teaching and learning is pretty natural and others for whom it is brand new.

I recently saw another resource for learning at home, WideOpenSchool.org , that people might find helpful. By way of an update, I want people to know that lots of work, planning, and learning is going on behind the scenes right now. We want to provide continuous learning opportunities at home in the most practical ways while trying to ensure equity and access. We have some staff for whom online teaching and learning is pretty natural and others for whom it is brand new.

We want to stay connected and provide support to families, and we will keep communicating through the district website, this Facebook page, and the district notification system.

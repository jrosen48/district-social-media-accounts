The three winners from IRMS are (in no particular order):

Ali VanTassel
Elias Pratt
Samantha Booth

Their artwork was selected from over 500 submissions in 33 schools across NYS.

From that display, her piece was the one and only selected by the Superintendents to receive this prestigious “Artist of the Month” award.

We are incredibly pleased with the artwork all our artists are creating; they continue to prove they are learning each day to view their world creatively, critically, and with open eyes.

We look forward to continuing to highlight and honor the hard work and accomplishments of our young artists throughout this school year.

Vivian was selected as the “Superintendents’ Artist of the Month”. Vivian has demonstrated critical thinking, creativity, and the desire to complete exceptional artwork. The competition amongst her peers was rigorous.

It was first an honor for Vivian's artwork to be displayed in the District Office for personnel, the community, and the Board of Education to enjoy for the last month. From that display, her piece was the one and only selected by the Superintendents to receive this prestigious “Artist of the Month” award.

We are incredibly pleased with the artwork all our artists are creating; they continue to prove they are learning each day to view their world creatively, critically, and with open eyes.

We look forward to continuing to highlight and honor the hard work and accomplishments of our young artists throughout this school year.

Well done Vivian!

Congratulations to Camila Quintero-Riano at the Middle School!

Camila was selected as the “Superintendents’ Artist of the Month”. Camila has demonstrated critical thinking, creativity, and the desire to complete exceptional artwork. The competition amongst her peers was rigorous.

It was first an honor for Camila’s artwork to be displayed in the District Office for personnel, the community, and the Board of Education to enjoy for the last month. From that display, her piece was the one and only selected by the Superintendents to receive this prestigious “Artist of the Month” award.

We are incredibly pleased with the artwork all our young artists are creating; they continue to prove they are learning each day to view their world creatively, critically, and with open eyes.

We look forward to continuing to highlight and honor the hard work and accomplishments of our young artists throughout this school year.

Well done Camila!

Day 35 post transplant, day 44 in the hospital, and today is the day!!! Kahlil gets to go home after a successful stem cell transplant and he is considered cured of sickle cell disease. His numbers are soaring today - WBC is 2.1, ANC is 1600, platelets are 68k, and hemoglobin is 11.6. On top of that, he is now fully chimera, which means 100% of his blood (WBC, RBC, and platelets) is being made by Kaavya's stem cells. This ratio will lower over time, but starting off at 100% is an important transplant success marker.

While we still have a looong road ahead of us, he is done with the hardest part of it. We are so so so proud of our baby boy! He will now have weekly outpatient visits, in-home nurse care as needed, and medications and lab tests for the next year or two. For now, we are beyond thrilled to have our baby back home! 💕
KAHLIL, not Khalil.

Update on Kahlil Washington: Today is day 18 post-transplant (almost 4 weeks in the hospital). Kahlil is in a lot of pain from radiation. He is getting medicine around the clock to manage it. Kahlil is strong and fearless, and doing ok. We hope that his blood counts will pick up in the next few days so he can start to feel better soon, and that he will be able to go home in a couple of weeks.
We thank Ms. Little for being such an awesome teacher and for scheduling two Zoom sessions so Kahlil could see his friends. He enjoyed that very much!
We ask our UPA family for continued love and prayers for Kahlil.
We would welcome cards and wishes for Kahlil. He just made a art project mailbox for his room and would love to receive some mail.

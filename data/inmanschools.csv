Good evening IES Parents! I hope you are all doing well! PTO is looking at the possibility of purchasing Teuton Youth Masks for our students. We would sell these to students at cost in order to spread school spirit in a difficult time. The cost would be $5 per mask. If you're interested, please respond to this post. If we have enough interest, we will proceed with purchasing them and share more details later. If you have any questions, feel free to respond to this post, send a FB message, or email me at ieskspto@gmail.com.

The alumni shared some very valuable information and advice to those students who plan to go on to college. Many themes surfaced today as we listened to the alumni share: advice on developing good study habits, preparing for tests, focus on not procrastinating, developing good time management skills and being willing to work hard were all traits that seemed to be stressed. One of the comments that really hit home from the alumni was when Macy shared that ‚Äúin High school you want to graduate, get out of Inman and then as soon as you go somewhere else you realize how amazing our community is, enjoy it.‚Äù The full question and answer session can be seen on the USD 448 Facebook page.

In the time since, Dr. Shaywitz started the Yale Institute for Dyslexia with her husband and wrote a book, Overcoming Dyslexia.

This might be the most amazing data picture you see in a lifetime! It shows the 63,779 cross-references in the Bible. The white bars along the bottom represent each Bible chapter, Gen. 1 - Rev. 22. The line’s color shows the reference’s distance from the other. A cross reference is a scripture that references another scripture. Had the Bible been written by one person or at one time this would still be amazing; however, the Bible was written by 40 authors over the span of 1500 years on 3 different continents.

Run Devil Run

Run devil, run devil
Run devil, run
I got somethin' make the devil gonna run
He been dancin' till the break of dawn
Devil gon' try to take a shot at me
He got none, but baby I got three
He tryna make a fool outta me
Y'all takin' out my sanity
He ain't nothin' but a silver tongue
I got somethin' make the devil gonna run
I got somethin' make the devil gonna run
I got somethin' make the devil be gone
Run devil, run devil, run devil run
You bet your bottom dollar he's gonna be gone
I got somethin' make the devil gonna run
Run devil, run devil
Run devil run
Run devil, run devil

Look out devil we got revival
My people gonna move and shake

OUR ENEMIES
These who are not ""flesh-and-blood enemies"" are demons over whom the devil has control. They are not mere fantasies—they are very real. We face a powerful army whose goal is to defeat Christ's church. When we believe in Christ, these beings become our enemies, and they try every device to turn us away from him and back to sin. Although we are assured of victory, we must engage in the struggle until Christ returns, because Satan is constantly battling against all who are on the Lord's side. We need supernatural power to defeat Satan, and God has provided this by giving us his Holy Spirit within us and his armor surrounding us. If you feel discouraged, remember Jesus' words to Peter: ""Upon this rock I will build my church, and all the powers of hell will not conquer it"" Matthew 16:18.

For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Ephesians 6:12 KJV

This tends to be the month parents start finding a new educational home for their children. If you’re one of those parents searching, looking for a school that will offer individualized, out of the box learning techniques for your son or daughter, we would love you to come by or message us and learn more about what Inspire Academy has to offer.

This tends to be the month parents start finding a new educational home for their children. If you’re one of those parents searching, looking for a school that will offer individualized, out of the box learning techniques for your son or daughter, we would love you to come by or message us and learn more about what Inspire Academy has to offer.
-
As a Christian private school focused on helping students with learning disabilities, we tend to offer solutions that other schools unfortunately aren’t able to. We’d love to tell you more about how your son or daughter could flourish here.

With so much misunderstood about learning disabilities, we decided it would be a great time to for a few little known facts!
-
There are no medical tests for LDs, and no medication that cures them.
LDs are not caused by the environment children are raised in, but do run in the family. Learning disabilities do not equate to low intelligence. In fact, by the parameters set around the term “learning disability,” people with them have average or above average intelligence.
-
People (that’s right, kids with LDs grow into adults with LDs) with learning disabilities aren’t lazy, dumb, or a product of their environment. They need a welcoming environment that helps them access the best of their abilities, just like everyone else.

If you’re interested in seeing why we consistently get the best reviews possible, send us a message today. We’d love to give you a tour of our school and show you what other parents are raving about!

Reviews mean the world to us. While we know we strive to do the best job we can each and every day, they are a fantastic way to see how God is impacting our students’ lives through us. We take great pride knowing on Google and Facebook we have nothing but 5 star reviews.
-
If you’re interested in seeing why we consistently get the best reviews possible, send us a message today. We’d love to give you a tour of our school and show you what other parents are raving about!

One of the most important factors for successful education is confidence. Helping students understand their strengths and value is incredibly important. While we work on building up this confidence in the classroom, we also show students that the greatest confidence they can possess comes from Him.

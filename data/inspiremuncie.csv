Joe'siah, grade 4, shared his powerful story and perspective on Wear Orange Day at last year's Giving Gala. Read Joe'siah's story:
""[Wear Orange Day] is something we do at our school where we talk about people's parents or someone else in their family that was murdered by a gun or something violent. On this day, we wear orange shirts and we go in a room and we talk about it and how we feel. We also make videos on how to stop gun violence. And we don’t want people to kill other people not just with guns, but with anything! ... I lost my dad who was shot by a gun. The Inspire staff and I talk about it and this helps me deal with the pain and helps me feel better. I love the staff and this school.""

Join the Inspire crew and others throughout the country as we #WearOrange to honor survivors of gun violence and support awareness around gun safety.

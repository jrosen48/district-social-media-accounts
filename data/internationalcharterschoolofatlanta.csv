MYTH: Charter schools are private schools.
TRUTH: Every single charter school in America, without exception, is a tuition-free public school. Charter schools are publicly funded by local, state, and federal tax dollars based on student enrollment, just like all other public schools. Charter schools expand public school options for families that may be dissatisfied with their local schools, but cannot afford private school. Charter schools must meet the same academic standards that all public schools are required to meet.

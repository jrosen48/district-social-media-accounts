The I-35 elementary teachers really miss our classroom kiddos! We’ve been seeing posts about teachers driving through town to see their kids, and we decided we wanted to do that as well!

You can have your kiddos stand on the front porch or in the front yard and wave as we drive by! If you live out of town, it would be awesome if you could find a sidewalk or somewhere to stand in the nearest town, but we also understand the importance of social distancing during this time!

We plan to do this next Wednesday, April 1st.
Here’s the schedule:
1:00- Start in Truro
1:45- St. Charles
2:30 New Virginia

These are rough estimates on times, plan to be ready 10-15 min before and after.

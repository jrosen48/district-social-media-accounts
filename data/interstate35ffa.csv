Since it's the middle of April, and very few acres have been planted in the Midwest, here are some facts about soil temperatures that might help to explain the delay in planting.

Corn requires a soil temperature of 50° F to germinate and grow and soybeans require a soil temperature of 54° F. Temperatures below the optimum can cause seeds to sit dormant and become more vulnerable to diseases, insects, and animal predators.

Let them know about this scholarship opportunity through Conservation Districts of Iowa!

Applications are due to your local SWCD office by Friday, February 16.

The Conservation Scholarship Winner from CDI's Region 6 (that includes Madison County!) will receive an additional $350 from the Larry Beeler Memorial Scholarship Fund.

Larry Beeler was a SWCD Commissioner in Madison County, and this is the final year the memorial scholarship will be offered, so it would be great to have applications from students in Madison County!

At the time we opened Inwood Academy, we had an overwhelming amount of applications for every open position. There was a hiring freeze at the NYC DOE and it was a tough time to be a teacher. During this hiring process, one amazing teacher, John Harrison, saw something unique in Inwood that he found exciting and decided to take a chance on us. He adjusted his classroom practice to support a different group of learners than he had taught previously and spoke into school policy. He pioneered our woodshop program with a small group of high school students and grew it to what it is today - a one-of-a-kind space for students to grow creatively and gain confidence outside the classroom. Our students see Mr. Harrison as an older brother and even a father figure. We are so thankful that he took a chance on IAL.

Ashley was Inwood Academy's first paid staff member (aside from our founder) and she started with us when we were still meeting at tiny desk in the Charter Center downtown. She helped us do just about everything to get off the ground - choose our insurance company, create school policies, hire teachers, set up bank accounts - and since then she has been a devoted teacher, stepping in wherever needed, even leading our choir! Ashley has sacrificed to serve IAL in too many ways to count, and we would not be the same without her. #inwoodacademy #inwood10",2020-02-21 15:01:46,,

Good evening to all my new friends! Tomorrow’s afternoon adventure with the giraffes will be streamed LIVE right here on this page starting at 2pm CST.

We now have more than 25,000 families(!!) who have RSVP’d which is incredible and represents something close to 75,000 unique children from across the country and even the world. Wow. There are almost no places to host this many people online at once which is why we will use Facebook at least to start.

I’m also thrilled to announce that 1st Alliance Mortgage Bryan-College Station has very generously sponsored every episode this week. Incredibly kind of them, and they jumped on board when we only had about 300 people signed up which is even cooler. Give them a chance at your next refi or purchase with historically low rates.

Thank you so much for helping our campus stay heart-healthy and save lives at the same time! If you haven’t had a chance to join the TEAM there’s still time to earn ALL the Heart Heroes… Perrie, Knox, Nico, Sofie, Crush, and Sunny! Get started now by downloading our APP called Kids Heart Challenge for iPhone and Android (you can earn a wristband just for registering).

Our school goal is to raise $10,000 toward the fight against heart disease! When we do, we will earn $1,050 in resources for our gym! Also, any student who raises $150 will get to SLIME Coach Westbrook & Coach Bowman!!! When we hit our goal to raise $10,000, Mr. Martindale will get slimed too!

🥵🥵🥵 A prolonged stretch of unseasonable heat has settled in and will persist for multiple days this week. Each day through Thursday will see temperatures climbing well into the 90s, and possibly even approaching 100 degrees at times.

Given the persistence and duration of the heat wave, there may be a cumulative health risk especially for vulnerable populations. Please drink plenty of water and limit time spent outside if possible. When outdoors try to stay in the shade and wear sunscreen and protective clothing!

A cool front will cross Iowa late in the week, on Thursday night or Friday, bringing more seasonable conditions for next weekend as well as a return of rain and thunderstorm chances.

Welcome to the Iowa Vietnam Veterans Recognition Day, 2020, virtual ceremony. While the COVID-19 pandemic prevented our usual annual ceremony, and related restrictions disrupted plans to host a live broadcast of a virtual ceremony, we promised to ‘adapt and overcome,’ ensuring the day would not go unrecognized. The following multi-media presentation includes some visual highlights in our usual ceremony, and the script that was planned, including remarks from our keynote speaker Brig. Gen. Thompson, and Gov. Reynolds. We know this is no substitute for the camaraderie of our usual gathering, but these are extraordinary times, and with everyone’s help, we will return to normalcy for our next event. We invite you to watch and read, and maintain our faith that even in these times, our comrades ‘Are Not Forgotten.’",5.0,"Thank you for your service!

Larry Richard - 4 pm update on TS Sally

From the National Weather Service –

Sally is a tropical storm, and is expected to become a hurricane before landfall in the vicinity of southeast Louisiana late Monday or Tuesday.

The track forecast has shifted west slightly. Remember that long range forecast accuracy is between 65 and 100 miles for 2-3 days before landfall.

Rainfall projections for our region are 1-3 inches through next Friday. Locally higher amounts are possible along and south of the I-10 corridor in southwest and south central Louisiana.

Be aware that the trees left standing after Hurricane Laura are quite vulnerable. Wind gusts of 30 to 40 mph could blow down some of these trees and/or damage tarps on our roofs.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3271112106269713&id=359147030799583,,0.0,"From Parish President M.

From the National Weather Service:
Tropical Depression 19 has formed in the Bahamas. It is forecast to move over south Florida tonight, and move into the eastern Gulf of Mexico this weekend. It is forecast to strengthen into a tropical storm.

Because it is early, and no distinct center has formed, we have low confidence on the forecast track and intensity.

We are expecting one to five inches of rain from this system, mainly in the Tuesday through Thursday time frame next week. If this system moves further to the west, our rain forecast will need to be adjusted higher.
Areas from Louisiana to the Florida panhandle are at risk from this system and need to follow forecasts through the weekend.

From the National Weather Service –

There is still high uncertainty regarding the track and intensity forecast for both tropical systems. In general, this afternoon’s forecast has shifted further west for both systems.

Tropical Depression 14 is disorganized, but should become a tropical storm tonight or tomorrow. It is forecast to be in the southern Gulf of Mexico on Sunday, and threaten Texas on Tuesday.

Tropical Storm Laura is forecast to move into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico Monday into Tuesday, and threaten Louisiana, possibly as a hurricane by Wednesday.

It is too early to know specific weather impacts to our region. Damaging winds, heavy rain, and higher tides are all possible.

Happy Easter To Everyone!!!
It’s very important moving forward that we continue to practice social distancing as much as possible, in order to flatten the curve of the Coronavirus COVID-19 in Iberia Parish.

It’s also important that we stay connected to our families as much as we possibly can even though we’re having to stay connected differently from what we are used to in the past.

My goal is to help our families remain together (safe) throughout this crisis.￼

Remember to wash your hands often ￼with soap ￼for 20 seconds.

Try to keep from touching ￼your face as much as possible.

Stay home as much as possible.

Stay Safe!!!",0.0,"M Larry Richard

Happy Easter To Everyone!!!
It’s very important moving forward that we continue to practice social distancing as much as possible, in order to flatten the curve of the Coronavirus COVID-19 in Iberia Parish.

It’s also important that we stay connected to our families as much as we possibly can even though we’re having to stay connected differently from what we are used to in the past.

My goal is to help our families remain together (safe) throughout this crisis.￼

Remember to wash your hands often ￼with soap ￼for 20 seconds.

Try to keep from touching ￼your face as much as possible.

Stay home as much as possible.

Some have asked what is meant by the emergency declaration which I recently issued. An emergency declaration cuts bureaucratic delays and unifies parish government functions under the Parish President and the Iberia Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness. This allows your Parish Government to mobilize its resources to respond to a crisis. These declarations also allow us to access state and federal funds that might be appropriated with respect to a particular emergency event. Emergency declarations are just the first step in the process of reacting to an event. Recommendations for more specific action usually comes later as the emergency situation, such as a storm or the Coronavirus, continues to develop. You will be kept informed of any recommended actions through posts on the Iberia Parish Government website or Iberia PINS (Parish Information Notification System).

From the National Weather Service:

We are expecting a hard freeze (temperatures in the mid 20s) tonight for areas along and north of the I-10 corridor. This is basically our entire forecast area except the coastal parishes.

Temperatures will be at or below freezing for 8 to 12 hours in southeast Texas, southwest and south central Louisiana, and 10 to 14 hours in east Texas and central Louisiana.

During cold spells like this, remember to protect your outdoor pets, plants, and pipes. In addition, the risk for house fires increases during cold weather because of improper usage of space heaters. Do not place them within 3 feet of your bed, furniture, or anything that could catch on fire. Do not leave them on when you are not home. Extension cords are not recommended, but if you have to use one, be sure it is at least a 14 gauge.

The system is expected to move inland over the south Texas or northeast Mexico coast on Wednesday.

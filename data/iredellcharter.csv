Oh the places your kids will go at ICA

This is our 2nd year at ICA and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. The make you feel welcome all the time. The staff ~ ALL staff ~ are involved in the daily happenings of the children. There are so many wonderful activities to allow children to express interest and learn new things.
Knowing that when a question or concern comes up, there are many individuals who can answer and address them.
I can see a HUGE difference in just 1 year within the school and academics. Growth is amazing to watch and witness.

If you‚Äôre struggling with your local school, I do recommend you come and visit and observe and speak to multiple families from ICA.

Oh the places your kids will go at ICA

This is our 2nd year at ICA and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. The make you feel welcome all the time. The staff ~ ALL staff ~ are involved in the daily happenings of the children. There are so many wonderful activities to allow children to express interest and learn new things.
Knowing that when a question or concern comes up, there are many individuals who can answer and address them.

I-SS students who choose plan B will only need care 2 to 3 days per week. We realize that students in Iredell County who do not attend I-SS may need care up to 5 days per week.

I-SS is staffing 17 After-School PrimeTime locations and 2 All-Day programs, but we are only able to accept students enrolled with Iredell-Statesville Schools into those programs. In our partnership with the Lowes YMCA on our Mt. Mourne campus, we are able to allow charter school students access since that site will be staffed by the YMCA.

I-SS students who choose plan B will only need care 2 to 3 days per week. We realize that students in Iredell County who do not attend I-SS may need care up to 5 days per week.

I-SS is staffing 17 After-School PrimeTime locations and 2 All-Day programs, but we are only able to accept students enrolled with Iredell-Statesville Schools into those programs. In our partnership with the Lowes YMCA on our Mt. Mourne campus, we are able to allow charter school students access since that site will be staffed by the YMCA.

Hanna Ball just showed up to her high school graduation at South Iredell High School socially distanced from everyone by riding on her horse, and I am now officially obsessed with this 17-year-old’s bold, instantly-memorable attitude.

Hanna’s family tells me she has ridden horses since a young girl. She participates in rodeos, FFA and 4H club. The rain held off yesterday long enough to get the horse loaded and hauled to a parking lot down the street from the school. She then rode her horse down the street and up to the stage. There she got off to walk across the stage and receive her diploma.

The staff played the Lone Ranger theme song in the background instead of “Pomp and Circumstance”.

With so many things canceled for seniors, this seems a wildly-needed exciting moment for not just Hanna and her family, but anyone else who either saw it live or is watching here now seeing one high schooler making lemonade out of our COVID-lemons.

Join Safe and Civil Schools for this free web-based meeting with Randy Sprick. Randy is a parent (and yes, sometimes his children drive him crazy), a grandparent, and a world leader in effective behavior management. His presentation will cover things you can do to help your children learn to behave better and become more independent and responsible.

Learn how and when to use consequences for misbehavior
Learn how and when to use praise
Learn to make daily life more pleasant and relaxed around the house
You will learn that you are already doing many things exactly right and add strategies for making things better! Come and join us for a fun and entertaining session.

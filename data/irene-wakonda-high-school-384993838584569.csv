Here is some information on this week's volleyball matches.

Tonight @ Freeman

Parents, students, siblings, etc below grade 9 and above grade 12 (college, adult) need to have a voucher to enter the volleyball match on Tuesday at Freeman. Each uniformed athlete in grades 7-12 (since we play jh and hs volleyball that night) will receive 4 vouchers. There is no admission price for the game. High school students will just have to announce to the gate keeper that they are an I-W student, so they will not need a voucher.

Thursday @ Canton

Restrictions: Masks are required upon entrance and for the duration. Social distancing is recommended. All fans will enter through our temperature checkpoint upon entry.
Admission Prices: $2 per person

Invitations: You will need an invitation to receive entrance to this match. That invite is attached to this e-mail. Four invites per rostered player, essential team personnel, and coach. The spectators presenting the invitation will still need to pay.

Streaming: http://chawks.liveticket.tv/

It seems like it has been far too long since we have been able to host an event. At this point we are not restricting access to the games. Masks are highly encouraged/recommended for all indoor and outdoor activities. Honestly, if we want to see our activity seasons played in their entirety and we want to see in-person instruction continue with as few interruptions as possible, we will need everyone's help. Spectators that are in attendance are asked to socially distance from non-family members.

Tonight's volleyball game will be broadcast live on the Irene-Wakonda High School Youtube page. Tomorrow night's football game will not be broadcast.

Senior Night will be Friday, August 28th for football and cheer. Volleyball and cross country will have their Senior Night on Tuesday, September 15th.

As most of you know, the schools are closed next week to try and minimize the spread of the Coronavirus. We at The Depot are concerned about our community and the children in it; and are prepared to help in any way we can.
So, we want to do our part and offer breakfast and lunch to any child who otherwise would not get it because of the school closure.

The Depot will have an egg & cheese breakfast sandwich and bag lunch available for any child who needs it from 7-10am M-F next week.

Please share and let others know. If you know me, you know that children and animals will NEVER go hungry on my watch.
Thanks!

At the request of Governor Noem, the remainder of the SDHSAA Class B Girls Basketball tournament is postponed. In addition, all SDHSAA state basketball tournaments for next weekend, along with the Visual Arts competition, are also postponed. The Student Council Convention, all Region music contests, and All-State Band scheduled for later this month are cancelled.

This is a difficult decision and comes amid constant conversation and information sharing between the SDHSAA, the Governor’s Office, and the Department of Health. We will evaluate the future of the postponed events in concert with those same entities. The safety of everyone involved is our foremost concern, followed by exploring all options to provide the student-athlete with the opportunity to finish their season.

We thank everyone for their patience and understanding in a very difficult time, and we apologize for any inconvenience that this may cause.

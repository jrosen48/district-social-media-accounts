Dia de los Muertos is not the Mexican version of Halloween. Mexicans have celebrated Day of the dead since they year 1800 B.C.
Although its origin is Mexican, it is also celebrated in other spanish speaking countries in central and south America.
Dia de los Muertos is not supposed to be sad or morbid, is a time of remembrance and joy as many families in Latin America honor and remember their loved ones who have passed. Altars are not for worship but for offering our love and remembering our departed family members.
In most places the celebration lasts 3 days, from October 31st - November 2nd.

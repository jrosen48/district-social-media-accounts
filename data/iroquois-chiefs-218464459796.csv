Members of Mrs. Dant's FACS class participated in the Popcorn Pep Club Contest that was held nationally. To participate they had to show their popcorn spirit. Their spirit included learning about popcorn by watching a ""Good Eats"" episode on popcorn. Members of the class then created posters about the health benefits of popcorn. Their final project was creating recipes that centered around popcorn. Each lab in the class found their own recipe and created it. They came up with Oreo popcorn, S'mores popcorn and popcorn snack mix. This week the class learned they received an honorable mention for their participation in the contest and won $500.00 to be used in the classroom.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157185688659797&id=218464459796,,0.0,"ndy, Jill

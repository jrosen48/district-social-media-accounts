This date represents the end of the first six weeks grading period. At this time, the in-person learning option would begin on Monday, September 28. This comes after careful review of the recommendation by Dallas County Health and Human Services that there not be any in-person learning at this time.

The Texas Education Agency has given local school districts authority to offer remote learning for all students for up to four weeks. Districts may extend the remote learning option for all students an additional four weeks with Board of Trustee approval. To extend the remote learning only option beyond eight weeks would require approval from the Texas Education Agency.

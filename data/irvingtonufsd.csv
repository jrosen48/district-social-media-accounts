Students ‘Spread the Love’ With Hearts at Dows Lane

As students walk up to Dows Lane Elementary School, they are greeted by colorful chalk hearts that adorn the building’s walls.

“This ‘heart-attack’ represents our love for Dows Lane and love for learning,” Principal Andrea Kantor said. “When we have 100 by the end of the week, it will add to our 100th Day of School celebration on Feb. 14.”

Kantor said the students helped her decorate the school in hearts during their recess outside on Feb. 10. They also placed hearts on bulletin boards, doors and windows throughout the school. In addition, members of the third grade Student Council created an interactive “Spread the Love” wall display of jumbo hearts in the main lobby, where students can add their own paper heart with a message about something they love or share an act of kindness.",0.0,"With the close of the 2019-20 school year, Irvington UFSD is celebrating its accomplishments by sharing some of the top stories from the year.

Drawing inspiration from everyday objects, students in art teacher Kathleen Tetro’s Mixed Media/Sculpture class created larger-than-life sculptures out of recyclable materials, adhesive and paint.

As part of the project, the students used their math knowledge to recreate different objects, such as crayons, a vintage camera, LEGO pieces and mints, at a minimum of five times larger than the original size.

“The students worked at finding the correct dimensions of both geometric and organic objects, measuring the height, length, depth and angles to create accurate sketches,” Tetro said. “Then, they proceeded to multiply all dimensions by a specific number of their choosing to create an enlarged sculpture of the item.”

The project challenged the students to use their creativity, which yielded outstanding results.

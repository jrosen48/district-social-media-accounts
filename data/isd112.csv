Students worked in teams starting with $100,000 in simulated money to invest in stocks, through a simulated portfolio. The teams work together researching how actual companies‚Äô stocks are performing, and then make trades (buying and selling) through their SMG portfolio. This year, due to distance learning, students communicated with one another about their trades via a Google Doc or Google Meet in order to compete in the game, which they began in class a week before distance learning began.

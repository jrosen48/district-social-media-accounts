Dear Families,

Just wanted to highlight what the 1st day of school will look like for our 3 groups of students.

Hybrid Group A - will be attending school in person at SFMS. Students who signed up for technology will pick it up that morning.

Hybrid Group B - students will check to see if they are able to log-in to Schoology and find their classes. Those students needing technology will pick-it up at school on Tuesday. Students will not have assignments to complete.

Distance Learning - 1st, 3rd, 5th hours classes will be synchronous (live with a teacher) & 2nd, 4th, 6th hour will be asynchronous.

Schoology training will be released very soon.",3.0,"St. Francis Middle School families

SFMS - Connecting the Past to the Future!

As many of you know, SFMS is going through a major remodel this summer. This picture was found during construction when the old lockers were removed. After some research, the picture is of Duane Schroeder taken in 1980 at the MN State Wrestling Tournament.

We reached out to Duane and asked if he would share his story. Here is list of his accomplishments:
-US Naval Academy Graduate
-wrestled/played Sport Judo, winning the Judo East Coast Championship
-Naval Flight Officer: E-2C Hawkeye Aircraft
-Earned a Masters in Business
-Earned a Law Degree
-Currently the Vice President (Taxes) at Medtronic, the largest medical device country in the world

Duane's message to our St. Francis family:
Success is a journey, not just showing up for game day. The effort you put in your school work, job and interests will determine where you will end up in life!",2.0,"#SaintsPride

From Foundation 15 Committee and Brent Swaggert:

For nearly 30 years, F-15 has raised money and awarded scholarships to graduating seniors in St. Francis. We created a short video celebrating some of the past recipients and some future St. Francis graduates that could one day be F-15 scholarship recipients. Big thanks to Matt Norton for helping to create the video!

Because of the great support of our community, the scholarship opportunities have grown over the years. There will be 16 recipients of F-15 scholarships later this month at the Senior Awards Celebration.

The committee is selling $10 tickets with a chance to win a total of $1,500 in prize money.
The deadline for buying tickets is Monday, May 18th and the drawing will take place on Wednesday, May 20th at 5PM via Facebook Live at the Foundation 15 Facebook page.

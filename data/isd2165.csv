Here is the decision tree that the Minnesota Department of Health has put out to guide schools on making decisions about excluding staff and students to possible exposures, confirmed exposures, and symptoms. We just received this info and are still sorting through it. We wish to work with parents as partners to make decisions in the best interest of the health of our entire community. I recommend erring on the the side of caution. We are opening schools on September 8th with the goal of keeping them open. This will take effort and caution from all of us.

We look forward to seeing you all (at least virtually) next week.

Mr. LeTourneau works hard to make sure each student is challenged, especially in math. He creates engaging lessons and his students love being in class with him. The fourth graders look forward to having him as their science teacher. He is dedicated to showing students he cares about them and their interests. He invites students to each lunch with him in his class and is often spotted throwing a football with students during recess. He even attended the 4th grade girl's basketball tournament!

We are so lucky to have Mrs. Lymburner. She is a very caring teacher and coworker. Her joy of teaching kindergarten and seeing how her students grow through the years is obvious. There are special memories that her former students have from being in the Clifford classroom. She shares her love of reading with students and surrounds them with a room full of fun books. Mrs. Lymburner believes it is also important to teach basic manners and how to be respectful at an early age. Those values are reflected in her own family as well.

She is a coworker that can be relied on for input, suggestions or just a shoulder to lean on. Through her years of teaching, she has acquired experience, knowledge and an endless supply of classroom materials. There have been many changes throughout her teaching career and she continues to adjust and move forward. She is always on top of accomplishing any task too.

From Josh-William Archambault
We appreciate Mrs. Hagen because she is a great teacher and coach. In the classroom her teaching methods are simple but very effective. As a teacher she does not hesitate to help a student in need. She is also very flexible to work with and just super cool. As a coach, Mrs. Hagen is preparing the younger volleyball and softball players for the high school level. So thank you Mrs. Hagen for all that you do for us.

Besides being a fantastic spouse and mother, we at HF High are extremely fortunate to have such a dedicated and passionate teacher as Katie. Katie puts forth great effort in her lessons with her FACS students every day. Whether it be cooking, sewing, or nutrition units or helping seniors prepare for their future, she puts extreme care and thought in trying to reach and help each one of her students. She also holds students accountable and strives and encourages them to do their best. It's amazing how many different things she does for students and HF schools. Besides teaching multiple classes in FACS, she is also responsible for leading or advising FCCLA, prom, fundraiser-coordinator, the Jag store, concession stand coordinator, jr. high volleyball and keeping Mr. Kreger in line.

She is always there for her students rather it be homework wise or even personal and is there for you when you need it most.

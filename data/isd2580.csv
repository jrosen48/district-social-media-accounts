Below is a link to a brief survey that we are asking each family to complete now that our distance learning plan has been in full effect for some time. The purpose of the survey is to help us understand the effectiveness of and discover the barriers that still may exist to our distance learning program relative to Internet access and devices your students are using. Participation is optional, but your response will help us provide better instructional opportunities for your students. We expect this survey to take approximately 5 minutes to complete. Thank you for your participation and for all you are doing to help your children continue their learning.

This survey is being conducted by ECMECC, which East Central is a member of. The survey is being done in Pine, Chisago, Kanabec, Isanti and Mille Lacs counties.

I sure hope you are all doing well, my thoughts are with all of you and wishing the students could be here at school. I shared a few pictures with you. I talk about my cats, Vinny and Chewy a lot so I wanted to include them. I have been doing a lot of puzzles at home - here is Vinny helping me. I, of course, wanted to share a picture of Ms. Amber and me from this past Halloween. We are here working and trying to organize the distant learning.
The buses are delivering food (lunch & breakfast) and the homework packets went out today (Monday 3/30)!

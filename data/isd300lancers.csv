The plans will be posted on our website and parents will receive an email with the most current plans.

Currently, you can find documents on our school website that provide information to parents on some of the safety precautions and our procedures for handling the facilities, students, and visitors this fall concerning Covid-19. Please take the time to look them over.
I am sure that once we are given which plan to use, we will develop additional plans to get students active and involved. I ask for your cooperation and patience as we move forward in these very difficult and challenging times.

Return to Learn Plan / Return to Learn ThoughtExchange",11.0,"As we have been creating our Return to Learn Plan, we engaged people from all across the district to think about how we can mitigate risks in the most reasonable ways possible. Now we want to hear from you. If you have questions or comments about our Return to Learn plan, take a moment to share them in our ThoughtExchange.

ThoughtExchange is more than a survey, it will offer you a chance to give us feedback about our Return to Learn plan, to raise questions, and at the same time see what your friends and neighbors are saying about the plan. There are lots of ways to participate. Join us at https://www.isd318.org/Page/439

Weather Safety - Storms, Hail and Lightning

Itasca County Sheriff's Office
April 14 at 5:00 AM ·

Storms, Hail and Lightning

Thunderstorms affect relatively small areas, compared with most other storms. The typical thunderstorm is 15 miles in diameter and lasts for 30 minutes — but whatever their size, all thunderstorms are dangerous.

Severe thunderstorms produce large hail or winds of at least 58 mph. Some wind gusts can exceed 100 mph and produce tornado-like damage. That’s why many communities will sound their outdoor sirens for damaging straight-line winds.

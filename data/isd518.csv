Governor Walz has spoken, and we will continue with Distance Learning for the rest of our school year. We are all missing seeing each other at school and being in class with our friends and teachers, but we need to stay healthy so that we can all come back together eventually.

If you feel like you just want to talk to someone, other than the people in your house; contact a teacher, counselor, Principal, para or secretary; any of them would be happy just to talk. We are all on Schoology, email, Zoom, or you can call the school, it is okay to reach out any time. We can even help you Zoom together with a group of friends if you ask.

We are making plans and will let you know about: locker cleanout, iPad turn-in, Yearbooks, and many other details. If you have paper homework to turn in, take it to a school or a lunch site and turn it in so you can get credit.

One Book | One Minnesota is a new statewide book club that invites Minnesotans of all ages to read a common title and come together virtually to enjoy, reflect, and discuss.

Libraries are essential for connection, and through One Book | One Minnesota, libraries across the state will connect their communities through stories. The program aims to bring Minnesotans closer together during this time of distance and adversity.

The first featured book selection is Because of Winn-Dixie by Kate DiCamillo (Candlewick Press). Here is the link to the book, if you do not have a copy of it at home to enjoy and read along: https://library.biblioboard.com/module/one-book-one-minnesota

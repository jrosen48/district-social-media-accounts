Here are two brief announcements regarding our school closure from March 18-27. First, no high school students will be allowed in the high school building. There may have been a miscommunication from one or more staff members, but to be clear, no high school students will be let in the building during the March 18-27 timeframe. This may be extended based on recommendations from the state government. If you have a question or need to drop-off or pick-up an item, you may contact the main office, but no visitors will be allowed past the main entrance doors.

Second, the spring Parent-Teacher Conferences scheduled for Thursday, April 2nd are postponed. Due to the school closure, the 3rd Quarter grading period has been extended to Friday, April 3rd. Rescheduling the spring Parent-Teacher Conferences will depend upon the date the school reopens.

The Governor of Minnesota and Commissioner of Education have announced (today) that schools will continue to be closed until (at least) April 30th. All distance learning programs for students will begin on Monday, March 30.

We will, however, by order of the Governor, continue providing daycare to families of essential workers. We will also continue providing free breakfast and lunch to students who want one.

We will send out additional information to you by no later than Friday morning of this week (March 27th) on this important topic.

For now, the most important information to know is that Virginia Public Schools, by order of the Governor, will not reopen on Monday, March 30.",2020-03-25 18:22:04,,

I want to let you know about an incident that occurred this morning. A Virginia High School student made a poor decision in sending an inappropriate text message to another Virginia student. In the text, the student making the inappropriate remarks made a vague statement warning a student to stay away from school. The incident was immediately addressed and is continuing to be investigated by the high school administration team and the Virginia Police Department. The investigation is ongoing and the incident has been resolved. There is no ongoing safety issue for students or staff.

We take student safety seriously at Virginia Public Schools and wanted to give you accurate information as to what actually happened. A voice alert was also sent to all families enrolled at Virginia Public Schools.

If you have any questions, you can call the high school office at (218) 749-5437.

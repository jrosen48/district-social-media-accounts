2️⃣ Oops! We had a typo in our original Roadmap. For grades 7-12, groups will be divided by alpha last name. Households with more than one last name will follow the schedule of the oldest child's last name. #GroupA = alpha A–K and #GroupB = alpha L–Z
3️⃣ Early next week we will announce the plans for ""Return to Learn: Orientation Week!"" This year's learning model will look different to most students and we want to help with this Fall 2020 transition. Stay tuned for this announcement!

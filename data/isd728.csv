WE MISS YOU!

Due to these unprecedented times and per Governor Walz’s requests, we will not have swimming lessons this spring. However, the Community Education Aquatics Staff believe practicing these lifesaving skills are still important! That being said, we will be posting swimming videos you can practice at home on Tuesdays and Thursdays starting tomorrow.

Here’s the great part:
We would LOVE to see you practicing these swimming skills! Like us on Facebook, create a post of you practicing and use the hashtag #swim728ceyouth. If we see you practicing your swimming skills at home, we will send out some PRIZES for your hard work!!

We will make it through this together, Aquatics Family! Let’s practice, practice, practice out of the water so then we will be that much better when we come back in the summer.",0.0,"Community Ed Youth

Thanks Bart Engvall for bringing some “positoovity” during these difficult times.

He wrote, “Hey all! So as all probably know, we had to cancel our spring production because of COVID-19. Many of us are sad because we have put in so much time and effort into this show. If you didn’t know, I was supposed to play Scuttle in our production. Scuttle gets to sing a little song called Positoovity in the show, which encourages Ariel to conquer her fears and stay positive. I felt that amidst of all the sadness and negativity in our world currently, everyone could use a little “Positoovity”, so I decided to share the makeup I was supposed to wear (and totally botched, sorry Kaytlin), and my first verse of my song (let’s just say maybe I could have used a few more singing practices) to remind you all that even though things may get tough and we will want to give up, we need to remember that silly little word to keep our hopes up and push forward in a scary time.”",0.0,"GREAT job Bart!

Please see the link below for details regarding the opening of school at both school buildings. This information will be reviewed at the school board meeting on Tuesday, August 25th prior to determining the school model for the start of the 2020-2021 school year. My recommendation for the board of education will be to start the school year with in-person learning for the elementary school and hybrid learning for the secondary school. Regardless of which building your child(ren) attends, all families have the option of selecting full-time remote learning for their child(ren). The District will review Covid-19 case data every two weeks to determine if a new learning model needs to be implemented. The initial learning model will be in place through September 25, 2020.

The kids got to see all the different parts of our farm and learn about cows and all the things we do to make our cows happy. It's such a rewarding experience teaching the younger generations.

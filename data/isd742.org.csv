She replied, 'It’s already awesome.'

She then repeated, 'Dad it’s Westwood, It IS awesome.'

So, I again told her they work on it to keep it awesome. She seemed to understand.

I thought it was so cute how much pride she has in her school. Hearing her say she thinks her school is awesome brought tears to my eyes.

We’ve been busy collecting books to donate to the PAKRAT Roll & Read Summer Book Bus, benefiting St. Cloud Area School District 742. This year, instead of checking books out, they’ll be providing books for kids to keep, until they run out of books. If you’d like to donate visit: https://bit.ly/3fbxneN

Dear Class of 2020 and Families,

I hope the summer is treating you well, and you enjoyed the unique graduation celebrations last month. As you know, we had hoped to gather the entire Class of 2020 together one last time in July. Regretfully, we will be unable to do so because CDC and MDH guidelines prohibit gatherings of over 250 people for the foreseeable future.

We wish you a safe, healthy summer and extend our sincere well-wishes as you take the next step in your journey. Know that we will always hold you close in our hearts and in our memories as one of the most remarkable, resilient graduating classes.

With highest regards,

We’re proud to recognize 67 schools and six school districts for their successful work using Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports (PBIS), a data-driven program that provides schools and districts with training and support to promote positive student behavior, especially for students facing challenges inside and outside of the classroom. Through evidence-based practices, this national program aims to make schools more responsive to the cultures and communities they serve. One important area of focus for the program is on decreasing disparities in discipline, which have historically had negative impacts on educational outcomes for students of color, American Indian students and students with disabilities. The schools receiving recognition are leaders in supporting positive behavior, improving school climate and increasing student achievement.

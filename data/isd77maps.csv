It is critically important that parents and families do their part to slow the spread of COVID-19. This role for parents and families includes:

Limiting potential exposure to COVID-19 by social distancing, wearing masks, and avoiding large crowds. Watching for potential symptoms and staying home when sick. Getting tested when appropriate and staying home while waiting for test results.

While all are eager to return back to school and connect with others in our school community, staff, students, and families need to follow guidance about when they should NOT be in school. If you are sick, stay home and consider COVID-19 testing. If you have had close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 in your home or in other activities, stay out of school for the full 14 days of quarantine.

By staying home when you are sick or have been exposed to a positive case, you are helping your community stay in school together.

In honor of Juneteenth Alison, our Family and Community Engagement Coordinator, suggests one way to gain a greater understanding of slavery is by reading historical fiction. Reading historical fiction can help create emotional connections to past events. By experiencing history through the eyes of characters you become emotionally invested in, it can help create a greater understanding.

Here is a list of 12 books she has read in 2020 portraying aspects of African American history and recommends:
The Invention of Wings by Sue Monk Kidd
Cane River by Lalita Tademy
Brown Girl Dreaming by Jacqueline Woodson
The Twelve Tribes of Hattie by Ayana Mathias
The Kitchen House and Glory Over Everything by Kathleen Grissom
The Nickel Boys and The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead
Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi
Beloved by Toni Morrison
The Dry Grass of August by Anna Jean Mayhew

I apologize. My statement yesterday was a missed opportunity to embrace and acknowledge the experiences, pain and challenges Abdi Sabrie expressed on his social media feed.

A special note from Kristi Lawton: (Tom and Lindseys mother)

‚ÄúI thank all of you so much for playing a part in shaping the future of my children! They were so fortunate to attend a school that actually even has a welding program. I know that is a rarity, especially in this day and age, but I hope that more high schools will consider adding classes in the trades to round out their curricula.

A tale of two young welders",7.0,"Check out this article in the Fabricator magazine that was just posted featuring siblings Tom Lawton (class of 2018) and Lindsey Lawton (class of 2020) and their journey into welding.

The article mentions Mankato East High School as the place where they got their start in a 9th grade welding class right up through their senior year internships at Jones Metal. It also mentions the AVID program and art classes. üíô

A special note from Kristi Lawton: (Tom and Lindseys mother)

‚ÄúI thank all of you so much for playing a part in shaping the future of my children! They were so fortunate to attend a school that actually even has a welding program. I know that is a rarity, especially in this day and age, but I hope that more high schools will consider adding classes in the trades to round out their curricula.

Enjoy the article!‚Äù
Kristi Lawton

NASA challenged students to design a piece of wearable technology that can protect astronauts heads and eyes from excessive radiation during solar particle events. Water is one of the best protective materials for this type of radiation so students creatively focused their design on using Orbeezs, water containing gel spheres, as the primary protective layer.

Students just completed the initial proposal stage of the competition and submitted the design concept you see in the photos below. The top five teams from across the United States will be selected to build their prototype and then travel to Langley Research Center in Virginia to share their finished product with NASA engineers. Advancing teams will be announced on March 20th! #NASA_WEAR #NASARadworks #Kato_WEAR

Dungeons and Dragons is a story-telling adventure game played through role-play. The students have spent a lot of time creating characters and some even planning the campaigns, or adventures, they are playing now.

We are grateful for community member and D&D expert, Mick Clackler Riquelme, for leading these students in learning about and playing this exciting game!

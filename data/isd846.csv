Breckenridge Schools lunch policy is that all students will be fed a healthy hot meal regardless of the family's lunch account balance. Knowing there are times when a family might go through a difficult financial time and need temporary help, a generous community member donated to the district asking that it be used to help cover unpaid lunch balances. This was the beginning of a fund known as Angel Funds. In addition to helping families with the hot lunch program, these funds are also used to ensure younger students receive a healthy snack during the school day regardless of their lunch account balance. Through generous staff and community donations, the fund has grown and provided support for many struggling families.

How the fundraiser will work: You can spread positivity and laughs by ""ducking"" your friends and family's yards. When you duck someone's yard it will be filled with rubber ducks and left up for 3 days unless they want to pay to get it removed earlier.

The money that is raised will go directly to local businesses in the form of gift cards that will then be given away to the community in the near future.

3. Keep Your Eyes Moving
The third standard of the Smith System asks drivers to remain alert. Energy drinks can only do so much before they cause the body to crash, and any repetitive motion sends us into a trance. Consistent eye movement prevents your body from entering the trance state, keeping you alert to every driving condition ahead of you.

1. Aim High
The first rule for this method is “Aim high in steering”. Staying alert of the dangers and traffic ahead not only avoids rear-end collisions, but it also alerts other drivers behind your vehicle to slow down. The driver should steer and focus their attention high, to view the road as whole and not just a few feet ahead.

The answer is probably obvious.

One day Mike was doing an RR stop. The warning lights were not flashing. Mike looked one way and looked the other. Much to his surprise, a train was moving and close. The crossing lights should have been on. The RR warning lights had failed.

RR crossings are a no passing zone, yet I get passed at one far too often. The passing vehicles are trusting that the warning lights are working and are driving into a blind and dangerous situation. Besides themselves, they are putting the entire bus at risk of GREAT harm. If caught, the driver can face a large fine upwards of $700.00. The possible charge may be a misdemeanor and include endangering others.

Please, slow down and look when crossing RR tracks. We are all worth it.

If you haven't heard, we're striving to provide a device for every student in our district. To do so, we need to collect all devices that were loaned out for distance learning last spring, and summer school sessions.

Now that all summer sessions have been completed, we're hosting another drop off event!

Please make every effort to drop off devices so we can reconfigure and prepare for the coming school year!

ALL Grade levels should be dropped off at the Rockford Middle School - Center for Environmental, DOOR 4 (please see map below). If no one is there to meet you in the parking lot, please use the intercom system to the right of the doors.

We want to thank Rockford Area Schools ISD 883 and Superintendent Rhonda Dean for coming out to the Hope Center at Maple Hill Estates! She made an effort to discover the communities' ideas on what school might look like this fall and how distance learning can be improved for our students! Many students took time to meet and share great ideas and then parents had their own time with Ms. Dean to share their thoughts as well. You showed by coming out that this community is just as important as every other and that you value our input. We are glad to have Rockford serving Mobile Hope families!",0.0,"Thank you to Mobile Hope for hosting Superintendent Dean and for gathering parents and students at the open house last week!

Distance learning coupled with the uncertainty of what will happen beyond May 4, 2020, is not what any of us could have predicted, and it is certainly NOT how our Senior #Classof2020 expected to spend their last semester of high school.

On Thursday, April 9th our softball, baseball and turf stadium fields at Rockford High School will have their stadium lights turned on for 124 minutes beginning at 8:20 pm.

Why 124 minutes at 8:20 pm?
· Lights on for 124 minutes signifies the number of seniors at RHS.

· Lights on at 8:20 pm is equivalent to 20:20 in military time, again in honor of the Class of 2020.

#BeTheLightMN is a movement to give seniors hope for tomorrow and the future. Please consider joining us in this movement by turning on your porch/outside lights at 8:20 pm as well.

Distance learning coupled with the uncertainty of what will happen beyond May 4, 2020, is not what any of us could have predicted, and it is certainly NOT how our Senior #Classof2020 expected to spend their last semester of high school.

On Thursday, April 9th our softball, baseball and turf stadium fields at Rockford High School will have their stadium lights turned on for 124 minutes beginning at 8:20 pm.

Why 124 minutes at 8:20 pm?
· Lights on for 124 minutes signifies the number of seniors at RHS.

· Lights on at 8:20 pm is equivalent to 20:20 in military time, again in honor of the Class of 2020.

#BeTheLightMN is a movement to give seniors hope for tomorrow and the future. Please consider joining us in this movement by turning on your porch/outside lights at 8:20 pm as well. We will get through this together - GO ROCKETS! 🚀",2020-04-08 13:02:19,,

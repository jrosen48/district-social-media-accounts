Hey Everyone!

I just wanted to pass along some information regarding some changes to the pick up and drop off process at Birchview.

This year, vehicles will enter the Birchview parking lot from the north entrance, and exit the parking lot to the east onto Hickory Street.

We are making these changes in response to a significant increase in the number of students who will be picked up and dropped off this year.

In an effort to maintain a safe and organized pick up/drop off environment, we ask for your patience and raised awareness during this new process.

Thank you, have a great rest of your day, and we can’t wait to see you around Noon tomorrow!

Edit/Update:

We will not be allowing parents to enter the building for pick up or drop off. We ask that you please remain in your vehicles during this process (unless you are unbuckling your child or something of that nature).

Thank you!",5.0,"Birchview Elementary School

You may have noticed that there is no driver listed for the Bus #10 route. We are currently looking for someone to cover this route, so if you know of anyone who may be interested, please have them contact Mr. Byce at (906)315-1701.

One month ago today I had an idea.💡

I discovered a need that felt too big to fill alone.

1000 3D printed face shields were needed!
I knew my colleagues would help. And I have network marketing skills😎. So I went to work!

I had no idea it would grow into this.
The network grew so quickly. Makers from all over the region rallied. Word spread. People I never met before joined in and went full throttle towards our goal.

More organizations and businesses reached out for our help. 🙏
And even more stepped up to donate and support our work.💪

As of today this crew has turned in 4,151 3D printed face shields which were distributed all over the Upper Peninsula. And this graphic doesn't even show all the efforts around the U.P.! This is just the little effort that I sparked with a little social media magic. ❤️🙏

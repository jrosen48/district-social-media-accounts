Today, March 21, 2020, the District received a call from the Lincoln Orens Middle School employee who notified us last week of COVID-19 testing. This afternoon, the individual told us that the test results are positive for COVID-19. The employee was last at work on March 13, 2020 and will not return to work until an appropriate health care professional determines it is safe to do so. We have been in touch with the Nassau County Department of Health but due to a backlog of cases, they may not be able to confirm the case for us for another day or two. Nevertheless we want you to know what we know. We continue to be in contact with the local and state health authorities and will keep you advised of any developments, including anyone that we believe may have had direct contact with the employee. In the meantime, please be vigilant in the safety procedures implemented by state and local authorities, and join us in hoping for a complete recovery for our employee.

In November, the Builders and Island Park Kiwanis Clubs teamed up at the local King Kullen and collected four overflowing shopping carts of nonperishable food items. The donations were packaged for families in time for Thanksgiving, and the Kiwanis Club also supplied gift cards for turkeys.

Builders Club students are currently creating handmade holiday cards to give to all residents living in Senior Housing in Island Park. They will also hold their annual ""Cocoa for Cancer"" fundraiser during lunch periods later on in the season.",2019-12-09 15:13:17,,

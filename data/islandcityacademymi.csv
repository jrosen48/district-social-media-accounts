Just a brief reminder of a few changes from last year to help with social distancing.

* We are using three separate entryways and the doors will open at 7:50 AM to allow more time. Classes will still start at 8:10 AM so you have 20 minutes not 10 minutes for drop-off.

* 1st, 2nd, 3rd Grades - Use the playground entry door
* Kinder, 7th, 8th Grades - Main Entrance
* 4th, 5th, 6th Grades - Use walkway near the dumpster
* All students report directly to their classroom, not the gym

* Latch-key students can arrive starting at 6:45 AM and report directly to the gym.

* Pre-K students drop-off starting at 7:35 AM to avoid the rush and allow more social distancing

* Dismissal - This year dismissal will not be lined-up outside but we will send students out when parents arrive. We will start dismissal at 3:00 PM, but our school day won't end until 3:15. We are allowing early dismissal again to allow more time to socially distance. Rather than doing it in 15 minutes, we will have 30 minutes to exit the building.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=4609379115753905&id=168472493177945,,0.0,"We are so excited to see everyone tomorrow morning!

I worked as a lunch aide, after school latchkey helper and a substitute teacher for ICA for about two years. I also have served as a member of the PTO for about 4 years. I am a graduate of Michigan State University (Go Green!) and recently, I earned my teaching certificate. I spent last year teaching English and Creative Writing in Jackson, MI. My husband and I have two children, Benjamin (5th grade) and Adeline (4th grade). We also have a silly chocolate lab named Toby, two cats and most recently 18 chickens. They all keep me very busy!

We could not be more excited that Executive Order 2020-110 allows libraries to start reopening next week!

However, we have some work to do before we can safely serve you.

Our reopening will begin with vestibule pickup.

We ask that you please hold onto book donations, since we are not in a position to accept them yet.

Watch our website (www.eradl.org), Facebook and Instagram page for more information.

As Mr. Warren mentioned yesterday in his announcement we will have the 2019 - 2020 yearbook this year. Mrs. B has once again done an amazing job with the yearbook and I've been told that she has some great candid photos of both staff and students. The yearbooks are $15 each and they should be arriving in the next week or two.

You can pay for your yearbook over the next two weeks when you drop-off your Chromebooks and other school supplies. If you would prefer to pay online we can send you an invoice again just let us know.

To order a yearbook in advance you can either call the school at 517-663-0111 or e-mail Mr. Warren at wawrren@islandcity.org.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=4094962290528926&id=168472493177945,,0.0,"Good Afternoon,

As we start our Thanksgiving week we wanted to remind everyone of the schedule this week. We will have our Board Sponsored Thanksgiving Luncheon on Tuesday including our Pre K students. The lunch is a turkey luncheon catered and served by our School Board. Students will be released after lunch at 1:30 that afternoon, we are closed Wednesday through Friday for the holiday.

Parents also just a reminder of our 24-hour policy when it comes to vomiting and fevers. If your child is vomiting or has a fever please ensure they are free of both for at least 24 hours before returning to school. This will hopefully help us prevent the passing of the sickness around the classrooms. We have had a lot of recurring illnesses this year and we want to try and prevent it as we move into the winter. Also, please help remind your child to wash their hands with soap and water often, but especially after using the restroom.

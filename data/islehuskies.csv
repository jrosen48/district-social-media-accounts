On April 23 during two different time slots your students can attend an online college fair to help them connect with top schools around the country -- without needing to leave their homes.

Students can tune in to two panel discussions:

“Tips on Creating Your College List”
“Behind the Scenes: How Admissions Decisions Are Made”

They can drop into virtual rooms where admissions officers from more than 40 schools will share information about their college and answer questions in real time.

Learn more and register for this free event, recommended for students in grades 9-11.

To better use social distancing and to simplify the process for pick-ups and deliveries, we are asking you to create a drop box at the end of your driveway. Any weather resistant container with a secure lid such as a tote or cooler would be great.

UPDATE***
We will now be serving in our event center located in the hotel.
We have secured to-go boxes, if you have the means to communicate that you will be coming and can let us know in advance then we can have it ready for you. This will help us limit how many people gather at once.
With the local schools shutting down we understand that many in our local and surrounding communities will be working less and would appreciate a meal . We would like to offer those in need, especially those with children, free dinner between 6pm and 8pm on the following dates: Thursday March 19 hot beef sandwiches and macaroni salad, Monday March 23 Heggies Pizzas, and Thursday March 26 spaghetti with a meat sauce. We will also provide apple juice, fruit punch, and tap water. Feel free to bring your own drinks as well, no alcohol please. Meals will be in our Cedar Room. We are not a restaurant so what we offer is all that we will have available.",2.0,"McQuoid's Inn and Event Center

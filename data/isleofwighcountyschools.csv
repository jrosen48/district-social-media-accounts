Isle of Wight County Schools has stationed four school buses at areas throughout the county to provide an additional resource for families who may not have internet access at home. The buses are located at the Otelia Rainey Center in Camptown, Bethany Presbyterian Church in Zuni, First Gravel Hill Baptist Church in Smithfield, and the Carrollton Cove Shoppes in Carrollton. The buses will be parked in these locations through the end of the current academic year. The hope is that families can use these hot spots to download assignments for their children that can be worked on at home.
In addition to the buses, all nine schools in the division have a wireless signal accessible from their parking lots. IWCS created a flyer that identifies the location of the buses and schools, as well as other options for free WiFi throughout the county.

Other finalists were Nia Boyd and Phetchinda Mady. In the Middle School Writing Division, Campbell Lowery received First place, with Lily Lufkin and Terrance Booker selected as finalists. The prompt asked participants to write a dialogue where they are the grandchild of a Holocaust survivor.

The Hardy Elementary School Archery Team’s success in the Regional Archery Tournament in Newport News, VA has qualified them to compete at the state level. The state tournament will be held in Doswell, VA on March 14, 2020.

Hardy implemented the National Archery in Schools Program (NASP) during the fall of 2018. The program focuses on fourth through twelfth graders and is designed to improve education performance. Michael Cooke, the physical education teacher at Hardy Elementary, serves as the coach of the program. All fourth graders are exposed to archery through their physical education class. Students interested in the archery team stay after school for additional practice time.

“Having been a NASP Instructor since 2007, I have seen the positive impact it has on students,” said Cooke. “It gives them a sense of belonging. It provides them a reason to want to come to school and be successful.”

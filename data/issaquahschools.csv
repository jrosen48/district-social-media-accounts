Dear ISD Community,

Following up on our earlier communication, the Issaquah School District is following Governor Jay Inslee’s directive to make contingency plans for possible school closures. While some of our neighboring districts have made a decision to close starting tomorrow, we are continuing to follow the advice of health officials. At this time, Public Health Seattle & King County continues to recommend that schools stay open. Therefore, All ISD Schools will be on a regular schedule tomorrow.

However, the Issaquah School District will close when guidance is given to the District by the State of Washington or Public Health of Seattle & King County or in the event we do not have sufficient staff to safely operate school. Please note: we have been informed that we will receive more direction from the Governor’s office on Thursday and will update the community as soon as we have additional information to share.

“I especially love the inclusive aspect of CTE. Through these courses students can realize and expand skills they didn’t know they had. One of my favorite moments in class is when a student makes connections between what they have learned in their core classes in combination with discovering their own interests.”

Teri Langdon is the kitchen manager a Skyline High School. She started working in the Skyline kitchen 20 years ago when her own kids were in school. They’re grown up now, but Teri’s still there because she loves the team she works with and the challenges of the job. She works hard to provide good meals and keep costs down.

It’s Classified School Employees Week, and we want to celebrate by introducing you to five of our 1,280 incredible classified staff members. Check back every school day this week to meet another ISD employee who makes school happen.

It takes a lot of time, work and dedication to keep our schools running, and it couldn’t happen without our classified staff. They provide crucial support in classrooms. They ensure buildings are clean, safe and functional. They make school technology work. They drive kids safely to school and back. They prepare the meals that let students focus on learning. They serve students, staff and parents in our offices. They show students what hard work and commitment look like.

Nurses help improve attendance at school by promoting health and disease prevention and management.

• Care for students with chronic health conditions such as diabetes, epilepsy, heart conditions and asthma
• Write annual student care plans
• Provide vision and hearing screenings
• Plan for and respond to emergencies
• Track communicable diseases

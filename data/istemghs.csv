Adriel gained both business skills and cosmetology practice at her iSEE partner, B. Anthony’s Salon. Adriel was enrolled in Auburn Career Center’s Cosmetology program, and found a great outlet for her interest in working for a salon through B. Anthony’s.

She initially sought to create and market a promotion for a manicure/pedicure service, and would then compare her results from the promotion against sales from previous years. She was unable to complete the promotion, because the salon closed in response to COVID 19.

However, Adriel said “it was great to get a look on the inside” of a salon, and learn “how to manage money for a business sustainably.” Her future plans include working for a salon, as well as entering the nursing program at Lakeland Community College!

Jonathon worked at Hearn Plumbing Heating & Air in Madison for his iSEE project. He transferred all written service records, which had previously been stored on Rolodexes, from 1990 on to a professional software database. He learned how to work with the details of the business, “identifying pieces of plumbing and HVAC equipment by their model and serial numbers.”

He also learned the personal interactions that go into small business practice. He was better able to “understand the web of connections between members of a company … [and] this experience has taught me to appreciate all of the work that goes into making businesses function well.”

His attention to detail and understanding of how people work together will serve him well as he heads on to Kent State University this fall to study History and Education!

Cooper, for his senior experience, worked at LaMalfa Event Center, where he “would do all kinds of things … from shadowing and helping the managers to scraping off dishes in the kitchen.” This broad set of experiences will aid him in his future post-secondary studies in business management.

In particular, he saw a need to streamline the Event Center’s event menu board, and had plans to work on this project prior to the Center closing due to COVID-19. His time at LaMalfa was long enough for him to discover something about himself. He realized, “I really love the idea of selling things to people.

At Turner, he could get experience in the non-design elements of civil engineering, the field he will study this fall Cleveland State University. Tyler would proofread Requests for information, especially ensuring accuracy of numerical data, and also write close out documents for each subcontractor.

The project he was assigned to ended up being sidelined by COVID-19, but not before he gained experience in “proofreading, analyzing data, communicating with business partners, and lastly understanding and solving problems.” He felt like he was pushed out of his comfort zone to obtain this position at Turner, and hopes to continue working there!

Mary worked at the Animal Clinic of Chardon for her iSEE project, where she gained experience with small business practices, as well as exposure in general to veterinary medicine. She will graduate at the end of this year with her Associates of Science from Lakeland Community College because of her enrollment in the CCP program, and in the fall, attend Ohio State University to study biology and/or zoology. Her intent is to become a veterinarian herself!

At the Animal Clinic, she focused on marketing for new hires at the practice, and developed promotions for the Clinic to use. Through her experience, she learned about “the different kinds of things that a business can do to market themselves and get people interested in applying.” She also “got a good feeling for what clinic life is like” and leaves the experience assured in her chosen field of study!

Taylor worked with Alt Media Studios of Mayfield, a marketing company designated as a Google Partner. A “Google Partner” badge is awarded to companies that demonstrate Google ads expertise. Taylor used graphic design skills she was taught through her Lakeland Community College CCP courses to design graphics for Google and Youtube.

Her iSEE experience at Alt Media allowed Taylor “to make actual connections in the work field outside of school.” She will delay further coursework, instead hoping to continue her internship after she graduates this May. She also completed classes in American Sign Language at Lakeland, and, if she decides to work in a different field than graphic design, would like to be an ASL interpreter.

For his iSEE, Cody worked on a unique collaboration with classmates Riley Weist and Jackson Senning to update computer networks at local Habitat for Humanity offices. Each office had different network standards and security protocols; Cody’s experience in Auburn Career Center's Mobile Applications & Technology program made him an ideal team member to address these problems.

Cody’s work at Habitat for Humanity gave him a new perspective on his future: “I’ve learned a lot about the career path I’m most interested in, broadening my interests more into the networking side than they were prior.” He plans to take a gap year after high school and then pursue a degree, hopefully at Bowling Green State University.

For his iSEE, Cody worked on a unique collaboration with classmates Riley Weist and Jackson Senning to update computer networks at local Habitat for Humanity offices. Each office had different network standards and security protocols; Cody’s experience in Auburn Career Center's Mobile Applications & Technology program made him an ideal team member to address these problems.

Cody’s work at Habitat for Humanity gave him a new perspective on his future: “I’ve learned a lot about the career path I’m most interested in, broadening my interests more into the networking side than they were prior.” He plans to take a gap year after high school and then pursue a degree, hopefully at Bowling Green State University.

He worked one-on-one with a few students to make progress toward their math achievement goals and helped coordinate with some behind-the-scenes preparations for the Beyond Camp held in the summer. His supervisor reported that Oliver was very patient and good at explaining the math concepts to students ... and tracking their progress daily. The attention to details and tracking will help Oliver in the future as he plans on studying mechanical and aerospace engineering at the University of Akron. He hopes to put these skills into use for engineering entrepreneurial goals for the future.

Miss Beattie grew up with a deep interest in history, stemming from her grandfather’s passion for storytelling and family genealogy. This motivated her to pursue a career where she could be around others, and teach them about history and the social sciences. Miss Beattie graduated from Kent State University in 2019 with a B.S. in Education, where she studied Integrated Social Studies with a concentration in Sociology.

When she’s not with the iSTEM family, Miss Beattie enjoys spending time outdoors, learning new recipes, relaxing with a good book, soaking up a Sunday at a local cafe, or spending time with her family and friends. She runs purely on coffee, loves to laugh, and is always open to new podcast suggestions (historical or not).

They are going to be modeling the way that climate change will affect agriculture in certain areas and make predictions and conduct risk analysis for adapting and adjusting for the future! Many thanks to Miss Wright for coordinating this experience!

Miss Wright is in her 7th year of teaching, both on a high school and college level. She completed her master’s degree in pure math in 2012 from Youngstown State University after completing her thesis on RSA and Public Key Encryption, and in 2015, became a founding staff member of iSTEM.

Though she loves math, she does a lot outside of school as well, including spending time with her family, helping out with the family floral business and church groups, attending local theatrical productions and concerts, traveling, and enjoying the outdoors!

Down 8-0 in the championship to a team that is a fundamentally sound as it gets, our young men had their character tested and passed. Clawed away inning by inning with big time hits and walks coming from all up and down the lineup. Combined with an outstanding performance in relief by Andrew Arellano, these young men beat Abbott 9-8. Great weekend of baseball, we got better. Now a rematch vs. Abbott on Tuesday for district game #1.

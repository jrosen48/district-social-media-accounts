Early childhood students and families at The Inspired Teaching Demonstration School began to work on a #BlackLivesMatter mural this morning. Students in Pk3 through 8th grade will have the opportunity to add their messages throughout the week as part of the D.C. Area Black Lives Matter Week of Action in Schools. We will post stories from throughout the week here: https://www.dcareaeducators4socialjustice.org/blm/stories",2018-02-06 15:07:45,,

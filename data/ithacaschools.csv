Here are the facts that I know as of 8:45 a.m. A drug suspect fled on foot (west end of Alma) the police followed and have the suspect surrounded, the situation is under control. No shots fired, no guns seen or reported. As a precaution Alma schools moved their Luce Road students and staff to Alma HS since the incident was on the west end of town.

We will continue the soft lock down until the situation is resolved in Alma. Understand that the area superintendents and local law enforcement work closely together on these situations, we train for them, and we communicate with each other on a regular basis.

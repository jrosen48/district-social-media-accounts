This morning the Jackson County Commissioners signed a resolution modifying the state executive order regarding mask usage. Jackson County has opted to make wearing a mask in places where you can not keep six feet from others a strong recommendation. Please see the order below. Governor Kelly has also released guidance as to when mask wearing is and is not recommended. (See the link below.)

Our office is encouraging all persons and businesses/organizations to follow these recommendations. We understand that these are challenging times in our county, state and nation. We ask for you to help us in reducing the spread of this virus by wearing a mask, staying six feet from others when possible, washing your hands frequently and staying home when you are ill.

With high school students across the state home from school the Kansas State Treasurer’s Office has a great new tool we have launched to help parents and students find money to pay for educational opportunities after high school. Whether you have a student looking at tech school, vocational school, or a traditional college we are thrilled to announce that we have partnered with Sallie Mae to provide an exceptional way to access over 5-million scholarships worth over $24-billion quickly and easily on our new Kansas ScholarShop website.

We tested this platform at Washburn Rural High School in February, before schools were suspended for COVID-19, and the students and teachers had great success searching. The website is now ready to be used by students statewide.

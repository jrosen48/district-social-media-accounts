The Tennessee Valley Authority, in partnership with Bicentennial Volunteers Incorporated (a TVA retiree organization), recently awarded Jackson County High School, $2500 for a STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education project.

Kent Shepherd, Biology Teacher at JCHS shared, “We are so excited to have the opportunity to use this grant to expose more students to our beautiful resources here in Jackson County.”

The project Jackson County High School submitted will provide wet suits and water quality kits to extend the time we can spend researching The Boils Wildlife Management Area and our state park Cummins Falls. Twice this year students spent time snorkeling at these areas with professionals from TWRA, TDEC and our State Parks.

Today, as many of you know, President Trump announced that he is making an emergency declaration to address the Coronavirus pandemic. The president declared emergencies under several different provisions of the law, which he said would not only free up nearly $50 billion in disaster money to fight the spread of the virus but also expand capacity at hospitals and reduce other health regulations that could slow action. You may ask; what does this mean for us? Here are the two main reasons for the declaration.

1. It frees up and redirects money and resources to help fight the pandemic. This means that Jackson County could be reimbursed for money spent directly related to helping fight the virus.

2.Allows the Department of Health and Human Services to modify or waive regulations for Medicare, Medicaid and other programs. Waiving those regulations would also bring about changes to the broader medical system. This includes making it easier for you to access a doctor online instead of having to actually go to the doctor.",0.0,"Jackson County Emergency Management

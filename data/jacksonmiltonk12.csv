Here are a couple important updates.

In regards to CURRICULUM, it is very important for students in grades 3-12 check their school issued emails a couple times daily.

It is also important that students and parents to understand that students are expected to complete assignments as they will be used towards their grade. School work for students in K-2 will have their work placed in folders. These folders will be placed in the main entrance of each building and can be picked-up at anytime.

For students in 3-12 that do not have internet access or the use of a printer (if needed) there will be folders in the front lobby of their respective building.

This Mr. Baker with a few important updates.

Just a reminder, there is no school for the next three weeks, starting Monday, March 16, 2020. No students are to report to school starting Monday, March 16, 2020.

Monday is a Waiver Day for all staff, and we will be preparing the best ways to provide high-quality curriculum for our students.

At this time no one will be in the buildings next Tuesday- Friday.

Starting March 23- April 3, 2020, staff will be in the buildings to prepare daily curriculum and answer any questions by calling their classroom extension or through email.

I will do another parent broadcast later next week to provide you with more details in regards to March 23-April 3.

We understand this is difficult and everything is on a daily basis.

Again, there is no school for three weeks starting March 16, 2020.

Please follow the Jackson-Milton School District Website and our district Facebook page for any updates.

Thank you and Go Jays!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=663859614381013&id=291303934969918,,0.0,"Dear Blue Jay Family,

Hey all,
Upcoming events are still being discussed to figure out when they will happen. So stay tuned for updates with things like Prize Bingo, DC Bus trip, Hot Stove Baseball/Softball....etc. in the next day or so.

Reminder, the people that plan all of this stuff are average joe parents volunteers, like myself, many of which also have to figure out their own lives over the next few weeks, so we really appreciate your patients with us as we work out new details for all of these things.

I promise, once new info is available it will be communicated immediately.

Julio Hernandez - Michigan Center, Senior; Ben Tripp - JPEC, Junior; and Taryn Ratliff - East Jackson, Junior, took some time out of their summer vacation to test for Adobe certification for Photoshop - and all three passed!

The Adobe Certified Associate certification is an industry-recognized credential that effectively validates one's expertise - proving they have the skills and knowledge to meet the demands of today's design industry.

We would like to remind all seventh grade students that tomorrow Tuesday October 29th is Challenge Day. Students should arrive to EIC by 7:45am. Ms. Hillman will meet students and walk them to Walker Hall. Challenge Day programs go beyond traditional anti-bullying efforts, building compassion and igniting a movement of positive change. The experience is inspiring and awakening for students and adults. Parent chaperones please remember the day begins at 7:30am.",2019-10-28 19:01:06,,

Here is your press pass. We need everybody's help to continue telling the story of life and learning in the Jackson Local Schools. We still hope to produce our year-end edition of Polar Bear Pride and make regular posts on this page.

HERE'S HOW TO SUBMIT.
1. Email the photo(s) to me, Paula Blangger, at pmb1jc@jackson.sparcc.org
2. Include in the email
• a few details about what’s happening in the photo(s)
• names, school and grade level of people in the photo(s) from left to right

Don’t worry about writing a story. I’ll do that for us. Just blab to me about what is going on. And although it’s not necessary, feel free to gather quotes from kids or others involved. To get the conversation started with young people, I often ask questions such as: What do/did you like most/least about (whatever is going on)? What will you remember about this when you are much older? How has this made you a better thinker/learner/person? What was the scariest/hardest/most satisfying/most exciting thing about this?",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2842980382465220&id=121865554576730,,0.0,"JOIN THE LOIS AND CLARK BRIGADE

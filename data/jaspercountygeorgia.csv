As you are beginning to receive your absentee ballots there is no white envelope. The instructions tell you put the ballot in the white envelope and then into the outer envelope. There is a white piece of paper that the State is calling a sleeve and they ask that you put the ballot in the sleeve and then into the outer envelope. You will sign your name on the flap of the outer envelope and then print your name on the line provided. Please be patient as I am trying to get these ballots entered into the computer so that they can be sent out for delivery. If you have any questions please call me at 706-468-4908.

Recently, we were made aware of a potential scam that is being mailed to our residents. The letters come as a sales contract for your property and offers a quick cash sale. The issue is that the contract is for an amount that is substantially less that the value of the property. This contract, if signed and returned, could leave you homeless for a fraction of the value of your property.
Additionally, as we get closer to the end of the year, phone calls from scammers will continue to increase and their demands will get bolder and more creative. Simply put, do not give anyone, any information over the phone, ESPECIALLY your personal information.
NO ONE is legitimately going to settle a real debt with you over the phone in exchange for Itunes or any other kind of gift card. Unfortunately, if you fall victim to one of these scams, the likelihood of ever getting your money back is very low.",0.0,"Jasper County Sheriff's Office

I apologize for posting the wrong project location for patching and upcoming pavement work on Hwy 212 in Jasper County Georgia.

It's on the east side between Hwy 16 and the Putnam County Board of Commissioners GA line.

Patching was complete in this area Monday. The crew must wait 30 days until more surface treatment (rock layers) are added.

JISD has spent the last couple days trying to gather as much information as possible on everyone‚Äôs situation. As of this afternoon (before all the power went out again) the City of Jasper projected that 98% of their customers would have power restored. JNEC had 6,000 customers without power in Jasper County, although much of that is south of Jasper. JISD still has many of our students and staff without power. Many folks have not yet returned or are just now returning to their homes and have lots of clean up to do. Internet is working fine in some areas and we are told will be out for several days and/or weeks in others. There are lots of people working very hard to restore power and internet and we thank them for their hard work. Because of the number of staff and students projected to be without power for several more days Jasper ISD will be closed for the rest of the week and will start back school on Tuesday, September 8th.

Please stay safe and continue to pray for those who have had devastation from this storm.

At this time we are understanding it would be Monday at the earliest to restore power to most of our area and this could be pushed to later in the week.

After consulting with Jasper County Officials, at this time, Jasper ISD is cancelling school for the rest of the week beginning Tuesday, August 25- Friday, August 28. All students and staff will finish the rest of the day as normal. There is great uncertainty at this time with Hurricane/TS Laura and we are being told to be prepared for a possible category 3 hurricane. With evacuations being called or expected to be called in the counties and cities to our south (Golden Triangle) we anticipate high traffic conditions with possible contraflow on HWY 96 beginning tomorrow. Therefore, it is in the best interest of everyone that we suspend school for the week, allowing families the freedom to leave if desired. We will not be offering virtual education (Asynchronous Learning) during this time and do have extra time built into our calendar. We ask that everyone focus on your safety and health during this time and we will keep you updated with regard to school re-opening and other news.

Stay Safe,

After consulting with Jasper County Officials, at this time, Jasper ISD is cancelling school for the rest of the week beginning Tuesday, August 25- Friday, August 28. All students and staff will finish the rest of the day as normal. There is great uncertainty at this time with Hurricane/TS Laura and we are being told to be prepared for a possible category 3 hurricane. With evacuations being called or expected to be called in the counties and cities to our south (Golden Triangle) we anticipate high traffic conditions with possible contraflow on HWY 96 beginning tomorrow. Therefore, it is in the best interest of everyone that we suspend school for the week, allowing families the freedom to leave if desired. We will not be offering virtual education (Asynchronous Learning) during this time and do have extra time built into our calendar. We ask that everyone focus on your safety and health during this time and we will keep you updated with regard to school re-opening and other news.

Stay Safe,

John Seybold",2020-08-24 14:10:27,,

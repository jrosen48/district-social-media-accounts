We recently received word that the Jersey City Board of Education is going to put forward a resolution calling for a moratorium on charter schools in Jersey City at Thursday's (tomorrow!) 6pm Board Meeting. This resolution is a direct attack on charter schools in Jersey City, including our school. The Board of Education is seeking to eliminate the opportunity for thousands of students to attend great, public charter schools in our city. Previously approved growth of charters may also be in jeopardy.

Charters are under attack and WE NEED YOU! Please come out to the board meeting tomorrow, January 18th at 6pm with parents across the city to oppose this moratorium.

Dear Parents and Guardians:

Last year, JCGCS submitted an expansion request to the NJDOE hoping to expand its charter from grades K-6 to a K-8 school. Our goal is to provide a high-quality education for students in a nurturing atmosphere as they progress towards higher-grade levels.

It is with great joy that I personally inform you that our expansion request has been approved by the NJDOE.
Over the course of the last five years JCGCS has become a strong beacon of hope for the Jersey City community. Our innovative educators and staff members are truly committed and dedicated to ensuring that the needs of all students are met. We are proud of our accomplishments and will expand to the eighth grade by the 2019-2020 academic school year.

In addition, JCGCS will be submitting an application later this year to the NJDOE to operate Pre K (4 year old) program. We will keep you posted on this progress and would like to thank you for your continued support.

There is never enough words that can appreciate any teacher or their hardwork in growth and development of a kid. They are like second parents and do all they can to give best to a child for their better future.

I cannot thank enough to Ms Villatore for her patience and her skills for making a great experience for my son Krupesh.

He has learn so much in this year at JCGCS and without support, guidance and enthusiasm of teachers it would have not been possible.

Nature
By: Khyathi Bulusu

Nature is as beautiful as a peacock,
Nature is as helpful as water and food,
Nature is as kind as your best friend,
Nature gives you life like mothers,
Nature is the best teacher,
But it won’t stay the same, If we destroy it.
People need nature, But nature doesn’t need people.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1504956452870275&id=377631648936100,,0.0,"Congratulations are in order for 5th Grade student Khyathi Bulusu!

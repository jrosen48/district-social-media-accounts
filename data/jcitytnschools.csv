Each week PTA will be introducing you to a few of our amazing faculty/staff members. We want you to know our Fairmont family since we aren’t able to really be in the building and together like usual!! 🖤💛🐝

First up: Mrs. Leslie Snapp! (Kindergarten)

1. My family consists of my husband Jordan, myself, and our three children, Bennett,6 Sophie,4 and Leah,3. We have one orange cat named Roscoe and 10 cows in our fields.

2. My favorite snack is anything salty, followed by anything sweet. But, seriously chips.

3. The best part of being a teacher is that each ""work"" day feels like fun instead of work. I get to spend time with my favorite people, both young and grown. I get to do what I love each day and that is a blessing.

4. My favorite children's books are The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein or Just in Case You Ever Wonder by Max Lucado. My favorite chapter book series is the Boxcar Children. (I read those in 1st grade when Mrs. McGill was my teacher)

5. I have many quotes I love but, my favorite is: If you want to change the world, go home and love your family. -Mother Teresa",3.0,"Fairmont Elementary PTA

From Johnson City Press reporter Tanner Cook...

Science Hill junior and two-time cross country All-American Jenna Hutchins won the Music City Distance Carnival (Nashville) 3,200 meters on Saturday evening in a new meet and state record of 9:49.83, besting Rebecca Story’s state record by about 10 seconds.

Hutchins’ time is now fifth best in US High School history (at least according to the US Milesplit databases; includes all conversions from two miles) and is only about two seconds off of Katelyn Tuohy’s official HS national record.

Hutchins now owns the state record for the 1,600 meters (4:43.33 from last year’s MCDC), 3,200 meters (9:49.83) and is second on the all-time list for girls cross country 5K (16:38.97 from Desert Twilight XC Festival last fall).

You can still order at the link below. And never fear - once the last few are claimed, more signs are coming! We have ordered more...they should be ready around the end of the week and we will deliver immediately. Thank you for your support of our seniors!

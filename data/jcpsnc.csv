If yellow buses come through your neighborhood delivering meals to students, you can make a sign for your yard, sidewalk or driveway to thank them. If you utilize the drive-thru at a school or community meal site, you can create a sign for your car to display a message of gratitude as you drive by. As you say thank you, maintain social distancing to keep school staff, children and families safe. Take photos of your cards or signs and post to social media tagging #NCSchoolNutritionHeroes, @ncschoolmeals and @ncpublicschools so everyone can see and help share the love for our School Nutrition teams.

WE HAVE A WINNER!!!

Today, we got to present the winner of the inaugural Jackson County Arts Council's tshirt design competition. We were blown away with the entries we received and had a very hard decision. We chose the winning artwork because it displayed many different aspects of what makes Jackson County so unique... dogwood trees, waterfalls and the historic courthouse, which is where our office is located.

AND THE WINNER IS....
Josie Smoker, senior at Jackson Community School (formerly known as School of Alternatives) and an enrolled member of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. What an amazing young woman and artist! We give thanks to her art teacher, Christina Daniels, for encouraging Josie to enter the competition and supporting her throughout the process. Great teachers produce outstanding students and artists. Congratulations Josie and Ms. Daniels!

T-shirts will be available for purchase soon. Please consider purchasing a shirt to support JCAC and so you can own a piece of Josie's artwork! When she's a famous artist one day you will wish you had a shirt...just saying!",0.0,"Jackson County Arts Council

We still have a long way to go, so the bus will be back in Dillsboro this coming Friday and Saturday night.

JMA staff, students and parents hosted and participated in the first EVER Fall Festival on Friday, Oct. 28th from 3-7 p.m. The festival was a HUGE success and fun was had by all, which was evident by all the positive comments and smiles as everyone left the campus!! Thank you to all who volunteered to ensure the festival was a success and memorable for the students at JMA. It could not have been successful without parent/guardian assistance, CONCILIO and support from our parent liaison, Ms. Gonzalez. Several staff members helped organized the festival and put in extra time in planning the event. The money raised will be added to our JMA library fund for grades pre-12. Thanks again to everyone!

JMA staff, students and parents hosted and participated in the first EVER Fall Festival on Friday, Oct. 28th from 3-7 p.m. The festival was a HUGE success and fun was had by all, which was evident by all the positive comments and smiles as everyone left the campus!! Thank you to all who volunteered to ensure the festival was a success and memorable for the students at JMA. It could not have been successful without parent/guardian assistance, CONCILIO and support from our parent liaison, Ms. Gonzalez. Several staff members helped organized the festival and put in extra time in planning the event. The money raised will be added to our JMA library fund for grades pre-12. Thanks again to everyone!

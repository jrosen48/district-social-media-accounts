We have sent our community an email this evening announcing a change to our schedule. Beginning Monday, March 16 our school buildings will be closed for in-person classes. For the entire week, through March 20, all Jeffco Public Schools facilities will be closed to non-employees. We will transition to a Remote Learning and Work Plan where students will learn from home during next week. We will send follow up communications about what this means tomorrow morning, Friday, March 13. This message will also be posted on our website. Please review it as soon as possible to ensure you are prepared. Thank you for your support.

Last August, Wheat Ridge Parks staff began collaborating with Wilmore-Davis Elementary students to design three pods for the nature play area to be incorporated on the east side of Anderson Park. Students completed kickoff meetings and site visits, and worked on their designs throughout the fall semester. After the site visits, the primary pathway (pictured) to the nature play area was installed.

Students will present their designs to Parks and Recreation staff and the National Wildlife Federation later this month.

And finals week. And the holiday season.

Pretty sure we all need this cat right now.

If you are feeling the stress of tests, the holidays, or anything else, we've got a few tips to help you manage the feelings and get through it all (remember, there are cookies on the other side of Friday):
* Take short breaks from studying/work - get outside for a few minutes and enjoy some fresh air and sunshine.
* Stay hydrated! And be sure to eat a good meal pre-test/work (pack snacks as well).
* In a moment of stress, focus on your breath. Slowly in through your nose, hold, then even slower out through your mouth.

Pretty sure we all need this cat right now.

If you are feeling the stress of tests, the holidays, or anything else, we've got a few tips to help you manage the feelings and get through it all (remember, there are cookies on the other side of Friday):
* Take short breaks from studying/work - get outside for a few minutes and enjoy some fresh air and sunshine.
* Stay hydrated! And be sure to eat a good meal pre-test/work (pack snacks as well).
* In a moment of stress, focus on your breath. Slowly in through your nose, hold, then even slower out through your mouth.

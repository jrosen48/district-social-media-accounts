It's time for An Alligator Hunt! Grab the family and head out to explore what our amazing town has to offer. We want to spend the entire week celebrating our hometown Author, Celia Joe Black, and Illustrator, Jessica Inez Trahan! So starting tomorrow, we are all on the hunt. Celia and Jessica will go live tomorrow at their first Book Singing event at The Steamer Trunk in Downtown Jennings, marking the start of our hunt! Then, your off to find Antoine, our book's main character. Look for him in the windows of businesses around town (there are 40 out there!!) and snap a pic! It can be a selfie, or for our camera shy fans, a thumbs up! We got really creative with our thumbs selfies, check them out below. Then you'll share your pic to this event page!

We paint our baby gator's nails to keep track of them, their ages, growth rate, how often they are being held, and also to know who we are putting in our indoor pond. It's a helpful tool for us! And pretty dang adorable (added bonus). Stop by and see our babies in their tank and indoor pond. Hope to be able to let you all hold them soon! We will announce on this page as soon as we get the go ahead! #jeffdavisparish #onlylouisiana #gatorchateau #gatorgram #feedyoursoul Louisiana Travel",2020-05-29 12:54:39,https://video-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/100664930_714453856023876_460887988436467712_n.mp4?_nc_cat=111&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=PmwD33O8CckAX-krZM-&_nc_ht=video-atl3-1.xx&oh=6638564163ac72b59e95987d15fee277&oe=5F5D7BCD,

Hey it’s that time again. We here at Hobo’s, with Jeff LaBouve (Jeff’s AC and Heating) and Paul Dupuis will be cooking again tomorrow night. But this time Michael Cassidy, Jennings Tractor and Equipment(Corey Cormier and Ellen Daigle Cormier), and Guillotte Brothers (Frank and Steve Guillotte) will be providing the meal. It’s awesome that these 3 sponsors have stepped up to the plate to provide a plate of food for our health care members! They are providing meals for the Jennings American Legion Hospital, Jennings Police Department, Jeff Davis Parish Sheriff’s Office, JenningsFire Department and anyone that works in a related field. (EMT’s, First Responders, etc.)

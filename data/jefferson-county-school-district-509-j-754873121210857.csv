Last night was the first in the Oregon Be the Light Movement.

Stadium lights across the state are coming on to show support and hope for all students. Schools across the state like Madras, Ontario, Phoenix, Bend, Mt. View, Culver, Corvallis are all participating in support of their students. More schools will be joining with some participating nightly and others participating on just Friday nights throughout the school year. Lights are on one minute for each day of school missed during this pandemic.

The stadium lights at Madras' Stampede Stadium came on at 20:20 hours (military time) in honor of our 2020 graduating class. This class will have endured and prospered in ways that have not been experienced in a lifetime.

Here at Madras High School we want to say thank you to all of our students and especially our student-athletes who have to date not had a spring sports season.

MADRAS FOOTBALL STAR SIGNS LETTER OF INTENT WITH PORTLAND STATE

Today was national signing day for Division I football.

High school athletes from across the country signed their letters of intent to play football at the next level and one such athlete is a familiar face to our viewers.

Treyvon Easterling, a running back from Madras High School, was one of the stars of our series last fall “Why Madras.” Today, he signed on the dotted line and said “he’s never been happier.”

From our Band/Choir director Jared McFarlin:

Greetings all,
I want to let you know about an upcoming event on Thursday, November 7. The Music Department will be presenting a concert in honor of our veterans. Please share at will and invite any veterans you might have connections with to attend. There is a suggested donation of $10 or three canned food items, but of course all are welcome to attend with or without the donation. Funds will be donated to Central Oregon Veterans Ranch, and food will be donated for baskets created by Jefferson County VSO.
Thanks for sharing!

Special moment for Coach Taylor and myself... The 2018 “Turnaround Student of the Year” was Alex Hernandez. This kid has come a long way. Alex represents many kids coming in to high school. Negative attitude regarding academics and no clear goals for his future. He began changing near the end of his sophomore year. Started talking with teachers, counselors and other school staff about what it would take to get caught up enough to start playing football. He mapped it out, chipped away and by fall of his junior year, Alex was playing varsity football and had all A’s and B’s... This is a true turnaround story. And it can be any of our students. You might not start out strong but look inside and find your personal motivation and start setting goals. You can change your future. Alex went from not caring about school or academics, to playing football and is now planning on attending PCC next fall to work toward his automotive/mechanics degree. Very proud teacher here! Congrats Alex. We wish you the best!!!",0.0,"Way to go Alex!😊

JJHS Back to School Registration and Chromebook Pick-up

August 13th and 14th from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM

Parents will need to enter the 7/8 parent pick-up area and go to the library through the double-doors. There you will be able to do the following:

Pick up your child's registration packet.

Fill out the Chromebook checkout forms.

Receive your child's Chromebook device.

Pick up textbooks for remote learners only (face-to-face learners will receive theirs in class).

Once you have these things, please exit the parent pick-up area and proceed to the front parking lot to fill out the registration forms.

Once you have filled these out, you can return them to the front desk secretary. If you are unable to complete the forms on campus, please send them with your child on Monday morning.

Loss of Jefferson ISD Student:

Sadly, it was reported yesterday that JISD lost one of its own this past weekend. Katelyn Mutai, a beautiful Jefferson High School student, was tragically killed in an automobile accident early Sunday morning. Katelyn was preparing for her senior year, where she was involved in many school-related activities. It has been widely shared that Katelyn had many friends, and it is apparent that she was loved by all who knew her. She had a winning smile, a very upbeat personality, and a positive attitude.

Hey JES and Kindergarten! I miss you! I know most of the district is using Acellus for most our remote learning, but I wanted to remind you all of Google Classroom. If you are working online, I have posted music lessons on Google Classroom and assignments that need to be completed. I know we are all navigating new territory here and every home situation is different. Do what you can and e-mail about anything you need. Just don’t forget about music and Google Classroom! Stay safe stay healthy, and stay hopeful! Things are different and crazy right now, but we will get back to a new and better normal! I just have to believe that and I hope you do too.",2020-04-18 14:43:13,,

Thanks to the efforts of these Jefferson ISD Horticulture students, Collins Academy was able to install the fence around the Wildflower Mini Meadow at the Elementary campus. The students were responsible for measuring the posts+drilling the holes in them. They also had to make sure they were level once placed in the ground & had to use some Engineering skills! We seeded this area last year with seedballs made by the students using funds from Texas Parks and Wildlife Recreation Grants. The fence will protect the wildflowers from getting mowed or trampled.

We honored CJ Woods yesterday at our lunch meeting. He was chosen for the Student of the Month award. CJ is a senior at JHS and is very worthy of this award. He is a member of the student council, a national honor society member, has been a great inspiration to those who know him, served his community as a volunteer and the list goes on and on.
CJ has plans to attend college and pursue a career as a veterinary after graduation. Congratulations CJ, we know you are destined to do great things.

EDIT: We will take the boys and the bus through downtown to allow people to safely get out and cheer them on. The bus will head down Broadway (past Brookshires and V-Mart). They will turn on to Polk Street and head through downtown so that the business owners and patrons can line the streets in parade type fashion. They should be going through downtown by 3:30, so if you attend the pep rally, you’ll have time to get downtown and get setup to send them off in a large fashion!!

Jefferson School District’s Plan is to resume in-school face-to-face instruction, on Wednesday, September 2, unless otherwise directed by the State Board of Education or the local health department. For families who are not comfortable returning to school, Jefferson School District will offer an online option through Rigby Virtual Academy.

Planning for the Future

We cannot predict the course of the current worldwide pandemic. We are hoping that the spread will have slowed – or ended.

One of the lessons we have learned from this spring is that Jefferson School District 251 needs to be prepared for any scenario. In preparation for the 2020-2021 school year, school staff and district leaders have prepared three scenarios for returning. Additionally, there will be an option for families who choose not to send their students to school because of concerns about COVID-19.

The Jefferson School District Board of Trustees has determined to continue with distance learning until the end of the school year (June 4), because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

That soft closure began in the Jefferson School District on Wednesday, March 15, and since that time, our educators and staff have worked hard to provide students the best possible remote learning and digital instruction we can offer. We recognize the challenge this has placed on you and your children and we will continue to do our best to help students prosper.

There are certainly many logistical matters to take care of before the end of the school year and we will get specific information to you, through your building principal, as soon as possible regarding end-of-year procedures, including graduation.

These are incredibly unstable and trying times, and we thank you for your ongoing efforts to help us provide an education for your children.

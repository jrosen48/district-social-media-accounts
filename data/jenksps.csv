Every single one of these seniors - nominees and finalists - are phenonemal examples of what it means to be a Trojan. Their character, determination, work ethic, compassion, and drive to succeed will carry on the tradition of excellence many years into the future.

The faculty and staff members at JHS are so proud of all these students have accomplished. A video is no subsitute for the real ceremony, but under the circumstances, it is a privilege to recognize these men and women for who they are, and for who they will become.

Please enjoy the 2020 Mr. & Miss JHS Ceremony!",2020-04-30 20:00:03,https://video-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/10000000_721667735240241_6709280640577044480_n.mp4?_nc_cat=105&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=UXXEJP0gQfEAX95H2RV&_nc_ht=video-atl3-1.xx&oh=c3de05bd609f0ef6877c41cdefe2fadb&oe=5F5E4FB0,

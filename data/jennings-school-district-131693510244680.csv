Greetings FB Family!

Dr. Art McCoy proudly sponsored two of our very own teachers to teach the region on the PBS Nine Network Teaching in Room 9 Lessons. Take a look at the pictures in the link. You can tell who they are because Warriors represent Well.

The Nine Network is producing two hours of literacy and math instruction for prekindergarten through fourth grades, weekdays from 12:30–2:30 pm, free of charge on television. The grade-appropriate instruction, taught by committed local educators at home, ensures all kids in our region have access to quality teaching during the academic year shutdown and into the summer, regardless of access to internet or computers.

12:30–2:30 pm, Mondays–Thursdays, on Nine PBS.
Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood on Fridays, followed by repeats of teachers’ lessons.

12:30-1:00 p.m. - Reading, PreK-1st Grade
1:00-1:30 p.m. - Reading, 2nd-4th Grade

Dr. Art McCoy was selected by the St. Louis Area Student Council Advisors as the 2020 recipient of this tremendous honor. Unfortunately, with the MASC State Convention being canceled last month due to COVID 19, they were unable to acknowledge this achievement at Timberland High School in March of 2020.

Today, we officially opened three new School Food Markets. These markets are part of a new initiative aimed at addressing hunger by providing nutritious food to kids and their families in convenient, familiar, and safe locations. They are currently being piloted in the Jennings School District (Missouri) and Cahokia Unit School District #187 (Illinois), with plans to expand to three additional sites in 2020. Funding for the School Food Markets program comes from the Bayer Fund, the philanthropic arm of Bayer.

The Foodbank will stock each market regularly with a selection of fresh foods and staple grocery items.

What an awesome law enforcement and leadership experience for nearly 28 youth across Missouri with the Missouri State Highway Patrol (MSHP). This year, we added value to this program as well as learned by including two St. Louis County Police Officers, a Jennings teacher, and 7 Jennings students to participate and represent the St. Louis region. These students received high school elective course credit and CPR training, which is state-required for Missouri seniors as part of their high school curriculum, and much more. Their lives were changed forever.

Dr. McCoy is working with leaders of the St. Louis PD to create C.A.P.L.E. Camp, which stands for Careers and Pathways in Law Enforcement for up to 50, 16 to 18-year-olds from St. Louis County, St. Louis City, and East St. Louis to receive this experience as well as mentoring, and more in law enforcement.

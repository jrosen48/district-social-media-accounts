“Time is passing. Yet, for the United States of America, there will be no forgetting September the 11th. We will remember every rescuer who died in honor. We will remember every family that lives in grief. We will remember the fire and ash, the last phone calls, the funerals of the children.”

Here in Jessamine County, we have lost too many parents, siblings, friends, and loved ones to overdose death.

But an overdose doesn’t have to be the end. It could be the beginning of hope for someone. If someone you know is at risk of narcotic overdose, consider carrying Narcan. You might just save a life.

Narcan is available to anyone in the community, no questions asked. You can come see us at the Jessamine County Health Department for training and a free Narcan kit whenever our doors are open.

Jessamine County E911 would like to congratulate Haven McKenney and Amanda Comley, two of our newest dispatchers on not only graduating from DOCJT Public Safety Dispatch Academy Class 128, but both graduated as Trainees of Distinction! Not only were both ladies Trainees if Distinction, their class was a Class of Distinction, something that only FIVE academy classes since the late 90’s has achieved. In order for a trainee to be a Trainee of Distinction they must maintain a GPA of 95 or above. For a class to be a Class of Distinction the overall class must maintain a GPA of 96 or above. Haven was also one of four squad leaders for the class, meaning that she was in charge of four other trainees, reminding them when to be where and the rules and regulations they are to follow while in the academy. We are very proud of these ladies and all they have accomplished during their time away and are excited to have them join us back in dispatch!!",0.0,"Congratulations! #greatplacetoliveworkandplay #jessamineproud

A lengthy search for a missing hiker has a happy ending tonight. Crews were called to the Jessamine Creek Gorge for a person in distress. An adult female contacted Jessamine County 911 reporting that she had become lost in the gorge area while out jogging on the trails. She had gotten off of the trails and tried to navigate toward a familiar location to find her way out. After an hour of hiking she realized she was lost and called for help. Agencies from Jessamine Co EM, Fire Rescue, EMS as well as Nicholasville and Wilmore Fire departments sent team members to aid in the search which lasted around 4 hours. The person was found successfully because she did as she was asked of her by responders and stayed where she was once her location was pinged by the communicators. Crews had to travel well off of the trail system to finally make contact. She was able to walk out with the crews and was evaluated by Jessamine EMS but did not require transport.",0.0,"Great job!

We are pleased to officially announce that the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet has funded the Nicholasville East High Trail project. The City was notified July 17th that our $700,000 project was included as one of 42 projects in the State. This phase of the project will finalize the right of way and relocate utilities. This phase will be the catalyst to pursue construction dollars for the final phase. The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet is actively constructing a new Eastern Bypass and they have included a muli-use path parallel to the bypass. The East High Trail will connect to the Transportation Cabinet's trail and will ultimately provide a connection from West Place subdivision all the way to downtown Nicholasville! This is truly a great opportunity to improve the quality of life for our residents and to provide a safe manner for those students who wish to walk/bike to school.",6.0,"FYI

As the 4th of July approaches we would like to ask for some consideration when it comes to fireworks in our community. We want everyone to be able to celebrate this great holiday but at the same time ask that you please be considerate of your neighbors. Fireworks are a huge part of the holiday celebration and we understand that on the 4th many will participate. It is our hope that all will have a great time but remember that not everyone has the next day off. The Police Department will not be going out looking for fireworks violations but if we receive complaints we will respond. Please try to keep your celebration to a reasonable level and be considerate of everyone as the night gets later. Thank you",0.0,"FYI

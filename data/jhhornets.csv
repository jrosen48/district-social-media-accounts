Today's games at Fairview didn't turn out the results we wanted but extremely proud of how hard our kids played! One of the many reasons I'm proud to be a Hornet! Also proud of these two young men for hitting a 2-run home run and a solo shot! They were both bombs!",0.0,"Coach Harrill had some very high praise for the way the A & B teams willingness to play hard today!

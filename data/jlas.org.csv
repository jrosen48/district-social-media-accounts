Buses will be dropping off and picking up in front of the High School so there will be NO DROP OFF in the front of the High School or in the K-8 parking lot.

Hello families and Cardinal Community!

While there are many unknowns as we look to the 2020-2021 school year, there are a few things we can control. The Board has decided to move forward with the request for a Bond. Nothing has changed from the original information, the bond was just moved from the May ballot to the August ballot due to concerns about voting during the Covid pandemic. Due to rules for elections, the ballot language had to be approved by the Board in May for August. This video explains the bond proposal in more detail.

This year has been....Interesting. For a moment there it looked like the graduating class of Johannesburg/Lewiston schools we'rent going to get their moment they had worked so hard for these past twelve years. Covid had stolen the show once again.

Through zoom calls and through a lot of hard work the JLAS staff pulled together an amazing idea; A traveling graduation so that each student would see their accomplishments celebrated like so many graduating classes before them. Even more special than that, each student had their parents, grandparents, friends and even pets watch them receive their diploma and walk across the stage!

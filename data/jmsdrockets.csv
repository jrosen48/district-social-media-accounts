Please ignore this message if your child is in our cyber program for grades 7-8.

For students in our full-time cyber program in grades K-6, and 7-12:

Students have been enrolled over the past few weeks in the EdOptions cyber program for the courses they need. We were assured courses would “appear” on August 26th for all students to start on time.

As of right now, courses have not “appeared” for our students in their dashboard.

Please be patient with us as we work to resolve this issue immediately.

As soon as we receive confirmation that the courses are available to our students you will receive a notification from us.

A common question from elementary parents is what time do students have to be logged in by. The answer to this question is that there is not a set time for students in grades K-6 to accommodate a variety of childcare setups. The students are to work each day for at minimum an hour per course.

Sorry for this issue, but we are working to resolve it as soon as possible.

The PIAA today pushed back the start of fall sports until August 24. What that means is that heat week for varsity football will begin on that day as we speak today.￼ The WPIAL is having a news conference on Monday which will clarify some things to us as well.

We understand everybody’s frustration because we are living it as well. But all we can do right now is to continue with the schedule that was given to us a couple weeks ago￼￼￼.

The start date for all sports in our organization is August 24. Girls middle school softball, will start on September 8.￼ We will wait for clarification on when golf will have their first match, because that was the first week of their first section matches.￼

Once again if you need any clarification send me an email and I will do my best to clear things up.￼

We are lucky enough to utilize a web-based program to design our yearbook, so students can work on their pages from home.

A new page we are adding this year is a FIDS page. So, with that in mind, we would like our students to take pictures of themselves, at home, working on their FIDS work.

First grade celebrated Dr. Seuss’ Birthday all week long last week with family members reading their favorite books, decorating cookies like the character from “Put Me In The Zoo,” and listening to audiobooks after discovering QR codes in our building with a scavenger hunt. The students also transformed into the Lorax and enjoyed Green eggs and ham! Finally, we created a trail mix with 120 snack pieces, in honor of the 120th day of school.

As you can all guess, putting together a Yearbook is going to be really challenging since we are missing a quarter of the school year and all the events, plays, and sports that go with it. The Yearbook class has been working their tails off over the last three weeks to try to make this year’s Yearbook a memorable one.

Here’s how you can help us out. Pick your favorite quarantine activity, and get a photo of yourself doing it! Sending a high quality action photo of you and your brothers and sisters or family doing anything school appropriate (playing your favorite video game, going on your daily walk, reading, or even creating your daily Tik Tok are all great ideas).

Take a couple versions of your photo and text it (just like sending a text message) to Mr. Tein at atein@jgsc.k12.in.us to guarantee that it gets into the Yearbook.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2889497314466152&id=1102148953201006,,0.0,"Students,

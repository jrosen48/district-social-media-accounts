If anyone knows me, they know I love THE WIZ! It would be a dream to choreograph and/or dance for a Wiz on Broadway lol. So for my birthday I decided to put together a short video, recreating one of my favorite scenes from the movie: A BRAND NEW DAY! We all know these last few months have been filled with a lot of darks days and moments, so here is a little light to shine in those dark corners! Also s/o to this amazing cast of dancers! They are truly the embodiment of talent! ❤️❤️

Thanks to everyone who made the trip today and to parents who had snacks for us. We appreciate your support more than you’ll

Congrats Elaina Riley, Ty Hahn, & Josh Hoff-Boring for receiving Outatanding Performance Awards.

Special thanks to Jeffrey Koehler, Ami Koehler, Wayne Koehler, and Mason Benham for unloading our set trailer tonight!

Special thanks to Cec Antholz for designing and making several costumes again this season. And to Ruth Denny Norvell for helping maintain costumes! And thanks to everyone at school for always pitching in to help with our weird random requests throughout the season. JB is the best!

Good Morning, Wildcats! Today, the Middle School will be releasing the hybrid day assignments for their students. If you have a middle school student, your elementary student has been assigned the same days. Due the number of fully remote students, we have had to alter some of our classroom placements.

It's been a really difficult end of the school year for high school seniors in our community. The Broome County Legislature would like to send this special message to all the seniors that had their final year of high school cut short. The journey doesn't end here! We know you'll do great things as you take the next steps in your life. If you know a high school senior, share this video with them or tag them in the comments.

Still looking for a way to decorate a car for a senior parade? Many of the local school districts are putting on senior parades, I know that both JC and CV are this Friday evening. If you are looking for a decorating idea, we can help. We have added a special 13x19 car decoration print to the online gallery of all our seniors and for $15 each, you can get one or more of these photos to add to the parade decorations and then if you are gentle with the tape, you can frame them afterward. If you are not one of our senior portrait customers, send me a message and we can see if we can help.

It's really hard to get the exact size compared to a car so you best bet is to measure your car and see how it would fit on yours.

To achieve the rank of Eagle Scout, Pope earned 30 merit badges demonstrating competency in a wide range of areas including camping, first aid, personal finance, personal fitness, citizenship and many others. In addition he completed a service project leading a team of 18 volunteers to renovate the entrance to Wolfe Park, a popular park for hikers in the town of Chenango. The project included removing years of accumulated graffiti, building new railings for the gazebo, as well as sanding and staining the gazebo and two swing benches.

What a great 1st day of school! It started great thanks to some of our students and community members who left these awesome, inspiring messages for our staff. Then the senior breakfast drive-thru was a great success thanks to our senior parents and business support from the Clayton McDonalds and Hardee’s restaurants! Followed by many engaged students with prepared teachers ready to take on the new year and over 130 more devices distributed to students so they could learn at home.

Yes there were tech issues, schedule changes, and questions too, but we persevered. We are so proud of our students, teachers, staff, and parents on a great 1st day of the 2020-2021 school year! Tomorrow, we will get back after it again working together for all of our students!

The WJ Food Pantry will operate from 4-5PM on Wednesdays now that we are back in school! We will still operate with the “Drive-Thru” style of pick up!

At this time we do not have a specific donation drop off time as we are back in school, but there is a blue bin that is placed outside one of the portables for non-perishable items. Someone will check this daily! We are still in need of breakfast items, dinner sides, pasta sauce, and snacks!

Based on guidance from the Johnston County Health Department and taking into consideration the growing number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the county in recent weeks, the original plan to host “modified” traditional graduation ceremonies will not be possible.

We have been advised that the safest feasible way for schools to hold graduation ceremonies will be to hold drive-through/drive-in graduations.

Schools will share specific dates and times for these ceremonies by the end of the week.

Please know that the district has made every effort to hold a traditional graduation for our students. However, student safety and the safety of our communities is our number one priority.

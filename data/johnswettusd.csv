We need your input for a proposed safety/trail project in your community!

The project includes a trail and protected street crossing beginning at the intersection of Pomona Street and Crockett Boulevard and continuing to the entrance of Willow High School and Crockett Hills Regional Park (see a map of the project here). This trail is needed to provide a safe route for students and the public to reach the bus and downtown Crockett.

Contra Costa County is working with John Swett Unified School District, the Bay Area Ridge Trail Council and East Bay Regional Park District to seek funding for the project through a State grant.

Please fill out the survey linked below by August 24th to provide your input on the project. Input from this survey will be submitted with the grant application.

Greetings JSUSD Community,
Knowing a shortage of substitute teachers has been an ongoing challenge for us, we have increased the Daily Sub Rate to $140/day for subs. In addition, the District will now reimburse the fingerprinting fee for new subs after they work for us for a minimum of five days. I have attached a flyer for distribution. Please pass this along to anyone you know who may be interested.

Lifetouch is currently on a journey to provide a World Class experience for you, as a valued yearbook customer. It has been our pleasure to partner with your school on this year’s yearbook and we know how important yearbooks are - especially in times like these.

We wanted to make you aware that due to COVID-19, we have had government-mandated shut-downs in some of our production facilities and social distancing protocols in others that have reduced our capacity for printing yearbooks. Be assured that everyone who ordered a yearbook will receive one. However, the delivery of your yearbook will be delayed.

Esta es una encuesta para ayudarnos a planificar el próximo año. A medida que determinamos cómo abrir escuelas, su aporte es extremadamente importante. Es probable que recibamos orientación de los funcionarios de salud del condado de que los estudiantes pueden venir a la escuela por turnos y recibir una combinación de aprendizaje en persona y aprendizaje a distancia. Responda estas preguntas en función de cómo se siente y piensa AHORA, sabiendo que las cosas pueden cambiar. No está haciendo ningún compromiso, solo está retroalimentando.

With all the changes this Spring, we had to make our ASB Elections strictly online. We had students apply online, interview via ZOOM, and now we are voting electronically. As things changed, these students stepped up!

JSHS ASB/Class Officer Elections will be held this week from Monday May 11th through Friday May 15th at 3pm.

Please vote for the candidate you feel would be representative for our school, and your class. Only one vote is allowed per student. Please encourage other classmates to get out and VOTE! Your voice matters.

This is an outreach message to our local residents and community. The John Swett Unified School District has taken the initiative to install lighting in the pedestrian tunnels between John Swett High School and Carquinez Middle School. We pursued this project in order to address student and community safety concerns about the tunnels being so dark at night. While we are lighting the tunnels at night, this does not mean we want to encourage people to wander through our school grounds. Quite to the contrary. If you see anything improper or questionable going on at one of our schools, please contact the police immediately. It is our goal to be a good community partner and keep everyone safe, especially during these challenging times. If you have any questions, please reach out to me by cell phone at 925-639-7408.

Check out John Swett Science on YouTube!

Tips from Mr. Machado:

To watch youtube videos search “John Swett Science” Students from any class can watch any videos no matter what class you are enrolled.

Videos will contain labs and mini lectures on how to solve problems. You can download the lab sheet PDF and do the lab with me. Problem sets are only 2 problems each PDF.

The videos are going to be unedited in real time. I will go fast to save upload time. Pause the video and watch it multiple times

We also ask that no student be dropped off before 7:30 each morning. In the past we could make arrangements for early drop off, but this year our teachers and staff already have enough extra duties to attend.

I will be contacting parents next week to get everything I need for the information packets that were intended to get out a few weeks ago. Be checking dojo and email. If I can’t get ahold of parents that way I will call. I will also be addressing the mascot tryouts as well. Nothing was going to be decided until after graduation as our Admin had a lot on there plate. Thanks you those who are planning to tryout for your patience, you will know soon! All students where given a calendar before spring break, if that could please be turned into the school sometime next week that would be greatly appreciated. If you cannot get in to drop off at the school please let me know and I will make arrangements for a pick up location. Once the next statement is made on March 8th by our governor, information for future fundraisers, camp, parent meeting about payments due/rules and will be sent out. Having those calendars will help me greatly with all the above. Thanks for your patience as we navigate all this.

Packets where handed out two weeks ago, some have turned them in some have not. If you have not turned in the information paper or your child’s calendar please do so. While I know things are on stand by I want to start having practices as soon as we are allowed and the calendars will really help that out. Once the next statement is made on March 8th by our governor, information for future fundraisers, camp, parent meeting about payments due/rules and future practice dates will be sent out. It’s important to please return the info form and calendar to help me with that when the announcement is made. Thanks for your patience as we navigate all this.

As of May 20, 2020, the Gatesville Recreation Department has decided on a new athletics schedule for the remainder of the year. We had to make tough decisions during this time to ensure the health and safety of our entire community and the surrounding areas. We believe that our new schedule is the best course of action at this time.

We will have a youth baseball/softball season for kids that registered for the pre t-ball, t-ball, 8U, and 10U divisions. This season will run from September 5- October 10. There will be safety guidelines that will have to be followed to ensure the safety of everyone. There will be more to come on these guidelines once the season gets closer.

For those of you that had kids registered for the 12U, 14U, and 15U divisions, we are canceling those divisions at the time. Refunds will be sent out within the next few weeks. The remainder of the 2020 soccer season is also being canceled at this time.

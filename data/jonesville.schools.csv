Her favorite book that she has written is A Mother's Journey. It's about emperor penguins.

JMS Families -- First of all, thank you for sending your kids to school today! Considering the circumstances, they did a wonderful job and demonstrated P.R.I.D.E. throughout the day! We truly have wonderful kids at JMS! It was apparent how much our kids love coming to school as many were saddened to not be coming the next few weeks. Over the next few days, JMS teachers will be working hard to create online lessons for students who have access to the internet so they still have an opportunity to learn. These will be rolled out on Wednesday, March 18. Even though we aren't physically in the building, we want your child to still have access to important content and to teachers. If there is anything you need from me over the next two weeks, please email me at bplayford@jonesvilleschools.org and I will get back with you as soon as possible to assist in any way I can. Thank you for sending us such wonderful kids and stay safe over the next few weeks!

We are asking you today to ask for your help in sponsoring elementary students in the Comet Cruisers running program. The cost to sponsor each runner is $60.

Due to the fact that the weather conditions for this evening are expected to worsen, tonight's Pre-festival Concerts have been cancelled. This performance will not be rescheduled. We wish our band students good luck as they travel to Manchester next week for District Band Festival. Thanks and Go Comets!",2020-02-26 12:21:33,,

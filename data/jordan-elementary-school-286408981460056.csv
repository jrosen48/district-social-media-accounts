We know right now all our families are carefully weighing the pros and cons between our in-person and remote learning options for the 2020-2021 school year. Even if you haven't decided which option you feel would be best for your student, we strongly encourage you to register online if possible. You are not asked to pick a learning option when you register. We will have a way for you to pick that designation at a later date. Not only is registering online simple, but it will save you from having to stand in lines on registration day!

Need help or your login information? Call 618-532-1907, ext 1120 and someone will be able to assist you.

Dear Mrs. Laurie Miller,

I appreciate you today and every day! I love how you give your own time to help students even when it is your planning time. You make the classroom comfortable and you have a caring heart. I have had such a great year with you and can’t believe I won’t get to come back to Jordan next year as a student. Thank you for helping me learn and become smarter! Be sure to treat yourself to some ice cream even though you would rather have something healthier! 😂

The coupons have been delivered to individual schools in the District for distribution.

Barbara Schmiett and Russ Monsive wanted to personally recognize and thank some teachers and support staff on behalf of the restaurant. They showed up at Terra Linda to express their appreciation– they even brought along some Egg McMuffins and coffee which they shared with a small group of teachers and support staff.

McDonald’s says they simply want to thank everyone for the hard work, dedication and innovation to support the success of children in our community during this challenging time.

1. Pick up a library card. Access books at your local branch and digital copies online at no cost.
2. Join a summer reading program. Local and national contests award participants with prizes, games, and even scholarship dollars.
3. Use free Digital Learning Tools. Online games, articles, stories, and books.

Reading to your child can serve just as big an impact as independent reading. Children can read aloud to a grandparent, pet, friend, in person, or via video chat. Remember that magazines, graphic novels, comic books, and even blogs are still reading.

The parade was a way for everyone from school to feel a renewed sense of connection with students and families.

Keep up the great work Oakcrest students, teachers and staff!

Myla wanted to do something to show her first-grade classmates just how much she misses them, so she got to work. Myla’s grandmother taught her how to sew and Myla decided to use her new skill to make personalized heart pillows for every one of her classmates. She even chose different fabric for each student with a message attached saying “I will miss you and wish we could have finished the school year together!” Myla even made a special pillow for her beloved teacher Mrs. Brotherson.

The pillows will be handed out to Myla’s classmates when they come to Mountain Shadows to check out at the end of the school year.

Right now they are providing 22,000 meals a day so students don’t go hungry during school dismissal.

This video is a tribute to all of our Nutrition Services workers – for their dedication to the job and love for all the students they serve.

Officers Alcivar and Ashley of the Riverton City Police Department have issued a ""Chalk It Up"" challenge to the D.A.R.E. students and their families in Riverton. They are asking students to write positive messages on driveways and sidewalks near their homes or to hang a poster in their window. The officers hope that these messages of hope will lift the spirits of everyone in the community. The rules of the challenge say students must be safe, get approval from their parents, and that the messages be appropriate.

Thank you, officer Alcivar and Ashley, for working to bring some joy to the community in such a creative and inspiring way.

While Riverside students have participated in the contest for 15 years, this year the school had not one, but four State winners. We’re told that has never happened in the history of the Arbor Day Poster Contest!

With 25,000 treat-filled, pre-packaged plastic eggs at their disposal, West Jordan Police D.A.R.E. and resources officers had an excellent, actually an egg-cellent, idea. They decided to pack the eggs up and rather than having an Easter Egg Hunt, they handed them out to students as they exited grab-and-go lunch at West Jordan City elementary schools. The officers were met with big smiles from students and parents who were delighted to find out the Easter Bunny was still full of surprises.

That is exactly what some students in the Teacher Education Program at JATC South are doing during the school dismissal. They are getting creative and finding ways to keep in touch with their practicum students in some Jordan District elementary schools.

It was a labor of love for Columbia Elementary School teacher Angela Drope and her teammate. They wanted to do something to let students know how much they are missed and to congratulate them on their first week of at-home learning. So, Mrs. Drope made a sign for each of her 50 students with an individual message telling them that they (along with their parents) rocked the first week of online learning. The message ended by saying “Mrs. Drope is so proud of you.”

Mrs. Drope spent hours hammering the signs into place in the front yards of homes where her students live. It was a special and meaningful message that brought big smiles to students and parents.

Keep up the amazing work everyone!

They were celebrating all things science as more than 800 students and their families gathered for a fabulous, fun night of learning at Oquirrh Elementary School. Student ambassadors from the University of Utah engaged parents and their children in a variety of hands-on STEM experiments in chemistry, math, biology, and physics during Family Science Night. Some of the experiments included making ghost bubbles with dry ice, creating worms with sodium alginate, using your breath to create electricity and turning on lights with liquid nitrogen!

They were celebrating all things science as more than 800 students and their families gathered for a fabulous, fun night of learning at Oquirrh Elementary School. Student ambassadors from the University of Utah engaged parents and their children in a variety of hands-on STEM experiments in chemistry, math, biology, and physics during Family Science Night. Some of the experiments included making ghost bubbles with dry ice, creating worms with sodium alginate, using your breath to create electricity and turning on lights with liquid nitrogen!

But the biggest surprise came when Principal Shauna Worthington told everyone that thanks to community support, she was able to collect 15,000 boxes of cereal – enough for students in 17 Jordan School District schools. Every student at Oquirrh Elementary received the gift of two boxes of cereal.

Principal Worthington started the Cereal Project because she was worried some students might not have enough to eat over the winter break without school breakfast and lunch.

A total of 425 community volunteers showed up to gift wrap all 15,000 boxes of cereal.

Thanks to everyone involved in the Cereal Project, for the outpouring of love and support for students.

One of the biggest secrets to a happier life is focusing on what you can give, rather than what you should receive. Holiday shopping and gift-giving can be stressful and distracting from what we are truly trying to ""give"" each holiday season.

While things like baby yodas, movies, hoverboards, video games, phones, and toys are all exciting - what we can truly give this holiday season is our time and attention to those around us.

Having a ""home"" means having somewhere to feel safe. Having a ""home"" means that we feel surrounded by people who care about us.

Our challenge to the students and families this holiday season is to offer a ""home,"" a sense of connection and caring. We hope that each of our students and their families use the time over winter recess connecting with each other, reaching out to friends, and creating a ""home"" for those around us this holiday season.

How will you offer a ""home"" to others for the holidays?

This school year the Foundation will fund approximately 650 classroom grants, an all-time record. It is a significant increase from just two years ago when they funded 91 classroom grants, last year JEF funded 275. The grants support things like STEM, books and literacy, arts, music, technology and special education. This year the grants will total approximately $400,000.

The number of classroom grants funded by the foundation keeps growing thanks to generous donors like “Scheels.” As a part of the retailer’s recent ‘Day of Giving,’ Scheels donated $10,000 to the Jordan Education Foundation – all of the money will help to fund classroom grants.

It is a place that feels a little bit like home. That’s the idea behind a new Wellness Center at Oquirrh Elementary School. The purpose of the Wellness Center is to give students a place where they can go for a 10-minute break to relieve stress or worries and get back to their classrooms and successful learning. With the help of a social-emotional learning coach in the Wellness Center, students are learning to identify, express and manage their emotions for a happier, healthier experience in school. They also learn the importance of self-confidence, recognizing their strengths and resilience.

The Wellness Center is a calm, relaxing and welcoming place for all students throughout the school year.

It is a labor of love for Oquirrh Elementary School Principal Shauna Worthington as she works hard to reach a goal of collecting 4,000 boxes of breakfast cereal this holiday season. The cereal will be gift wrapped and given to students in seven Jordan School District Title I schools to take home over the winter break. Ms. Worthington wanted to do something to keep kids from going hungry while they were away from school.

Principal Worthington and her family came up with the “Principal Project” idea last year and quickly collected 2,869 boxes of breakfast cereal - enough for students in four JSD Title I schools.

Using telescopes with solar filters, the students were able to watch as Mercury slowly passed directly in front of the sun as a small black dot crossing the sun’s face. The entire transit of Mercury across the sun took about 5 ½ hours. The last transit of Mercury was in 2016. The next one won’t be until 2032.

It was a night to show appreciation and say thanks to everyone who came together supporting and welcoming the new Mountain Ridge High School into the communities it now serves. Board of Education President Bryce Dunford told those who gathered that as students and staff begin establishing new and lasting traditions at Mountain Ridge, we must never forget that the school belongs to the community. Mr. Dunford recognized prior Board members for paving the way for construction of Mountain Ridge which was built at a 17% cost savings, on time and under budget. He thanked everyone for their role in building the school and congratulated students and the community for embracing Mountain Ridge and taking pride in being ‘Sentinel Strong.’

A special thanks to State Board of Education and Jordan Education Foundation Board Member Mike Haynes for delivering the dedication speech.

Students were able to choose their very own Halloween pumpkin, which for some wouldn’t otherwise be possible. The pumpkins are part of the Green Thumb Nursery program at the prison and they are grown by inmates.

Some of the pumpkins were decorated with elaborate designs painted by inmates who typically harvest a crop of about 2,000 pumpkins each year.

Students created exhibits showing their family traditions that parents were able to walk through. Each display had to have something the students had grown, raised or made with their families. The Fall Fair is a part of the third-grades curriculum-based learning.

Thank you, Blackridge teachers, for creating such an enjoyable environment for parents to engage with their students.

It was a ond-day trip of a lifetime for some students enrolled in the Aircraft Pilot program at JATC North. They were invited by Delta Airlines to participate in ‘Girls in Aviation Day.’ It was a day designed to get more females interested in becoming airline pilots. Aircraft Pilot teacher, Fiona Silcox said nine girls in her class were treated to an all expenses paid flight to Houston, Texas for a day of fun and experiencing what it is like to be a pilot and to work in the aviation industry. The Delta 737 plane making the trip had an all female flight crew with about 100 girls on board from around the State of Utah. Once they landed in Houston, the students were treated to a tour of the Johnson Space Center, the Space Center Museum and NASA Space Mission Control Center. They also had the opportunity to meet and talk to a female astronaut.

We wish these young ladies the best as they pursue their future careers.

The 4th, 5th and 6th graders have been invited to perform the National Anthem at the Utah Jazz Game at Vivint Smart Home Arena. The students, under the musical direction of teacher Scott Knight, will perform the National Anthem a capella.

When Thatcher Mathews recently embarked on an Eagle Scout project, he decided it would be something to benefit his favorite elementary school – Fox Hollow Elementary. So Thatcher, who is now a 9th grade student at Sunset Ridge Middle, worked with the Fox Hollow administration, custodian, PE assistants and a local vinyl company to design a “Sensory Path or Walk.” The “Sensory Walk” was installed on the floor in two different entrances to the gym. The walk is a way for students to warm up before gym class by following a path, which includes tasks like hopping, balancing, bending and touching. So far the “Sensory Walk” is a big hit at the school. Thanks to Thatcher Mathews for giving back to a school he loves.

Every day the Jordan Education Foundation (JEF) works hard to provide for the needs of students throughout Jordan School District - but they couldn’t do it without an outpouring of community kindness and support.

For example, over the past few days kind and caring individuals simply stopped by the JEF office to drop off food and other items to support students in need in our schools.

Natalie Smiley, a student at Copper Hills High School, donated 125 pairs of brand new shoes and some backpacks thanks to local businesses and her DECA class who joined in the effort to help students in need.

Another special surprise came from the Country Park 4th Ward Relief Society in South Jordan. These generous ladies opened their hearts to students in need by putting 250 weekend food packs together along with collecting food items for Principal’s Pantries throughout the District.

Thank you for making a difference in the lives of children and teens every day!

The annual two-day event brings specialists from different agricultural organizations together with business to provide a hands-on educational experience. Students learned about different professions in the ag industry as well as how food makes its way from farms to the dinner table. Utah growers brought fruit and vegetables for the 7th-graders to sample and a local horse therapy organization taught the students about the different way animals interact with people.

Thank you to all who donated their time and supplies to make this year’s Agriculture Day a success.

Five new schools are now open in Jordan School District for the 2019-20 school year thanks to a 2016 voter-approved bond. The new schools, along with district-wide boundary changes, have brought overcrowding relief to many of our schools.

Students at Daybreak Elementary School were treated to a true taste of the Utah State Fair as they headed to the school cafeteria on Wednesday. Lunch ladies created a State Fair-like atmosphere wearing colorful clothing, making cow cookies, serving corn dogs, hamburgers, cow sunglasses and offering prizes in a coloring contest. While the students loved the food, the dancing cow was a really big hit.

It was State Fair Day in the cafeteria and each student who ate school lunch received a ticket to the Utah State Fair. It’s an opportunity for children who might otherwise miss out on the activities, exhibits and experience of going to the fair.

Thank you to our amazing lunch ladies and Dairy West for making mealtime such a memorable “State Fair” experience!

It was a fun day for students at Fox Hollow Elementary School as they had the opportunity to get to know some DARE officers from around the country as well as several from West Jordan, Herriman and Riverton. The officers were at Fox Hollow as part of their own training and requirements to graduate and teach DARE in schools all over the United States. About 15 officers were observed while teaching a DARE lesson in classrooms at Fox Hollow. After the lessons were done, it was time to have some fun. The officers took time to interact with students in the gym playing basketball while others visited kindergarten classes where they engaged with students with a video workout.

It was a day of positive interactions with police officers that Fox Hollow students won’t soon forget.

It is a race to the finish at Mountain Point Elementary School as they prepare to welcome hundreds of students to the new school in Bluffdale on Tuesday. Principal Carolyn Bona is ready and thankful for the opportunity to share brand new opportunities the school will bring to students, teachers and staff.

This week Mountain Point is getting a little help from Boy Scout Troop 1466 from Riverton. They showed up at the school with service in mind, participating in an Eagle Scout Project. The project goal was to assembly all the school’s gym equipment including soccer goals, ball carts, inflating soccer and basketballs and more. Thanks to the young Scouts and their leader, Aaron Baker, for playing a part in getting the school ready for a smooth and successful first year.

Jordan School District fifth and sixth-grade teachers participated in a day of workshops and activities during the 'Summer History Academy' at South Jordan Middle School. The 24 educators spent a week digging into the core curriculum, hands-on social studies lessons and new techniques for teaching current events. The academy is a way for teachers to learn from each other and bring new ideas into their classrooms.

The week ended with teachers ready and eager to use their new resources with their students in the fall!

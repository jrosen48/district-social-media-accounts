Joseph Eagle Feathers! Here is a crackle feather that we dip in water to crack the clear glass and then quickly heal in the forge to keep it in one piece. It sparkles and shimmers as it turns in the light. I'm excited to see who snags this feather at graduation!

I love that Joseph celebrates the promotion of their 8th graders into high school. Every year this is one of my favorite school shoots. Talk about a great group of young people!
For fun, we did a few buddy photos after the official class photo. I am attaching a link for anyone that would like to purchase additional prints of the ones they already had, or order any of the fun extras! You can order right from this link, or contact me directly.

For anyone who has not yet picked up their promotion photos, you can do so in the JCS office next week, Monday-Thursday between 8-11:30.

*Feel free to share these posted images on your social media, but please remember that screenshots, or downloads of watermarked images from my website is considered theft, so any images posted with watermarks across them will be asked to be removed until purchased, at which time I will happily send you a social media digital for sharing!

Have a fantastic summer!

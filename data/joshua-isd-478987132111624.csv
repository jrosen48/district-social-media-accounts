Thirty nine events — that's what we have planned to honor teachers during this Teacher Appreciation Week. All of the events will be livestreamed at TeachersCan.org/events, unless indicated otherwise there. And get some sleep , because your schedule of events starts at 7:30 each morning, including tomorrow. You don't have to be a teacher to participate, but we are doing this specifically to pay tribute to our awesome Texas teachers.

Which event(s) are you most looking forward to?

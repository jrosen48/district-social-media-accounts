My administration made the very difficult decision, in close consultation with educational and health leaders, to extend public school closures through the rest of the academic year. We have to continue to take very aggressive steps to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.

We know this has tremendous implications for families and students all across the state. This is part of a two-pronged plan my administration is crafting to protect New Mexicans from COVID-19 and ensure that children are protected, fed and educated and that families are supported through this crisis.

We are in unprecedented times. Public health is our first and foremost priority. We will keep doing everything we can to keep kids, teachers, families and workers all across the state safe from this terrible virus.

Dad and I spent the last two days at the J. Paul Taylor Symposium at New Mexico State University. The focus this year was “Justice for Migrants”. There were very informative and emotional presentations from people involved in this issue across our southern border. This was the fifteenth year of an idea that dad sparked as he asked questions of an incoming president of how the university could have a conversation about social justice. New Mexico State University President Martin, at that time started the first Symposium, “Justice for the Women Murdered in Juarez”.",2019-04-13 09:52:18,,

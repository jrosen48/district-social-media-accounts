Due to capacity restrictions, ticketed JHS fall activities (football, soccer, swimming, volleyball) will have limited attendance available. Each rostered student-athlete will be given four vouchers for each home contest (2 for away) that they may share with family & friends. The voucher is not your pass to get in but rather an opportunity to purchase an admission ticket. Non-ticketed events such as cross country, golf and tennis we are asking no more than two spectators per student competing.

This meeting is for grades 9-12 volleyball players!

Volleyball parent meeting will be held on August 10th at Jamestown Highschool. We are holding 2 groups to minimize amount of people.
Times are :
7pm: Junior and seniors
7:45pm: freshmen and sophomores
*If possible, please keep your group attending to a minimum. In other words- no siblings and only 1 parent/player. I know this will make some people upset... as I know how much you love parent meetings 😂.
We are excited to have a season, so let’s start off using as much caution as possible!

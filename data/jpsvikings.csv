All levels of MHSAA sponsored football have been postponed until the spring of 2021.
Our football players and coaches have put in quite a bit of hard work over the summer in anticipation of the upcoming fall season.
I want to thank them for their efforts. It was truly inspiring to watch.

I encourage football players to stay physically active and participate in another sport this fall. Cross Country or Men’s Tennis, are both great options as they are non cut sports. At this time Men’s Soccer is still available as an option, however, this is a sport requiring a tryout and there is still a chance it maybe shutdown.

We hope this communication finds you and your students doing well. We are excited to report that Hunt Elementary our Balanced Calendar school started back to school this week. I wish I could convey the joy it was to have students back in our buildings once again.

I am sure that you are all anxiously awaiting information from your principals and teachers regarding start dates and cohort assignments. I want to assure you that JPS staff is working hard at providing that information to you. This scheduling requires careful thought as we must take into consideration family affiliations and bus routing for the entire district. At this time, no lists or cohorts have been permanently assigned and we ask for you patience as we work through these details.

Also, there will be NO “Farmers to Families” boxes this week📦😢. Unfortunately, the first round of food boxes, funded by the USDA, has been depleted. We are sorry to share this news but at the same time we are thrilled to see how helpful these boxes have been for our Jackson community🧡🖤.

There is light ahead though‼️ Next week starts round 2 of the “Farmers to Families” boxes📦. The food supplied in the boxes will be slightly less than before but that doesn’t mean you won’t get any goodies🥬🍎. So make sure to come out next week‼️

The post office notified us that due to a shortage of workers in the Allen Park facility, which is where all Jackson mail goes to be sorted, they are having to utilize other facilities in Grand Rapids and Lansing.

This may be causing a delay for those of you receiving packets through the mail for your student(s). Every school has sent out at least one week's worth of materials, so we know they are out for delivery.

Please remember that if you have moved and have a change of address, you need to contact your school secretary so that your information can be updated.

Thank you for your patience!

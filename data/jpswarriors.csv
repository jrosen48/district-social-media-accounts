Although we are virtual this Thursday and Friday, we will be serving grab-n-go meals on Thursday from 9:30-11:30am for all Justice students only. Thursday's pick-up will have meals for both Thursday and Friday of this week.

We will be blended virtual starting next Monday. We will still serve grab-n-go meals daily from 9:30-11:30 for virtual students. We will serve the blended virtual students meals in the cafeteria when they are on campus. We will have a modified meal schedule in order to meet social distancing and cleaning and disinfecting between small groups.

We miss all our Warriors! We are hoping that everyone continues to practice safe behaviors so that our local numbers can drop us to a safer category for returning to school in a more traditionalsetting. Until then, be safe and your teachers will be calling regularly.

What you will miss/not miss about SRHS and living in Riggins: What I will miss is just the bonds you make with not only classmates but with the teachers as well. What I won’t miss is having to wake up a 5 in the morning to get ready for school.

Coffee or Red Bull: Coffee all the way!

How do you want to be remembered?: I don’t really know I mean I guess one thing would just be by staying true to myself and inspiring others to do the same because, being you is the only way to be.

THE BOARD EXTENDS SOFT CLOSURE FOR K-12 SCHOOLS WITH OPTION FOR REOPENING

The Board approved the motion to extend the soft closure until the end of the school year. There is the option for school districts to potentially reopen under criteria that will be developed and considered by the Board at the next meeting on April 13. “We have areas of our state where COVID-19 cases have not occurred and we need to be flexible and provide guidance to our local districts and charters to make the best decisions for their areas,” State Board President Debbie Critchfield said. “We will work on the criteria this week in consultation with public health officials and school leaders and take a formal vote at our special Board meeting next week.”

I hope that you are settling into the new routines associated with remote learning. The adjustment is difficult for all of us. Please reach out to teachers and/or myself with any issues you are having. We will continue to do all we can to support you in this difficult time.

We do not know when things will return to normal. We are in constant communication with the state and are monitoring the situation carefully. We will keep you informed of any changes.

Also, due to a couple of issues that have occurred this week, I want to remind you that the district Computer Use Agreement still applies. Please only use district computers for educational purposes.

We wish you all the best and stay safe!

Students have been visiting the Care Closet to get things they need every day this week - deodorant, shampoo, clothing and other items. We have also been receiving so many donations, we can hardly keep up! We have lots of clothing to pass on to students, but could use some more hangers to put them on! If you have some that you don’t need, we could definitely use them!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=127217598669633&id=102393901152003,,0.0,"The response the community has given us with donations has been amazing!

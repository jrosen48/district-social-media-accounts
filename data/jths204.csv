As remote learning continues, we are improving as we go. One of these improvements is a new procedure for recording student attendance.

Beginning Monday, August 31, all students must check in once a day before 8 a.m. using the Campus Student portal (https://bit.ly/3jl7QBg). Teachers will then verify student attendance each class period.

This new procedure will allow students to take full advantage of the breaks they have in between classes. Recording attendance early in the day also serves as an indicator of the student’s intent to participate for the day, and deans and counselors can follow up with students who do not check in.

Below you will find a short video tutorial that shows how to record attendance using this new procedure.

She provides her expertise in a stock market simulation contest where students place real time stock orders online and compete with students all over the state.

Through this partnership, Miss Avilés kicked off the second year of the program in November 2019 and concluded in February 2020 with Steve Visser’s Orientation to Business class with 57 students (West) and Suzanne Haberkorn’s Personal Finance class with 48 students (Central).

Dear JTHS Families,

Today we had 4,854 students log on to record their attendance. Thank you for encouraging your student to continue learning from home. This remains a great opportunity for students to raise their grades and learn important content and skills that will contribute to their academic success next year. These skills are also important for our graduates as they prepare for the next stage of their lives.

Helpful Resource – Mobile Food Pantry
A mobile food pantry is taking place Wednesday, May 6 from 5 to 6:30 p.m. at St. Mary Immaculate. The distribution is a drive thru.

What inspired Maland to take the leap into founding his own nonprofit while also juggling student life and musicianship?

JCSD-NECC Important Message Regarding Free School Breakfast/Lunch Forms:

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Arkansas Department of Education announced Wednesday, September 3 that all students will be provided free lunch and breakfast until December 31, 2020 as a response to COVID-19. The school needs all parents to complete and return the free lunch forms that were sent home with your students at the beginning of the year so that when USDA’s waiver on paid lunch ends, we can resume our free and reduced lunch program. Also, free and reduced lunch percentages are used to calculate supplemental Federal and State special funding that supports educational programs. We ask all parents to complete forms and return them as soon as possible. We do not know if the waiver will be extended to include the second semester.",0.0,"Junction City School District - Northeast Claiborne Charter is with Robby Lowe and Donna McLelland.

It’s U.S. Antibiotic Awareness Week! Antibiotics save lives and are critical tools for treating infections, like those that can lead to sepsis. When antibiotics aren’t needed – like for a cold – they won’t help you, and their side effects could cause harm. Serious side effects can include C. difficile infection, which can cause deadly diarrhea. Talk to your doctor about the best way to treat your illness. http://bit.ly/2AEuUHV",0.0,"CDC

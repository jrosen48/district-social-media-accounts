When I was a little girl, one of the most frighting things to me was going to school. Well today brought back some of that because everything was a little different. Non of us really knew what to expect of today. So we all got prepared, students and staff and guess what, we made it!! I am so proud of my school!!! We had it going on!!!!I am so proud of the students because they were ready for what they were facing. They wore their mask and cleaned their hands just like they were told. I am an adult and I can tell you, it was sooooo hard wearing those mask.

As of right now, only auxiliary and percussion are allowed to practice. That means band camp is on hold for wind players. I would like to go ahead and have percussion and auxiliary come in next week. The schedule for that is:

July 29-31 (Wed-Fri)
Auxiliary will meet from 8:30am-11:30am.
Percussion will meet from 12:30pm-3:30pm.

Please spread the word so all auxiliary/percussion members see this information. MASKS ARE REQUIRED THE ENTIRE TIME! We will be distancing as well. Do not come if you are not auxiliary, percussion, drum major, or band captain. Please do not arrive any earlier than 10 minutes before start time.

Hi all! I’ve had a few of you reach out about band camp so I wanted to share an update. Plan for band camp to be July 27-31. 8am-12pm (all), 1:30pm-3pm (perc/aux) as originally scheduled. That schedule may change. I’m waiting on a national study in Colorado and Maryland to even know if it will be safe for us to play. The preliminary results are expected this Friday.
I am also waiting for the state band organization to say we can play. They haven’t released bands to have summer practice yet with the exception of auxiliary and percussion (in outdoor only/limited time rehearsals).
I will keep you updated as best I can but for now, I don’t even know if we will be able to safely play our instruments. Just hang tight because I’m just as confused as you are trying to plan it all. My main goal is your health and safety. I miss y’all but not enough to risk you getting sick. Stay healthy, stay safe and go ahead and get used to wearing a mask for long periods of time.

A non-traditional graduation ceremony was held May 14, with students receiving their diplomas one-by-one with attendance of a few friends and family members allowed.

Food service:
Thursday will be the last day of food provision by the district. Friday is the last day of the school year.

Material return:
Students are asked to return any school materials, like Chromebooks and books, to a bus driver delivering lunch or to the district office this week.

We know each one of these special seniors will take away great strength of character and a positive and patient attitude from all they have been through during this unprecedented time!

Ok Dragon Fans...are you ready for a Blast from the Past?

This 1935 newspaper article was just sent to us from JCHS Alumnus Jacob Pumphrey, SAU Director of Mulerider Athletics Communications who received it from Great American Conference commissioner Will Prewitt!

It is the earliest Dragon Homecoming on record and the ‚ÄúJunction City eleven‚Äù clashed with Dubach on the local gridiron! The game was played in the afternoon at 2:30 immediately after the parade! Dubach beat the Dragons 6-0.

After the football game on that busy and festive November day, 85 years ago, our Lady Dragons Basketball Team played the Strong Tinymites...WOW...have you ever heard of the Tinymites? I guess Bulldogs is a better mascot!

Ok Dragon Fans...are you ready for a Blast from the Past?

This 1935 newspaper article was just sent to us from JCHS Alumnus Jacob Pumphrey, SAU Director of Mulerider Athletics Communications who received it from Great American Conference commissioner Will Prewitt!

It is the earliest Dragon Homecoming on record and the ‚ÄúJunction City eleven‚Äù clashed with Dubach on the local gridiron! The game was played in the afternoon at 2:30 immediately after the parade! Dubach beat the Dragons 6-0.

After the football game on that busy and festive November day, 85 years ago, our Lady Dragons Basketball Team played the Strong Tinymites...WOW...have you ever heard of the Tinymites? I guess Bulldogs is a better mascot!

FOOTBALL FRIDAY ON THE DSN!
2012 Bearden vs JC! (Regular Season Game)
In 2012, Bearden traveled to Junction City for an early season showdown. As usual, when these two powerhouses met, the winner would be in the driver's seat for the 8AA Conference Title and in all likelihood be a number one seed in the state playoffs. Led by Dragon Legend Shaquille Hunter, Junction City would come from behind for a thrilling victory. This game was a preview of what was to come when these two met again in Little Rock.

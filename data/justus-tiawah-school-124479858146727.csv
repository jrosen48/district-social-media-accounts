2020-21 7th and 8th Grade Math Parents
I am asking that each student have their own calculator.

For 7th grade ...just a plain ol' 4-function calculator. It is important that they do NOT have the +/- key.
I'd recommend the Dollar Store or even Dollar Tree.

For 8th grade we use a scientific calculator. TI 30s Multiview. These are usually available at Walmart, I also found them on amazon for same price.
I have put pictures for reference.

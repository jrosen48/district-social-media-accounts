RIDE THE BUS TO SCHOOL TOMORROW, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 12TH

Wednesday, February 12th is the 120th Day where student ridership on the District’s school buses determines the amount of transportation funds the district will receive for next school year. It is extremely important that all JVPS students ride the bus at least once, to or from school today

For students who drive to school and students that are driven to school, the District requests that these students park or get dropped off at the football field where a bus will transport them to the school. Buses will begin arriving at the football field for student pickup from 7:20 a.m. to 7:50 a.m.

Please ensure your student rides the bus to school or gets dropped off at the football field during designated time frame. We appreciate the support of parents and students as every student counted today is funding to meet the needs of our students.",0.0,"Jemez Valley Public Schools

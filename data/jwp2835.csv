The butter braids that were due to be delivered tomorrow morning will be delayed indefinitely. Because of the school closing we have decided that we will wait until a future date to deliver the product. I was in contact with the vendor this afternoon and we will decide at a later date when the product will be delivered. If you have any questions, please contact me at hvanotterloo@isd2835.org or 507-779-2137.

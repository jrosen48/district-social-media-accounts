These times are hard, no doubt. My teaching colleagues are feeling the strain of trying to do the best possible work for their kids and our community without a guide book or an instruction manual on how to do what hasn't been done before. But I know this - they love these kids and they are as committed to serving them as they've ever been. They're ready to go and so am I. I'm so proud and lucky to be an Albemarle High School teacher. Right here, right now, there is no other place I'd rather be.",12.0,"Trevor Przyuski

More than 60 projects by Henley Middle School Students are on display through October 31 at Center I, the school division’s most recent innovation hub. Cartoons, contour-line drawing, scientifically-inspired botanic illustrations, inky figural pictures, and modular geometric structures appear. Notecards, paper, upcycled surplus price tags, and wallpainters' dropcloth-paper are among the drawing and painting surfaces used.

The Henley student art exhibit is located on the first floor of Center 1, where its Main Street hallway intersects with a second-and-a-half streer corridor. The center is located on the second floor of Seminole Place, a multi-use repurposed light-industrial building at the intersection of Route 29 and Greenbrier Drive. Parking is available behind the building, off of Greenbrier Drive.",2019-10-15 09:35:42,,

During the sales tax holiday, shoppers can buy qualifying school supplies ($20 or less per item) and clothing and footwear ($100 or less per item) without paying sales tax.

This is Matt Haas, Deputy Superintendent for Albemarle County Public Schools.

I apologize for any confusion or blame my discussion with Ms. Hudson may have caused as reported on the NBC 29 Website. When I spoke to her earlier today at about 12:30, I was sharing a speculation that was made earlier by school officials, and I did not have all the latest facts. I did advise Ms. Hudson that the incident was still under investigation.

I spoke to Principal Bonham later today, at approximately 3:30, and he shared with me the conclusions of his investigation, which are shared here in our previous post. They are the most accurate facts of the case.

Again, I apologize, specifically to the Western Albemarle Cheerleaders; my comments were not an official statement, but I should not have made them to a caller while an investigation was incomplete.

This is a message from Jamie Hermann, Superintendent of the Kadoka Area School District.

First, I would like to say thank you for all the efforts and dedication you are putting into your children and their learning over the course of the past several weeks. It has been a journey like no other journey we have taken and experienced before.

As we navigate through the remainder of the school year, I have a few updates to share with you.

The plan is to continue with learning packets and follow the original calendar that was set forth prior to COVID affecting us. This next week we have Monday (April 13th) off so our drop off and pickup time will be Tuesday (April 14th) next week. Meals service will also be resumed on Tuesday as well.

Stay safe, stay healthy and have a wonderful Easter.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2485237571690779&id=1615525228662022,,0.0,"Good Afternoon.

Luckily there was a video taken first! Check it out here!

Staff - thank you for working so hard to keep the educational process for our kids going as much as you can! It's been inspiring to watch you all adapt over these past few weeks and do whatever you can to help kids!

Kids - we miss you! We wish you were here! We hope you're all doing well, staying healthy, and learning as best you can while we are all social distancing! We are all here to help, so please contact us if you need anything!

Traditionally, we sing this song every year at our spring concert. Eighth graders line the front of the stage, and they sing the first verse, with the rest of the choir joining for the remainder of the song. In the middle of the song, eighth graders leave the stage to deliver flowers to their parents/guardians, as a thank you for all their support over the years. Since we didn't get to have a spring concert this year, some of the eighth graders recorded this song on their own at home to honor everyone who has supported them in their lives.

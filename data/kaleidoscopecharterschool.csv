""I grew up in a small town in Northern Minnesota. In May 2019 I graduated from St. Cloud State University with my Bachelor's in Academic and Behavioral Strategist. For the 2019-2020 school year I worked at Fisher Public School.

During my free time I enjoy being a catmom to my almost one year old cat Chanel, reading books, and exploring wildlife.

Pop/Mento Experiment:

Learned about the Reaction

Hypothesis: Sprite will react more than the Coke, because it is a less dense soda.

Conclusion:

First Reaction - Coke is the Winner

Second Reaction - Sprite is the Winner

Same amount of Pop left in each bottle. About a 1/4 of the Pop erupted out of the bottle.

Thank you so much for your commitment to help us with the Kaleidoscope Character School Carnival!

Due to the uncertainty and growing concern regarding public health, KPTO has, in an abundance of caution, made the decision to postpone the Carnival scheduled for March 20th 5p-8p.

We will work with school administration to reschedule once the situation has stabilized.

Any presale ticket forms, will be returned to your classroom teacher to be sent home.

Any donations that came that have been delivered will be stored at school until we are able to host the Carnival later.

Thank you so much,

KCS student Adelyn, spent some time last Wednesday, manually unpackaging a whole pallet of expired cereal boxes, from her dad’s job, so the bags could be given TerraCycle.

She brought all of the bags to school today. Such an amazing act of service!

Way to go Adelyn! #KaleidoscopePRIDE",2020-01-27 16:00:20,,

I am excited to graduate from Kamiah High School and will attend LCSC where I will study to become a special education teacher. I've enjoyed playing sports every year. During high school, I ran Cross Country one year and played volleyball for 2 years. Since 2nd grade I played basketball and continued to play all four years in high school. I was in HOSA with the honor of going to the international competition twice. I enjoyed my time at Kamiah and will miss my classmates. I enjoyed my classes and thank my teachers for pushing me to do my best.

My name is Irene Popp and I have lived in Kamiah my whole life. Throughout high school I have played and lettered in all four years of basketball. I have also been an active member of HOSA, competing in state four times and in internationals two years in a row. This year I had the honor of being our chapters President. I enjoying spending time in the outdoors and with friends and family. This summer I will be fighting fire for the North Fork Ranger District of the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest. In the fall I will be attending Boise State University where I will begin to study pre-pharmacy. I’m sad that high school is coming to an end but I’m excited to start a new chapter in life!

Hi I am Chloe Hescock and I am a senior at Kamiah high school and oh boy where do I begin. I played sports for 3 years of high school because at the end of my junior year I moved away. I have done 4 years of HOSA going to nationals three years in a row but due to covid 19 I was not able to compete in my fourth year of HOSA. I was class president two years in a row my sophomore and my junior year and that was an experience. I would not trade my class in for anything, they are my best friends, even though we fight the majority of the time I will miss them dearly. I want to thank everyone for always pushing me to do better and to go on to better things. Come next fall I will be attending Lewis Clark State College for pre-nursing. So here’s to the class of 2020 for the year that was kind of crazy but hey our whole class is crazy and we are going to go on to do more crazy and fun adventures so here’s to the future and here’s to you class of 2020

You never know how much something you think is menial really matters until you lose it, well that was school for me. I would end up thinking, man I hate that I have to come here everyday, but by each weekend, though I never admitted it, I missed being there especially for classes like English, Financial Algebra, and US. History. I don't know how many of my senior classmates feel the same but I'd bet ten to one it's more than they would admit. There are so many people from the school that deserve thanks, not only from me but from everyone, more than I can name here. Thank you to Mr. Mercer, Mrs. Flerchinger, who was not only our advisor but was also a friend to most of us; Mr. Martin who really deserves to be teacher of a lifetime; and last but not least Mrs. Wilcox, who went above and beyond in her job for us.

I've only attended Kamiah High School for two years, but I can say that it's the best school I've attended. During the past two years, I've participated in National Honor Society and Drama. This year, I was elected class president and will be the class Salutatorian.I plan to attend Idaho State University in Pocatello. I am majoring in Speech-language Pathology. My plan has changed a lot over the years and will probably continue to change, but I want to thank everyone who has stayed by my side throughout all of the changes.

My name is Jordan Hrabak and I have been going to school at KHS since junior year but playing sports for KHS since freshman year. I love playing baseball and football in front of our amazing kub fans. Wasn’t apart of any clubs. I was always told high school flys by and for awhile it didn’t seem true until last year when it finally came in to realization that Graduation is right around the corner. This year especially flew by in the drop of a hat, and now with the situation we are in today it is unbelievable that we may have had our technically last day of school already. I want to thank my teachers, family and my amazing friends that helped make me who I am today and help push me to my best as well and thank all the sports coaches I have had throughout the years. After High school I am attending LCSC in the fall for automotive mechanics just to have a degree under my belt and become a police officer and then way later down the road open up a shop to work on cars. Thanks for the memories Kamiah High School. GO KUBS!

My name is Sarah Bytheway. I am a sibling of 16 children and momentarily taking care of 12 of them. I was a homeschooler up until 9th grade, when I enrolled into Kamiah High School. Throughout the next four years I have participated in 4-H, basketball, theater, several different dance classes, chess tournaments, MMA, school planning and funding and many other community service functions. With the circumstances going on today, I am just grateful to be graduating and starting my new life. In which I start creating this fall at LCSC, where I plan to study Dental Hygiene. Everyone talks about high school flying by quickly and they’re right! But, don’t waste your time thinking about what you could have been during those four years. You are already starting something new each day you wake up, so enjoy that day and make it the best you can.

I’m so proud of the class of 2020! I’m thankful for each and every one of them. Growing up with my classmates was a beautiful adventure. Now we each have evolved into courageous young adults with different lifestyles, personalities, cultures, and many more differences that distinguish us from one another. Our small town school gave us the opportunity to socialize and create friendships that could last a lifetime. School gave us each common memories that we can now reminisce over, or completely ignore! We bonded during field trips, assemblies, games, plays, and everyday class. Although I was a wallflower, and wasn’t involved in much, I didn’t miss out on the beautiful high school experience, and I thank each and every person who helped shape who I am today and helped me graduate from Kamiah High School. Sending good luck and good thoughts to all the graduates.

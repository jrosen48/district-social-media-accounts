Our mission is to support academic excellence through innovation. Since the Kaneland Foundation has no administrative costs, every dollar goes back to our students in the Kaneland District.

Please consider joining us at the Kaneland Foundation Annual Golf Outing on Thursday, September 19, 2019 at Bliss Creek Golf Course in Sugar Grove. Feel free to contact Beth Sterkel at 630-365-8295 or beth.sterkel@kaneland.org with questions you may have about the Kaneland Foundation, https://foundation.kaneland.org/, or to have a registration form mailed or e-mailed to you. Electronic registration on the Kaneland Store, https://kaneland.revtrak.net/Kaneland-Foundation/KF-Golf-Outing/#/list, opened on July 01 allowing you to register and pay electronically.

We are truly grateful for your support to the Foundation and thank you for your sponsorship and participation in the golf outing.

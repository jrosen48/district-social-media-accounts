Yesterday was a terrific first day of school! It was refreshing to have students back in the building!

For your information, we have a paraprofessional aide job position open. KMS is a great place to work! If you are interested, please apply at https://ksdstaff.sedck12.org/ksd/ap/job-detail-view.php?jid=74
The closing date is Aug 21.

Also we are still looking for one more parent Community Council member. Please fill out the attached form and return it to Mr. Bateman. No experience is needed as training will be provided. Be a decision maker for our school. Come join!

Lastly, school pictures are scheduled for next week on Aug 25. Our Back to School night will be different this year due to Covid. Each teacher will be recording a short introduction video presentation to send out instead of meeting in person. We will also have some information about logging into Canvas/SIS. Stay tuned!

Concurrent Enrollment classes taught on the high school campuses will follow the instructional directions set forth by their school district. At this time we anticipate this to mean courses will be taught virtually (online) upon returning from spring break.

Concurrent Enrollment classes taught on the university campus, or DSU Extension Centers, will follow DSU instructional protocols for full time students. Lecture courses will be taught virtually through Canvas as well as other electronic means, for the remainder of the semester. Classes that require hands-on experiences such as clinicals, labs and internships for completion will be addressed via the student’s instructor.

We are excited to start school on Tuesday, August 13 and look forward to having students back! Just a reminder, the first day for Kanab Middle and High will be a full day. Kanab Middle School will end the day at 3:00pm. Kanab Elementary will be half day dismissing at 12:50.

Also, be sure to mark your calendars for our Back to School Night next Tuesday on August 20 at 6pm. We plan to have hot dogs and chips for those who attend so come and enjoy and bring an appetite! Back to School night will be a little different this year as parents and students will be able to visit each class hearing a brief overview of the upcoming year. We will start at 6 pm sharp by meeting in the gym/commons area for 10 minutes, and then off we go to the different classes with a three minute passing period.

Again we are excited to be back and hope to see you at our Back to School Night!

Dear Students, Staff, and Patrons,

We want you to know that we are monitoring the weather closely this evening. The District will have spotters out early in the morning to determine if roads and schools will be ready for buses and patrons. Any decision for a delayed start or closing of schools occurs in the early morning hours when snowplows are out clearing school parking lots.

If a closure or delayed start occurs, the district will announce it here on the Kane District Facebook page and via email and phone calls from your building administrator through the school’s Parent Link notification system.
The announcement will be posted at approximately 6:00 am.

If no announcements are made by the district, school will proceed at the normally scheduled times.

As weather conditions may differ between neighborhoods, we honor a parent’s decision to have your child arrive late or stay home. Teachers will help students make up any work that students miss.",2.0,"Kane County School District

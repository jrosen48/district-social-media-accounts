Happy Earth Day! For the past few weeks Kennedy students have been learning about land artist Andy Goldsworthy and found object artist Tony Cragg. Both artists have ties to the environment: Goldsworthy creates art using only natural materials like rocks, sticks, and leaves; Cragg’s early work was made using found objects as an act of recycling and reusing found and discarded materials.

While students are home, art supplies may be limited, if there are any at all. Using natural and found materials is an accessible alternative to traditional art materials like paint and color pencils.

Here are a couple examples of student projects (a nature mandala and rock stack by 5th grader Miles Yohnka) and Mr. Costanza’s found object sun, an example for students made with his sons in his back yard.

I am so proud of the time that my son put in with me over the past couple of days to protect and help our community! Many of our friends and family in this community do not have the supplies they need due to the Covid 19 pandemic. Medical visors for the hospitals are one of those things. We are proud to donate 23 visors to Riverside's ER after some drafting, 3 prototypes, cutting, filing, stringing, and cleaning. We all appreciate you being on the front lines for us. Stay strong!

Five students from Kankakee High School went to Springfield this past weekend. Maggie Mulcahy, Miguel Espinoza, Jamie Pazino, Isaac Stipp, and Logan Morris have been working since December on learning about all aspects of how government works. The students came up with proposals for bills and ways to lobby for them. These five students went with their proposals to Springfield to partake in the Annual Youth and Government Assembly. As part of the event students from all over the state participate in a mock government.
Organizers are excited to help more Kankakee students be part of the program next year.

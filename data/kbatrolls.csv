No, you don't. We will keep track of your output, but consider this to be a 3 week weekend. As mentioned previously, this is now a contest between you, your will, your laziness and your goals. We could never do it for you...but now, it is really up to you.

VERY hard to say. As I write, the Governor has not ordered a shut down of public schools, the CDA School District did that on their own, but I think it is coming. Shrug. I will update you as I get more information, stay tuned.

We have another Senior Project Good Deed offering for you that is pretty cool. Literally.

Remember the Tree Planting expedition this Fall? The one that feels like it was a million years ago? Well, the Idaho Land Council and Kat are at it again.

This time, it is a class here at the school this Monday 3/2 at 10 a.m. on Snow Measurement and Management (and there is a lot that goes into that, it's a career) followed by a Snow Shoeing Trek to Mt. Spokane the following Monday, 3/9, 8-2, to practice what you learn in the class. Transportation will be provided.

Since it involves two days of commitment, it will satisfy BOTH of your Good Deeds for Senior Project. You Seniors who have been putting off your Good Deeds? It’s a great opportunity.

You will need to sign a waiver in order to participate. They are available in the Office. It’s first come, first serve and it’s a 20 person bus, so if you are interested hop to it.

We have another Senior Project Good Deed offering for you that is pretty cool. Literally.

Remember the Tree Planting expedition this Fall? The one that feels like it was a million years ago? Well, the Idaho Land Council and Kat are at it again.

This time, it is a class here at the school this Monday 3/2 at 10 a.m. on Snow Measurement and Management (and there is a lot that goes into that, it's a career) followed by a Snow Shoeing Trek to Mt. Spokane the following Monday, 3/9, 8-2, to practice what you learn in the class. Transportation will be provided.

Wow. This message is usually a late November thing, but I am beginning to think this is going to be a Special Winter.

So, here is the deal: If the Couer d'Alene School District closes due to weather, we do too. The best way to know this is to tune in to KREM2 or KXLY11 in the morning. I will do my best to post to our Facebook page if we are closing, but I don't know til I see it on the TV myself.

In the event of school closure, any work you do on the weekend will be counted as ""bonus"" work like it would Friday-Sunday.

There is a Parent's Day/Preregistration on Thursday 8/29 from 8-2. You can meet with the Teachers, figure out a plan for the coming school year and eat some sweet snacks!

The first day of school is Tuesday, September 3rd. Attendance will be taken (5 lessons a day) from that point on. Don't pretend you didn't know, it's the same start of school you've been doing since you were 5.

The School Year is rapidly drawing to a close. We here at KBA are super excited to Graduate our TENTH Class! If you have a student walking with the Class of 2019, they were probably in 2nd Grade when we got this whole thing rolling. Hard to believe how the years have gone by, with each year just getting better and more fun.

However, from the Department of Not So Fun, every year the State asks us to Torture you, our Family, into taking a brief Survey. This one is actually pretty painless as such things go. If you could take 5 minutes to hit the below link to offer your feedback, it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks so much! Silverwood on the 22nd, GRADUATION ON JUNE 5TH!!!

The School Year is rapidly drawing to a close. We here at KBA are super excited to Graduate our TENTH Class! If you have a student walking with the Class of 2019, they were probably in 2nd Grade when we got this whole thing rolling. Hard to believe how the years have gone by, with each year just getting better and more fun.

KBA is going to Silverwood Wednesday, May 22nd. The bus will leave the school at 9 bells and be back around 3:30. This is TOTALLY FREE to active KBA students, and it even includes a HUGE lunch spread prepared by the friendly Silverwood Elves.

SCHOOL WILL BE CLOSED ALL DAY.

Permission slips are available downstairs at the end of the table or upstairs in the office. PERMISSION SLIPS ARE DUE BY FRIDAY MAY 17TH, we have to tell Silverwood how much BBQ to cook for us.

This is always fun, and, now that Summer is here it should be a beautiful way to spend the day, we hope you attend.

KBA History is about to be made! Our First Ever Prom!

This is a Privately Held Event - the School is not officially involved, but all KBA students are invited. Purchase of Tickets or anything else goes through Lorrie, not Dodi or I. Lorrie is also the person to contact if you have any questions.

The Venue is in Post Falls across from Qemelin Park, it looks like a nice place. You should attend! It could be a lot of fun. It definitely won't be like Proms at the Big Schools, that much is for sure.

There are copies of this flyer available at the school.

Look for Dodi and I at the front desk, we will take down your name and give you a bracelet that is good for all activities except Raptor Reef. They don't allow outside food, so bring some money for their snack bar and for the arcade.

For you who need a Senior Summit Volunteer Activity, I cannot imagine a better cause, or a more efficient one. After we get back from Break we can tune this up, but in the meantime mark your calendar. Or your Phone. Whatever. 😎

""Good evening I I'm contacting you because you showed interest in volunteering with Panhandle Autism Society. We will be having enough volunteers for setup so we are needing people to stay after the event is over to help with cleanup. It is one of our biggest struggles every year to have enough people who stay behind to help us clean up and we are responsible for the park for this event and we would love any participation we can get the more people we have the faster it will go. The event is from 10 to 12 on Saturday April 13th at mceuen Park in Coeur d'Alene Idaho. Clean up should probably he started a little bit before the event ends but I would estimate it wouldn't be more than a half an hour to 45 minutes after the event is over.

While school is open today (1/9) SPEECH IS CANCELLED! Just got a text from Jill, she slid into a ditch and when she got out of her rig slipped and fell, so we are Jill-less today. She is fine, she just lives in Darkest Rathdrum on a dirt road and I guess it's basically impassable.

Yes, School is Open Wednesday, January 9th. The rule is, if the Coeur d'Alene School District is open, we are open too. You can check their status on Krem 2, KXLY or KHQ. You can also call the Snow Hotline at 208-667-0784.

That said, if you live in outlying areas and can work from home, that might be smart. It is supposed to get up to 40 today, so any freezing rain will melt as the day progresses.

Be careful out there! Drive slow, lots of following distance, you know the drill.

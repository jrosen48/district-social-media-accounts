The updated changes to the calendar will make revisions in previously scheduled holiday breaks, family advocacy days, and move the start of the school year for students to Tuesday, September 8th to better align with other districts in the area. The changes will allow for the end of the school year to only be pushed back by one day for both students and teachers.

The first nine weeks will remain remote learning ONLY.

In addition, the updated calendar moves the start date for all returning teachers back to August 17th and eliminates Wednesday professional development half days for the entire school year. The state mandates how many hours each student is required to be in class (Kindergarten through 11th grade: 1116 hours, 12th grade: 1086 hours). These changes allow for the district to meet those mandated hours.

The updated changes to the calendar will make revisions in previously scheduled holiday breaks, family advocacy days, and move the start of the school year for students to Tuesday, September 8th to better align with other districts in the area. The changes will allow for the end of the school year to only be pushed back by one day for both students and teachers.

The first nine weeks will remain remote learning ONLY.

In addition, the updated calendar moves the start date for all returning teachers back to August 17th and eliminates Wednesday professional development half days for the entire school year. The state mandates how many hours each student is required to be in class (Kindergarten through 11th grade: 1116 hours, 12th grade: 1086 hours). These changes allow for the district to meet those mandated hours.

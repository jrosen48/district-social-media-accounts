Thank you, Class Act!

First graders at Glenwood had a great indoor recess using new games which were purchased with Class Act funds. Each year our school receives a check from Class Act. We used a portion of those funds to purchase a variety of games and activities that incorporate critical thinking, problem solving, and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) to keep kids thinking, creating, and extending their learning, even during recesss time. We are incredibly thankful to everyone who supports Class Act. Your donations will make classroom activities and recess more engaging for all of our Glenwood Gladiators.",0.0,"Glenwood Elementary

Daniel Falk presented a Gaga Pit to Park Elementary as part of his Eagle Scout requirements. The pit was designed by Daniel and constructed with the help of other KHS students, many of whom attended Park Elementary. Unique to this Gaga Ball pit, Daniel added wheels so the pit can be easily moved inside or to another location. In addition, the pit can be divided into two pits for additional play.

Thank you to Daniel, the sponsors/donors, and construction helpers for this great addition to Park Elementary School.

Gaga Ball is played like dodge ball only with one ball. When the ball hits you below your knees, you are out of the game.

He offers to hold the door for others at recess and is a good friend on and off the playground. Ryan uses ""please"" and ""thank you"" and in doing so encourages the rest of his classmates to use their manners too. Ryan is always willing to lend a helping hand.

Sebastian showed great kindness today at lunch recess. He saw a new student to our school who was playing alone. Sebastian went up to the student, introduced himself, explained how he too was a new student last year, and asked him to come play with him. SO AWESOME!!!! Display that yard sign proudly, Sebastian!

With the United States expansion of the travel ban, and the desire to flatten the COVID-19 curve and not overwhelm our medical community, Kearney Public Schools, along with Hastings and Grand Island Public Schools, will be extending students’ Spring Break starting tomorrow, March 16 through March 29.

There has not been a confirmed case in Buffalo, Hall, or Adams County, however, CDC guidance requires social distancing and separation of large groups of people. We view our regular school day as something that would constitute a large gathering. We also see this extended break as an opportunity to thoroughly clean and disinfect our buildings and our facilities team will work diligently to make sure we have cleaned all areas appropriately. Additionally, all activities and sports practices will be cancelled and KCLC will not be in session.

Our top priority is the safety of our students, staff and, in this case, the greater community and we hope these efforts will serve our community health in a productive way.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3162804923731187&id=194914887186887,,0.0,"KPS Families,

With the United States expansion of the travel ban, and the desire to flatten the COVID-19 curve and not overwhelm our medical community, Kearney Public Schools, along with Hastings and Grand Island Public Schools, will be extending students’ Spring Break starting tomorrow, March 16 through March 29.

There has not been a confirmed case in Buffalo, Hall, or Adams County, however, CDC guidance requires social distancing and separation of large groups of people. We view our regular school day as something that would constitute a large gathering. We also see this extended break as an opportunity to thoroughly clean and disinfect our buildings and our facilities team will work diligently to make sure we have cleaned all areas appropriately. Additionally, all activities and sports practices will be cancelled and KCLC will not be in session.

Our top priority is the safety of our students, staff and, in this case, the greater community and we hope these efforts will serve our community health in a productive way.",2020-03-15 17:29:36,,

A couple weeks ago the students had a coin challenge & raised $933.00. Combined with additional donations made during the book fair, there was a total of $950.00! We used every dollar collected to purchase books ranging from preschool to middle school age.

This Christmas Season the Kearney Public Schools TeamMate Program is wrapping gifts at the Hilltop Mall. TeamMate Mentors and Mentees will be staffing the booth evenings and weekends from December 6 through Christmas Eve.

Busy shoppers are invited to bring gifts they purchased at the Mall, ordered online or purchased at other retail stores to be wrapped.

Proceeds help support the activities of the Kearney TeamMate Program. TeamMate Mentees wrapping gifts are helping support a program they benefit from. They are also building social skills, problem solving and critical thinking skills.

The TeamMates Mentoring Program was founded in 1991 by Tom and Nancy Osborne to provide support and encouragement to school aged youth. TeamMates of Kearney Public Schools have been serving youth since 1999 and currently serve 67 youth. Mentors meet one hour per week at the school to provide support and encouragement to youth. To become a mentor go to www.teammates.org.

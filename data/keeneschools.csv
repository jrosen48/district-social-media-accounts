Jessie hails from Massachusetts, and this will be her first year teaching after several years’ experience through substituting, paraprofessional positions, and coordinating an after-school program. What she loves most about working with kids is being a role model and inspire them to be excited and motivated about their learning. Her goal is to have her students leave the classroom feeling confident in all their abilities, not only academically but outside of the classroom as well!

Jessie enjoys spending time with friends and family and caring for her dog Cooper and cat Sadie. She loves reading (huge Stephen King fan), traveling, yoga, and tending to her growing house plant collection! Welcome to Fuller School, Jessie!",0.0,"SAU29

All schools shall implement frequent hand washing procedures that align with the CDC Guidance Considerations for Schools. While hand sanitizer has become an acceptable and convenient way to clean hands, the best method for maintaining hand hygiene is with soap and water. Here are the five steps to washing your hands the right way as recommended in the ""CDC When and How to Wash Your Hands"" guidelines:

1. Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap.
2. Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
3. Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the “Happy Birthday” song from beginning to end twice.
4. Rinse your hands well under clean, running water.
5. Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry them.

Hand hygiene will begin as soon as anyone enters the buildings. A hand sanitizing station shall be located at the entrance and upon arrival, all students, staff and essential visitors shall sanitize their hands.",0.0,"SAU29

¡Hola! (Don't worry about trying to say my last name. You can call me Mr. B. -- or Profe B. in Spanish.)
The proud hiking companion of two dare-devil rabbits, I'm coming to KMS in my sixth year of teaching Middle School Spanish. I am actually coming back to the area: I used to work down the road in Hancock, teaching outdoor skills at a magical place called Sargent Camp, many moons ago. In recent years, however, I have taken on the rewarding work of teaching Spanish in the classroom. I am so glad to be back in the Monadnock Region!

The thing I love most about teaching Spanish is helping learners express themselves and their ideas in a new language, as they discover for themselves the best-kept secret of language-learning: It's easier than you think! After all, our brains are hard-wired for language!

When I'm not teaching, you can find me in one of three places: curled up with a good book, out among the trees and mountains of New Hampshire, or on a paddleboard crewed by Captain Hatchet (the gray one) and First Mate Auger (the white one).",0.0,"SAU29

'All of us are excited to have our students back soon,' he says. 'At the same time, many of us are nervous. But if we all work together, just like in the video of the barn move, we will be okay.'

It is now time to start the conversations with your children about face coverings, hand washing, and proper distancing, as outlined in our previous posts here on Facebook.

Artwork by Reagan Hopkins.

Students in Ms. Nelken's art class at Keene Middle School have been recording their experiences during the Covid pandemic through cartoons. All the art was created by students in their homes while receiving online instruction, using their own art supplies. The art shows both the difficulty of staying at home, online schooling, and being separated from friends. The work highlights our students' ability to thrive during these times through exercise, cooking, art, finding humor in the small things, and spending lots of time with family pets.",0.0,"SAU29

Quoting Superintendent Malay, reflecting on these last few months: ""the struggles and challenges have been real just like the successes and triumphs have been real. But at the end of the day, the one constant that has held true, despite the struggles, the hardships, the challenges, and the difficulties, has been the belief that we CAN and will get through this."" Wishing everyone a fun summer!

Students in Ms. Nelken's art class at Keene Middle School have been recording their experiences during the Covid pandemic through cartoons. All the art was created by students in their homes while receiving online instruction, using their own art supplies. The art shows both the difficulty of staying at home, online schooling, and being separated from friends. The work highlights our students' ability to thrive during these times through exercise, cooking, art, finding humor in the small things, and spending lots of time with family pets.",0.0,"SAU29

On May 27-29 from 4-7 pm, May 30 from noon-3 pm, and June 3-4 from 4-7 pm, 2020 graduates are invited to come to The Colonial (in cap and gown we hope) and the Colonial will personalize the marquee with their name for pictures (first come first served). Free popcorn snack provided, too!

Also, between now and June 5, any graduate who takes a photo under the Class of 2020 Marquee and posts their picture on Facebook or Instagram, tagging @colonialkeene, liking their page, and using the hashtag #colonialgrads will be featured on the Colonial's pages and entered into a drawing for movie passes or free concessions.

We are very proud to announce that our own Jennifer Antosiewicz has been selected as ""Early Childhood Educator of the Year"" for the Monadnock Region. Jennifer is a Careers in Education Instructor at the Cheshire Career Center at Keene High School. This award program is sponsored by the Cheshire Children's Museum and Impact Monadnock/The Monadnock United Way.

""Jennifer was selected in part because of her ability to meet the needs of individual children, to demonstrate theory versus reality, and her communication expertise with children, families and her colleagues,” explains Deb Ganley from the Cheshire Children's Museum. “We had so many excellent candidates. It was not an easy decision. Jennifer also has the responsibility of teaching future early childhood educators, so her example as a role model is critical in what she does.”

It's been a while since the High 5 team visited SAU29 KeeneSchoolDistrict classrooms, but that won't stop us from sharing from one of our more recent sessions!

Franklin and Wheelock Elementary School 5th graders spent time thinking about leadership. Students brainstormed a list of leadership traits before identifying traits they think they already have (orange dots) and skills they want to work on (yellow dots). At this time, we recognize the importance of all of these leadership traits - whether in the classroom or learning from home. We greatly miss Keene School District students and staff, and hope to see you all soon. Take good care!",0.0,"Edge of Leadership

Due to social distancing, Kelliher School is cancelling the “Taste of Kelliher” scheduled for April 18, 2020. The money raised from that event funded the Kelliher Alumni Scholarship.

Kelliher seniors need your help! There is no way for us to have another gathering or to sell products door-to-door. So…we need your monetary donations!

Please consider mailing a donation for the Kelliher Alumni Scholarship. We hope to raise enough money to award the same amount as we gave last year. If we do that, it would be awesome! Any money over and above that amount will be added to the principal in the Alumni Scholarship account.

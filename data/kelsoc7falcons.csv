Better hurry! We only have 10 black Falcons masks left and just a few dozen blue remaining. All are $5 each and have been a HIT with parents, grandparents and alumni so far! 👏
To get your masks, simply call the school office or message this page with quantity needed and color(s) desired.
🔸You may pay with cash or check (written to the Kelso C-7 PTO.) Please send money inside your child’s backpack, and we’ll send back the mask.

The Scott-Mississippi County Area School Superintendents have met and made the decision to extend the school closure up to and including April 13th. For Kelso C-7 School, there is no change of dates from the previous communications. Classes will resume on April 14th. This decision will be re-evaluated on April 6th. At this time, districts across the state are continually evaluating the situation, taking the advice of state and local health departments, as well as the CDC, to make informed and careful decisions. Our main concern is the health and well-being of our students and their families.

We will continue to provide breakfast and lunch to our families during this extended closure on Mondays (2 meals), Wednesday (2 meals), and Fridays (1 meal). Please continue to monitor communications through our emails, our Facebook page, and our website.

To kick of the week, we have our Board of Education President, Mrs. Leonna Heuring.

Here's some fun facts from Mrs. Heuring about herself:
👉Both my husband and I are Kelso C-7 alumni; I was in the class of 1994 and Dean was in the class of 1987. Our son, Rolen, is a seventh grader here.
👉I was a member of Kelso C-7’s first girls’ basketball teams which began in the 1991-1992 school year.
👉Retired Kelso C-7 teacher, Mrs. Debra Nenninger, who continues to substitute teach at Kelso C-7, was my teacher in 6th, 7th, and 8th grades.
👉My sister is Kari Wilhelm, who is a 1992 grad of Kelso C-7 and has several kids who attend Kelso C-7.

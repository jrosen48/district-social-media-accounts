We raise our voices with our many community partners and call for the eradication of racist elements in our systems that have historically disempowered and disenfranchised black students.

Like our students, we strive for a world where we, our families, and our communities can live free of bigotry and discrimination and enjoy equality of opportunity. As a school, we believe education is a tool that all of us can use to bring about meaningful change in our country and in the world.

We often go on record when schools are not living up to our expectations so I had to say how much I appreciate the staff, teachers and my sons IEP teachers for their efforts. The level of organization, patience, structure, committed/caring/compassionate teachers puts them in a category all by themselves.

Tonight during the Special School Board meeting, the School Board appointed Dr. Godfrey as the COVID Coordinator for Kenmare School District. The School Board also voted to change the start day of the school year to August 26th. Staff will report on their regular scheduled day of August 17. This will give us extra time to ensure our Smart Restart plan is complete and communicated in depth to our families. Next week, I will be convening a district task force to begin developing our plan to return to school. While we discussed fairly solid options tonight, we want to make sure what we do moving forward is in the best interest of our students' health, safety, and educational needs while also adhering to the Governor's guidelines. I would also like to ensure all of you that you will be informed every step of the way. Thank you for supporting our district!

Due to the strong possibility of inclement weather on Sunday, graduation ceremonies will be moved to the auditorium. Each student may invite up to eight family members. The auditorium will be sectioned off for families, and seniors will participate in a drawing after graduation practice on Saturday to select their family's spot. No other members of the community will be allowed inside the school during the ceremony. When students are called upon to receive their diplomas, the school board president will place the diploma on a table for the student to retrieve. Parents who wish to, may join their graduate on the stage to physically present the diploma to them.

Students in grades K-2 will be allowed to check out a Chromebook IF there is not a device for them to use at home.

Students and parents will not be allowed in the building for your safety--those materials will be brought out to you. Please remember to practice social distancing while waiting. KPS wants you to stay healthy and safe!

If there any questions, please send a message to the Facebook page or an email to tgodfrey@mykps.us or tcunningham@mykps.us

The Pierre School District's Food Service Department recently partnered with the Southeast Community Center to feed those in need and reduce food waste. Monday, January 27th, Georgia Morse Middle school kicked off the partnership by donating beef and cheese burritos and corn to SECC.

It is important that every student is fed. It is also important that our left over food not be thrown in the trash. The Food Service Department takes care in estimating the amount of food that needs to be prepared each day but are bound to have some remaining after the lunch period. Our kitchen managers can predict the lunch count fairly accurately and are geniuses when it comes to saving and refreezing certain items for next time. However, many of our products do not freeze and reheat well like the burritos pictured. We want to stop filling trash cans and start filling bellies with our leftovers.

It is important that every student is fed. It is also important that our left over food not be thrown in the trash. The Food Service Department takes care in estimating the amount of food that needs to be prepared each day but are bound to have some remaining after the lunch period. Our kitchen managers can predict the lunch count fairly accurately and are geniuses when it comes to saving and refreezing certain items for next time. However, many of our products do not freeze and reheat well like the burritos pictured. We want to stop filling trash cans and start filling bellies with our leftovers.

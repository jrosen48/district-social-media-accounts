Officer Mike Meyer has served our community as a patrol officer, an SRO and our longest running DARE officer at 13 years! We estimate that over Officer Meyer's DARE career he has had a positive impact on the lives of 19,000 Kennewick School District, Bethlehem Lutheran School and St. Joseph's Catholic School (Kennewick, WA) 5th graders. Officer Meyer was also instrumental in several of our other youth services programs, such as Every 15 Minutes and our crossing guard picnic.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says one of the best ways to do that is to properly wash your hands.

That means you should:

-Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap.

-Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.

-Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the “Happy Birthday” song from beginning to end twice.

-Rinse your hands well under clean, running water.

Here are your flu FAQs answered...

Can my child go to school if they are sick?

No. Your child should stay home to rest and to avoid spreading flu to other children or caregivers.

When can my child go back to school after having flu?

Keep your child home from school for at least 24 hours after their fever is gone. (The fever should be gone without the use of a fever-reducing medicine.) A fever is defined as 100°F (37.8°C)* or higher.

How long can a sick person spread flu to others?

People with flu may be able to infect others from 1 day before getting sick to up to 5 to 7 days after. Severely ill people or young children may be able to spread the flu longer, especially if they still have symptoms.

Books on the Go! Good stuff from Kenowa Hills Public Schools.

Led by Liz Greemann (left) and Brooke Johnston, teachers at Kenowa Hills Alpine Elementary School, Books on the Go aimed to create opportunities this summer for children to see themselves as readers and for families to learn skills and strategies to support literacy at home.

All summer, a mobile reading van (that also included ice cream) visited common locations on a consistent schedule for an interactive read aloud, phonic and vocabulary games (with social distancing expectations communicated in advance) and more.

District high school students and other Kenowa Hills staff members served as volunteers, and every student left with a new book of their choice to bring home.

We know many parents want their Knights back in the classroom for face-to-face learning, and rest assured, so do we! We also know from parent feedback and surveys that some parents have concerns about sending students back to face-to-face learning during the pandemic.

Starting in the Fall of 2020, we will be offering a 100% online option for those families who want to keep their students home this fall. Please read the graphic for more info, and if you would like to receive early updates on the 100% online learning experience, please complete the form at: https://tinyurl.com/khvirtual

We will continue to keep all of our families informed of the plans for face-to-face learning as well as our virtual learning experience as we hear more from the State and monitor things closely.

The event titled ""Hands On Health"" was just that - Knights attended various breakout sessions such as anatomy and physiology, occupational therapy and medical simulation models. In the anatomy and physiology session, students learned from one of DUs professors how the lungs function and interacted with actual pig lungs. In the occupational therapy session, students got to experience what happens to people who have a stroke or brain injury and lose various abilities, having to relearn simple day -to-day activities.

DU has a state of the art medical simulation lab where students were able to listen to healthy versus unhealthy breathing.

Yet another great experience for our students to explore opportunities for their future!

These experiences range from participating in a District School Improvement Team meeting or a Board of Education meeting, shadowing leaders throughout the district, and subbing for a building principal or assistant principal. Leadership Program participants conclude the program with a culminating, in-depth project that supports our district's continuous improvement and growth.

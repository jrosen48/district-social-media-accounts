As Kentridge High School Senior Jaden Hunter prepares to graduate, he wants our community to know, ""During hard times and even when you are feeling lonely or lost just put yourself out there and you will be satisfied with how many new experiences and friends you make along the way.""

During his time at KR, Jaden enjoyed making new friends and people who he will consider family for a long time. He also participated in football, track, and was an officer for BSU. He plans to attend San Antonio College in the fall to study political science.

Congratulations to Jaden and our #KSDClassof2020!

Mr. Ken is so much more than a custodian at Sawyer Woods. He builds incredibly genuine connections with every single student. He is approachable and makes everyone feel included and welcome. Most of all, Mr. Ken has a heart for kids who need just a little bit more support. He can be seen working around our campus with his ""buddies"" which is so valuable for those students. He recognizes the value in every single employee and student in the building, making them feel seen and a part of this community. Sure, Mr. Ken does great work keeping our building safe and clean, but what he can do by cultivating meaningful relationships with students is even more amazing.

Prior to teaching at Emerald Park, she taught first-grade at Covington Elementary. Peggy had a keen interest in child development and learning/memory theory when she was at the University of Illinois. She continued her education at the University of Washington and was a leader in the field of Early Childhood Special Education.

Peggy had the opportunity to help open Emerald Park and was surrounded by dedicated staff who worked well together to build an amazing school culture and community. She said she truly found a home at that school. Over the years, Peggy learned teaching is both an art and a science, and a truly great teacher is a master of both.

Hey Friends - we need your assistance!! Do you have time this week to help us with a little project?!

In May, there are three big recognition weeks - Nurses‚Äô Week May 6-12; National Hospital Week May 10-16; and EMS Week May 17-23 - and we want to show our local medical professionals how much they are appreciated in our community!

We would love to get a bunch of cards or drawings from kids thanking our local hospital staff, nurses and EMS personnel! Please place your cards/drawings starting Monday in the drop box at Covington City Hall (16720 SE 271st St) by Friday, May 1 at noon. The box, shown in the picture, will be located by the table in front of Suite #100 (the entrance to the city hall front desk). *Oh, and please leave any envelopes unsealed.

Our Teacher of the Year nominee, Mr. Parsons, took the idea and ran with it managing to raise over a $1000 in donations for his class to buy books.

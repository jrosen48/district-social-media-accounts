I love how many people are supportive of teachers and are understanding of the difficulties we’re facing...

But I need to show appreciation for the custodial staff at Keokuk High School. Our building has always been maintained and clean but since covid-19 came around the diligence they’ve used in keeping our environment safe is so amazing.

So to the custodial and maintenance staff-
We see you constantly on the move.
We see you providing us with supplies.
We see you taking extra care in making sure surfaces have been cleaned and sanitized.
We see you shouldering more of the responsibilities so we have more time to work with the kids.
We see you.
Thank you.",9.0,"Katie Geltz

Hello Little Chief families,

I’m sorry I’m posting this late at night but I wanted to get this information out to you as soon as I made the decision, which has been hard to make.

We’re sorry to say that we are cancelling the Parent Parade tomorrow. While we’ve all been looking forward to seeing our students, there have been some new developments locally as the COVID-19 has now spread into Lee County. Many of our staff also live in neighboring states that have made orders for residents to stay at home. It would be irresponsible on our part to encourage families and staff to travel to our schools under the new circumstances. Sorry to disappoint!

Please take care! Take precautions and practice social distancing! We miss you very much!!

Sincerely,
Mr. Marsden

The Keokuk High School Concert Band has been chosen as the 3A Concert Band for the 2020 Iowa Bandmasters Association (IBA) Conference. This is the highest achievement a concert band and band program in the state of Iowa can receive.

On January 10, our band recorded 3 pieces and submitted them to a committee of band directors from all levels and classes. Many bands submitted recordings, but only one band from each class is chosen from the entire state. This is a huge honor for this program, with Keokuk High School’s last appearance on the IBA stage being in 1995.

The cold weather last Friday didn’t stop the PGSB crew and our customers from having a great time at our tailgate event before the Keokuk-Fairfield football game! We also made three check presentations in Keokuk and one in Mount Pleasant. Pictured are a $1,000 donation to Legacy Theater, $2,000 donation to Keokuk Music and Athletic Boosters and $15,000 donation to Hoerner YMCA (photo credit: Daily Gate City). Also pictured below is a $2,000 donation to the Mount Pleasant Music and Athletic Boosters taken at Friday night’s home football game. We’re proud to live, work and contribute in these communities!

We want to thank American Idol’s Dave Pittman for coming to Keokuk High School today. A couple of important points he shared was acceptance first and then embracing the issue or change in your life. The only way to beat failure is to accept and embrace the change. That is how you overcome adversity. Dave suffers from Tourette Syndrome and when he sings you would never know it. He is a special person and living proof that you can overcome anything. #KPride",0.0,"K-Pride at Keokuk High School

(Wonder of the Week)

Mrs. Ard is a wonder in the classroom! She just received a $300 grant from the Keokuk Community School Foundation to increase her thematic mentor text library. Congratulations!

Her students are doing a wonderful job meeting our little chief expectations. They have filled their classroom basket with chief change and added it to our school wide bucket, great teamwork!

For those wondering about Mrs. Ard outside the classroom, here is a small glimpse.
She has been teaching for 29 years, with 17 years in the Keokuk School District.
Everyone in her family (including her husband, all 3 children, and herself) hold degrees from WIU!
When she was in elementary school she wanted to be a comedian🙂
Some of her favorites are: reading, the color blue, spending time with family and friends, almost anything chocolate, and floating in the pool.

W.O.W. Wednesday
(Wonder of the Week)

Mrs. Ard is a wonder in the classroom! She just received a $300 grant from the Keokuk Community School Foundation to increase her thematic mentor text library. Congratulations!

Her students are doing a wonderful job meeting our little chief expectations. They have filled their classroom basket with chief change and added it to our school wide bucket, great teamwork!

For those wondering about Mrs. Ard outside the classroom, here is a small glimpse.
She has been teaching for 29 years, with 17 years in the Keokuk School District.
Everyone in her family (including her husband, all 3 children, and herself) hold degrees from WIU!
When she was in elementary school she wanted to be a comedian🙂
Some of her favorites are: reading, the color blue, spending time with family and friends, almost anything chocolate, and floating in the pool.

Keep up the great work little chief family and check back next week to see who the next W.O.W. Wednesday will feature.",2019-09-18 21:46:31,,

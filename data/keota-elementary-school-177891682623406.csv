Keota Students,

I wanted to let you know that I am thinking about each and every one of you. I want each of you to know that your teachers, support staff, janitors, cooks, and all who work at school miss you. We know that this can be hard to understand and confusing, and that is okay. We are here to help like we would any other day.

We hope you take some time to relax and know that your parents/guardians are doing their best to help you too! Change is scary, but change makes us grow stronger. If you have any questions for me, you can have your parents call or email me or respond below this post and I will do my best to respond as quickly as I can. I want to be here to help each and every one of you.

Please take some time to play, be imaginative, or just sit and relax with a good book. I will continue to think about each of you! Take care and be awesome like I know each of you are!

Sincerely,
Mr. K

Due to missing last week's STEM Club session, we will make up that time this Thursday, February 20th. Instead of pickup time at 5:00pm, we will go until 5:30pm. This is the same night the boys host district basketball and we understand if this change does not work, please just let the office know if this time change does not work and we will have your son/daughter ready at 5:00pm.

Parents,

Due to missing last week's STEM Club session, we will make up that time this Thursday, February 20th. Instead of pickup time at 5:00pm, we will go until 5:30pm. This is the same night the boys host district basketball and we understand if this change does not work, please just let the office know if this time change does not work and we will have your son/daughter ready at 5:00pm. Thank you in advance!

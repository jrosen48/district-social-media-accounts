As we enter this new realm of education, please know that we have many of the same concerns that we are hearing from you. How will this work for my child? As educators, we would much rather have your child on campus, eating in the cafeteria, sitting in the classroom, or playing on the playground. However, our country is facing the first pandemic since 1918 and we are all having to make adjustments, learning as we go.

The administration is preparing a plan that must be approved by the Oklahoma Department of Education. This plan will then be shared with the teachers who will begin preparing information to be shared with students and parents. This is a process and we have until April 6 to work through it. We will make adjustments as we go, with hopes that we will be allowed to return to campus in time for summer school.

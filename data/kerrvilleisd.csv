The student was on campus for a brief time Monday morning before exhibiting symptoms, being assessed and then sent home. The campus has completed the contact tracing process which identifies students or staff who were in close contact with the student who tested positive.
The student who tested positive and anyone in close contact with the student will not return to school until they have met the criteria to return safely. Extensive cleaning of the classrooms and common areas has taken place.
KISD Active Positive Cases will now be recorded on our district website. Near the bottom of the homepage, in the photo collage is a photo of masks that turns red when you hover over it, with COVID Dashboard. That will take you to the district COVID dashboard that will be updated on a regular basis with the current number of active COVID cases identified in currently enrolled students and employees.

Dear KISD Teachers,

We are incredibly proud to see our virtual and in-person KISD schools up and running for the 2020-2021 year! As a token of our gratitude, the Kerrville Public School Foundation is happy to announce our Caring During COVID Initiative. Under this initiative, KPSF will provide each KISD teacher a $100 gift card to H-E-B for classroom needs. We know that many of you often spend funds for your classrooms out of your own pockets, and we hope this gift card lets you know how much we appreciate your efforts on behalf of our KISD students. You will receive your gift cards early next week from your school principal.

Thanks for making the 2020-2021 school year a reality for our students and families.

Have a great year,

KPSF Board of Directors",10.0,"What an amazing gift to our teachers! Thank you for all that you do for our teachers and students, KPSF!

Online learning from home isn't ideal for everyone and presents many challenges for all teachers, parents and students involved. But it also offers some opportunities: to focus on the end goal, show GRIT and finish strong. Schools may be closed, but learning isn't cancelled.
In every classroom in the district is our Profile of a Graduate poster with the five characteristics every KISD graduate should have. Now, maybe more than ever, our students need to show grit and stay goal-focused to finish out the school year strong.
Over the next several weeks, we'll be sharing encouragement and motivation from our students and staff so that we can #FinishStrongKISD.",2020-04-20 10:00:58,,

Dear KISD Parents,

I hope this letter finds you safe and healthy.

Earlier today, Governor Greg Abbott announced that schools will remain closed for the rest of the school year. We are saddened by this decision, but know it is made in the best interest of safety for our students, staff and community.

We will continue our Virtual KISD online learning and meal program for the remainder of the school year. Decisions about closing out the semester and graduation for our seniors will be made and communicated in the coming weeks.

We are disappointed that we will not see our students return to their campuses this year, but we will get through this together and look forward to seeing them again for the start of the new school year in August.

Thank you for your continued patience and support during this time.

TOM DANIELS ROBOTICS TEAM WINS AWARD

The Tom Daniels Elementary School Mustangs Robotics Team recently captured first place in the Grand Champion Robotics competition at Schreiner University. After seeing single-use plastic water bottles everywhere, the team designed a limited edition sticker to bring awareness to the issue. The money raised by these stickers will be used to purchase more reusable bottles.

Team members Addison Wrase and Olivia Wrase and coach Elizabeth Wrase dropped by City Hall last week to show the logo to City of Kerrville Assistant Public Works Director David Barrera.

“These types of initiatives by our community are very much appreciated, and we’re glad to help support them,” Barrera said. “Our department’s other assistant director, Scott Loveland, has purchased stickers and plans to add them to one of our educational outreach campaigns beginning soon.”

The Tom Daniels Robotics Team has also been instrumental in adding a water bottle refill station at Tom Daniels.",0.0,"Way to go, Tom Daniels Robotics Team! Bringing positive change not just to their campus, but to the environment also!

Yesterday the KPSF board had the honor of visiting the new Aviation Program at Tivy. What an amazing sight! Mr. Cook and his class showed us where our donor dollars have been put in to play. We were able to see the three flight simulators purchased last year to start the program, along with a brand-new flight simulator purchased a month ago. This program has been a tremendous success and it was great to see the student’s excitement as they demonstrated how to use the flight simulators.

KISD STUDENTS LEARNING ABOUT CITY GOVERNMENT

This morning students from the KISD Challenge Lab program visited City Hall for a tour of the city led by Councilmember Kim Clarkson, Planning Director Drew Paxton, and Sherry Mosier, Manager Strategic Initiatives. The program of study is called Utopian Destinations and through hands-on activities, students gain awareness of ways in which people in the local community and other communities meet their needs for government, education, communication, transportation, and recreation. Students compare and contrast urban and rural locations, as well as study on how cities evolve over time. Additionally, students examine how humans modify or adapt to their environments and how cities form around natural resources. Student learning culminates in a proposal and presentation for a new city, complete with a charter, governance structure, services outline, transportation plan, maps, and materials for promoting tourism and business development.

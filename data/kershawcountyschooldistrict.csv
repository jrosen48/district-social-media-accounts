During the first week the our district was closed, 100+ amazing KCSD food service staff and bus drivers prepared and delivered over 10,000 meals to Kershaw County children ages 18 and under. Fifty-one buses traveled all the KCSD bus routes on Wednesday through Friday - with one driver and one food service staffer on each - to deliver the meals and smiles to our Kershaw County families. If you have photos you would like to share, please email them to webmaster@kcsdschools.net and we'll be happy to add them! #myKCSD #KCSDStrong",2020-03-20 18:22:21,,

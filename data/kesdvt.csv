Registration for all three can be found at vtrural.org/recovery/nek

Each forum will include a short opening session, followed by a choice of two 90-minute deep-dive breakouts, which were chosen by a group of NEK leaders last week. The topics for each forum are given above.

You should be receiving documents from your school asking for enrollment information. We collect this information at the Pre School and Elementary School level in order to plan for class size and to give teachers an idea about what their duties will be for the fall. We are planners!

At the High School level we collect residency information so that when we receive money from the state to pay for high school tuition it can be dispersed accurately for the students who live in our towns.

Take note this week. Check your snail mail and your email. Lets get all this paperwork done early!!!!! Thank you for your help!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=983362125416829&id=267036890382693,,0.0,"Good morning Kingdom East Families!

P-EBT is a new resource available to families with school-aged kids who have been impacted by the current school closure. P-EBT provides money to purchase groceries to families with kids who would be accessing free school meals if school wasn't closed.

Many families have already been notified that they qualify and will be receiving P-EBT soon. Households already enrolled in 3SquaresVT will have P-EBT loaded on the card they already have. Other households will get a EBT card in the mail, similar to a debit card, that can be used at most food retailers.

Over 35,000 families already qualify for P-EBT, but more are eligible. All families with school-aged kids are encouraged to apply for free school meals TODAY to see if they qualify for P-EBT.

Here is a clarification on our providing meals for you at this time of school closures.

We at KESD do hope that you have contacted your school and gotten on the list for meals for your children. If something changes for you we are here to help you.

Please be aware that we can only provide meals to children ages 1 - 18. Babies have a different set of nutrition need and we cannot meet that need as an organization.

We thank you for your patience during this first week of meal delivery. We are learning as quickly as we can what the community needs are and meeting them with wonderful volunteerism and positive attitude.

You are our neighbors and we hope that you will continue to reach out to us with concerns or questions. Have a wonderful Wednesday.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=894212857665090&id=267036890382693,,0.0,"Good Morning KESD families.

SANDY PUNDERSON - Sandy is a team player who collaborates in the true sense of the word. She is always open to listening, observing, sharing her work product, brainstorming, considering feedback, and working to improve systems -- even when this means challenging what is familiar in order to create something better. She is both approachable and helpful. She is able to clearly explain boundaries and advocate. She also is developing additional skills to support KESD staff by becoming a Classroom Behavior Coach.

A gift to the KESD community, Sandy Punderson exemplifies a respectful and positive can-do attitude of growth. Her reflection and balanced approach are a welcome addition to any team as we strive to provide the best educational experience possible for all.

KATHERINE HANDY - I would like to recognize Katherine Handy for all the work that she does and being so helpful. The K-2 teachers at Burke are all new to the district, two of us are new to teaching, and Katie has worked tirelessly to make sure we are fully supported. Katie has helped us with so many things since the beginning of the year. She has helped us plan, input data, prep materials, coached us to improve our instruction, subbed, etc. She also has a ton of other responsibilities within our school and the district, yet she makes sure we have everything we need! She is MUCH appreciated and deserves to be recognized!

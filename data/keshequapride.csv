Our reopening plan has been completed and is posted on our website. Please remember that it is a living document and subject to change as districts across the state receive new guidelines from state and federal agencies. KCS will update the plan as needed to comply with all future regulations and we will communicate with the community regularly in the coming months. I would like to thank everyone for their patience in these uncertain and turbulent times.

I would like to express my gratitude to the individuals who were part of the Stakeholder Committee for their time, effort, and invaluable contributions to this document. I would also like to thank the KCS administration team for their tremendous and tireless efforts to accomplish this monumental task.

Together we will meet and overcome all challenges and we will provide the best possible education we can for the students of Keshequa.

Respectfully yours,

Thomas K. Kopp

Our reopening plan has been completed and is posted on our website. Please remember that it is a living document and subject to change as districts across the state receive new guidelines from state and federal agencies. KCS will update the plan as needed to comply with all future regulations and we will communicate with the community regularly in the coming months. I would like to thank everyone for their patience in these uncertain and turbulent times.

I would like to express my gratitude to the individuals who were part of the Stakeholder Committee for their time, effort, and invaluable contributions to this document. I would also like to thank the KCS administration team for their tremendous and tireless efforts to accomplish this monumental task.

Together we will meet and overcome all challenges and we will provide the best possible education we can for the students of Keshequa.

Respectfully yours,

Thomas K. Kopp

Message From the Superintendent:
LETTER TO PARENTS & THE KETCHIKAN COMMUNITY

I know that there is a lot of concern about how we move into school in the fall, and I have been receiving many calls, emails, texts, and other inquiries regarding the District’s Smart Start plan. I also know that some misinformation is circulating that has caused some concern. As a result, I am providing additional information to you and the community about our current status, and some of the plans we currently have in place. This is a communication that is going out a little earlier than planned, but, with consideration for the understandable angst the unknown creates for many of our families, I hope that it will help you understand the process the district is going through to determine how to operate in the fall.

On May 19, 2020, Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy announced plans for Phase Three of the State’s approach to reopening segments of the Alaskan economy in an effort to balance the ongoing need to slow the spread of COVID-19 with the critical need to resume economic activity in a reasonable and safe manner. Phase III begins at 8:00 a.m. on Friday, May 22, 2020. We all must remember that the pandemic is not overdue to the announcement. Please remember it is because of the work we have all completed together that we are able to move into Phase Three. However, if all people are not careful and following health and safety precautions we could see a rise in COVID 19 cases.

KRBD is thrilled to offer a one-hour, locally produced program for children, created in partnership with the Ketchikan Education Association. Local teachers recorded themselves reading books, singing songs and reciting poems, and sent those recordings to us. We put it together into a program, which will air at 11 a.m. Friday! Turn on the radio for your elementary-age children (and anyone else) to listen and connect with teachers! The program will be on our website after it airs, for those who can't listen at that time.",2020-04-09 16:28:38,,

Hello families!

Did you know that the Audible app is free to students during this time of school closure?

Look what I found this morning: ""Charlotte’s Web"" by E.B. White, read by a full cast (including Meryl Streep!). I found many other wonderful children's books on the app as well!

This sounds like a good choice for the entire family.

Happy Reading,

Hi All,
On Friday March 6th, the school is having a Stop-Drop-And Read event at 10:45 in honor of Dr. Suess' birthday. Ms. Powers (the librarian) would love it if parents would come in and read to a class. If you would like to do so, please let us (or Ms. Powers) know! She will have a hat and book ready for you, or you can bring your own.

She would also like to let you know that she will still be having a Read Across America week, but has pushed it back to the end of March to accommodate teachers.

Elections are upon us, and we are realizing our usual crew has had changes to their lives where they will not be able to participate at their usual capacity. We have such fantastic parents who rise to the occasion when donations are needed....if you have some time to give to help coordinate events such as shoe drives, book fair, conferences and adoption trees, please let us know.

If you just simply can't make the times of our meetings, please know we decide the meeting time based on our Board's schedule, so that will change. We really hope to get enough participation to be able to continue.

Our next scheduled meeting is March 5th. Elections will be April 2nd. If you are interested in becoming a board member, but can't make that date, please reach out to a Board member, or send us a PM.

Thank you for all you do!",0.0,"Point Higgins PTO

The first audio stories from my students about what it is like to be ""quaranteened"" at home during a global pandemic will air on 91.3 WYSO at 5:44pm during ""All Things Considered,"" with replays at 7:44 am on Friday during ""Morning Edition"" and on Sunday at 10 a.m. during ""WYSO Weekend.""

This has been a fantastic professional collaboration; Basim (Basim Blunt, WYSO's program coordinator and producer of Dayton Youth Radio) and the kids have worked their booties off putting these together, with the kids recording in their closets and under blankets on their beds -- creative production solutions during crazy times!

I hope you will join us by tuning in to 91.3FM or hopping onhttps://www.wyso.org/ to listen to the stream.",2020-04-23 15:00:02,,

Each year, Pups for People works to raise the funds needed to give someone a service dog with full training and all other necessities covered.

The Pups for People Awareness Event will be held at Oakwood High School on March 8, from 1-3 p.m. The event will include a silent auction, an obstacle course, carnival games, food and the chance to meet some service dogs.

Pups for People is raising funds this year to provide a six-year-old Centerville student with a service dog. Past recipients of service dogs through Pups for People include Ahmad Doucet, Ally Moran and Lili Rodriguez.

pupsforpeople16.wixsite.com",0.0,"Pups for People, a new club at Fairmont High School, is hosting an Awareness and Fundraising Event on March 8.

Pups for People was started by a group of Oakwood High School students and has expanded this year to Fairmont High School, under the leadership of Fairmont student, Grayson Fogel.

Each year, Pups for People works to raise the funds needed to give someone a service dog with full training and all other necessities covered.

The Pups for People Awareness Event will be held at Oakwood High School on March 8, from 1-3 p.m. The event will include a silent auction, an obstacle course, carnival games, food and the chance to meet some service dogs.

Pups for People is raising funds this year to provide a six-year-old Centerville student with a service dog. Past recipients of service dogs through Pups for People include Ahmad Doucet, Ally Moran and Lili Rodriguez.

Her children, Chloe and Jacob, put back half of all the money they earn and then donate it to a charity of their choice. Chole & Jacob recently chose the Kettering Backpack program and donated $100. Chloe shared that she wanted to donate to Kettering Backpack because one of her friends gets food from the backpack program, and she wanted to help.

Thank you Kelly for teaching your children to have a giving heart and a HUGE thank you to Chloe & Jacob for helping to provide over 20 students with food this weekend!❤️❤️❤️

Mr. Trent was an avid supporter of Fairmont Athletics and the Kettering City Schools Music and Arts programs. He cared deeply about our students and staff. Mr. Trent served the district for more than six decades as a teacher, principal, superintendent and long-standing board member, and always put students first.

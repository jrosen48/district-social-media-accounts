This is a reminder that tomorrow (Thursday) we will be serving meals for an entire school week at a time. We have just been allowed to serve meals to any and all children in our community under the age of 18. The children do not need to be present and they do not need to be enrolled in our schools. Please take advantage of this opportunity to get good nutritious meals for our kids in need. This is a bulk meal pick up day for any and all students or nonstudents under the age of 18 residing in our community.

These meals continue to be distributed at Keyes Elementary School in the bus loading and unloading zone. The pickup times are from 11:30 to 12:30. Children do not need to be present. This will continue each week on Thursdays.

Our participation rate is very low and we encourage our families to participate. These are meals for a full school week and include breakfast and lunch.

School will resume tomorrow at the regular time. The Wildcat Parent Night will be re-scheduled for a later date. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. PG&E were absolutely amazing in checking the entire campus and assuring us that the campus is safe for students and adults. Repairs will begin tomorrow and gas will not be turned on until all repairs are complete. We took this incident very seriously and we are committed to the safety of our students, staff and community.

Thank You,

We are cancelling the Middle School Wildcat Parent Night Activity tonight. We are doing so as a precaution and following the direction of PG&E as a result of a possible gas leak. The After School Program Students have been moved to the Middle School and High School Charter facility and they are safe.
This is not effecting any other school site. It is simply Spratling.

The Spratling Campus is being secured and we will wait for PG&E to give us the all clear. The event will be res-scheduled. Thank you for your understand and cooperation.

Good Morning,

Beginning Monday, September 23, 2019 the after school program at Keyes Elementary School will be making some changes to provide greater security for our students. Beginning Monday the front gate at Keyes Elementary will be kept closed after school. Students in the after school program will need to be picked up from the 7th street gate adjacent to the cafeteria. This is needed to make sure our students are safe and entry on to campus can be monitored. We will use the gate on 7th street for both entry and exit of after school program. We will also be conduction safety drills during the after school programs in the coming weeks. Our goal is student safety and well-being. Thank you for your cooperation and support on this.

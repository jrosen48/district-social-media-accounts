First off I want to say how much I miss all of our students. It has been incredibly tough not seeing their smiles, hearing their laughs or watching them grow. My hope is that you are staying safe and healthy during this time, and if you need anything just let me know. By this time, your child may be done with their library books from before the shutdown, if that is the case, you can drop them off in the front vestibule of KES any time between 9:00am and 3:00pm, Monday through Friday.

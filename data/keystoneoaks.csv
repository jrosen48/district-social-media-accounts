Gotta express my gratitude to one of my new students this year. This is Amina. She’s awesome!!

Over the summer she was a part of one of my youth training groups, and we talked one day about masks that she made for her family. And part jokingly I mentioned that she should make a mask for me, but
she needed to design it in a way that shows that she really knows who I am. It was a fun little challenge to see how well she knows her new fifth grade teacher for the upcoming school year.

She absolutely hit this challenge out of the park. I’m so impressed by her thoughtfulness and attention to detail. A+++ for this assignment Amina!!

Over the next 14 days, we'll be sharing reminders and resources to help you and your children prepare for the first day of school.

Today's resource: a helpful video from the World Health Organization (WHO) - ""How to wear a fabric mask safely.""

Over the next two weeks, we encourage you to:

✅ Have your child/children practice putting a face covering on and taking it off. Make sure the face covering fits properly and is comfortable.

✅ Have your child/children wear the face covering for 30-45 minutes at a time, a few times per day.

✅ Make a ""Do you have your mask?"" reminder for the front door, the car, the coat rack, or one of the last places you or your kids stop before leaving for school.

✅ Consider sending a small disposable or reusable plastic bag where your child/children can keep their mask during mask breaks and lunch so that it stays clean throughout the day.

Hey kids, I’d like to read you a very very special book about NEVER GIVING UP and ALWAYS WORKING VERY HARD. When you have a bad day, it’s ok, just think positive, smile, and focus on the task. You are a Keystone Oaks student & I know you can get through anything.

I just spoke to Principal Mizikar, Principal Thomas, and Principal Werner and they all hope you are doing very very well!

.....Enjoy the book!",2020-03-20 08:04:41,https://video-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/10000000_196465801637188_8708499380409204736_n.mp4?_nc_cat=109&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=iz6-cMWhK2IAX-eSz17&_nc_ht=video-atl3-1.xx&oh=164beefe922f20e794f6cd306be51f78&oe=5F5C4FDE,

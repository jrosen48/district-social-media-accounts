Last night, the Knoxville baseball team played at Principal Park in Des Moines. Today, the district was notified that a ticket taker who worked the game has tested positive for COVID-19.

We have consulted with Marion County Public Health, which has advised that an individual passing through a ticket line does not meet the definition of exposure, and it's unlikely the virus would be passed this way. The department has cleared the team to continue play.

Our Activities Department has contacted the families of all student-athletes on the baseball and softball teams to notify them of the situation. We have also contacted our opponent for today's baseball and softball games, Albia. The games will be played as scheduled.

As always, the safety and health of our entire community remains our top priority. We will continue to seek guidance from Marion County Public Health to ensure we are taking the appropriate actions throughout the summer season.",6.0,"Knoxville Community School District

In addition, the site is compliant with Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) guidelines. Our previous site, for example, was missing elements like closed captioning, large print, multi-language capabilities and contrast in colors.

In addition to the new website, you can now download our new mobile app, which is available for iOS and Android devices.

Seniors, today was originally scheduled to be your graduation day and while we're disappointed you can't walk across the stage now, we wanted to make the day special.

Check out the signs that Ramaeker Screen Printing made! We were hoping to post the signs by this afternoon, but due to the threat of thunderstorms, we're going to hold off until next weekend. The forecast looks better and we want our entire community to enjoy them and honor you!

KCSD will be providing free meals to all students from March 23 - April 10. This program will be extended if school remains closed longer than this timeframe. The meal sack will contain both breakfast and lunch. Pick up will occur in the student parking lot of KHS from 11:30 AM-12:30 PM. Please use the west entrance on Willetts Drive only. The pick up lanes will then exit onto Madison Street. Students do not have to be in the vehicle. Please fill out the survey below to help us get a headcount of how many meals to make. (The link to this survey is also available on our school website @ www.knoxville.k12.ia.us)

https://forms.gle/DPn8zuoSetvtKasP9

We are also asking a question about internet access at homes. We are working on providing learning opportunities for students and need this information to help us with planning.

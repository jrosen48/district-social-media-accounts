Through the investigation, the Killeen Police Department cited the former KISD bus driver for failing to activate the warning lights on the bus at the appropriate time.

At this point, our primary concern is the well-being and recovery of the student. Our thoughts and prayers remain with the family. At last check, the student was in stable condition.

All KISD Transportation employees were provided additional training on the proper ways to report emergencies and the importance of all precautionary light and signal protocols.

As student safety is our utmost concern, we remind all drivers to be cautious as students have returned to in-person instruction.",2020-09-01 17:15:00,,

Killeen ISD would like to remind drivers it is against the law to pass a school bus with flashing red lights and/or stop signs displayed. If a bus is flashing yellow lights that means it is about to stop.

As Killeen ISD resumes in-person instruction, we ask that drivers slow down, put down their phones, and be mindful of students and school buses.

Even though school is out, we want our students to continue to learn. When students read, write, work on math problems, and explore during the summer, they can continue to make academic progress and avoid the loss of skills, which is often called the “summer slide.” This is even more important this year due to the COVID-19 school closure.

We are excited to provide our students and families with a variety of online learning activities throughout the summer.

We are Kangaroos. We are Eagles. We are Knights. We are Greywolves. We are Lions. We are Panthers. One team, one vision, one love... We are KISD!

Today kicks off a special series #celebrateKISDseniors Over the course of the next few days, we will celebrate one High School each day. In doing so, we will highlight each school's Valedictorian and Salutatorian as well as, look back at some of our favorite memories from this year! Our hopes is to flood social media with love and support for our incredibly strong and resilient graduating class of 2020! We invite you to comment, share each post,... all in this together, let's go!

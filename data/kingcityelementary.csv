King City patrons, you were made aware of a decision regarding the school year the same way I was, through Governor Parsons daily briefing. I was given no advanced notice. While I do believe it was likely inevitable that school would not take place within the school building for the remainder of the year, it did not provide the school with the opportunity to put out a proper notice.

Once I receive all of the details from the Department of Education I will make a formal declaration.

Please know we will do everything we can to recognize our seniors sometime later in the summer once conditions allow for it.

RAINY DAY Wildkat Indoor PE Challenge
Let’s see what you come up with!! Please share pictures in the comments.

Here are ten energy releasing physical activities that are appropriate to play indoors!
Build an obstacle course—use blankets, pillows, toy bins, and furniture to make tunnels or tasks to run around or jump into
Hop, skip, or roll from one room to another
Practice somersaults or jumping jacks
Dance to silly songs
Bean bag toss
Indoor hopscotch—use masking or electrical tape on non-carpeted floor
Act out animal motions—slither like a snake, kick like a donkey, swing your trunk like an elephant, etc.
Step aerobics—use a folded blanket to step up onto and have your child copy what you do
Yoga, or stretching
Balloon ball—hit the balloon into the air and don’t let it touch the ground
Of course, with any indoor physical activity, be sure your play space is a safe one by being somewhat large and clear of toys and sharp edged furniture.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2824454730968231&id=688557774557948,,0.0,"PLEASE SHARE!

While substituting the last several weeks I have been amazed at how Addyison has matured in the last several years. She has shown interest in her grades and is considerate and kind to other students. I hope she continues this growth as she moves on into the higher grades.

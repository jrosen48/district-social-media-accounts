We understand the situation with Covid-19 is ever changing. Plans will be developed that address safety protocols and distance learning in the event that school is forced to close for a period of time.

To get things started, we have to get feedback from parents. This survey gives us a starting point so that we can begin to plan accordingly. Parent participation is vital in gathering the information we need in order to have a successful start to the school year. This survey will be open until Wednesday July 8th at 9:00 pm.

It is only necessary to complete the form one time per family. If you receive the survey more than one time please disregard the others.

Plans will be developed that address safety protocols and distance learning in the event that school is forced to close for a period of time.

To get things started, we need feedback from parents. This survey gives us a starting point so that we can begin to plan accordingly. Parent participation is vital in gathering the information we need in order to have a successful start to the school year. This survey will be open until Wednesday, July 8th, at 9:00 pm.

Parents/Family:
**Gates open at 9 am. Park in the East parking lot, come through the East gate, and enter the field at the southeast corner (by the restrooms).
**We are not giving out tickets; each graduate can bring 10 guests. Please abide by this rule and sit together in one group.
**Due to the wind this afternoon, the chairs on the football field are simply lying on the ground right now. We will do our best to have them all set up by 9:00. Also, condensation may occur through the night, so chairs may be wet--plan accordingly.
***AGAIN--we ask that everyone follow CDC, state and local social distancing guidelines.
**At the conclusion of the ceremony, we ask that everyone exit the field in a timely and safe manner.

This event will be one to remember, so please help us make it the best graduation yet!

The ceremony will be livestreamed at kingfishersports.tv and we will share that live feed to this page at 10:00.

GOING THE DISTANCE — Creativity and innovation have always been our hallmarks, so it's no surprise that CTTC instructors have seamlessly transitioned to off-campus learning for all students beginning today.

For Brandi Millsap, Cosmetology instructor, that meant transitioning from the hands-on teaching she was doing the week before spring break to a Hybrid online/distance learning program approved by the State Board of Cosmetology for required theory hours.

Ms. Millsap also supplements that program with instructor-led demonstration videos, classes via social media and videoconferencing, emails, phone calls and any other way she can maintain contact with her students.

The rest of our faculty has proven just as innovative and adaptive.

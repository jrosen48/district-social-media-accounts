I am enclosing below a link to register for Congressman Zeldin’s Annual Service Academy Information Day Forum which this year will be held via Zoom due to COVID-19 social distancing restrictions. This event will be held this Saturday, June 27, starting at 10am and is for high school students (juniors and seniors) who are interested in applying to one of our nation’s five service academies. In addition to the congressman, this Zoom forum will feature representatives of the services academies, members of the congressman’s review committee, and parents who are helping their student to apply for a congressional nomination for entrance to an academy.

Here is Kings Park we have a rich history of service in the armed forces as well as enrollment in our nation’s five service academies. Please feel free to pass information and link along to any student with potential interest in applying to a service academy.

“Resilience is accepting your new reality, even if it's less good than the one you had before. You can fight it, you can do nothing but scream about what you've lost, or you can accept that and try to put together something that's good.”
― Elizabeth Edwards

Elizabeth Edwards was the wife of former Senator John Edwards. She struggled with incurable cancer, and passed away in 2010 at the age of 61.

In March, life threw us all a curveball. But Kings Parkers are resilient, we are strong, and we will get through this together. As best you can, try and keep a routine. Keep both mentally and physically busy. Take time to call or help a friend. Most of all, watch your diet, and keep positive. We will get through this!

Some people cannot talk on the phone and therefore cannot communicate effectively with a 911 emergency service operator in an emergency. In the fall of 2018, Suffolk County released the text-to-911 program. Maddie wanted to help the county spread the word so more people would know about this new service. With the help of her friends, she set out to create a PSA video showing three scenarios where text-to-911 would be of vital importance for an individual who is deaf or hard of hearing.

Congratulations to Steven Torre, Kole Suhovsky, Micaela Ciambrone, Alex Aitchison, Emily Johnson, and Alexa Grimley on being selected to participate in the annual NYSCAME concert that took place on November 15th. Their selection places them among the best musicians in all of Suffolk County.

All-State Music Selection

Congratulations to Alex Aitchison on receiving All-State Honors! The All-State selection “process” begins with the solo being evaluated by a NYSSMA Certified All-State adjudicator. These All-State adjudicators are responsible for evaluating every All-State solo of the same instrument or voice part. At the conclusion of the festival, the All-State adjudicators create a rank ordered proficiency list of all students being recommended.

Yesterday, the state released the Covid Reopening Plan Template that schools must create, submit for board approval, and then submit to the state. This document is based off of the Safe Schools Roadmap found here: https://www.michigan.gov/documents/whitmer/MI_Safe_Schools_Roadmap_FINAL_695392_7.pdf.

Please know that we are working very hard to get Kingsbury's plan completed well ahead of the mid-August deadline.

While we know there are many questions floating around about transportation, facemasks, cleaning procedures, academic instruction, athletics, and more, we ask that you sit tight and allow us to follow the state's guidelines in creating our plan. We will share this with you as soon as possible.

Additionally, you will be hearing from the new KPA board soon regarding furniture donations/loans for our outdoor classrooms. As many people have pointed out, taking learning outdoors is a monumental task and it will require the effort of our entire community to be a success.

We would still like to make this last year at Kingsbury special for our 8th Graders and we need your help! We are inviting our families to “adopt” an 8th Grade student for the remainder of the school year - or as long as you like.

January 1 at 5:30 PM ·

Allowing children the time they need to play freely outside is not a new or original concept. Nature play is something kids have done since the dawn of time. From that perspective, this is the most ordinary thing we could be doing for our kids. And yet, current research shows that the average American child only gets 4-7 minutes of daily free play outside.

In just a few short decades, childhood has largely moved indoors and yet the basic tenants of child development have not changed. Kids still need outside play in order to fully develop in every facet.

By committing to nature play, you are giving your child the gift a beautiful childhood in the here and now as well as lifelong advantages for the time still to come.

As you may be aware, Governor Walz is announcing a decision this Thursday, July 30, 2020, on what Minnesota public schools can do this fall. Districts across the state were tasked with developing three (3) plans.

The three (3) plans, or scenarios, include the following:

1. In-person school resumes (Regular school with everyone).
2. Hybrid (Combination of in-person school and distance learning).
3. Distance learning (no in-person school).

Kingsland has been developing plans for the last month. We will notify parents during the week of August 3-7, 2020 as to what our general plan is based upon the announcement. Nothing will be sent out prior to next week as our staff must read through any guidance put forth by the State.

Please be patient as we tread new waters. Announcements regarding athletics will more than likely be coming shortly afterwards from the Minnesota State High School League (MSHSL).

Hello Preschool Parents,

I am writing to let you know that K-12 schools will be going into a period of Distance Learning from Monday, March 30th through May 4th. Preschools participation in Distance Learning is not required by the Governor's Order, but our Preschool Teachers have been working hard on putting together packets for your children to work on during this time. When these packets are ready to be picked up your child's teacher will contact you.

We will not be charging for April's monthly tuition payment. Thank you to those of you that have already made your April preschool payments and we will automatically apply them to your May tuition payment.

Thank you,

Please see attached as we have been ordered by the Governor to implement Distance Learning. We really have no more information than the Governor shared with Minnesotans at 2:00 PM today. This is not a time for anyone to panic. The plan contained within the attachments should cover how the process will work. We will get through this. Take care of family, friends and neighbors.

The plan is to call the Fillmore County Sheriff's office in the early afternoon tomorrow (Saturday). Their deputies - who have been on the roads - will either advise no travel and the dance will be canceled, OR, they will say the roads are fine and we will dance! As always, the students' safety comes FIRST. Kingsland will use this page and the text message alert system to notify everyone if the dance is canceled.",2020-01-17 20:54:29,,

Knight Nation!

We hope you enjoyed a great holiday weekend and had a Happy Memorial Day!

With Governor DeWine announcing plans for sports/activities to resume this coming week, we have been working on plans to open our athletic facilities to the public and to get our athletic programs back together as soon as possible. With the announcement and updates coming on Thursday and Friday of last week, in addition to the holiday weekend, we still do not feel adequately prepared to reopen at this point.

Unfortunately, our stadium and athletic facilities will remain closed until we are completely ready to open for use. We appreciate your patience during this time and please know we are making plans to ensure the safety and security of all users when we reopen.

Once we feel comfortable with our plans for use and decide to open facilities, we will make sure to update the community as soon as possible.

If you have specific questions please do not hesitate to contact our office directly at 513-459-2937.

We hope you enjoyed a great holiday weekend and had a Happy Memorial Day!

With Governor DeWine announcing plans for sports/activities to resume this coming week, we have been working on plans to open our athletic facilities to the public and to get our athletic programs back together as soon as possible. With the announcement and updates coming on Thursday and Friday of last week, in addition to the holiday weekend, we still do not feel adequately prepared to reopen at this point.

Unfortunately, our stadium and athletic facilities will remain closed until we are completely ready to open for use. We appreciate your patience during this time and please know we are making plans to ensure the safety and security of all users when we reopen.

Once we feel comfortable with our plans for use and decide to open facilities, we will make sure to update the community as soon as possible.

If you have specific questions please do not hesitate to contact our office directly at 513-459-2937.

Miss Danielle from Kings Kids at SLE, and her son Noah made this great video of a Floating Stickman!

What you will need:
- water
- dry erase markers
- dish

Why does this work?

The ink in dry erase markers is insoluble. When you pour water onto a dry erase stick figure on a smooth surface, a strong buoyancy force overcomes the stickiness of the ink, pulling the stick figure off the surface and causing it magically float on the water.

The simulation gave a brief glimpse into the feelings, experiences, stresses, and bonds that so many families experience while dealing with poverty. It is also extremely insightful into the guilt and destruction of self esteem accompanying not always being able to help improve one’s own situation.

KBA Families,

The Kings 7th grade boys team is playing in the ECC Tournament Championship at KHS this evening at 5:30. This group of boys is trying to finish off their undefeated season and bring the trophy home to Kings. I know the team would love the extra support if your family is free this evening to come watch. This could also be a great for the kids in our program to see what things will be like for them in the not so distant future as well.

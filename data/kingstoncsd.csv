Farmers and staff from Hudson Valley Farm Hub and the Kingston YMCA Farm Project visited George Washington Elementary to give lessons on corn crops, describing the many varieties of corn species that can be grown locally and how corn produces masa (cornmeal) to use for cooking. The lesson was offered in both English and Spanish so students could hear each translation of the entire presentation. Students learned how corn is planted, harvested, dried, and ground before a hands-on demonstration using masa to make tortillas. From rolling the dough to pressing and cooking the tortillas, students finished the workshop with an edible treat to taste!

Kingston City School District’s Health & Wellness Committee supports cooking in the classroom as it is a valuable life skill that also promotes healthy eating. Children who assist with meal preparation are typically more adventurous eaters and learn that healthy foods can taste great. Cooking can also be a great time to practice math and reading skills in a practical setting.

Students on stage sang a song about kindness before a student-made video was viewed, showing a compilation of clips about what kindness is to them.

Students in the video represented all grade levels at the school and inspired others to be kind, by giving a hug, standing up for your friends, helping someone up, respecting others, being nice, loving people, and playing with someone who doesn’t have anyone to play with.

Principal LoBianco closed the assembly with a poem reading that resonates with all:

Spread a little kindness
Everywhere you go
Let that little kindness
From your heart, gently flow

Reach out with kindness
To all those in need
Smile at others with kindness
Spread the kindness seed

Be kind today, and every day

Preceding the game was the KHS Homecoming Parade, which featured Super Hero-themed floats from each class as well as all of the Homecoming Queen Nominees.

The KHS Tiger Marching Band performed their field show “Chasing Time” and the National Anthem to kick off the stadium festivities. The Kingston Tigers were victorious over the Saugerties Sawyers 35-6 in a great game against the neighboring rivals.

At halftime, the nominees for Homecoming King and Queen took center stage for a ceremony filled with flowers and smiles. The excitement rose as the court was announced to a cheering crowd.

King: Phoenix Rios

Queen: Tori Boulay

The eighth-grade class processed onto Gruner Field with Principals Sheber and Reid as teachers, counselors and staff, family and friends, welcomed them with applause and cheers. The MCM Chorus performed the Star Spangled Banner and “We’re All in This Together” before students were recognized for their achievements and officially accepted as high-schoolers.

The SUNY Ulster President’s Challenge Award winners* were brought up to face the crowd before Coach Kelder presented the Joe Riccio Award to Ms. Abigail Kresser for her dedication, citizenship and integrity. Abigail then presented the Making a Difference Award to Ms. Nissen, MCM 6th-Grade Teacher.

Friends and family gathered in the heat at Deitz Stadium to celebrate the J. Watson Bailey Middle School 8th Graders at their Moving Up Ceremony. The soon-to-be high schoolers were a combination of smiles and tears as they said good-bye to their home of four years.

Principal Debra Fitzgerald advised her students to “Be humble and be kind. You have all been a Bailey Bulldog. Those days are now over, and you are all ready to become a Kingston Tiger.”

Good luck in KHS, Class of 2023!",2019-06-27 09:07:56,,

Did you know that there is a proposition on the upcoming Kingston City School District ballot about Dietz Stadium?

""Proposition 4 - Conveyance of Dietz Stadium to the City of Kingston""

What does this proposition mean?

Voting YES on this proposition would allow the Board of Education to hold a vote on whether or not to transfer full ownership of Dietz Stadium, which hosts athletic events for the students and community, to the City. Currently, the City of Kingston and the Kingston City School District each have 50% ownership of the Stadium. Voting YES would NOT automatically transfer ownership to the City. Rather, it would give the Board of Education the opportunity to discuss the issue and hold a vote on whether or not to transfer ownership.

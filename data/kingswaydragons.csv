While we cannot thank our teachers, paraprofessionals, secretaries, transportation staff, custodians, maintenance and grounds personnel, technology and food service staff, and district personnel in person, we appreciate each and every one of them for their tireless commitment to our students. Our administrative team has put together a few creative ways to say ‘thank you’ for the critical role each employee plays in our district, including a Virtual Wellness Week for all of our employees to provide daily self-care activities to help them relax and have fun.

Parents, students and alumni are encouraged to send a faculty or a staff member a note of appreciation.

Dear Parents, Students & School Community,

I wanted to take a moment to provide our parents, students and school community a quick update regarding a number of topics before we break for spring recess. I am sure you agree that these past few weeks have been exhausting and the welcomed reprieve from virtual schooling could not be timelier. I have encouraged our faculty and staff to enjoy the recess and to disengage from the computer. I am also encouraging our students to do the same, as this is an opportunity to for us all to catch our breath, enjoy some fresh air – while practicing social distancing – and engage in fulfilling activities.

We end this week on a high note and I share with you some feel-good highlights and my student message by below.

This update also serves as a moment to stress the importance of continuing our social distancing practices, especially among our students, as our best strategy in flattening the proverbial curve.

I wish each of you continued success while we navigate these unprecedented times and hope that this update serves you well as we continue to work hard at providing our students with the very best program possible.

Please Support our Local Restaurants, Eateries and Businesses: Our local businesses have repeatedly supported our students and programs through countless sponsorships, donations and discounts. Now is the time to pay it forward and do what we can to support them. The attached link below is a list of local restaurants, eateries and businesses that I have been in touch with, which includes links to their websites, business hours, delivery/take-out options and specials. I have continued to say that this crisis extends beyond our school walls and we have a greater responsibility to practice social distancing while supporting one another.

I’m so proud to be Kingsway & South Harrison’s Superintendent of Schools and of our Board leadership team, administrators, teachers and support staff. This special group of educators came together to address an unprecedented crisis and developed a viable and sustainable plan to deliver virtual instruction to all of our students, deploy Chromebooks to those who needed them and began providing lunches to our neediest students. We worked around the clock and overcame adversity, together!!! As a member of our community it’s heartwarming to know that we stood tall when the stakes were high. While there will be more to communicate, please know I’m overwhelmed with appreciation and admiration for my colleagues, parents and students. Be safe everyone!",0.0,"James Lavender

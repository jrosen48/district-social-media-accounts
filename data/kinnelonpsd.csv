Knowing that the school closure will be much more protracted than originally anticipated, we are responding to the need to provide a more direct instructional approach including moving forward with new content. I am working diligently with the administrative staff to develop schedules and instructional plans that are developmentally appropriate to the varying grade-levels and that address the specific needs of our special education population. We will share the parameters of the plan with faculty, parents, and students as soon as is possible.

Sincerely,

Knowing that the school closure will be much more protracted than originally anticipated, we are responding to the need to provide a more direct instructional approach including moving forward with new content. I am working diligently with the administrative staff to develop schedules and instructional plans that are developmentally appropriate to the varying grade-levels and that address the specific needs of our special education population. We will share the parameters of the plan with faculty, parents, and students as soon as is possible.

Mrs. Castelluber and Mrs. Greco's English 3 classes participated in a mock Canterbury Tales feast to culminate the prologue of The Canterbury Tales. In the prologue, Geoffrey Chaucer's narrator proposes that each pilgrim tell two tales on their pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral and two tales on the way back to the Tabard Inn. The person / pilgrim with the best story wins a free dinner paid by the rest of the travelers. Students each wrote their own modernized pilgrim prologue poems, feasted during presentations, and voted on whose poem was the best. #kea #kinneloneducators #khscolts #kinneloncolts #canterburytales",0.0,"Kinnelon Educators

The KHS chefs 👩‍🍳👨‍🍳 of 223 participated in their monthly chopped competition under the direction of Mrs. Gurth and Mrs. Kane. This month’s theme was breakfast. 🍳🥞🥚🥓 The secret ingredients were eggs, cream cheese, sausage and blueberries. The competition was fierce and the judges had a hard time picking the winner. We can’t wait until next month!

Welcome to the month of May! We hope April brought you and your family a safe and restful Spring Break, followed by more communication and support from your child’s teachers and more practice for your child to engage in remote learning. While school buildings will remain closed through the end of the school year, our remote learning will continue. Your child’s teacher(s) will continue to be in touch regularly to update you on remote learning plans and to make sure your child is accessing instruction each day. Your child’s teacher(s) will continue to be your best point of contact for any questions you or your child may have.

A few weeks ago, Dave Levin sent a letter to all KIPP alumni, and I shared my thoughts with all KIPP staff; both acknowledged the ways in which the school and organizational culture we built and how some of our practices perpetuated white supremacy and anti-Blackness. As we shared then, we need to do more, faster. Over the last few weeks, we have been working to turn these words into action. And while we are taking some immediate steps, there is still much more work to be done to eliminate any practice at KIPP that furthers systemic racism, anti-Blackness and inequities experienced by our students, alumni, families, teachers, and staff. The steps we are sharing today represent a fraction of the conversations we are having about what changes we need to make.

“Over the past 25 years, KIPP NYC has faced many challenges. During each and every one, our champions and cheerleaders provided beacons of light to guide us through. Twenty-five years ago, when we were forced to host summer school in the Franz Sigel Park on the Grand Concourse because the New York City wouldn’t provide us a building, a group of donors arranged for breakfast and lunch and a snack every day. After 9/11, another group of supporters made sure that families affected were able to continue paying rent and that health and mental health services were available to all KIPP families. While the pandemic crisis of COVID-19 is the gravest challenge we have ever faced – together we will breathe life into three of KIPP NYC’s core values: Revolutionary Love, Teach Like Harriett, and Find a Way or Make One.”

Happy 2020! We're so proud of 7th grader Mia whose essay on identity, ""Dominican-ish"", was selected for publication by YES! Magazine! What an honor! Shout-out to Ms. White and Ms. McIntosh for supporting students in submitting their essays through their writing group!

“It’s difficult being Dominican but born and raised in New York. I’m supposed to speak fluent Spanish. I’m supposed to listen to their music 24/7, and I’m supposed to follow their traditions. I’m supposed to eat their main foods. I’m unique and it’s not only me. Yes, I may not speak Spanish. Yes, I may not listen to their kind of music, but I don’t think that defines who I am as a Dominican. I don’t think I should be discriminated for not being the same as most Dominicans. Nobody should be discriminated against for being different from the rest because sometimes different is good.“

—Mia Guerrero, KIPP Washington Heights Middle School, New York, N.Y.

Later, I offered a workshop to staff from across the KIPP NYC Network examining various forms of capital that #KIPPsters and their families bring to school every day. Always appreciate the fellowship and deep learning with my KIPP partners across the country. Looking forward to ongoing work this year!

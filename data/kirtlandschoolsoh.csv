Kirtland CARES 🌷 NEEDS COLLECTION

Due to the current crisis in our area, the City of Kirtland has established KIRTLAND CARES. The primary objective of this effort is to make sure members of our community do not go without, during this time.
🗓 Starting Monday, March 23, the Kirtland Community Center, located at 7900 Euclid-Chardon Road, will be a drop-off point, weekdays, from 10:00AM - 2:00 PM for nonperishable food, household items, and basic first aid supplies.
🔴 Those wishing to donate to the KIRTLAND CARES cause, are asked to drop off supplies at the front entryway of the Community Center.
⚪️ Please bring the items in boxes, bags, or containers that you do not want back. As needs arise, the items will be distributed to residents by city personnel and healthy volunteers from the community.
🔵 The building will not be open to the public but support staff will be on site to retrieve the items as they are dropped off.
📧 Reach out to Kirtlandcares@KirtlandOhio.com for more information.
🌷Be well! Thank you!

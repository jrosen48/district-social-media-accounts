Ben's Father Ron and Sister Tori are also members of the Department, and we ask that you keep them, the whole Lauren Family, and all of our brave volunteers close in your thoughts and prayers. Ben, a 3rd generation Volunteer Firefighter, via his maternal Grandfather, was born on Flag Day (June 14th) 1996, and attended his first of many UP Firefighter's Tournament six weeks later... He was a proud, dedicated and exceptional member of your Fire Department, and was truly the finest representation of our Community's young people - respected and admired by all who knew him.

Those kids (and their teachers) are worth this!!!

These little Modeltowners who will grow up and be your doctor when you are sick. They will be the ones to fix your car when it breaks down. They will be the ones to help you with your financial planning. They will teach our future children to read and write. They will be the ones to take care of our future.

I was blessed to work at Gilbert, Sawyer, and GMS/GHS, and I can tell you that if anyone can do those things, it's the kids in the Gwinn Schools.

Do this for them! Vote YES!!

Support our kids!!

Also, our Student Council is going to use this week starting on Monday, January 27th as Snow Fest Week which replaces our typical winter homecoming. The week will still include dress-up days along with other activities and a short assembly on Friday. There will also be a dance but we are waiting to hear if the Junior Class will be offering that on Friday night or a different date. Certain things like hall decorating and crowning a king and queen along with assembly games will not take place.

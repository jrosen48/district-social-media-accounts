Per TEA guidelines, when positive tests occur, campus parents are informed via Remind 101 and through letters that go home.

We can all continue to help each other by keeping kids home when they are under the weather – even if it is just for a cold, allergies, or a headache, and we would like to thank everyone for their ongoing help with this self-screening process.

Since we do clear and clean each room when a student is sent home with any illness, please continue to help your student self-screen before school as this can lessen the burden on the campuses when students are temporarily displaced due to cleaning.

Finally, if you keep your student home for being ill (regardless of the illness), please be sure to fill out the COVID Student Health Reporting Form which is on the Kaufman ISD website and is linked below:

All JH students will be receiving an email to their school email address notifying them when schedules are ready to view in their Skyward account. We will also have printed schedules for them to pick up on the first day of school.

Students will also receive all the Google classroom codes for all Jr. High classes in this email. At-home online students need to sign up for their elective teachers' Google classrooms at that time. Other Google classrooms will only be used to fulfill any students' need for make-up work.

Parents, please sign up for new Remind for the current 2020-2021 students and parents: text ""@jhkaufman"" to 81010.

Also, this year we will be using the PikMyKid app for car-rider dismissal this year.

All incoming students' families will be receiving a letter in the mail with important information about this. To ensure a smooth dismissal, it is important that those instructions are followed before the first day of school.

There is a video below with instructions for at-home learners:

While staff members are learning new on-campus guidelines, they have also expressed excitement returning to work with their peers.

“We are used to working a little more closely together, so Zooming some meetings is still a little strange, but having the energy back in the building feels great. We’ve missed it.” Said Kristen Pearson, counselor at Helen Edwards.

Tomorrow concludes the first week back for teachers. They will spend next week preparing for August 17th, the first day back for students.

With social distancing requirements, it will take many more hours and practice areas to provide our student-athletes a quality summer strength and conditioning experience.

We will continue to work closely with the UIL, District Administration, and the State of Texas so that timely and accurate information will guide appropriate responses. Local conditions will influence the decisions that public health officials make regarding community-level and ultimately, Kaufman Athletic strategies.

We have always emphasized the value of the teaching profession and how teachers give rise to the future. During this crisis, Texans are seeing what a light our teachers continue to bring to our students and how important they are to the future of our state.

Now, the Raise Your Hand Texas Foundation is proud to partner with a growing list of more than 75 businesses, associations, community organizations, and universities working through Teachers Can to help teachers find their voice, and working to help everyone else let teachers know just how much we appreciate them.

We hope you'll share this video in honor of a teacher who made a difference in your life, a teacher you admire, or on behalf of all Texas teachers. And then visit TeachersCan.org to see what else you can do.

Tuesday night, our Kaufman Lions took on the Mt. Pleasant Tigers in the third round of the playoffs. We're incredibly thankful for those who made the trip to Tyler to watch our boys! Tuesday's game was a perfect example of the fighting spirit of our team. The first half was a battle that found our Lions trailing by six points. In the second half, our Lions found themselves in a tough situation and ended up trailing by 21 at one point. However, our Lions found a spark and did what they've done all season, and they battled back! The excitement was capped off as Joseph McCray rebounded a missed free throw by the Tigers with six seconds remaining. McCray raced up court and buried a three-pointer as time expired to send the game to overtime. Our boys came up a little short in the extra period, losing 53-56, but they came up huge in heart, fearlessness, and determination. Way to go, boys, it was an amazing season!",0.0,"Kaufman ISD added 53 new photos.

Last week was Kaufman Tennis held its annual Paine Invitational Tennis Tournament. To start the week, JV had to deal with some less than stellar playing conditions as the cold and the rain made things difficult. Eventually, it was decided the courts were too wet, and the tournament was canceled. However, we still have some images from the early action before the weather got too bad. In varsity tournament, the girls' teams came away some big wins - taking first and second place in Girls Doubles. As a team, the girls placed third overall. Over the weekend, our junior high Lions played in their version of the Paine Invitational tournament and took home plenty of hardware. Way to go, Lions!",0.0,"Kaufman ISD added 77 new photos.

Last Friday night was the final regular season home game for our Lions' basketball teams. It was also SENIOR NIGHT! Your Lions battled the Terrell Tigers in the final home game. In the varsity game, both teams struggled to get going in the first period as the quarter came to a close it was tied. However, your Lions started to heat up in the second quarter taking a double-digit lead into halftime. The Tigers put up a good fight, but ultimately your Lions came away with the win. In the JV game, your Lions got off to a quick start jumping out to a double-digit lead in the first quarter. Their lead would hold strong as your Lions defeated the Tigers. In the freshman game, our Lions had a tough outing with the Tigers capturing an early lead and never looking back and eventually going on to win.",0.0,"Kaufman ISD added 130 new photos.

Track season is off and running, and our Lions track teams spent last Thursday competing in the Wylie East Track Meet. It was a pretty successful first meet of the season. On the girls' side, the varsity team finished 3rd overall, and the JV team finished on top with a 1st place finish! On the boys' side, both the varsity and JV teams finished 2nd! Great job, Lions, way to start track season with a bang!

Last night Monday Elementary hosted its Love of Learning Night, which featured games, activities, and a ""living wax museum"" put on by the 5th grade students at the school. Earlier on Thursday, the students put their wax museum on display for the rest of the students to come by and do a little learning. The wax museum started out as a book report on the student's chosen historical figure. The students then conducted additional research to help bring their historical figure to life! Many of the students are not smiling in the photos because they're doing their best to become a wax figure.",0.0,"Kaufman ISD added 119 new photos.

Thank you for your questions and concerns over the family commitment survey. As we work to develop a plan for the DOH this information will be very important. I understand you wanting to make an informed decision so please look for communication on Monday that will provide more details on what school will look like whether we are in person or remote. I have received numerous emails from you and we are monitoring Facebook as well so we will do our best to address all your concerns and questions. Your communication has been very respectful of the situation we are faced with and that is greatly appreciated.

Have a great day,

Once the team arrives an end time will be set for the boys JV game to start the girls varsity as scheduled. There will be a period of running clock most likely at the end of the boys JV to accommodate this.

Dear Parents, Guardians and Community,

First, I want to thank all of you for your patience as we go through this smoke-filled time period. As your superintendent it is important that the safety of our students is assured. When I made the decision to close our schools, the air quality inside our schools was above safe levels. Since that time the air quality outside has improved to moderate levels. However, we want to make sure that the indoor quality is safe as well. We are contracting with a local company to monitor and help us with necessary changes we might make. I feel very confident that we will get to start school on Monday, but please watch for any changes on Sunday evening. As always, we are using Facebook and our website to share important information.

Thank you for your support and we are looking forward to seeing all the kids on Monday.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1614617185317499&id=682713071841253,,0.0,"MESSAGE FROM SUPERINTENDENT RICH STEWART

History of Klamath Union

The history of Klamath Union High School will be presented in a program at 6:30 p.m. Friday, Nov. 29, in the school’s cafeteria.

The presentation by the Klamath County Museum will cover previous use of the building location, construction and expansion of the school, and some of the lighter sides of the school’s history.

“The recent opening of the renovated school, cafeteria and theater mark a major milestone in the proud history of the school,” said museum manager Todd Kepple. “We hope this program gives people a chance to reminisce about the school, and perhaps help us fill in some gaps in our records.”

Klamath Union High School opened in 1928. Major additions to the school included a gymnasium in 1938 and a south wing in 1958. A grand opening of the recently renovated school was held last month.

Practice eating “school lunch” with your kiddo. Make sure they can open everything you send with them or things like milk containers if they will be eating a school lunch. Talk about not putting food directly on the table in the lunchroom and let them know that a cafeteria can be noisy. Set a timer for 20 minutes and talk about how they may not finish eating and that’s ok. Practice packing everything back up and talk about what is trash and what should come back home in their lunch box. If you get a chance, go to your child's school and ask if you can walk them through the cafeteria.

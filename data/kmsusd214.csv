Another simple card game for kids!
HOW TO PLAY üê∑PIGüê∑

üòúIf you want to be notified when more games post, please like üëçüèº and follow my page.üòã

Rules:
Shuffle the cards. Deal until each player has four cards.

The aim of the game is to collect four of a kind. Players must choose what they want to collect and discard. The discarded card is passed to the player on their left who also discards a card to the next player on their left and so on.

Once a player has collected four of a kind, the player must immediately put a finger on their nose.

If another player sees them do this, they too put a finger on their nose even if they don't have four of a kind. The last player to notice the others and place a finger on their nose gets the letter ‚ÄúP‚Äù given to them.

The first player to receive all three letters: P, I, G, is eliminated. The last player in play is the winner.",0.0,"Another Card Game which is like the game SPOONS but this one is called PIGüê∑

Hi everyone!

Mr. Hammond here, hoping you are doing well and healthy. Since we can't meet together to sing, I thought I would try having us all sing in our own homes! Each week on Friday I will be hosting a live-streamed sing-along with songs about a certain theme.

This weeks theme: Support
Bill Withers - Lean On Me
Bruno Mars - Count On Me

https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7eJ3u75SWcfJBXjZtIsrv6

We'll talk a little bit about each, get some education in there, but mostly just enjoy the idea of singing along with someone, even when we're separated by houses. The songs I'm going to be singing are on this playlist, so you can listen to them and learn them for Friday! Keep an eye on this space for more information and share this with anyone you think would enjoy it. I hope to hear you then!",0.0,"KMS: Create, Connect, Recharge, Reflect

It was a great day of wrestling for our KMS cub wrestling team at the Dodge City Dual Wrestling Tournament on Saturday.

KMS defeated Dodge City Comanche 57-51.
KMS defeated Garden City - Ken Henderson 54-48.

This advanced KMS to the Championship round vs. Great Bend and Liberal Eisenhower to guarantee a top three finish. Each team had to dual one another.

KMS defeated a very tough Great Bend team in the Championship round 51-50.
Liberal Eisenhower defeated KMS in a very competitive dual 60-52.

Due to how the tie breaking points criteria was set up (due to a 3-way tie), KMS finished 3rd place out of nine teams

Last weekend was crazy amazing. Baylor had the Champion Steer at the Kansas Junior Livestock Show. The boys and Teagan worked hard all summer getting this steer ready. Theirs - and many others - hard work paid off. Thanks to everyone who helped us get here, its been an unbelievable ride.

I hope your summer is going well and you are staying cool!

Knapp has kicked off its Summer Reading Program and I wanted to follow up with you on my recent email regarding some great resources, to encourage you to keep on reading!

In case you weren’t able to collect your book and reading log the last week of school, there are extras, as well as books you are welcome to take, in Knapp’s entryway. (Office hours for the month of July are 9:00am-1:00pm Monday-Thursday.) Reading logs were also attached to a parent email that went out today.

We would also like to encourage students to keep working on their packets if they are not complete, so they can continue learning over the summer!

If you stop in, please say “Hello” to Mrs. Spears, our new principal! She would love to meet you!

Don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions & HAPPY READING!

The Rubber Egg
1. Place an egg into a tall drinking glass.
2. Pour vinegar into the glass until it is completely covered.
3. Put the glass to the side so nobody drinks it or spills it.
4. Let the egg soak overnight. Make some observations! You should notice a lot of foam and bubbles. When it seems to have slowed, move on to the next step.
5. Rinse the vinegar and foam out with water and then cover the egg again with vinegar.
6. Wait for 6 days. At the end of this time, rinse off the egg and pick it up.

You should notice it feels slightly different than when you started… most noticeably it is missing the shell and has a weird rubbery feel to it. Shake it. Gently squeeze it.

Test out your new creation in the sink by dropping it from a few inches and then some more.

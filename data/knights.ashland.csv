Don’t be worried if you don’t have any dance experience, we have a few days of practices before tryouts so you can learn the basics, and we also go to camp in the summer to improve all of our skills before the season starts! We have a reasonable practice schedule and dancing is a great stress reliever! If you have a friend that might be interested please invite them to tryout with you!!

We dance at football and basketball games, but you do have the choice of just doing 1 season if you’re involved in other sports throughout the year. Don’t be worried if you don’t have any dance experience, we have a few days of practices before tryouts so you can learn the basics, and we also go to camp in the summer to improve all of our skills before the season starts! We have a reasonable practice schedule and dancing is a great stress reliever! If you have a friend that might be interested please invite them to tryout with you!! Please contact Coach Puckett or any member of the team if you have any questions - hope to see you next week!

Today State FFA announced the state proficiency winners during a Facebook live event. Usually this would take place at State Awards Day, but with COVID-19, it was done online.

We had one student, JT Donnan, competing for Swine Production Placement. JT works at a local hog farm, and does a variety of different tasks. Although he didn’t get 1st place today, he is still in the top 3 in the state, which is a major accomplishment! We congratulate JT for all the hard work he has put in completing his SAE.",0.0,"A-C Central FFA
April 29 at 4:58 PM ·

Today State FFA announced the state proficiency winners during a Facebook live event. Usually this would take place at State Awards Day, but with COVID-19, it was done online.

We had one student, JT Donnan, competing for Swine Production Placement. JT works at a local hog farm, and does a variety of different tasks. Although he didn’t get 1st place today, he is still in the top 3 in the state, which is a major accomplishment! We congratulate JT for all the hard work he has put in completing his SAE.",2020-04-29 18:10:17,,

While it is not ideal, we want to assure you that at A-C Central, our teachers and staff are fully engaged and willing to take on this new challenge and push forward with remote learning, engaging with students and continuing with our food distribution program every weekday with the exception of Good Friday, and Easter Monday.

This month’s student of the month for the middle school is Andrew Doellman. Andrew is an astute student. He is branching out and trying new things to find what he enjoys the most. His unique point of view is a great addition to any classroom or group. Andrew is someone who is brimming with positivity and is eager to learn and help out. He's always prepared with class materials and for class discussions. He's always well-mannered and respectful to classmates and staff alike. Andrew is creative, a talented writer, and an avid reader who I enjoy getting book recommendations from.",2020-02-19 13:35:25,,

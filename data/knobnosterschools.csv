Our students started the competition at the University of Missouri in Columbia last December with over 350 FFA students representing 23 chapters from across the state at FFA Draft Day.

The Knob Noster FFA Team earned 1,770 points over the course of the program based on their steer's quality, yield and profitability.

Please remember that state law requires you to do the following:
""When a school bus stops to load or unload school children, the driver activates signaling devices (flashing lights and stop sign) to notify other drivers of an impending stop. Oncoming and following traffic must stop before they reach the bus when these signals are activated.""

Based on careful consideration of all feedback provided in this week‚Äôs commencement survey which was sent to the families of the senior class of 2020, the district will not hold commencement on June 20, 2020.

Should things change, we will provide a minimum of a 14 day notice as we approach that date.

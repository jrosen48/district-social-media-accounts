Knox Elementary fourth graders participated today in the international campaign, Mix It Up at Lunch Day. As part of their lessons on tolerance, the students drew numbers to identify at which table they would eat.

The fourth graders used the icebreaker questions at each table to learn about their new friends. For example, at the Red Stars Table #4, students shared their hidden talents with each other, such as the ability to draw well, do the front walkover, run fast, and ""do cool tricks on my bike."" The Blue Table students told others their favorite board games, which included Monopoly, Sorry, and Clue.

Students noted they enjoyed the activity. As one 9-year-old said, ""This is really good. We can make new friends we've never made before."" The activity was organized by KES counselor Mrs. Tara Nantz.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1218426434964917&id=167573190050252,,0.0,"KCSC-Mix It Up at Lunch Day

Knox High School students in Ms. Jacqueline Zaiko's Aquatics classes were recently challenged to build a boat made only of cardboard and duct tape. The goal was for the boat to ""live"" through one trip down and back the length of the pool.

Pictured here are the crew members of Noah's Ark and No Name. The students say it took them about four hours and five rolls of duct tape to make their creations.

Even though 60% of the boats will sink shortly after leaving the dock, the two crafts in this post met the goal. They did, however, sink before reaching the record of sailing 10 lengths of the pool set last year.

The student objective for this assignment was to demonstrate how to work as a group to accomplish a goal. The objective correlates to the teamwork benchmark of using effective collaboration and cooperation skills outlined in the Indiana Employability Skills created by the Indiana Department of Workforce Development.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1036556096485286&id=167573190050252,,0.0,"KCSC-It's Not About the Duct Tape

The most amazing thing happened in our community this week.

This week, a beautiful couple received a devastating prognosis. That day, they decided to speed up their someday wedding - to Friday.

In the space of about three days - an incredible wedding came together for two people who are two of the most amazing people I know.

This happened because of some very specific people and businesses.

I want to respect the privacy of this couple, but will share with you the AMAZING things that came together. Please support these amazing businesses - bc these are people who have big hearts and take care of their community.

First, the event coordinators and their friend (the backbone of this whole thing). Thank you to Teri Smith, Erika Gottula (Flourish Wedding & Event Planning) and Amy Rose (Uptown Events- Medford)

And everyone else:

Beautiful Venue: George Schultz & family
Catering: Kona Bento
Videography: Kelsie Dean IndieGlow Films
Hair & Makeup: Reina Allen Artistry @artistryreina on Instagram
Bridal bouquet and boutonnière: Penny and Lulu Studio Florist
Altar flowers: Le Marche’ Collective and La Fleur Bouquets
Groom’s Wedding Band: Korrin Rae Jewelry
Tuxedo: Tuxedo Junction Medford Oregon
Dress alterations: Cat Munoz
Sound set up: Carlson Sound and Light
Even the port-a-potty was taken care of(!) - Royal Flush
Donations: Southern Oregon Candlelighters
Photography and Cake: personal friends of the family

There are countless more people to thank who volunteered their time and hearts.

I am stunned and in awe.

Congratulate this beautiful couple and pray they will get as much time as possible together.

Thank you. ❤️🙏",2.0,"We are so thankful to have had the opportunity to participate in this beautiful event with so many caring individuals! 💗 #serving #caring #livelove

The most amazing thing happened in our community this week.

This week, a beautiful couple received a devastating prognosis. That day, they decided to speed up their someday wedding - to Friday.

In the space of about three days - an incredible wedding came together for two people who are two of the most amazing people I know.

This happened because of some very specific people and businesses.

I want to respect the privacy of this couple, but will share with you the AMAZING things that came together. Please support these amazing businesses - bc these are people who have big hearts and take care of their community.

First, the event coordinators and their friend (the backbone of this whole thing). Thank you to Teri Smith, Erika Gottula (Flourish Wedding & Event Planning) and Amy Rose (Uptown Events- Medford)

And everyone else:

Beautiful Venue: George Schultz & family
Catering: Kona Bento
Videography: Kelsie Dean IndieGlow Films
Hair & Makeup: Reina Allen Artistry @artistryreina on Instagram
Bridal bouquet and boutonnière: Penny and Lulu Studio Florist
Altar flowers: Le Marche’ Collective and La Fleur Bouquets
Groom’s Wedding Band: Korrin Rae Jewelry
Tuxedo: Tuxedo Junction Medford Oregon
Dress alterations: Cat Munoz
Sound set up: Carlson Sound and Light
Even the port-a-potty was taken care of(!) - Royal Flush
Donations: Southern Oregon Candlelighters
Photography and Cake: personal friends of the family

There are countless more people to thank who volunteered their time and hearts.

I am stunned and in awe.

Congratulate this beautiful couple and pray they will get as much time as possible together.

Thank you. ❤️🙏",2020-02-22 18:05:07,,

Recently, Kona Bento has experienced a number of unfortunate events. However, with the support of our customers, fellow business owners, and Law Enforcement, moving forward has been easy.

We'd like to recognize Dennis Lane and AEInteriors. We requested a quote for upgrading our security system and he said he'd be available in a week. We then spoke further about the events that had prompted us to seek his services.

The next morning he came to Kona Bento and installed the system free of charge. He said that he once had someone give him a hand when he first started his business and he simply wanted to pay it forward.

What Dennis doesn't know is that his good deed has already paid off, as it helped us obtain evidence to trespass a sick man who does not respect personal boundaries.

If you or anyone you know is looking for someone to install a security system or electronics AEInteriors is the ☝️ to call!!

Oregon County Health Department is now taking appointments for back to school immunizations for the 2020-2021 school year. This is a little different, as we usually do not require appointments. Waiting until the end of summer when appointment slots are already full may mean missed class time for an appointment after the start of the school year. We are also spacing immunization appointments out through May and June, due to the COVID 19 pandemic, to decrease waiting room congestion.
Students entering kindergarten will be required to be up to date on their Dtap, Polio, MMR and Varicella. Eighth graders need to have a current Tdap and Meningococcal and Twelfth graders will also need a Meningococcal booster depending on the age they were with their previous dose.
For an appointment or questions regarding vaccinations or Missouri requirements, please call 417-778-7450 for ALTON or 417-264-3114 for a Tuesday or a Wednesday appointment at THAYER. We do ask that you bring a current immunization record to your appointment.",6.0,"Oregon County Health Department

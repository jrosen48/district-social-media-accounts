The proposed 15-minute shift is for multiple reasons. One, with middle/high school bus runs taking place prior to the elementary runs, the 15 minutes provides additional time needed for student temperature checks and bus cleaning between runs due to COVID-19 disinfecting. Regarding afternoon bus transportation, the 15 minutes will also mean elementary students will have less wait-time between the end of the instructional day and when buses arrive for student transportation home. Student drop-off will still begin at 7:30 a.m.",2020-07-14 19:56:44,,

The Department of Social Services’ Child Care Subsidy Program assists Virginians in paying for child-care costs. If you are eligible and are approved for services, the Subsidy Program can pay a portion of your child-care costs directly to the child-care provider.

To be eligible, children must be either:

Under age 13 and not eligible to attend public school during the part of the day when public education is available

Under age 18 with special needs

Virginians can easily check their eligibility or apply online using the CommonHelp application. You can also apply in-person at a local DSS office. To learn more about the Child Care Subsidy Program, visit the DSS website.

As we work on preparing for the new school year, I am amazed at how so very different this year is compared to previous years. The unknown is truly the unknown; and we must press forward and move to educate our students which is so vital to our students overall well-being. Again, I want to thank each of your for your continued support and patience with all of our staff. We continue with all of our decisions to make safety our top priority. I have attached a pdf letter with more information regarding Chromebook distributions, drive through for all schools, and details on our mitigation plan.

Stay healthy and safe.

All the best,

To the CHS Class of 2020

You are the class who lost
your last months as the top dogs
your right to be the kings and queens of the school
your need to fix the mistakes
your time to dance and celebrate
your moment to shine
your belief in what is fair
your right to say goodbye
your rite of passage.

It isn’t fair.
It isn’t right.
It stole a moment in time that will never be given back.
But…

You are the class who will gain perspective
will understand that nothing is promised
will fix your mistakes soon after you make them
will celebrate with the ones who matter
will find other ways to shine
will not need life to be fair to do a job well done
will love your friends and family more deeply
will appreciate those who taught you
will know what it means to “grow up”
will be the hope for the future
Because
You matter.
You are important.

One of every five Americans is a person with a disability. A person may be born with a disability, may acquire a disability through an accident or illness, or may acquire a disability simply as a part of growing older. Despite the fact that disability is a natural part of life, people with disabilities have not always had access to equal opportunities. Not until 1975, with the passage of the Federal Education for All Handicapped Children Act (now known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act), did school-aged children with disabilities have a right to a free appropriate public education.

The Virginia Department of Education has worked to share many initiatives which support students with disabilities.

I was inspired to become an educator through the teachers I had as a kid! When I was in middle school, my mom passed away and one of the biggest support systems I had was through my teachers. My former teachers continuously checked in on me, while my future teachers always made sure to give me the support I needed. I knew then that being an educator was what I wanted to become.

JROTC Instructor - MSG Dan Dolan

In short, my ""Why"" is to pay it forward.

In long, when I was in high school I was headed for either jail or a coffin. Divorced parents, physically and emotionally abusive mother and just all around bad youthful behavior. The father of a friend of mine was the Army JROTC instructor at my high school and he convinced me to join the JROTC program. It was through that program and his guidance and mentorship that I decided to join the army and make a decent life for myself. He became the father figure I needed and helped guide me in many of my tougher times. If not for him, I believe I would be in a much different, and less happy place right now.

My selfish goal is to be that person who makes that kind of difference in a student's life because I know how valuable it can be.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=128399141842727&id=101589101190398,,0.0,"What’s Your Why Wednesday

While I learned valuable skills like cash flow analysis, collaboration, and professionalism, my heart yearned to make a more powerful, impactful difference. My sister, who is also a special education teacher, inspired me to follow my heart back to helping in the form of teaching.

Thank you parents and students for knowing that attendance matters.

Chronic absenteeism is missing 10% of the school days, which is about 18 absences/year or about 2 absences/month. Being on time and staying all day is important too 🙂 A few quick tips:

1. When you are sick, please take care of yourself and stay home from school to avoid the spread of germs.

2. Visit the doctor if your illness is going to keep you out of school more than two days. They can help with a speedier recovery sometimes.

3. Other emergencies come up too. We understand. Always communicate with the school when your child has been absent. A doctor’s note or parent note works great!

4. Try to schedule appointments outside school hours whenever possible.

Teacher Feature: Dr. Swanson

When my son was younger, I volunteered at his elementary school because I wanted to get involved. When I asked questions about various things that pertained to programs I was interested in, I got interesting looks and responses from educators in his setting. I couldn’t figure out why. Once I was told he had made a “bad” choice for a friend when he gravitated to the only other young boy who looked like him in the class. These experiences peeked my curiosity about how African American males were viewed and treated in educational settings. I decided I wanted to become a part of the support system for this student group to ensure they got a fair shot at an education that would allow them to dream and become!!!

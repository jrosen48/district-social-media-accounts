In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, KEF has decided to cancel the June Student Enrichment Grant Cycle. As we rely heavily on our local business' generous donations to fund these programs, we feel that we can not ask our businesses who are struggling in response to COVID's closures to stretch themselves even thinner by donating to KEF.



We will still have our October and February grant cycles as planned. By not having a June cycle, we will be able to fund more student grants later on in the year.

Everyone got to play a game of heads and tails before hearing from our coaches and athletes about the upcoming games.

At the end of last school year, Dyer second grade teacher Mrs. Reed entered a contest to have the Denton based store SCRAP come do an hour of art in her classroom.
She won!

Yesterday, Jacie from SCRAP came and conducted a hands-on craft lesson with Mrs. Reed's class. Jacie discussed the importance of reducing, reusing, and recycling with students before showing them various crafts made from items that are reused! Students saw flowers made from bottle caps and silly straws, a bumblebee made from old CDs and map paper, and a jellyfish made from ribbons, fabric, and bottle caps!

Then, students were able to make a self-portrait using scraps of fabric and buttons. Our students were really able to showcase their creativity, using fun patterns and colors to create hair and clothes for their self-portraits.

Thank you SCRAP Denton for this incredible and fun opportunity!",2.0,"We love the creativity these students showcased in their fabric self-portraits!

The first ever Bobcat Bash was a huge success! All the kids had the chance to dunk a grown up at the dunking booth, play games sponsored by various KHS organizations, and win treats and prizes! Then, we moved inside for a Meet the Bobcat and LadyCat pep rally! We met our fall sports athletes from KHS and KYSA, listened to some great music from the KHS Blue Brigade Band, and got the Bobcat Spirit flowing with the help of our KHS Cheerleaders. Bev the Bobcat got our players up on their feet and dancing together, and the whole community was able to participate in a fun game of Heads or Tails. Thank you to everyone for coming out to support our students, and special shout out to the Krum Athletic Booster Club for making this event happen.",0.0,"Krum ISD added 114 new photos.

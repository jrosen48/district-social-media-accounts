Jim Overfield, who earned his doctorate at Princeton and is a history professor emeritus at the University of Vermont, is the son of the late Joe Overfield, a very familiar name for Buffalo baseball fans. Joe Overfield attended thousands of Bisons games beginning in 1925 and went on to become the preeminent authority on the subject, culminating with his definitive 1985 book entitled ""The 100 Seasons of Buffalo Baseball."" He had always intended on updating his book before he passed away in 1999, but his son Jim Overfield is picking up where he left off. ""The Seasons of Buffalo Baseball"" will be an update and revision of his father's work.

We are excited to share that the West Ada School Board last night approved a return to competition for their high school sports teams.

This means our athletes will have some teams to play. Because the spread of COVID in our county remains in “red” West Ada, like Kuna, the limit on large group gatherings remains.

This means no spectators here and in West Ada. West Ada also is using the NFHS Network to livestream some games: https://www.nfhsnetwork.com/

Good afternoon Everyone,

We’ve had many inquiries about schedules. Due to circumstances created by the coronavirus (shifting teachers to online school, budget constraints, transferring teachers to other placements), schedules should be available to view online by August 27th. We appreciate your understanding and flexibility. Also, we are not able to honor requests (beyond extenuating circumstances) to switch from Blue to Gold or vice versa nor are we able to honor requests for open enrollment due to our current uncertain situation. Once school begins in-person, we can re-evaluate the Gold/Blue enrollments and open enrollment requests and make determinations at that time. Again, thank you for your understanding.

KHS Alumni Spotlight
2016 KHS graduate Annalise Burke recently graduated with honors from Rutgers College. When asked how KHS prepared her for future success this is what she told us.

“While at KHS, I was the President of Business Professionals of America and participated in the High School of Business program. As a Public Policy and Korean double major at Rutgers, I found the concepts learned through those KHS activities gave me an edge in courses such as Policy Economics, Statistics for Policy Research, and Federal Taxation. Additionally, participation in BPA prepared me for competition on a national level for college admissions. Currently, I am preparing for my fourth U.S. State Department-funded program, this time as a Fulbright ETA Scholar in South Korea.”
Congratulations to Annalise!

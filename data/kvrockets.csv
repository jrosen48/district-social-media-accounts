Thank you to Mercantile Bank of Michigan for donating a CPR in Schools kit to the students at Kelloggsville Public Schools.

More than 326,000 people experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital each year, and about 90 percent of those victims die, often because bystanders don’t know how to start CPR or are afraid they’ll do something wrong. CPR, especially if performed immediately, can double or triple a cardiac arrest victim’s chance of survival.

Seniors will also be able to pick up projects that are completed in classes (art, woods, welding etc). Students will bring their items to the front doors of the high school and we will have lines that are marked for social distancing. Only a few students at a time will be allowed entry. Books will be checked in by staff, lockers will be emptied by staff and items will be returned to the student. Students will not be allowed to go to lockers or locker rooms. Please bring all items that need to be returned to the school on those days.

Seniors that still need to complete courses for graduation will check in books at a later date to be determined in the future.",2020-04-20 11:41:05,,

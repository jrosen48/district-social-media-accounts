LHS Class of 2020:

if you get a chance, take a drive by the high school there is a tribute to you from staff and parents on the front lawn! We have a personalized sign for each of you next to a larger one commemorating your class! Please don't take it yet, we plan on getting them to you by early next week to display at your residences.

I would like to leave them up as group for a couple of days as a tribute to you and allow for people to take photographs if they want. Cars are already driving by honking their horns as a tribute. So, please don't take your sign yet. Don't worry about them being stolen the front of the high school is under video surveillance 24/7. We are still working on the logistics to get the signs to you. There will be an email to follow with directions on how we are going to do that.

Hey Neighbors!

Over the next few weeks, many of us will be increasing our time spent at home. It can be hard to find things to do all day (especially with children) and not lose your mind. So I was thinking about a way for our community to still get outside and do something fun, without touching or coughing near others.

I thought it’d be fun to have a neighborhood wide rainbow 🌈 hunt!

All you have to do is put a rainbow in your window between now and this Friday. That’s it! Color it, paint it, cut it out, print it from the printer, whatever.

Then we can get outside, walk around and see how many rainbows we can find!

It’s easy. No human contact. Get fresh air. Make a rainbow and then hunt for others.

What do you think? A fun art project that becomes a great outdoor activity!

Students counted goldfish from 1-15 to feed the penguin, painted their names with penguins, built igloos with different materials and played iceberg shape bean bag toss. They used blubber gloves to learn how Arctic animals are protected from the cold and used scooters to slide on their bellies like penguins! What a fun week!

Due to the inclement weather, we will be having the PSS Halloween Parade ONSITE today.

The Parade will start at 2:00. We will exit the gym and go around the walking path and re-enter PSS through the 5th grade door. If it is raining hard, we will have to cancel the parade all together.

Due to safety concerns, we are asking families to observe the parade outside, as we have always done in the past. Parking will be limited.

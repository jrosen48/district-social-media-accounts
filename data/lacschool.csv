January brings snow, makes your freeze.
February brings rain, makes the lake unfreeze.
March brings the breeze, that makes you dance
April brings may flowers, daisies at your feet
May brings pretty lambs, lambs running thru the grass
June brings rose, fills kids hands with joy
July brings cooled showers
August brings my birthday at the end
September brings fruit, makes good sportsmanship
October brings you haunted feeling
November brings pumpkins
December brings a sheet of ice, makes Christmas treats

Today, as you know, is “Make a Meal Monday” for Virtual Spirit Week. So.....the Lower Alloways Creek Education Association, along with Marshall, decided to “make lunch” for our awesome LAC Road Department/Public Works employees. They’re out there everyday taking care of our beautiful township. A huge shout out to Brad Serfass for delivering lunch from Brad’s Pizza and Sub Shop! Thanks for all you do guys - we all appreciate your many efforts!",0.0,"Susan Maniglia is with Shelly Bietsch and 2 others.

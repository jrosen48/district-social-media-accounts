Luke also is an exhibiting artist in Ladue Horton Watkins' Spirtas Gallery's current show, Photographic Visions.
Luke's beautiful portrait series explores the ""We got you"" generation and the new sense of support young men receive from friends and families. No longer are men and boys encouraged to hide their feelings in unhealthy ways, as in generations past. The caring hands on shoulders reinforce this idea of solidarity.

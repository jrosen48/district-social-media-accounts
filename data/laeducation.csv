Third grader (now 4thgrader) interviews State Representative! Thanks Louisiana State Representative, Marcus Bryant for sharing your job, what you do, and how at a young age you can represent your State! Dailee's teacher gave them a project two weeks ago on learning about the three branches of government. Through our discussion, I went on to teach her about City officials and who they are, Parish officials and who they are, School Board Officials and who they are, and State officials and who they are. To help relate studies with real life, I contacted Representative Bryant and he was kind to allow her to interview him. She researched some things in her community she would like to see changed and Rep Bryant made note of her concerns. It is such a blessing to have elected officials to take time out to help educate kids with the power of how Government works!

Today, I signed a proclamation that immediately halts any gathering of more than 250 people until Monday, April 13, closes all K-12 public schools statewide effective Monday, March 16 and also moves upcoming state elections.

We are at an inflection point now and we are going to take bold action to minimize the further spread of this illness. That is why I am issuing this order today, ending all events of more than 250 people, closing our schools, and reducing the amount of face-to-face public interaction at state government buildings.

In a separate executive order I will grant Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin’s request to move our upcoming elections for April and May to June and July. The limits on gatherings of 250 people or more statewide is based on federal CDC guidance given the community spread which we are currently experiencing. These steps are necessary to protect the health and safety of the people of Louisiana from the risk of COVID-19.

Today, the Louisiana Department of Health has confirmed two new presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 in Louisiana. Currently, we have three presumptive positive cases of coronavirus in Louisiana, all in the New Orleans area.

While we investigate these cases, we cannot disclose any additional information about these patients at this time.

It is important that the public take measures to protect their health and reduce the spread of illness, including avoiding going out in public when you are sick, washing your hands, social distancing and disinfecting commonly used surfaces.

Testing for COVID-19 is expanding this week as commercial labs come on board. We expect to see more presumptive positives in the coming days and weeks and I am asking all Louisianans to remain vigilant as we work to contain the spread of this and other illnesses. #lagov

*Favorite food: Currently, my favorite food is runny fried eggs. Weird, I know!

*Favorite HS memory: All of my favorite memories happened during school trips! If I had to choose, my most fond memory was going to the FCCLA state conference to run for state office and meeting all of the other incoming officers for the first time.

*Plans after HS: Major in Nutritional Sciences at Cornell University

*Favorite teacher: It's super hard to choose a favorite teacher. Several teachers in high school have made unique and strong influences in my life. I've learned that most teachers want to do their best to help students! I promise, it doesn't go unnoticed.

*Favorite food: Currently, my favorite food is runny fried eggs. Weird, I know!

*Favorite HS memory: All of my favorite memories happened during school trips! If I had to choose, my most fond memory was going to the FCCLA state conference to run for state office and meeting all of the other incoming officers for the first time.

*In 10 years: I see myself working as a sports dietitian either in a gym I own or in a well known gym, married, getting the chance to travel often, and somehow giving back to the community. I would love to start a scholarship for students going to Lafayette County C-1.",2020-04-27 11:52:42,,

🌸Plant Sale Update!!🌸

Due to the Governors extended stay home order, we are having to move the plant sale back to May 4. If the Governor extends the order again, odds are the plant sale will move again.

All plants are in full bloom and look beautiful! Please keep us in mind for your spring plant needs! We have tomato’s and peppers as well. Our students worked hard in the greenhouse to make this possible.

As we get closer to May 4 more details will be released on how the plant sale will work.

If you have specific plant sale questions, please email carpenters@huskersk12.org.

Thank you for always supporting us!",0.0,"https://www.facebook.com/1537167489673461/posts/2990304154359780/

ATTENTION SENIOR PARENTS! Please share this post to help spread the word.

I have had several inquiries about printing yard signs for seniors, so here is some information.....

All yard signs are 18x24, printed on two sides, and come with a yard stake. They are customized with name, photo, and school colors. You are welcome to use a Senior photo that I have taken or if you have a different photo that you would like to use I will need a copyright release. Yard signs are $20 each.

The first bulk order will go in THIS FRIDAY AT 3:00! I will be able to order more at a later date depending on the demand.

All orders can be placed through the School/Sports tab on my website, www.purelifephotography.biz, or paid through Venmo. Feel free to pm me regarding which photo you would like. Delivery will be porch pickup from my house, or I will gladly deliver as many as I can.

I am including three design options. Feel free to contact me with any questions!!!

I am super proud of Sydney Ritter and her accomplishments tonight! She took 2nd place at UCM in the Refresh, Repurpose and Recycle Fashion Design Show. Sydney entered the Repurpose category. She was required to purchase clothing from a thrift store and redesign it into another piece. I admire her creative side and only wish some of it came from me! Her model, Savannah Skinner, did an amazing job of showing off her work. A huge thank you to Sydney’s advisor, Courtney Bergsieker, who encouraged Sydney to enter her work and took time away from her own family to support her. It’s wonderful teachers like Courtney who help to inspire our children to be more than they believe possible.",0.0,"Monica Ritter is with Sydney Ritter and 2 others.

Jacob said he most enjoyed hearing discussion in his committee meeting about MoDot funding. Brittney even got to sit at the head seat of the Senate because Senator Hoskins is the President Pro Tempore!

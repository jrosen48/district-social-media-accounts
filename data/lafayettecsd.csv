Dear LaFayette School Community:

The district was approached by a group of thoughtful community members who would like to honor the class of 2020 in a special way with yard signs for students in our senior class. Please see the message below from the LaFayette Sports Boosters:

Since the school year is one for the history books and we are unsure of the unknown future, we wanted to provide a little something to honor the Class of 2020. We will be selling lawn signs to show our love and support.

Each sign is 18X24 and comes with a wire stake. A photo of the yard sign is included with this post. Signs cost $10.

All seniors will be receiving one for their house and thank you to some of the community who have submitted donations to help offset the cost.

If you are interested please contact The LaFayette Athletic Booster club, via email or Facebook. You can pay via PayPal (LaFayetteABC1@gmail.com) or check, cash.

Once these signs arrive we will make contact with families to arrange delivery (while observing social distancing rules to keep everyone safe!).",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1798232813641367&id=662444280553565,,0.0,"April 15, 2020

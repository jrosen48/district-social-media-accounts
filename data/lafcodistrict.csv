🍎 MEET THE EDUCATORS 🍎
Hannah Gadd Ardery is a choir, music history and dual-credit music appreciation teacher at Lafayette High in City of Oxford. And, she's received the honor of being Mississippi's Teacher of the Year.
She comes from a family of teachers (and even married a teacher), and say's she's a “product of the ‘90s; like, golden age of Disney and the golden age of all things pop music; I mean, Britney (Spears) was and still is my queen.”
Sure, she teaches about music and choir, but she says her favorite part of her job is teaching students to love one another. ""Until you intentionally include, you unintentionally exclude, and they really understand that and they understand the value of loving each other.”

My students work hard! Let me tell you about this picture.

This is Aubrey Claire. She will be a senior, and she’s been a photographer for three years. Many of her pictures have been featured as part of the Commodore Media Group. She’s won awards for her work.
For the past year and a half, she’s been trying to get one of her images to be picked by Herff Jones as one of the landing pages for their yearbook website. She would send them pictures after every photo shoot she edited. For a year and a half! Today, it paid off.

She can now say she’s an internationally published photographer. Her name is at the bottom. LHS and Oxford, MS are also part of the caption.

She put Lafayette County School District on the map. She’s talented, but I’m so proud of her determination to see this through and get it done!

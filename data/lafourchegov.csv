It's 7:00AM: Here's the latest on Tropical Depression 8 in the central Gulf of Mexico. This system will continue drifting west-northwest and steadily strengthen into a tropical storm through late-week and into the weekend.

‚òîÔ∏è Impacts associated with Tropical Depression 8 include the risk for locally heavy rainfall today and tomorrow. Portions of the area remain in a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall, with now areas south of I-10/12 in SE LA now upgraded to a Slight Risk. Watch for flash flooding in these outlooked areas!

üåä No changes to the Coastal Flood Advisory in effect. Higher than normal tides may produce some coastal flooding along coastal SE LA / S MS and the tidal lake coastlines. More so in/around areas that traditionally see coastal flooding from enhanced onshore wind flow.

Stay tuned for more updates!",2020-07-23 09:01:30,,

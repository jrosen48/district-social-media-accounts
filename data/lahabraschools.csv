What a night, what a show! Arbolita students and staff put on an amazing display of Visual and Performing Arts for the La Habra Community. The first annual Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) Festival was the culmination of many months of teaching, learning, planning and preparation to welcome parents and community members to Arbolita to enjoy student performances.

With the reconfiguration of La Habra City School District, Arbolita was selected to become the District’s first ever VAPA focused magnet. One year later Arbolita Elementary has greatly transformed, offering piano lab classes, chorus, Disney Musicals, and collaboration with The Kennedy Center, Any Given Child. A very special guest in attendance was Cathy Rigby, former Olympic Gymnast, actor and motivational speaker. Congratulations to the Arbolita students, parents and staff for a great night!

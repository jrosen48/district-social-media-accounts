We will be doing virtual PTO (Parent Teacher Organization) and PIE (Partners in Education) meetings this year!!!

Research shows that parent-school-partnerships improve schools, strengthen families, build community support, and increase student achievement and success. Both PTO and PIE committees are made up of staff members and parents/guardians but are completely parent/guardian led.

If you are a Primary School parent/guardian and are interested in joining, please click the link below to learn what each committee is and how you can get involved!

Once we have gathered information for all who are interested, we will send zoom meeting invites to your email address in order for you to be able to join the meetings. We look forward to seeing you at the first meetings soon!

Junior/Senior High and Tiger Trades: Will be located in the Ag classroom at the High School.
Tuesday August 11th 11-6pm

Primary:
Wednesday August 12th 8am-12pm

Intermediate:
Wednesday August 12th 12pm-4pm

We will be requiring masks, temp checks at the door and only allowing 4 people in at a time, so since we are in a classroom we ask that only one parent come in to obtain bus passes and if possible leave children with another responsible adult. We will have our doors open for proper ventilation. We also still have our bus contract online (district website) for those who are available to print and complete them prior to coming, it should make things go quicker.

Any questions please just give me a call, thank you so much!!

Tuesday August 11th 11-6pm

Primary:
Wednesday August 12th 8am-12pm

Intermediate:
Wednesday August 12th 12pm-4pm

We will be requiring masks, temp checks at the door and only allowing 4 people in at a time, so since we are in a classroom we ask that only one parent come in to obtain bus passes and if possible leave children with another responsible adult. We will have our doors open for proper ventilation. We also still have our bus contract online (district website) for those who are available to print and complete them prior to coming, it should make things go quicker.

Any questions please just give me a call, thank you so much!!

How to Change the World With Kindness

Mindset: Live to Give
Learning Objective: Make a Difference
Thought:
In a world that seems upside down, we need to take care of ourselves and the people around us. Grab a piece of paper and write your name, the name of someone you know, and a stranger’s name. During the upcoming week, do something kind for each person on the list. Random acts of kindness have been linked to many health benefits such as a reduction in anxiety, depression, and blood pressure.
Let’s turn the world around with a few acts of kindness!

Devin is a 13 year Lake Dallas graduate. He's enjoyed jumping with Falcon Flyers and then playing trombone in the band.

He sings with The Millennial Choirs and Orchestra and had the privilege to sing at the Tabernacle on Temple Square in SLC and Carnegie Hall in NYC. He has the gift of perfect pitch, but he won't tell you that.

He's a fun, loving, helpful, caring, & thoughtful young man. He has always been a sensitive & empathic young man and has NO tolerance for abuse of any kind. He's gotten in ""trouble"" a few times by telling female friends when her boyfriend isn't treating her well.

Congratulations to my little sister Shelly Maldonado. Even though it hasn’t been an easy road for you, you pushed through thick and thin and now here you are!

Shelly joined the Lake Dallas Falcon family only 4 years ago as a freshman in high school. During her time here, she enjoyed her Spanish and Dance classes, and being part of the CIS group.
Outside school she spent time practicing Aikido and attending her church youth group. She’s planning to attend El Centro College in Dallas in its nursing program.

Our family is so proud of you and can’t wait to see the woman you’re becoming.

Deven is a 13 year Lake Dallas Falcon. He has been a Falcon football player since the age of 5. After watching him play that first season I knew I would have a title of a “Falcon Mom”. Deven never missed a season since. Football was his passion and he loved playing on the Falcon Field. Deven was part of the FCA. He’s a proud member of Lake Shore Baptist church. Deven enlisted in the Army National Guard during his Senior year. He will report for duty after graduation. He will also be furthering his education at UNT in pre-engineering. Deven we are so proud of all the things you have accomplished in your 13 yrs as a Falcon. We are looking forward to watch you grow into a godly young man and do great things in life. We love you Devo.

Kaleb Ledbetter is our intelligent, humble, kind hearted, and hardworking son. Despite the obstacles, we are so excited to congratulate him on his high school graduation. In school, Kaleb has always had a natural understanding of math. He’s enjoyed and excelled in his (many!!) math, engineering, physics, and computer science classes. In the fall, Kaleb will be continuing his interests in these areas at Texas A&M University in the engineering program.

He has always been very passionate about soccer, beginning at 4 years old. He especially enjoyed his time playing with his friends these past 4 years and is proud of the accomplishments the Lake Dallas soccer team was able to achieve. Of course, we all wonder what could have been for this team had it not been for this nasty virus.

Though 2020 didn’t end the way we would have liked for him and his classmates, it doesn’t change how proud we are of him and how excited we are for what his life holds for him in the future.

It is now time, Audrey, to say goodbye to the chapter at LDISD as part of your journey to the next educational challenge. The road to graduating from high school is never smooth and is paved with lots of bumps and challenges. We noticed that you persevered and were tenacious in setting and meeting goals that included dual credit courses, working two jobs, caring for family, and all the while excelling at all your other classes. You, and you alone, earned that GPA! You are fortunate to have already decided your career goal of health care management with a degree in business.

I watched an inexperienced football player become a beast but earned the respect of his team and peers. I watched a shy singer become a vocalist.(wish you would have stayed in choir). Your journey is just beginning and I can hardly wait to see what you accomplish next. The United States Navy will mold you into a leader and you will learn things beyond your dreams.

Maddie Vest is our Class of 2020 Senior and a 13 year LD student 💚. We are so proud of all of Maddie’s accomplishments. She hopes to go to Midwestern State in the fall. Maddie found her love for cheer in 3rd grade in LCFCA, then moved on to competitive cheer and middle school cheer. She was in high school cheer all 4 years and a Varsity Cheerleader since her sophomore year. Maddie has a huge heart, she is dedicated, and she’s also a hard worker. Maddie worked hard to maintain a strong GPA while she also worked on the weekends.She’s sad about not being able to say her good byes to all her friends and her teachers and about all the missed senior year traditions but she is showing such resilience and strength during this time.

Congratulations to my 2020 Lake Dallas Graduating Senior, Zoe Brewer♥️

You have been a shining star since your debut in 2002! You’ve always had a sincere smile and heart that everyone seems to gravitate to.

From your early days in Illinois at Holy Family elementary school, to North Ridge Middle School, to now...you’ve been a young lady of class and honor, one that has kept your eye on the prize, while always caring for others. I have been sad beyond words that you will not be performing in the Spring Show that you (and dozens more!) have worked so hard all year for. But, just remember: the destination is never as thrilling as the journey... and you, my love, have had quite a journey! Words cannot express my pride and confidence I have for you and your future ahead.

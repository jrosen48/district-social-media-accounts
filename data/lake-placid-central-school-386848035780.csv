ATTENTION ALL LAKE PLACID MUNICIPAL ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS:

All Lake Placid Municipal Electric customers will experience a power interruption that is estimated to last four hours, beginning at Midnight, September 16th and ending at 4:00 a.m. on Thursday, September 17th. Any changes related to the outage will be posted on the Village’s website and Facebook page.

This outage is necessary to transfer the incoming 115 Kilovolt transmission line to a new receiving structure at the Lake Placid Municipal Electric Old Military Road Substation. Should a problem on Lake Placid Municipal Electric owned 115 Kilovolt system occur, recent upgrades should result in fewer customers being affected, for shorter durations of time.

Today the Governor gave all NY schools the green light to reopen. We are excited to see students again in September.

The Governor also asked that each school provide families with the following information, most of which is already posted in our formal reopening plans:
• What is our remote learning plan? In particular, how do we address questions of equity?
• How will we meet the NYS Department of Health guidelines on COVID testing?
• How will we arrange for contact tracing should a student or staff member test positive?

We will be posting specific answers to these questions on our website in the coming days.

In addition, we will be offering three live online discussions about our reopening plans. These are intended to provide parents with information about reopening and answer any questions. We will offer a separate but similar discussion for teachers.

Thank you for your patience and support as we work through the challenges of reopening the Lake Placid Central School District.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10158278353200781&id=386848035780,,0.0,"Dear Lake Placid School Community –

Happy June! To date our staff and faculty have been planning for the end of the school year, with Friday June 12th unofficially scheduled as last day of school for students and staff. On Tuesday the Board of Education will vote on calendar changes making the final day official. We hope there will be no late-breaking changes from the Governor’s office. Summer recess will begin after that. Congratulations to all of our students, staff, and families, for all you have accomplished in the face of so many challenges during this historic and unique school year. Enjoy all of the end-of-year celebrations, banners, signs, and parades honoring students throughout the month of June. We will be working hard to prepare the schools for reopening in the fall, and – fingers crossed – I hope to see everyone back at school in September.

Sincerely,

Dr. Roger Catania, LPCSD Superintendent",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10158075357525781&id=386848035780,,0.0,"Dear LPCSD Students, Families, and Community Members –

Repost: original was taken down.
May 1st is the traditional College Decision Day. Although Anya was offered merit based scholarships from St Lawrence and University of Rochester and was accepted to RPI, the college she most wants to attend is the University at Buffalo to pursue a Bachelors in Environmental Design. Please join me in congratulating her on her tremendous accomplishments thus far:

4.0 GPA with Membership to the National Honors Society Varsity Cross Country Captain
President of the LPHS Environmental Club
Leader and Speaker at the ADK Youth Climate Program

In addition to all this, she has worked since she was able to get working papers and racked up over 269 hours of volunteer work!

Like all seniors, she is missing many milestones that we all took for granted like Prom, Graduation and Senior Prank Day. If you would like to send her a personal greeting or congratulations you can send them to:

Our school calendar continues to change in response to the ongoing crisis and the Governor’s executive orders impacting the school year. Because the orders require us to use all remaining vacation and snow days, we will now be in session this Friday, May 22nd. This is a change. All remote learning activities will continue on that day. However, the following Monday, May 25th, is Memorial Day, which is a federal holiday. School is officially closed for the day, so no classes will be held. I encourage everyone to celebrate with flags and family barbecues, and by remembering those who died in service to our country. Happy Memorial Day! And best wishes to everyone as we approach the end of this unique and challenging school year.

The Governor’s Executive Order has directed all school districts to continue alternative instructional options during the period we had originally set aside for spring break (April 6 – April 17). Today I want to let you know how we intend to alter our approach to at-home learning throughout this 2-week period. Each school has developed a project-based activity or series of activities that we hope will provide students and families with a more engaging and creative approach to learning. During this time we hope that students will read, think, create, get outside, and set aside their devices for at least a part of the day. Schools will make sure that expectations are appropriate for every age and grade level, and that teachers and support staff will be available to help and guide students along the way. You can expect more details from the principals at each school. We hope that your families are healthy and safe. Thanks to all of you for your feedback, encouragement, and support.

Saluting the seniors of Western New York",6.0,"Buffalo News photographer Mark Mulville kept track of the stats:
Almost 80 schools.
Nearly 350 students.
VERY close to 2020 miles (it was 2008 miles when all was said and done.)
Over the course of 15 days.

His task was to compile photographs a few seniors from each area high school, capturing this moment in time for a BN Salute to Seniors which runs through Saturday, June 20.
These are Lake Shore's Featured Seniors in the Buffalo News Salute to Seniors ... scroll through the gallery to find their photos!

“Some parents called them about our senior lawn signs,” says Leadership in Action/Student Government teacher Jeff Connors. “This was the brainchild of seniors Jadyn Jones, Maela Murtha, and Gretchen Hazard (and Mrs. Styles and Mrs. Hazard).”
“Student Government simply paid for them, as we figured it was the least we could do for our seniors,” he continues. “The next best part is that Jamie Allen (Class of '86, Austin and Tabitha's Dad) was able to make them for us with no notice and for a great price.”

“So far, 157 of these are gone, but we have enough for all 212 kids. Families may pick up at Connors; they are set next to the restaurant. It is pretty awesome to drive around Evans, Brant and the Seneca Nation and see these around! Take a drive and see!”

Maybe the house was finally quiet of the other siblings. I feel they shouldn’t stress over a schedule, although I know structure is very important. During this time, my tip is for them to do what works for the family seeing they’re all in this together 24/7. Once the kids get back to school, they will fall back into a routine quickly.

Choose 1 or 2 subjects a day. Try to accomplish as much as you can on those days. Ignore the other subjects' assignments & emails & REMIND messages until the day you've chosen for those subjects...then check those things out. (DON'T delete the messages, just refer to them when it’s their turn, so to speak)
Also, at least for me...have your child keep in touch with the teacher of each subject. We're waiting to hear from them. (NOTE: I am a middle school teacher and only teach one subject, so my class is different than an elementary teacher.)

Over the next few weeks, many of us will be stuck at home and if you have young children it can be hard to find things to do all day....

As we know....our community is THE BEST!!!! Let's show our ""LOVE"" for one another, in a fun and creative way!!!!

All you have to do is put a heart in your front window. That's it! Color it, paint it, cut it out, or print from your printer (another project for your kids). We can walk around (or even bike or drive) to see how many Eagle hearts we can find, get fresh air and not think of the stresses around us.

PS. Many local communities are doing similar projects..... so let's join in on the fun!!!! We are all in this TOGETHER!!!

Madden has two kinds and practiced wearing each which was great because he determined that there is one that he definitely prefers over the other as far as not getting as hot 🥵 & easier to hear him!

Learning the words ""triangle,"" ""square,"" and ""circle"" are NOT the most important concepts for toddlers to learn.

However, toys like shape sorters, puzzles, and blocks CAN help teach important concepts like LIFE SKILLS!

YOU show your toddler how to take the circle piece and mistakenly try to put it in the triangle spot.
YOU show your toddler how to try again and not give up.
YOU show your toddler how to successfully place the object where it is supposed to go! 🏆

Of course, be sure to make appropriate noises and facial expressions as you demonstrate this basic, but very important, life lesson. 😃👏",0.0,"Let's Play: the speech and language way

Pretend play or make-believe has an important place in a young child’s development. Through play your child will develop language & communication skills, empathy & understanding of others, imagination & thinking, and physical movement skills. Preschoolers don’t need special toys for imaginary play; they can play with a few household items such as
Large plastic crates or a large, empty box for creating a ""home""
Old clothes, shoes, backpacks, hats
Old telephones, phone books, magazines
Cooking utensils, dishes, plastic food containers, towels or napkins

Feeling estranged from your own child is painful.

Research indicates the most important predictor of a child’s emotional and psychological stability is the closeness of the parent/child relationship. If your child is not opening up when they are upset, the relationship may not be as close as it needs to be. There are two habits that parents routinely engage in that shut down communication and drive a child away: negating feelings and mistaking sympathy for empathy.

In many cases, honoring your child’s feelings is all they need to feel better. Simply knowing their parent understands allows them to feel secure and forge ahead. Some sympathetic statements, on the other hand, disrupt any chance of emotional attunement, instead of helping them work through their difficult feelings.

This super simple and super fun activity targets so many important developmental skills.....another win for painter’s tape!!!

2. Fine Motor — using the hand/finger muscles to peel the ends of the tape

3. Gross Motor — doing the activity on a vertical surface to strengthen the neck and shoulder muscles

If you’re not exactly the most athletic person like me (no, it is NOT a prerequisite for PTs to be good at sports), you might find practicing ball skills on the bottom of your priority list.
.
.
However, these skills actually target many others like visual tracking, balance, directionality, timing and response times, depth perception, and upper/lower extremity coordination.
.
.
Well, there’s no need to panic over ball practice-this activity is so easy to set up and targets all those important skills!
.
.
To advance this activity try one of these:
1. Time the child and then encourage him to beat his score.
2. Have tap the balloon with only one hand and place the other hand behind his back.
3. Have him balance on one leg as he throws the balloon and catches it.",0.0,"Tots On Target

Dear Families,

The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH), in partnership with the Minnesota Department of Education, continues to fine tune the definitions that guide the childcare services we provide families. Current guidance is that we can provide childcare for Tier 1 and Tier 2 workers in the event that both parents/caregivers are working out of the home. This includes children 5 years (kindergarten) through 12 years of age who are enrolled in our district and would normally attend classes during this time. If a parent/caregiver is in the home, best practice is to keep children home. In this way, we can follow MDH ratio requirements and provide the safest and healthiest environment possible for our children and staff. According to the MDH, “The care for children of these workers is intended for extreme circumstances in which no parent or guardian is available to care for a child due to employment as a critical worker.”
Thank you for following this guidance during these uncertain times.

The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH), in partnership with the Minnesota Department of Education, continues to fine tune the definitions that guide the childcare services we provide families. Current guidance is that we can provide childcare for Tier 1 and Tier 2 workers in the event that both parents/caregivers are working out of the home. This includes children 5 years (kindergarten) through 12 years of age who are enrolled in our district and would normally attend classes during this time. If a parent/caregiver is in the home, best practice is to keep children home. In this way, we can follow MDH ratio requirements and provide the safest and healthiest environment possible for our children and staff. According to the MDH, “The care for children of these workers is intended for extreme circumstances in which no parent or guardian is available to care for a child due to employment as a critical worker.”
Thank you for following this guidance during these uncertain times.

Calling all Junior Rangers! This Wednesday, April 1st at 12:00 pm PDT, join us as Mount Rainier National Park and the Washington National Parks Fund go on a virtual field trip to explore what it would be like to be a park ranger.

This 30 min field trip is perfect for kids PreK-3rd grade or the young at heart. Education Ranger Annie will read the book If I Were a Park Ranger by Catherine Stier. The book features a diverse cast of children who talk about all of the things they could do if they were a park ranger. After reading the book, Ranger Annie and Ranger Julie will hold a Q&A about what it’s like to be a park ranger at Mount Rainier National Park.

Follow the link to sign up. https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_Bdm2lWjKR4OM9IX3fo9ioA

Calling all Junior Rangers! This Wednesday, April 1st at 12:00 pm PDT, join us as Mount Rainier National Park and the Washington National Parks Fund go on a virtual field trip to explore what it would be like to be a park ranger.

This 30 min field trip is perfect for kids PreK-3rd grade or the young at heart. Education Ranger Annie will read the book If I Were a Park Ranger by Catherine Stier. The book features a diverse cast of children who talk about all of the things they could do if they were a park ranger. After reading the book, Ranger Annie and Ranger Julie will hold a Q&A about what it’s like to be a park ranger at Mount Rainier National Park.

Follow the link to sign up. https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_Bdm2lWjKR4OM9IX3fo9ioA

Solitary play IS an important type of play - but should not be the only type of play a child engages in. This is important for parents to know because 1. We should not be entertaining or playing/working with our kids at all times, and also 2. We should be playing with our kids SOME of the time. I will also add that this is a very complicated time and many families have many more important things to take care of at the moment like rent and food. The amount of time we play with our kids WILL and SHOULD be dependent on our circumstances- so please do not feel guilty if this is not a priority. Hugs and take care all ❤️❤️",0.0,"Balance!

Not much is as hard as sitting with uncertainty. And we are in a time right now of extreme uncertainty and worry.

There's not one big thing to do in moments like these, but rather lots of little things to help manage our anxiety and reduce the impact of our anxiety on the others around us.

Remember: also contagious is your mindset about the coronavirus, and we want to protect our kids from doomsday thinking and panic spirals.

So, here's a list of ideas, to manage our own anxiety and to help our kids make sense of what's happening around them.

When a child’s emotions get big, they need the adults in their life to stay with* them to help soothe them: co-regulation. The part of the brain in charge of emotion regulation (prefrontal cortex) is very poorly developed in children under seven and hardly developed it all in children under five… In fact it’s not done developing until you’re almost 30 years old !!!

When her toddler began melting down in the store (this) mom grabbed the umbrella from her purse just to serve as a distraction to the toddler long enough for her to quickly wrap up her shopping. What happened next was surprising and magical! The toddler settled in under the safety of the umbrella which dampened the overwhelming noise of the store, shaded her from the bright fluorescent lights above and reduced the visual stimuli around her. Her meltdown ceased! Mom reported she didn't have to rush, her daughter felt safe under her polka dot canopy and mom was able to finish her shopping without another scream or tear.

Thank you for following the drop-off procedures that went really well this morning. Please read below for updated pick-up procedures and a detailed map.

Parents picking up students will enter the pick-up line through the furthest (south) entrance of the main parking lot. Cars will be lining up by rows directed by traffic controllers. Each row will be directed to enter the pick-up line in the front of the building. No cars will be permitted to park and parents must remain in their cars.

We thank you for your patience as we find the best process for safely dropping off and picking up your children. Have a wonderful afternoon!

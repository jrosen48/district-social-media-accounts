Remember, someone else's experience won't necessarily be yours. Teachers come in all different packages and personalities, just like all parents and students.

Request a Free Bed

July 18, 2018 at 10:02 AM ¬∑

The Maumee Valley chapter of Sleep in Heavenly Peace (SHP) is taking applications for beds.

Children between age 3 and 17 who do not have a bed and live in Northwest Ohio are eligible to receive a free bed, complete with mattress, sheets, comforter, and pillow. You can request beds for your family or you can refer someone who you know that needs a bed. Requests must be made on the website: https://www.shpbeds.org/request-bed

SHP is a non-profit 501¬©3 relying on donations for funding and all beds are built by volunteers on ‚ÄúBuild Days‚Äù. Their first build day will be July 21 from 9 a.m.-noon at the Whitehouse Campus of CedarCreek Church.

Lake Local Schools was one of the two examples (Licking Valley being the other) in the state of Ohio she shared as schools being proactive and on right path. On Tuesday May 22nd Chris visited our campus to observe our morning routine and our approach to school safety.

Each one of our staff members should be commended for consistently working towards keeping our students and buildings a safe place.

Quick back-to-school reminder When you receive your child's teacher assignment in the next few weeks, be kind and remember that social media spreads far and wide. Even the simple question of ""Does anyone know anything about Mr/s. So-and-so?"" can lead to a firestorm of opinions that may not all be positive. Remember, someone else's experience won't necessarily be yours. Teachers come in all different packages and personalities, just like all parents and students. I'm sure you wouldn't want the teachers asking all our cyber friends what they know about your child as a student or you as a parent, and using those opinions to determine how the year will go. Extend the same courtesy to your child's teacher, get to know him/her, ask questions, and give him/her a chance. You may find that the teacher you heard was __________, was exactly what your kiddo needed.

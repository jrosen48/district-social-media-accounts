Let us not forget...

On this night 19 years ago 246 people went to sleep in preparation for their morning flights. 2,606 people went to sleep in preparation for work in the morning. 343 firefighters went to sleep in preparation for their morning shift. 60 police officers went to sleep in preparation for morning patrol. 8 paramedics went to sleep in preparation for the morning shift of saving lives. None of them saw past 10:00 a.m. Sept 11, 2001.

In one single moment life can change forever. Tonight as you go to sleep in preparation for your life tomorrow, kiss the ones you love, snuggle a little tighter, and never take one second of your life for granted.

There was a pause.

""Do you want to talk about it?"" asked Piglet.

""No,"" said Pooh after a bit. ""No, I don't think I do.""

""That's okay,"" said Piglet, and he came and sat beside his friend.

""What are you doing?"" asked Pooh.

""Nothing, really,"" said Piglet. ""Only, I know what Difficult Days are like. I quite often don't feel like talking about it on my Difficult Days either.

""But goodness,"" continued Piglet, ""Difficult Days are so much easier when you know you've got someone there for you. And I'll always be here for you, Pooh.""

And as Pooh sat there, working through in his head his Difficult Day, while the solid, reliable Piglet sat next to him quietly, swinging his little legs...he thought that his best friend had never been more right.""

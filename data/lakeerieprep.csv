This year has brought its share of ups and downs , surprises and challenges . One thing that remained consistent was our sense of duty to our scholars and overall sense of family and community .

From the first day of school to the last our falcons from the oldest to youngest guide our thoughts and actions . No one school is perfect and we are far from it . Yet , we strive to continually uphold the expectations of Respect-Responsibility- Relentlessness; to keep our eye on the goal of education for all .

Our 8th grade falcons will leave our nest today and begin their next phase at various high schools through out the county . Our youngest falcons made a HUGE step from kindergarten to First grade .

We stopped by each and every one of their homes today to congratulate them!

Tears -smiles -laughter and love were in abundance.

PILLARS are used as a support or foundation structure for a building. They are what keeps a building standing. At LEP we believe in the Three Pillars ~ RESPECT – RESPONSIBILITY – RELENTLESSNESS. Without them our foundation would not stand the test of challenges and obstacles that life places in our path.

Respect – Treat others the way you want to be treated.
Responsibility – Do what you HAVE to do now to do what you want to do later.
Relentlessness – Never give up!

Falcon Families

A river cuts through rock not because of its power but because of its persistence. One of our 3 Pillars at LEP is RELENTLESSNESS… meaning we NEVER give up. We meet challenges head on and try again, aiming for growth not perfection each time.

Tell your scholars to be relentless in their pursuit of greatness! Challenge them to read 20 more minutes a day, try the extra math problem that seemed difficult before, learn that new dance that everyone is doing and simply HAVE FUN!
Remind them to never give up on themselves and uphold the expectations as a Falcon.

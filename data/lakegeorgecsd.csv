Lake George French 12 students and Schroon Lake French students practiced their language skills together during a French Immersion Day at the Hillview Library in Diamond Point.

The students and their teachers were welcomed warmly by their host, Mrs. Louise Higgins, a fluent speaker, and Librarian Mrs. Graves. Mrs. Higgins and Mrs. Graves prepared an authentic French lunch for the students to enjoy.

Madame Higgins shared her own experience and memories as a bed and breakfast owner in Jugon-les-lacs, located in Brittany, France. After, students did presentations – all in French – about the culture and history of specific areas of France they had researched.

Day #13: #FreeHugsFebruary #Challenge

Wow! Did I meet an amazing individual today. From the moment I arrived at Lake George Jr.-Sr. High School she brought immediate #JOY to my day. Throughout the day we connected and her positive attitude was contagious!

I have no choice but to give today's #FREEHUG shirt to Ashlyn McChesney for making my day even better than it already was! This young woman is truly going to #ChangeTheWorld with her #Attitude. Reminds me of what the great #WilliamJames said:

""The greatest discovery of my generation is that a human being can alter his/her life by altering their attitudes""

We can all learn from this incredible woman!

Thanks #Syracuse!

Day #13: #FreeHugsFebruary #Challenge

Wow! Did I meet an amazing individual today. From the moment I arrived at Lake George Jr.-Sr. High School she brought immediate #JOY to my day. Throughout the day we connected and her positive attitude was contagious!

I have no choice but to give today's #FREEHUG shirt to Ashlyn McChesney for making my day even better than it already was! This young woman is truly going to #ChangeTheWorld with her #Attitude. Reminds me of what the great #WilliamJames said:

""The greatest discovery of my generation is that a human being can alter his/her life by altering their attitudes""

We can all learn from this incredible woman!

Thanks #Syracuse!

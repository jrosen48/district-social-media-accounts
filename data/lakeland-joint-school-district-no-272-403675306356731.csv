Due in large part to the generous support of the patrons of the Lakeland Jt. School District and the passage of our Supplemental/Instructional Levy, we are thrilled to announce that beginning fall of 2017 we will offer a full-day program for every kindergartner. During the 2016-17 school year the district piloted a full-day program and targeted students who were identified as ‚Äúbelow grade level‚Äù using the Fall Idaho Reading Indicator. The students who participated in the full-day program out-performed their peers in the traditional kindergarten program. Based on the evidence from the data gathered, the decision was made to ask voters to support the full implementation of this program. We are excited about the future of public education in the Lakeland Jt. School District. Great things are coming our way! Early registration for kindergarten will be held Thursday, May 18th at each of our elementary schools from 9:00 ‚Äì 3:00.

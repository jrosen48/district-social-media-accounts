To support AP students affected by school closures due to COVID-19, students and schools will have access to live AP review lessons, delivered by AP teachers from across the country. Lessons will begin March 25.

During this challenging time, we will work to give every AP student the opportunity to earn the college credit and placement they‚Äôve been working toward all year while maintaining a focus on the health and safety of our AP community.

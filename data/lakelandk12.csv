We had a student whose work has been recognized nationally in the Scholastic Art Awards. All of the gold key winners from the Brooks Museum competition we entered in December are sent from the regional competition to the national competition. 7th grader, Nada Daas, won a silver key nationally for her Scratchboard piece!

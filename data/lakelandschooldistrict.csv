Eight debaters from the Lakeland Central School District Debate Team competed in a six-round Georgetown online tournament on Friday, April 3, and Saturday, April 4, from the comfort of their own homes.

Four hundred and fifteen students from 55 schools in 21 states and two countries (Canada, Korea) competed in the event. Alanalee Huges (Panas) and Gurmerha Bawa (Lakeland) finished with a 3-3 record and lost in the first elimination debate, as did Liam Webb (Lakeland) and Jeremy Carbo (Lakeland). Jenna Bashjawish (Lakeland), Izabella Widulski (Lakeland), Edwin Anthony (Lakeland), Ilan Villard (Lakeland), also participated, and Ethan Warren (L) judged Middle School Debates.

Jenna was the tournament’s third-best overall beginner speaker. Ilan and Liam judged part of the middle school elimination debates.

It was a fun challenge to have 110 rooms simultaneously scheduled and rescheduled online throughout the entire weekend. The students are now preparing for an online competition in early May.

Lakeland Community,

While we understand how closed in people are feeling and that fresh air can be helpful, this cannot take place on school fields at this time. Schools have been closed by executive order, and that includes our fields as well. Please walk around your neighborhood, ride bikes but do not plan to congregate at the schools. Starting in the next day or two construction will start back up at Lakeland High School and this is another reason we must prohibit pedestrian traffic. The grounds will be posted as they are after hours. I regret deeply having to make these announcements as I know we all love being outside, and I know how much our students miss seeing with their friends. But the directives have been issued, and we all need to respect them. Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

The books include Scythe (2016), Thunderhead (2018) and the latest The Toll (2019). That book was released the day he appeared at the middle school and students were able to get copies of the book at a discounted price and have them autographed.

Students will begin to recognize their role in what’s going on.” Connors said.

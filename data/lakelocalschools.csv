The book fair is all set up and ready for the kiddos. Thank you to everyone who helped.

Preview days are Friday and Monday. Look at your child’s flyer to see what day they will be shopping.

Annual Grand Event is Thursday March 5th from 5 -7pm. It’s a great opportunity to shop as a family, purchase a gift from a teacher’s wish list or hit up grandparents. 🙂

We still need volunteers to help! Use the link below to sign up.

BGSU academic summer camps are open and accepting applications.

Summer camps are one of the first ways that students can get a feel for a particular major or interest, which is why we spend months coming up with offerings that will appeal to this generation. This year, we will have more than 20 camps, including coding, forensic science, fitness, music medicine, media production, vet science, business and much, much more.

Summer is a great time for students to explore majors and career interests. Some camps are overnight for students to get that experience away from home, while others allow for commuting back and forth each day. Each camp is designed to expand a student's world view, but also to give him or her experience on a college campus.

Happy Sing-Along Saturday! I’m a little late with this one.

Here is Big Bear Mountain by one of my current favorite bands Jr Jr.

The original ends with an instrumental outro and the 5th grade classes and I were ending with the final lyrics and it sounded a little clunky but still fit better than me playing a 20 second outro with no one singing at the concert. One of our fifth grade students Mia Jones, went home and worked on an ending that made it sound more like the end without a musical outro and it sounds great, so I included it here.

Teacher Talk (featuring Roz Mermell, recorded on 01/16/90)

Dragon Broadcasting at Lake Orion High School
March 29 at 5:14 PM ·

Some sad news to share: Ms. Roz Mermell passed away overnight. Roz was a long-time former LOCS staff member (and mother-in-law of current Board member Dana Mermell). Superintendent Marion Ginopolis wrote ""Many of you may not have known Roz, but she was a huge influence on so many of our former students. For many years, Roz was the substance abuse prevention advisor for LOCS and ran all the clubs and activities for students to make good decisions (SADD, positive peer influence) and volunteered in our LOHS RealTalk program on numerous occasions after her retirement.""
In honor of Ms. Mermell, our only ""FROM THE ARCHIVES"" post today is an episode of ""Teacher Talk"" when she was the guest from 1990. Please enjoy this flashback episode, and keep her family in your thoughts.

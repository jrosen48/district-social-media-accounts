Children’s Defense Fund-Ohio, along with a working group of anti-hunger and children’s advocates and in partnership with the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services and the Ohio Department of Education, is working to raise awareness about the program to families.

I am Hailey Blanchard and I am a senior at Millersport High School. After I graduate, I plan to attend Ohio University and double major in Spanish and Spanish Education. Coming up with a favorite memory of my high school experience is nearly impossible. I have found something special in every single day. However, with that being said, a few of my favorite memories include Christmas caroling through the halls with Mr. Keener, doing a scavenger hunt through the school in A.P.

It was an enriching educational trip as students learned about Ohio's government and how it works to serve all of our eighty-eighth counties.",2020-03-09 08:46:23,,

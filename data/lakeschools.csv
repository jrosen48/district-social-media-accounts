QUESTION FOR PARENTS: We've seen and heard lots of parent conversation suggesting an option that would have one group of students come to school two full days a week (Monday and Tuesday, perhaps) and then do virtual school the remaining three days. Another group at the same school would come a different two days (Thursday and Friday) and then do virtual school the other three days. That would lessen the number of students in the buildings at any given time and give us Wednesday for a full day of deeper cleaning. I see how that could work in middle and high school, but what about elementary school? Would it create a child-care problem for most parents? Would it be better to have elementary students come to school M, T, Th and F, and have only Wednesday at home for virtual learning? Curious to hear your thoughts.

TMS PATRIOT Max Grinnell has been creating thank you boxes for mail carriers, Publix workers, Lake County Sheriff Office, and nurses & staff and a local hospital. Basically ""all the people who are keeping our world running right now"", Said Max. Creating an iced coffee and baking muffins to then deliver to people with a note that says ""thankful for you."" The outside of the box says ""barista in a box"". The design on the cup says ""#IAmEssential"" He has done this every week since the break. Pretty amazing! 🌠This PATRIOT is an amazing student.

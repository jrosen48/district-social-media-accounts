We want to express our heartfelt appreciation for all the comments, messages, phone calls, and kind words from everyone. When we got word on Sunday about the school closure we immediately started planning, organizing, and preparing for something we had never experienced. However, we have kept our 2 main goals in mind:
1. Get meals to the kids by any means necessary
2. Minimize contact to keep us, our school, and our community safe

Tuesday afternoon we were exhausted and worried if we were doing enough, but your feedback is the fuel that keeps us going! We are completely humbled by how many kids NEED and appreciate these meals.

We will continue to be here this week and now through spring break as well!
Pick up meals between 9am-12pm (or later if needed) behind LMS underneath the basketball goals.
If you do not have transportation to LMS please call 501-262-1880 and choose ‚Äúfood service‚Äù for delivery options.

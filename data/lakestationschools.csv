To Our Seniors,

We wish the end of your senior year was different. We wanted the opportunity to watch you enjoy all the joyous activities that occur at the end of your senior year. Since the situation doesn't allow us to do as planned, just like with anything in life, we adjust. To let you know we are thinking of you, and are proud of you, we will be delivering this yard sign to your home in the next week or so!!! We are also thinking of other ways we can honor and celebrate you so continue to check your email for updates. As for graduation, we are waiting a few more weeks before we decide what type of graduation ceremony we will be having to honor you, but rest assured no matter what, we will be having something memorable to celebrate your accomplishments!!

Learning Lab: Extreme X-Rays and Particle Accelerators

Chemistry students in Mr. Ness' class at Edison participated in a Learning Lab at Argonne National Laboratory. Student teams designed a magnetic linear accelerator using a Gauss gun. They investigated concepts in magnetism and energy transfer, collected data, and optimized their design based on previous results. By observing relationships and patterns in their data, students made thoughtful modifications in a friendly competition to see which team can achieve the greatest acceleration.",2020-02-11 11:52:46,,

I would like to give a big congratulations to all of my students who have participated in choir and band solo and ensemble over the past 2 weekends! We had students from grades 7-12 participate and have a total of 6 students who competed at the highest level of competition and will be going on to State in Indianapolis. They are listed below. :) We may be a small school but going to events like this proves our kids can compete against the big schools and are just as hard working and talented. Way to go and congrats to all 30 students who made Edison proud! ❤

Truth bomb from our state superintendent Dr. Jennifer McCormick!

Who is REALLY to blame for the lack of MONEY for teacher pay (and nurses, counselors, social workers, bus drivers)? The STATE holds the pursestrings. They spent $160 million on vouchers last year on vouchers to schools that can openly discriminate! How much did the virtual charter school flush down the toilet when they cheated Hoosier taxpayers? How much is it we waste on testing? Where does the money go? Let's talk accountability, shall we?

Attached you will find a calendar for the activities happening for our students throughout the week of March 23rd. Please encourage your child to check their Advisory Google Classroom for announcements and event details.

The daily schedule shown is a suggested routine for your child to follow. Your child is welcome to work at the times that work best for your family, but we have found most of our students are following a pattern similar to what is shown. Please know our staff will be available for office hours each morning at 9:00 a.m. unless they have a family or medical commitment.

Finally, your teachers wanted to leave you video messages to let you know what they’ve been up to and to check-in on how you’re doing. Use the link for FlipGrid to sign-in, watch their videos, and leave one in return! Any lakeviewlocal.org email will be able to access. I am moderating all videos and will not post content that is inappropriate- stay classy, Lakeview!

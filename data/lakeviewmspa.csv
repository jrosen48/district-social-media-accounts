I absolutely support giving our school districts direct control regarding their fall sports seasons and spectators in their stands.

That's why I am supporting House Bill 2787, which would give the authority to make those decisions to the school districts.

We’ve clearly seen that a one-size-fits-all approach does not work and is unfair to our rural communities to be lumped in with urban centers.

It’s time to give back local control and allow these schools to make these decisions, based on their own circumstances, to determine what will work best for them.

If you'd like to show your support for allowing spectators in the stands at PIAA events this year, please consider signing this online petition:

Sheetz Expands Free Meal Program to All 600 Stores

Sheetz is proud to announce the expansion of the Kidz Meal Bagz program providing free food to help children and families in need as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meal Bagz will be available at all 600 Sheetz locations and will be available daily, while supplies last.

The Meal Bagz include a turkey sandwich, chips and a drink. Families interested in taking advantage of the free program can go to any Sheetz location and ask an employee for a meal at the register or through the drive-through.

As we expand this program, our goal is to help feed those kids who are most in need. Through our first two weeks, it has been very hard to anticipate the demand at each store, but we are remaining connected to our communities in order to help as many people as possible. However, since this is a special item assembled by our supply chain and vendor partners, we do have limited quantities.

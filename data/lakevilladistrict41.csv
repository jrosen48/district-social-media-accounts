We are very sad to inform you that all parades today for Lake Villa schools are cancelled. This breaks our hearts as much as yours. We are committed to keeping everyone safe during these turbulent times and we need to keep our own first responders able to do their jobs.

We are so sorry, but in light of the recent social unrest and threats in Lake County, we have been in contact with our local police departments. We are very sad to inform you that all parades today for Lake Villa schools are cancelled. This breaks our hearts as much as yours. We are committed to keeping everyone safe during these turbulent times and we need to keep our own first responders able to do their jobs.

We are rescheduling our elementary parades to 11:30 a.m. and middle school to 12:30 p.m. on June 10th. We understand our children and staff need closure. We all want you to know we are in this together.

Dr. Lynette Zimmer

Dear Parents/Guardians:

Early this morning, one of our parents shared a social media message with the Palombi Middle School Principal. This message, that was shared with their son, contained a threat to students. After further investigation, this threat was made by an out of state student at an out of state school. The Lake Villa Police Department were contacted immediately and they have been in contact with the police department where the threat originated. Lake Villa Students were not the target of this threat.

The school district would like to thank this parent for bringing this information to our attention so quickly. We encourage all parents and students to immediately contact the school district and local police department in the event that a threat is made that would jeopardize the safety of our school community. Our goal is to continue to do everything within our capability to ensure the safety of our students and staff.

Sincerely,

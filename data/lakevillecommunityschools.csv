Hospital Supply Drive!

Local Hospitals have reached out to local school districts for donations and help collecting supplies.

Are you home on quarantine wondering what you might be able to do to help? Do you have some buyers remorse when you over purchased cleaning supplies and toilet paper during this unstable time? Do you have a couple bottles of hand sanitizer, clorox type wipes, safety glasses, face masks, and/or rubber gloves that you might be able to spare for our medical professionals on the front line helping to fight this Virus?

Well, If you said yes to any of the above, we will gladly collect what you have have available (minus the toilet paper), no matter the quantity. We will have a drive-up drop off collection site set up at the Middle School this Friday and this Friday only from 10-12. Once all items are collected, they will be delivered to Hurley Hospital on Behalf of LakeVille Community Schools.

Let's do our part to help those helping us!

I hope this message finds you healthy and well.

I wanted to address an article that was released by Bridge Magazine earlier this week. The article left us all with more questions than answers at this time. Though my gut says most of these items will become reality later this week when/if the Governor signs an executive order putting them into action, the information in the article is to be considered an opinion of the journalist.:

https://www.bridgemi.com/talent-education/whitmer-end-michigan-school-year-seniors-graduate-others-move

Once we have additional information and direction from the state, district leaders will be working to make the recommended changes. Until then, we will continue to provide learning opportunities and resources for you and your family.

Please continue to be patient, flexible and supportive.

Stay home, stay safe, and wash your hands!

Whitmer to end Michigan school year; seniors graduate, others move up",4.0,"Good Afternoon Falcon Families,

I hope this message finds you healthy and well.

I wanted to address an article that was released by Bridge Magazine earlier this week. The article left us all with more questions than answers at this time. Though my gut says most of these items will become reality later this week when/if the Governor signs an executive order putting them into action, the information in the article is to be considered an opinion of the journalist.:

https://www.bridgemi.com/talent-education/whitmer-end-michigan-school-year-seniors-graduate-others-move

Once we have additional information and direction from the state, district leaders will be working to make the recommended changes. Until then, we will continue to provide learning opportunities and resources for you and your family.

Please continue to be patient, flexible and supportive.

Stay home, stay safe, and wash your hands!

We have been asked by the Michigan Department of Education (MDE) to collect data in our district about access to technology and the internet. We will be sending out an automated phone survey around 3:00 today to families of current students. The survey has only three quick questions. Please plan to respond to this call. The survey should only be taken once for each household.

The MDE will be looking at this data to help determine and assist districts with online learning opportunities should our closure be extended. Though that has not been determined at this time, more importantly this information will help us to better meet the needs of our students and support our families.

Again, please plan to respond to the phone survey this afternoon. Also please share this message with families who might not see it here on Facebook.

Good evening everyone we're very excited to be offering a chance for boys and girls to play ball locally again/ all ages. Please be patient with us as we are in the beginning stages of putting this all together. We will be looking for coaches/sponsors and volunteers as there is many things that need done! Looking forward to a great season!",0.0,"Otisville Baseball/Softball

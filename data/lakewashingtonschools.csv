This include tables, doorknobs, light switches, counter tops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilet faucets, sinks, etc. First use soap and water to reduce the number of germs, dirt and impurities on the surface.

All Lake Washington School District (LWSD) students (grades Preschool-12) will be starting the 2020-21 school year learning in a fully remote setting.

Over the last week Superintendent Dr. Jon Holmen has been actively engaged with a number of entities as we evaluate our plans for school in the fall. As of today, LWSD will start the 2020-21 school year learning in a fully remote setting.

This decision is being made after a thorough review of available reports and local models. Additionally, Dr. Holmen and staff spent time discussing the current state of our community and county with the King County Department of Health. Given this and the limited guidance districts have received related to re-opening school in the fall; it was decided to start the school year in a remote model.

COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact (within about 6 feet) for a prolonged period. Spread happens when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks and droplets from their mouth or nose are launched into the air and land in the mouths or noses of people nearby. Since people can spread the virus before they know they are sick, it is important to stay at least 6 feet away from others when possible, even if you—or they—do not have any symptoms.

Meet Jayme BranaghLandon, our counselor at Benjamin Rush Elementary! Here's her wellness tip for the day:

“Set boundaries and prioritize. Many of us have work, family and school demands. Some of us have children and in some cases, multiple children in multiple schools. It is impossible to manage everything all the time. Set boundaries when you can. Be realistic with what can be accomplished. Some things will have to wait until the next day.

Make time for yourself. Can you take a few minutes to be alone? Take your dog for a walk, step out on your patio or deck and make time to read. Create your own space or routine, even if it is just a few short moments.

By taking time for yourself, you will find the ability to handle the stress and demands just a little easier.""",0.0,"Lake Washington School District added a new photo.

In the fall, the Green Team at Ella Baker Elementary School learned that students were not correctly sorting compost and recyclables during lunch. When too many materials are incorrectly sorted, the utility has to throw all of it into the trash.

The Green Team took quick action. They weighed the cafeteria waste in September and found that 100 pounds of lunch waste was going into the trash daily. In October, they made educational announcements and 3-D signs so students were aware of the problem and could see visually what should go where.

Green Team students and parent volunteers helped students learn to sort their lunch waste correctly. Now, food waste (compostables) account for about 70 pounds of lunch waste. Recyclables are about 10 pounds. About 20 pounds is going to the landfill each day. That’s 80 pounds less than when they started.

“‘To Market, To Market’ is a book that can be enjoyed by everyone. It combines beautiful pictures with meaningful words. Nikki McClure uses her unique cut-paper illustrations to tell a story about a mother and son and their weekly visits to a farmer’s market. As they check off items on their shopping list, readers will learn how each particular food was grown or produced, from its earliest stages to how it ended up at the market. This book explores themes including community, nutrition, hard work and living gentle on the planet. Nikki lives in Olympia, which gives the book a Northwest feel.”",0.0,"Lake Washington School District added a new photo.

If your children are experiencing stress or anxiety, remind them that adults are working to address this concern, and give them actions that they can take to protect themselves. Encourage them to stay home to stay healthy and to practice good hygiene:

1. Wash hands multiple times a day for at least 20 seconds. (Sing Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star slowly, which takes about 20 seconds.)

2. Cover mouth with a tissue when sneezing or coughing and throw the tissue away immediately. Another option is to sneeze or cough into the bend of an elbow.

3. Stay at least six feet apart from people when in public.

Meet Liz Haggerty, our librarian at Kirkland Middle School!

Her book recommendations are ‘This Was Our Pact’ by Ryan Andrews and ‘What I Carry’ by Jennifer Logo. Here’s what she shared about her favorite books:

""‘What I Carry’ is about a girl named Muiriel who is about to age out of the foster care system and she is determined to not build any relationships before then. Until she meets Francine and Kira, she gets the perfect job and meets Sean. It’s a beautiful and sad story and it’s written in honor of the author’s daughter who came to her from foster care.

‘This Was Our Pact’ is about a group of boys who have always been told the lanterns that are released once a year in their town’s river turn into stars.

Meet Liz Haggerty, our librarian at Kirkland Middle School!

Her book recommendations are ‘This Was Our Pact’ by Ryan Andrews and ‘What I Carry’ by Jennifer Logo. Here’s what she shared about her favorite books:

""‘What I Carry’ is about a girl named Muiriel who is about to age out of the foster care system and she is determined to not build any relationships before then. Until she meets Francine and Kira, she gets the perfect job and meets Sean. It’s a beautiful and sad story and it’s written in honor of the author’s daughter who came to her from foster care.

Let your children’s questions be your guide as to how much information to provide. You can listen to their concerns, fears and questions, but try to keep your responses factual and age appropriate to lower their stress and anxiety levels.

Remind them that adults are working to address this concern, and give them actions that they can take to protect themselves. This includes staying home, washing hands and keeping six feet apart from people when in public.

Meet Stephanie Johnson, our librarian at Ella Baker Elementary!

Her book recommendation is “The One and Only Ivan” by Katherine Applegate. Here’s what she shared about her favorite book:

""This book is the winner of the 2013 Newbery Medal for the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children. In this sweet story, narrated by Ivan the gorilla, readers will be brought into Ivan’s life in captivity, where he spent the past 27 years behind a glass enclosure in a shopping mall. There he watches television, paints and hangs out with his friends, Stella and Bob. But when a baby elephant named Ruby comes to join his enclosure, he begins to see his time at the mall through Ruby’s eyes. Ivan becomes very protective of Ruby and realizes that things need to change for the better. Katherine Applegate creates an unforgettable first-person narration of hope and friendship.""",0.0,"Lake Washington School District added a new photo.

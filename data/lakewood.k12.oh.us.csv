To clarify, the first thing to remember is the millage on the ballot is provided as an estimated average, “…estimated by the County Auditor to average over the repayment period of the bond issue”. With that said, the estimated average millage is 3.8 mills.

Based on the ballot language, 3.80 mills equals $0.38 for each hundred dollars of valuation. Valuation is defined as the “assessed valuation” of property. For a home, the assessed valuation equals 35% of the market value recorded by the County Auditor’s office.

For a home with a market value of $100,000, the assessed value is $35,000. ($100,000 x 35% = $35,000).

To calculate the cost of 3.80 mills, divide $35,000 by $100. So, $35,000/$100 = $350.00.

Then take $350.00 times the $0.38 or $350.00 x .38 = $133/year or $11.08/month.

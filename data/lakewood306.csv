It is with great enthusiasm that we announce Amanda Cote as the next principal of Lakewood Middle School. Amanda has been an assistant principal at Centennial Middle School in the Snohomish School District for the past five years. Prior to serving as an administrator, she worked in Snohomish, along with several other school districts around the United States, as a social studies and language arts teacher. She has had the privilege of working in several districts due to the fact that her husband served in the military.

Amanda was selected from a terrific pool of applicants and two experienced finalists.

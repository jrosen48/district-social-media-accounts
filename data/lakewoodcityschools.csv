Kathy Nortz* was a pioneer for Women's Sports. In 1977, her Freshman year, Girls Cross Country was not a sanctioned sport by the OHSAA, so she trained and ran with the boys. At invitational meets, Coach Nixon would enter her in the open race so she could compete in an official race. The following year, Lakewood High School instituted a girls cross country team. Kathy was a role model in the fledgling program and helped set the standard for its continued success. She was team captain, and LHS Most Valuable Runner.

Her coaching record in over 25 years at CWRU is outstanding.

Patrick had always enjoyed art class in elementary and middle school. So freshman year he signed up for an art class as he says, ""I wanted a period every day where there were no questions to answer. I wanted time to let my imagination run wild and have time to create."" That first high school art class fulfilled his goal and more. It nurtured a love for art that grew over the next four years, until Patrick could envision a future in art.

I really do wish you could all meet, in-person, the amazing young people that we are introducing you to on our page. I wish we could meet in-person the scores more that did not apply for our scholarships but that I know are out there in the class of 2020.

Happy Friday Ranger Nation!! It is time to meet another one of our students who have earned a LREF scholarship! Are you ready? We proudly introduce Sean Mahoney!

Sean is a true asset to Lakewood High School. His overall academic record is sparkling (3.93 GPA) but his story is more compelling than even those lofty numbers indicate.

Sean is a model of consistency. He always shows up on time, is always prepared for class, and turns in all assignments on time. He has not shied away from rigorous coursework but rather has taken numerous AP, advanced and CCP classes. Yet he still finds time to do volunteer work including helping with freshmen orientation, West Shore Young Leaders, H2O and St.‚Ä¶",0.0,"Congratulations, Sean!

The shields came from a partnership with Willoughby-Eastlake School of Innovation, which laser cut the plastic and donated additional shields. The Lakewood Polive Department will use them as well.

From Mr. Kozar: ""During these challenging times, it's crucial to support those in our community. As efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 continue and with the critical shortage of PPE, I'm glad I was able to do a little something to help our first responders here in Lakewood. If we're going to get through this time, we're going to have to be in this together!""

Today Governor Laura Kelly held a press briefing to announce Kansas Education Plans for the 2020-2021 school year. Joining her at the briefing was Dr. Lee Norman, Secretary for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment and Dr. Randy Watson, Kansas Commissioner of Education.

The briefing informed schools that on Monday, July 20, 2020, Governor Kelly will release an executive order requiring schools to delay opening until after Labor Day. It will also require daily temperature checks and masks to be worn.

We will know more on Monday after we review the exact wording of the order and will begin work on our specific reopening plan for USD 215 and will include a new academic calendar.

It’s always great to share the success of our students. Every year each grade level chooses one girl and one boy to win the citizenship award. It is always a very difficult decision because we have so many kids deserving of this honor. It is a really big deal and quite an achievement. Since we couldn’t have our awards assemblies, we had yard signs made. Principal Ray and some teachers went around to deliver the signs and inform the students and families of their accomplishment.

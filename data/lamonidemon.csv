Friday, Sept. 11th Lamoni will play a varsity football game @ Mormon Trail (Humeston) 7:00 p.m. The Mormon Trail district and surrounding area recently suffered the tragic loss of a three-year-old boy’s life. Tomorrow evening, they will be honoring this boy by wearing the color ""John Deere"" Green, his favorite color. The Lamoni school and community does a fantastic job supporting other small communities. We are asking for our Demon fans to show up in green shirts/attire in support of the entire Mormon Trail community as they try to cope with this loss.

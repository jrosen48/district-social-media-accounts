Today is Earth Day 2020!
Earth Day was a unified response to an environment in crisis — oil spills, smog, rivers so polluted they literally caught fire.
On April 22, 1970, 20 million Americans — 10% of the U.S. population at the time — took to the streets, college campuses and hundreds of cities to protest environmental ignorance and demand a new way forward for our planet.
The first Earth Day is credited with launching the modern environmental movement, and is now recognized as the planet’s largest civic event.

How can you celebrate Earth Day?
On Earth Day, take a walk or run through the neighborhood. Go alone and relish your solitude, enjoying the time for free thought or listening to a podcast. Or take advantage of the opportunity for quality time with your loved ones and stroll with your family and dog by your side. There are so many things you can do with your family, on Earth Day.

Just a quick update:

Governor Abbott announced today the extension of school district closures until May 4, 2020. We will continue to provide remote instructional materials as developed and implemented by each campus at least through May 4, 2020.

Meal services will continue to be provided as developed and implemented each day except for Good Friday, April 10, 2020. We will not be serving on that day but will all other days through at least May 4, 2020.

It is extremely important for our community to take this virus issue seriously but not lose common sense. Stay home, wash your hands, and limit large gatherings are all things we must do to help prevent the spread of this virus.

If your student or family member test positive for the virus, please contact me immediately at rascoec@lisdtx.org.

Thanks, and God bless Lampasas ISD and our great community.

As you may have heard, Governor Abbott has canceled all schools until April 3, 2020. All UIL activities have been canceled through at least May 4, 2020.

Lampasas ISD plans to continue the feeding and online instructional efforts as planned and communicated.

It is extremely important for our community to take this virus issue seriously but not lose common sense. Stay home, wash your hands, and limit large gatherings are all things we must do to help prevent the spread of this virus.

If your student or family member test positive for the virus, please contact me immediately at rascoec@lisdtx.org.

We ask that you continue to work with us as we work to provide for the needs of our kids. Thanks and God bless Lampasas ISD and our community.

It's been a while since my last Lancaster City Schools General Sherman Junior High School construction update. The construction companies building this great new facility have been very busy putting on the finishing touches! Teachers and staff have been moving in and getting things set up for the students' return in the coming weeks. Looks great!

Do you have a bunch of CD cases at home? If so, make them into a mini greenhouse! This is a great experiment to do with kids.
1. Use a old CD case and fill it up halfway with compost/dirt.
2. Place a few seeds in the case and close the case.
3.Tape (clear packaging tape works best) the bottom of the CD case closed. This will help keep water from leaking if you overwatered.
4. Lightly water your seeds and place them in a window. *note: a few drops goes a long way!
5. Optional: Using a piece of tape or address label, write the date and what you planted.
You can continue to reuse the CD greenhouse for multiple seedlings.

I love kids that show initiative. My euphonium student, Ben Jurecki, and his bandmate tuba player Murray Robertson, entertained in downtown Lancaster at noon playing my arrangements of patriotic duets. They aren’t easy works, so this performance required initiative to practice and prepare ON THEIR OWN. I was very pleased that our mayor and his wife stopped by to listen. I pray that these students and thousands of others like them get to return to a normal school setting and find ways to continue to keep the music alive!

Today we are spotlighting the new trail at John Bryan State Park near Yellow Springs. This trail features a unique tale of history and nature. “As an Oak Tree Grows,” written by G. Brian Karas, shares American history from the perspective of a majestic oak tree. The entrance to the trail is located behind the playground in the state park.

It's the end of an era. Lancaster City Schools former Thomas Ewing Junior High School building is coming down. The building served students on Lancaster's east side for decades. Voters approved a levy to build a new Thomas Ewing Junior High, which is now located on Sheridan Drive.

Last night was Senior Night for our Baseball, Softball, and Tennis seniors. The baseball and softball teams should’ve been on a quest for their third straight OCC Championship and making a deep tournament run right now. Very proud of the legacy’s these seniors have set for their programs. Thanks to all the seniors for what they’ve done for these three programs over their careers. Pictures were taken by individual family appointments. #granvillepike",0.0,"Lancaster High School

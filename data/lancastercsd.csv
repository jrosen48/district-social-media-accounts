The purpose of the survey, offered to stakeholders in seventeen Erie County school districts, was to inform the views of school superintendents as we participate in conversations about reopening school in September. The suvery feedback will be shared with the NYSED Reopening Task Force as well as with planning teams within our individual school districts.

We value the input and perspectives of our parents and staff members and the survey was one means for gathering that feedback while we await guidance from the Governor, State Education Department, and Department of Health. Final decisions about reopening will be made after the guidance is published.

Nearly 3300 stakeholders in Lancaster completed the survey.

The purpose of the survey, offered to stakeholders in seventeen Erie County school districts, was to inform the views of school superintendents as we participate in conversations about reopening school in September. The suvery feedback will be shared with the NYSED Reopening Task Force as well as with planning teams within our individual school districts.

We value the input and perspectives of our parents and staff members and the survey was one means for gathering that feedback while we await guidance from the Governor, State Education Department, and Department of Health.

""As a former student of yours, I wanted to be sure to give a shout out to you and your currently extremely talented, group of singers and performers! My mother and I went to Shea‚Äôs Performing Arts for the announcement of the 2019-2020 season. There was a play I had never heard of before called 'Come From Away.' Many we‚Äôre very excited to hear about it. Then out showed a huge group of performers to perform a song, which of course gets me interested. Then I find out the performers were from Lancaster High School, under the amazing direction of Gary Lee! My mother and I were very proud to see our alma mater in highlights like that!
Mr Lee, you have never lost your touch and everyone who‚Äôs ever worked with you knows you strive for the best only because you know the talent you‚Äôre always working with. So congratulations to all the students who performed and Mr Lee for guiding them to a great performance!""",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2084668818286115&id=739576096128734,"7 Eyewitness News WKBW

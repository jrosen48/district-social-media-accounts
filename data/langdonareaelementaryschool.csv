The first couple will come from the south side of the stage in Boyd Block, walk to the center of the stage to have their picture taken and then walk off the north side of the stage. Once they’ve had their picture taken, they will go to the west side of Main Street to minimize crowding. Once all the couples have been announced, Jayne Kitchin Will then draw all the prom prizes.

Each geographic area is sent a different center. For example Langdon residents received their survey packets (unless they use a PO Box).

I am monitoring the situation with the COVID-19 virus and associated issues. We are taking direct guidance from the governor and ND health department. Things appear to change hourly. It is vitally important that if your child is sick that you keep them home. Public school systems do not currently have the authority to offer online or off campus curriculum and count this as contact days for our students. Current guidance states that missed time must be made up in the following ways.
Making up the hours on planned Professional Development (PD) days, if the mandatory three PD days are already met;
Making up school time on Saturdays;
Extending the school day; or
Extending the school year.
If public schools are afforded the flexibility to offer content differently and the situation dictates that we do not hold school those avenues will be pursued.

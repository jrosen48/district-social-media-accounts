At Langtree, I participated in different clubs and sports. Mu Alpha Theta as a communications officer, Chick-Fil-A Leadership Academy (2018-19), National Honors Society, and Crosby Scholars of Iredell. I also played basketball and soccer for Langtree for the past 4 years. While playing basketball at Langtree, I was named to the PAC-7 All- Conference Team and All-Tournament Team. I was also named Charlotte Observer’s Player of the Week. Most importantly, I am the class valedictorian for the class of 2020.

My favorite high school memory is competing in state playoffs with the boys basketball team in 2018-19 season.

This Fall, I will be attending North Carolina State University to major in Business Administration with a concentration of Finance or Human Resource Management.

""Having a choice for your child’s education is one of the most valuable decisions you will ever make for your child.
Knowing that public schools were not going to work for my rising 6th grade, I began the journey of finding the best school that would benefit my son. Our journey brought us to Langtree Charter Academy 6 years ago. Throughout the past 6 years, I have been able to watch my son grow in more ways than I could imagine. His teachers have been incredible and have made sure to embrace his learning style, not the general mass. Our school is small and each student is looked at as an individual with different styles of learning. Safety for the staff and students has always been priority. I know that my choice for him was the right choice. Langtree will forever be the school that prepared him for college and the future.""

Kristina has been bowling since the age of 5, and since then has gained the title of the youngest female to bowl a 300 in North Carolina at age 12.

In my life through coaching and playing sports I have met people that I would not have, made friends with people I might not have known. It has opened doors and given me opportunities. I have experienced the ""thrill of victory"" and the ""agony of defeat"". My hope and goal for each player I coach or have coached is that is that they receive the same values and experiences that sports have given me. On to the tournament . Go Hornet's. Have a great Friday.

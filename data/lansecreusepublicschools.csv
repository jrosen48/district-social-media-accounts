Each and every day, the safety of students and staff remains the top priority of the district to ensure that we continually strive to provide a safe learning environment for everyone. In an effort to maintain the best environment for all, it is necessary to practice emergency drills throughout the year. With that being said, I would like to take a moment and share with you a video about a district wide safety drill that will take place on November 22, 2019 with all students and staff. Similar to other drills your children participate in throughout the year, this drill is also intended as practice in case of an emergency. Please take a minute to watch the video linked below, and feel free to contact your building principal with any questions.

Thank you and have a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday.

The cuts meant that our Rensselaer Park students couldn't safely return to school in person for the time being, so was there a point to decorating the sidewalks this year? YES!

Earlier this week we arranged for Rensselaer Park students and families to stop by the school and pick-up district-provided school supplies for their remote learning school work.

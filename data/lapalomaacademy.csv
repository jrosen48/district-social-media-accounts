Next week is ""Teacher Appreciation Week"". This is a great opportunity for our students to show their teacher how much they are missed. Every teacher I have spoken to has told me how much they wish they could be with their students. We all know that packets can never replace the classroom! So please give your teacher a boost, and let them know how much you care about them! Here is our schedule for next week's Teacher Appreciation Week.
Thanks!

May 8, 2018 at 7:39 PM ¬∑

We are devastated and shaking as we write this, but trying to be strong for Emma.

She is bleeding in her stomach due to Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) of both her liver and stomach. Her blood counts continue to go down every 2 hours. This is very bad as they are already critically low. She is bleeding internally in her stomach. Tomorrow, they will sedate her do a colonoscopy and endoscopy to try to stop the bleeds. Even if its stopped, it won't cure anything. GVHD happens because Emma's body is rejecting her bone marrow transplant. This can be fatal.

We are at a complete loss right now. We are so heartbroken. We are in absolute fear. We need a miracle. We cannot loose her. Im so so sorry Emma. You deserve so much more.",0.0,"Prayers For Emma

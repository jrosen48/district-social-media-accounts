Last evening the Larimore School Board met in special session. All board members were present. The board approved the following:

1. Rescheduled the start of classes to August 27. We were scheduled to start on August 20. Delaying the start of the school year will give more time for teacher professional development in the area of distant learning and the use of technology in the classroom.

2. Approved in-person learning to start the school year on August 27 and give parents, who are uncomfortable in sending their children back to the school or their child has a preexisting medical condition, the option to keep their children at home for distance learning. If parents opt for distance learning it is important that those children adhere to the school schedule while they are at home.

3. Approved the Reopening Plan. This plan is considered to be somewhat fluid as there will be a need for changes as we move forward.

Have a great weekend. Stay well and safe.

Dear Parents,

As you know last week Governor Burgum announced the K-12 Smart Restart guidelines to help North Dakota school districts plan for reopening this fall. In order to reopen, school districts must have a plan to restart and also update their distant learning plan. In order to develop a restart plan we need your help. Therefore, we are asking you to complete a survey. This information from this survey will help us formulate our restart plan and make necessary changes to our distance learning plan.

Good evening everyone,

Just a couple of items tonight. We will again start with the breakfast and lunch program this coming Monday, March 23. We had over 75 students served yesterday. Please call the elementary prior to 9:00 AM to tell us how many meals you need. You may pick up those meals between 11AM and 1PM. If you do not have transportation to the elementary school, call the elementary at 343-2249 and ask if we can deliver.

We will be watching our neighbor states to see if they begin to consider sheltering in place for all residents as they have now done in New York and California.

Lastly, one of the ways that my wife and I will try to help our restaurants and the folks who work there is to order more take out. We already order take out a couple of times a week so increasing that number will not only help our hospitality people, it will also save me from cooking. Until Monday, Be Safe!

All kindergarten, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd graders can practice for our program with the 7 songs in the ""Upload"" section.
I have rhythm practice playlists in three groups by grade level. But you can do them all for fun!
I have some of our favorite action songs, and a special group of songs and stories for St. Patrick's Day. I hope you enjoy some singing and dancing while we can't be together.
See you soon!!!!

This year, we decided to spearhead an effort to contribute letters to Macy's Believe Campaign! This morning in PEP, students worked on submitting letters to Santa Claus and for each letter we submitted Macy's donated to Make-A-Wish!

TODAY is National Believe Day, so Macy's is DOUBLING the donations! $2 for every letter submitted up to $2 MILLION. If you're interested, it's super easy to submit your letter- just follow the link below. They encourage letters from all ages. :)

On Thursday, we had a very special opportunity to have a visit from Ridge Hughbanks, National Central Region VP! There are 6 National Officers serving the over 650,000 members of FFA, so we were lucky to be one of the schools visited. Ridge taught us about teamwork, failure, persistence, and community development. Our FFA Chapter is very thankful to Ridge for visiting!",0.0,"Larimore FFA

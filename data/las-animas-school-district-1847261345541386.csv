One of the common questions visitors ask is ""Do you actually use the wagons?"" The answer is yes! Our oxen are used to pull each of our vehicles. Just like a car today, maintenance was important to keep the freight rolling along the Santa Fe Trail. You can see in the photograph that two Bent, St. Vrain, & Co. Employees are busy removing the wheels to make sure there is a proper amount of grease.

The green Conestoga will be leading our parade from the parking lot to the fort to kickoff our July 4th festivities!

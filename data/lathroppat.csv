I'm looking for some babies and children to participate in some gross motor assessment labs in the Pediatric PT course I teach at Rockhurst University this spring. I need babies age 0-12 months for the ‚ÄúBaby Lab‚Äù on 2/8 and children age 1-6 years for the ‚ÄúChild lab‚Äù on 2/22. Children and families will need to be there from 8:30-11:30. Two groups of DPT students will assess the child‚Äôs gross motor skills. The tests they will be performing are play-based and will involve lots of observation, interaction, and asking questions of parents/caregivers. Students will be looking at movement skills such as rolling, crawling, walking, running, jumping, and playing ball. Families usually find it interesting and the kids have a lot of fun! Children of ALL abilities are welcome. Message me if interested!",0.0,"https://www.facebook.com/kendragagnon/posts/10154919354419288

Hello Laurel Families, this is Dr. Larrimore with a very important community service announcement. Because their last visit was so productive, with nearly 700 people completing Covid-19 tests, this Friday, July 17th, from 9:00 AM until 1:00 PM, the Delaware Emergency Management Agency and the Delaware Division of Public Health will be returning to Laurel to conduct another round of Covid-19 tests in the parking lot of Laurel Middle High School.

Just like the first visit, no physician's order is required, and no appointment is needed. Registration is also not required, but recommended, as it helps to speed up the process.

Good Morning Laurel Families, this is Dr. Larrimore with a highly important message for parents of LMHS students.

Earlier this morning, a smoke-like smell seemed to be emanating from the LMS side of the building. All LMS students were placed in the gymnasium until we could locate the source of the smell.

As of this alert, the source of the smell has not been located and nothing other than a strong smell has been detected.

However, for precautionary measures, The Laurel School District has decided to close LMHS for the remainder of the day and evening. At this point, all bus contractors have been alerted and all buses are returning to LMHS.

We will begin dismissal at 9:45 am for both Laurel Middle and Laurel High School. If your son or daughter is a rider, you may pick them up at 9:45 am.

Hello Laurel Families, this is Dr. Larrimore with an important message.

Although the state highway department and other first responders have done an amazing job cleaning up after this morning’s tornado, I still have many concerns about returning to school tomorrow.

The area on Alternate 13, from Discount Land Road to Duck-In Deli, including east of that on Camp Road, is closed and will likely stay closed through tomorrow afternoon, making transportation for these students an impossibility. Additionally, many homes are still without electricity. Finally, I have concerns that continued winds tomorrow could blow storm debris back onto the roads, creating hazardous driving conditions for our bus contractors, our parents, and our young student drivers.

For these reasons, The Laurel School District will be closed tomorrow, Tuesday, April 16. All practices, games, and extracurricular activities are cancelled as well.

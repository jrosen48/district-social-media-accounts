As the global pandemic continues, the Laurel Leader-Call will be featuring community heroes who are taking action in the face of world-altering adversity.

Leander Bridges II, director of child nutrition for Laurel Schools, helped put together the district’s ongoing program that provides free meals for families and children in need. He and his teammates will be at Laurel High and Laurel Middle schools every weekday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. They currently serve about 2,000 meals per day.

“Right before spring break, the superintendent and I began making plans to continue serving our students,” Bridges said. “Our cafeteria ladies chipped in on this big time. The grab-and-go style allows us to maintain social distancing and keep the kids safe.”

Thank you, Leander Bridges II and the Laurel School District. We look forward to recognizing more of our local heroes in the days to come!

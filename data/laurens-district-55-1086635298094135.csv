Laurens Middle School students now have the chance to engage in some hands-on learning thanks to new science labs. The new science labs, which were celebrated at a ribbon-cutting event today, February 12, 2020, feature new technology including microscopes and a Promethean smart board, as well as modern desks and safety equipment. This is the first new building added to the Laurens Campus since it opened its doors as Laurens High School in 1953. The students are excited about all of the experimentation and learning that will be taking place in their new science labs.",0.0,"Laurens District 55 added 24 new photos.

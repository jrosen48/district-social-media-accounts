The West Laurens Raiders held their annual soccer banquet and senior night last night at Southern Pines. The players and their families gathered together one last time to honor each team member and seniors. Coach Nate Smith and Emory Davis remarked on the unfortunate ending of this past season, but emphasized on the many accolades the players had already achieved. Each senior present gave very moving speeches to culminate their experiences as part of the Raider Nation. We thank the coaches, parents and family members who tirelessly support these young athletes. It is during times like these that makes every teammate...every practice...and every game...so very important!!!

Some of you have even taken on additional roles to help father the fatherless. You will never truly know the impact you have made on that child’s life. To the ones who’s father is either estranged, deployed, displaced or deceased...hang in there. We understand how difficult today may be for you. We hope that you all find ways to celebrate today with lots of love, laughter and a whole lot more thankfulness. Happy Father’s Day from Laurens County Schools❤️ #teamlaurens #fathersday #thankfulforfathers #relationshipsmatter #rolemodels #growinggreatstudents #laurenscountyschools",2020-06-21 02:39:38,,

When you first walk into East Laurens Primary, you are greeted with beautiful smiles and a whole lot of love😁. That has just as much to do with the sweet ladies in the front office, as it does their sweet Principal, Mrs. Janelle Butler. She treats her staff and students like family, which makes her such a pleasure to work with. She will be an advocate for your child, because their academic success is her top priority. Thank you Mrs. Butler for always working to make sure our Little Falcons shine brightly!!💎🖤💛📚 #teamlaurens #eastlaurensprimary #nationalschoolprincipalsday #shiningbright #growinggreatstudents #laurenscountyschools",0.0,"Laurens County School District added 11 new photos — at East Laurens Primary School.

On Easter, we would traditionally put on our Sunday’s best outfits to attend church with our family and friends. We would gather together to celebrate with good food, good fellowship and lots of fun. Eggs are painted and filled with candy for all the little neighborhood kids to find. And let’s not forget our obligatory Easter family photos.😁

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been placed in unprecedented positions. We are grieving the losses of our family traditions...our customs...and ordinary daily activities that give us great joy. Please be encouraged to know that this too shall pass. Our school district and community is comprised of a great number of believers, who will understand that as Jesus rose on the 3rd day...we too shall rise again!🙌🏽 Happy Easter Everyone!!!

Yesterday we received the devastating news that we will not be returning back to school for the remainder of this school year. That is not the news any of us wanted to hear; however, it is in the best interest for the safety of our state and country at this time. This news also brings about the difficult decision of having to cancel prom. I share in disappointment with each of you the reality of not having a prom this year, and there is no amount of words that I can write to express my state of disappointment.

I do look forward to the class of 2020 Commencement Exercises that will have to be rescheduled for a later date than the original date of Friday, May 22, 2020. Our compliance to what health and government officials are asking us to step up and do during these tough times will greatly increase our chances of being able to participate in a much anticipated and well deserved Class of 2020 Commencement Exercises at a later date. I pray that each of you are staying safe. I miss and love each one of you!

This news also brings about the difficult decision of having to cancel prom. I share in disappointment with each of you the reality of not having a prom this year, and there is no amount of words that I can write to express my state of disappointment.

I do look forward to the class of 2020 Commencement Exercises that will have to be rescheduled for a later date than the original date of Friday, May 22, 2020. Our compliance to what health and government officials are asking us to step up and do during these tough times will greatly increase our chances of being able to participate in a much anticipated and well deserved Class of 2020 Commencement Exercises at a later date. I pray that each of you are staying safe. I miss and love each one of you!

Educationally,
Dr. Otha J. Hall",2020-04-02 23:09:55,,

Today Mrs. Porter, Mrs. Padgett and myself took field trips (in separate cars to separate addresses) all over Laurens County. We took each of our amazing teachers and staff members a sweet treat and dropped it in their mailbox.

We ❤️ our ELE staff so much and we want each of you to know you are appreciated and greatly missed! Wish we could have hugged each of you!

As the nation celebrates the Vietnam War Veterans today, we want to make sure that our Laurens County School District Veterans know just how much they are valued and appreciated. They each represent various schools and positions within our district. Their time of service include the Vietnam War, Korean Conflict, Operation Desert Storm, Operation Desert Shield, Operation Iraqi Freedom(Iraq) and Operation Enduring Freedom(Afghanistan). They have families who have sacrificed right along with them. We work amongst these great men and women everyday without realizing the life stories they carry within. Please take the time to scroll through the pics below and thank a veteran. Because without them...there would be no us. 🇺🇸❤️

Most states celebrate “Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day” on March 29 or 30 of each year. Though there is some debate, March 29 is generally viewed as a more appropriate date. On that day in 1973, the last combat troops were withdrawn from Vietnam and the last prisoners of war held in North Vietnam arrived on American soil.

Hi everyone! Everything has been placed in a limbo and it has been a while since you ordered school (East Laurens Primary & East Laurens Elementary) and sports (DLCRA) pictures. Rather than holding these waiting on things to return to normal, we thought we’d offer a “drive-up window” for picture pickup tomorrow. I know this is last minute, so we’ll offer another date/time, so if tomorrow isn’t convenient, keep watching our page for another opportunity.

So, tomorrow, Saturday, March 28, from 10:00am until 1:00pm, we will be in the parking lot of what used to be Harvey’s Grocery Store (between McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts and in front of Home Depot). We will be in our white Ford Transit cargo van.

We will be practicing all social distancing precautions. Please remain in your vehicle and pull up to the van, give us your child’s name and we will hand you your child’s photos.

Please share this to help us get the word out! We have a TON of pictures to hand out!",9.0,"Drive-Thru Pictures Pickup tomorrow with Final Touch Photography!!!📸❤️

We appreciate the professionalism of the Georgia Department of Public Safety, as they conducted our annual bus inspections last week. Within three days, they had inspected 109 of our buses and we passed with flying colors!!

We must give credit where it is due. Our hardworking Transportation Department under the direction of Mr. Greg Pauldo, work countless hours to ensure that our buses are properly serviced. Normally, our 83 regular bus routes total 4500 miles per day. Even with school out, we have buses running 22 routes per day to deliver meals to students. That means our transportation crew is working each day. Help us thank them for all they do to keep our drivers and students safe on the roads. 🚌🏆🛠❤️ #teamlaurens #transportationdepartment #safetyfirst #georgiadepartmentofpublicsafety #growinggreatstudents #laurenscountyschools

I have taken panel board from my classroom and made a “classroom” in my shop at home where the lessons will take place. Please share for those parents and kids who may need guidance addressing math concepts such as fraction operations, decimal operations, geometry, coordinate plane, volume, order of operations, and expressions.

Teamwork definitely made the dream work today for Laurens County Schools!! When closing a school district for any amount of time, there are so many moving pieces that need to take place. Each department had their specific tasks to complete to make today possible. There were stacks and stacks of learning packets printed and given out. 3032 meals were provided for 1516 students. Our technology department issued over 1000 Chromebooks to students and families. We sold the beautiful plants from our East and West greenhouses. And we even managed to film an episode of Team Laurens to help tell our story!! Phew!!! What a great time to be a part of a great team!! Thank you everyone for all that you do for Team Laurens!❤️💻📚🥪📝 #teamlaurens #teamworkmakesthedreamwork #newnormal #growinggreatstudents #laurenscountyschools",0.0,"Laurens County School District added 79 new photos.

We can not let this day pass without letting our LCBOE employees know how much they are ALL appreciated!! There is not a position held that is insignificant. There is not a person working within our district that is not valued. That’s roughly 900 men and women who work hard everyday to ensure that our students are well taken care of...in and out of the classrooms. We thank you for your dedication and spirit of excellence in which you work. Thank you ALL for being a valuable piece of our Team Laurens puzzle. Because without YOU...there would be no US!! 📚❤️

Black History Month is recognized nationally during the month of February. This gave several Laurens County Schools the opportunity to pay homage to significant individuals, who positively affected American history. There were many teaching moments and history lessons from every board, book and door decoration. West Laurens Middle School was the most participative school by having a door contest with the theme, “One Act of Kindness Can Change the World”. They had 99% participation! Kiley Mickel Karmazinas and Amy Price Garnto were named the winners by displaying doors that honored NASA Mathematician Katherine Johnson and embraced the diversity of our students. Thank you administrators, staff, teachers and students for making concerted efforts in providing cultural teaching moments for us all.❤️🇺🇸 #teamlaurens #blackhistorymonth #diversity #worldchangers #growinggreatstudents #laurenscountyschools",0.0,"Laurens County School District added 58 new photos.

Good news! Beginning Monday, September 14th meals will be FREE for all children 18 & younger. Breakfast and lunch will be available for ANY child, not just students enrolled in our district. This impacts our curbside meal service and will also impact students when they return to in-person learning.

New for curbside meals: Parents/guardians who are picking up meals on behalf of the children in their care will be asked to complete and display a placard in their vehicle. You will receive the form to fill out on the first day that you participate in meal service.

We are grateful to USDA for extending the Summer Food Service Program through December.",0.0,"Our Child Nutrition Department is resuming the free meals for children program on Monday, September 14. See below for details on the program.

On June 29, Governor Doug Ducey issued Executive Order (2020-44) which delayed the opening of schools for on-site learning until August 17 at the earliest. This executive order gave school districts the option of opening on their scheduled start date using distance/online learning.

The Laveen School District has determined that, given the uncertainty of when schools will be able to open for on-site learning, we will keep our current calendar and begin the 2020-21 school year on August 3 using distance/online learning for all students.

For the first time ever, we're joining forces with six major sports leagues to launch a digital education competition like you've never seen before - the EduCup Challenge.

Students will work alongside their favorite sports teams to complete digital courses focused on teaching critical skills and healthy habits. The more students who participate, the more points their team earns, and they get one step closer to winning the 2020 EduCup (which comes with the chance to win scholarships or prizes)!

There's nothing like a little friendly competition to get students fired up about learning.

You can contact our nurses by email at lsorensen@laveeneld.org or by phone/text at (602) 515-1047.",2020-03-31 19:24:47,,

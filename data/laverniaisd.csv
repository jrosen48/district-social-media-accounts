The very reason teachers choose their profession — their desire to put their students before themselves — also precludes them from taking credit for the lifelong difference they make for those students. If this point in time has revealed anything, it is just how incredible and important teachers are.

Teachers Can is a partnership of dozens of businesses, associations, community organizations, and universities who believe that, now more than ever, teachers deserve to own their impact. And that teachers deserve to hear from all of us how valuable they are to our students, our families, our communities, and our future.

Please share this video, for those who can, for those who teach. Then visit TeachersCan.org to find more ways to thank our teachers. #TeachersCan",0.0,"#ThankATeacher #TeacherAppreciationWeek #WeAreLV

LVPD officers and constables will ride La Vernia ISD buses with students on a variety of routes throughout the school year.

Happy Homecoming LV!

We have huge things planned tonight so get ready...
This afternoon (9/27/19) at 5:00 pm - Varsity Volleyball will be starting game one vs. Navarro at home. We are looking for a packed house! Many students, the cheerleaders, teachers, and coaches will be in attendance for the match. Freshman and JV will begin directly after the Varsity games.

Football kicks off at 7:30 pm at home vs the.Rockport- Fulton Pirates. Come early, get a great seat, wear your blue, black, and white and cheer loud!! Wear your favorite player's number on your right cheek to support (we hear eyeliner pencil works great).

The LVHS Art Club will be offering face painting and hair painting as a fundraiser at the entrance of the Football game for $1 - $2. Show your LV Spirit!!!

We hope to see ALL of La Vernia at the Game!

LVHS Health Science Theory students passed the National Certification in Clinical Medical Assistants (CCMA)!!!

These new CCMA students are now a vital part of clinical patient care. They were trained to perform so many different tasks, which are seen as high demand in the workforce. This training began with Principles of Health Science their first year, Medical Terminology their second year, and continued this year with the Health Science Theory class.

We want to inform you about an incident that occurred at our Primary School campus today. At 11:16 AM, a suspicious individual visited the campus requesting to have lunch with a student. The individual refused to produce identification for our campus safety monitor and our school resource officer, and was escorted off campus at 11:35 AM. The individual started an altercation with the officer in the parking lot and attempted to evade arrest. The officer apprehended the individual immediately and removed him from the property.

Out of an abundance of caution for our students, we placed our Primary School campus on a brief precautionary lockdown during this incident. The lockdown has been lifted at this time and the campus has resumed normal operations. There is no active threat to our students or staff.

The safety and security of our students and staff is our first priority. We will continue to make every effort to ensure that our campuses are a safe place to learn and work for LVISD students and staff members.

We want to inform you about an incident that occurred at our Primary School campus today. At 11:16 AM, a suspicious individual visited the campus requesting to have lunch with a student. The individual refused to produce identification for our campus safety monitor and our school resource officer, and was escorted off campus at 11:35 AM. The individual started an altercation with the officer in the parking lot and attempted to evade arrest. The officer apprehended the individual immediately and removed him from the property.

Out of an abundance of caution for our students, we placed our Primary School campus on a brief precautionary lockdown during this incident. The lockdown has been lifted at this time and the campus has resumed normal operations. There is no active threat to our students or staff.

The safety and security of our students and staff is our first priority. We will continue to make every effort to ensure that our campuses are a safe place to learn and work for LVISD students and staff members.

Governor Ivey recently amended the “Safer at Home Order.” Some of the changes included lessening the restrictions on gatherings. Therefore, we now believe we can have some type of graduation that resembles our traditional ceremonies.

A huge shoutout to ELES teacher, Tessa Filyaw, who shared her wisdom and ideas about the assessment and specifically the Text Dependent Writing portion of the assessment. 2nd-3rd and 7th-8th grade teachers are up next!

We have amazing and dedicated teachers in our system!

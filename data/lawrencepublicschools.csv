“Inclusion, diversity, and equity should be woven into the fabric of who we are as an organization,” said Russ Johnson, president and CEO of LMH Health. “We want to help our community’s youth experience opportunities they may not know exist, and to experience them in a low-pressure environment where they can freely explore those options.""

Superintendent Dr. Anthony Lewis said that providing paid internships to students from underrepresented groups is the kind of measurable action steps the district wants to see as a product of its equity work. “The benefits of this partnership with LMH Health extend beyond these students and their families to the community-at-large as we create a leadership development pipeline from our schools to the workforce,” he said.

“She helps students understand not only the importance of school but also the importance of being a good human being.” commented Jayci Roberson, Woodlawn Elementary Principal.

When asked about Michelle for this award, a peer stated, “I don’t know that I’ve ever worked at a school that had a “Michelle”, someone who is universally there for students, staff, administration, and families alike. She fills so many roles for us and I can’t imagine Woodlawn without her.”

CDC RECOMMENDATIONS ON CLOTH FACE COVERINGS
The coronavirus can spread between people interacting in close proximity — for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing — even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms. In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html

It is critical to emphasize that maintaining six-feet social distancing remains important to slowing the spread of the virus. The cloth face coverings recommended ARE NOT surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.

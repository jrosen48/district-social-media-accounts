In New Jersey, we celebrate the second week in May as “Special Education Week” – a designation that has been memorialized in state statute.This week recognizes the contributions of students, parents, teachers, child study team members, administrators and school board members in their efforts to ensure educational access and equity for students with disabilities. In New Jersey, more than 241,000 children receive special education instruction and services in public and private schools.

The theme for this year’s Special Education Week, is “Creating, Learning, Growing.” Since 1985, the New Jersey School Boards Association (NJSBA) and ASAH, an organization representing private special education schools, have sponsored Special Education Week in New Jersey and have also led a poster contest for students intended to highlight student achievements.

The Lawson R-XIV School District will be open tomorrow when the Chiefs hold their celebratory parade and rally.

In 2015, when the Royals won the World Series, our student attendance was approximately 70% on the November parade day. Assuming a similar number for the Chiefs in 2020 would suggest a number of our families may lack the work flexibility, child-care solution, and/or the interest to attend the parade and rally. That, in addition to the long string of inclement weather days which have plagued this semester, suggests school should be in session.

Of course, there will be several families who choose to attend the parade, and will want their children with them. We support that choice say ‘Enjoy!’ All we ask, the same for any absence, is that we receive parental verification so the absence can be excused.

Thank you for your understanding -- and Go Cards & Chiefs!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2920557361335581&id=543242989067042,,0.0,"A season to remember for the Chiefs and their fans! Congratulations to all who have passionately supported the ball club through the years.

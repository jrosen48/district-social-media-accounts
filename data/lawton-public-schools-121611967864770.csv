Rare Birds: The incredible story of the 1990 Eisenhower football team

In 1990, they helped Eisenhower High School achieve something it never had before and hasn‚Äôt since. Not only did they win the state football championship in Oklahoma‚Äôs largest classification, they were named national champions by USA Today, who produced the foremost high school football poll during those days.

On the field, they wore opponents down with tenacity and track-star speed. But just as importantly, they were a representation of Lawton: hard-working self-starters who came from different ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds to achieve a common goal. And 30 years on, they haven‚Äôt forgotten what Lawton gave them. And Lawton hasn‚Äôt forgotten what that team gave the community.

MHS is excited to announce that we have been awarded another national Promising Practice recognition for our work in Project Unified!

Project Unified give students the chance to foster relationships and promote inclusion by providing equitable opportunities for Special Olympians and unified partners to participate in athletic competitions. The students highlighted in this practice are members of Unified Club, also known as Partner's Club. Students have competed in basketball, volleyball, track and field, boccie ball, bowling, and horseshoes, to name a few.

MHS would not be capable of such a club without the guidance of club sponsors, Mr. Ford and Mrs. Santos, and the former sponsors, Mrs. Young and Ms. Ray, who spent years building this wonderful program for students of all abilities.

Congratulations to all sponsors, club members, and staff who have helped to make this organization such a huge success at MHS!",2.0,"#MHS has been awarded another national Promising Practice recognition for their work on Project Unified! Way to go, #Highlanders!

Project Unified give students the chance to foster relationships and promote inclusion by providing equitable opportunities for Special Olympians and unified partners to participate in athletic competitions. The students highlighted in this practice are members of Unified Club, also known as Partner's Club. Students have competed in basketball, volleyball, track and field, boccie ball, bowling, and horseshoes, to name a few.

MHS would not be capable of such a club without the guidance of club sponsors, Mr. Ford and Mrs. Santos, and the former sponsors, Mrs. Young and Ms. Ray, who spent years building this wonderful program for students of all abilities.

Congratulations to all sponsors, club members, and staff who have helped to make this organization such a huge success at MHS!",2020-06-10 10:18:31,,

The following students will be awarded the Principal‚Äôs Award for 2019-2020 school year. These 8th graders went above and beyond in academics, behavior, and school involvement. They all worked hard to be well rounded students and represent CMS. We are very proud of their efforts. Normally we would announce this during 8th grade promotion, and we wanted to make sure they know to come to pick up their plaque at student pick up. Congratulations!

Friendship is the emotions or conduct of friends; the state of being friends. In Ignition, we have formed relationships with each other throughout the year. ‚ÄúFriendship is the hardest thing in the world to explain. It‚Äôs not something you learn in school. But if you haven‚Äôt learned the meaning of friendship, you really haven‚Äôt learned anything."" -Muhammad Ali

Meet Schyla Wright. She has been the Educational Services administrative assistant for 12 years and has been with LPS for 20 years.

Schyla works directly with the assistant superintendent of Educational Services, assists parents, teachers and principals with questions and concerns, and acts as the district point of contact for the Food For Kids Program and the LPS Christmas Food Basket Program.

‚ÄúMy favorite part about my position is knowing that I was able to help or make a difference for someone,‚Äù Schyla said.

‚ÄúIn February I will become the proud grandma of a baby boy,‚Äù Schyla said. ‚ÄúI look forward to sharing this new adventure with my family.‚Äù

Integrity

‚ÄúIntegrity is the most valuable and respected quality of leadership. Always keep your word.‚Äù -Brain Tracy

Integrity is an important attribute to have when leading a crowd and is a foundation of character. Along with this comes the consistency of our actions, morals, and principles. It means to do what is right no matter when, where, or who is watching or present.

MacArthur High School (MHS) students and LPSPD officers organized the 2019 Red Tulip Project, which took place throughout October. This project's purpose was to raise baby items, such as diapers, wipes, clothes and toys to donate to DHS. Donations were collected at most schools around the district and compiled at MHS, where students sorted the supplies into care packages. In the case of an emergency foster, the hosting parents would receive a care package from DHS as a starter supply kit for the baby they will foster.

This week‚Äôs mentor of the week is Spencer Short!

Why did you become a mentor?:
I became a mentor due to my freshman year. I was quiet, shy, and barely had anyone to talk with or relate to until my mentors came into our class. After that, I wanted to help other students who were like me know that they aren't alone

What is your job in the program?:
My job is with the volunteer committee. I help put stuff together and organize volunteer times.

What are three words to define you?:
Kind, creative and caring.

It's our last day of our week honoring volunteers - thanks to ALL of our volunteers who do so much in so many different ways.

Today's focus is on Activism -- and there is something you can do right now to take part. The New Jersey Public Charter Schools Association is looking to build a database of parents who are interested in hearing more about legislative actions we can all take to make things better for charter school students.

If you are interested, fill out this form with your name and contact info - and they'll include you on their weekly e-newsletter blasts.

Although we have no direct exposure at LCCS from COVID-19, we will be closing the school starting Monday March 16 through at least March 30. We believe this is the best decision for the health and safety of our students, faculty, and families - as well as for the wider Jersey City community and beyond.

Tomorrow we will send an update with our full Distance Learning plan with all information about how we will support your students during this unprecedented time. We will be monitoring the situation and will make decisions about reopening as soon as we are able. Thank you so much for all your support.

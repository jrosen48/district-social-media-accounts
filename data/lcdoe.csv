Many thanks to Senior Chief Pitpitan and his NJROTC cadets for their commemorative demonstration this morning in honor of Patriot Day. Falcons were challenged to never forget September 11, 2001: the loss of innocent American lives, the sacrifices made by our first responders, and the immediate and definite response to defend the American people by our Armed Forces. We also thank the Veterans who attended our service today for their service and their sacrifice. We will never forget.

“It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.” - President Abraham Lincoln, Gettysburg Address

We are now getting close to the mid-point of the first nine weeks. Today we have held discussions with school administrators and teachers on adjusting our original school re-opening plan. If you are a parent who chose virtual instruction for your children at the beginning of the school year and are now in a situation like ""this is really not working for me, my child seems to be struggling more with virtual, our internet at home is not of quality to run the programs or you are having tech issues"", we are going to offer a one week period for you to be able to switch from virtual instruction back to traditional. You will have from Monday, August 24 through the close of the school day on Friday, August 28th to switch back to traditional. If you choose to switch back, you will need to contact your school's principal during that week. We encourage you to watch a short video by Dr. Bill Heath in explaining this option.

If you are a parent who chose virtual instruction for your children at the beginning of the school year and are now in a situation like ""this is really not working for me, my child seems to be struggling more with virtual, our internet at home is not of quality to run the programs or you are having tech issues"", we are going to offer a one week period for you to be able to switch from virtual instruction back to traditional. You will have from Monday, August 24 through the close of the school day on Friday, August 28th to switch back to traditional. If you choose to switch back, you will need to contact your school's principal during that week. We encourage you to watch a short video by Dr. Bill Heath in explaining this option.

The parents of the potential exposed students are immediately notified. Contact tracing has been completed by the administration at Highland Rim School and all who may have been potentially exposed have been notified. The building has been thoroughly sanitized as it is daily.

Parents/Guardians – We ask that you continue to check your child’s temperature prior to sending them to school and if your child has any of the Covid-19 symptoms as outlined by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) that you keep your child at home. If a student is at school and has any of the CDC symptoms, school personnel will make contact with parents/guardians for the child to be picked up. We will continue to complete symptom checks for all students and staff members daily. #oneLC",2020-08-11 19:35:03,,

Parents,

The health department is an option for getting children’s immunizations to be ready ready for the school year. We are continuing to provide community services at curb side (older children). We normally ask that the younger children be brought into the health department with one caregiver in order to give them the immunizations. We take all infection prevention precautions to keep the children and parents safe during the visit.



There is no COVID testing performed inside our health department and we will not be doing any COVID testing during these hours. We want to ensure that we continue to mitigate the possibility of any vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks and get the children up-to-date on any needed immunizations.



Please see attached flyer regarding school immunizations at the Lincoln County Health Department. As always, we will provide immunizations to anyone that comes in anytime during our normal business hours but we did designate these times next week to assist with getting our students ready for school.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2722972554691136&id=1514002505588153,,0.0,"From the Heath Department

To celebrate the achievements of our Top 10%, LCHS presents a daily countdown of our top-performing students. Today’s honoree is Mr. Sahil Patel, Valedictorian of the LCHS Class of 2020.

In a normal world, he’d be delivering his Valedictorian Address just about now.

My name is Sahil Patel and later this fall I will be attending Vanderbilt University as a Neuroscience major on a pre-med track. The teacher I invited is Mrs. Katie Wheat. I first met Mrs. Wheat in my junior year during Chem I. Taking her class was one of the most enjoyable and fulfilling things I
have done. And Mrs. Wheat herself has been super helpful, from writing
recommendation letters to providing general advice. All in all, my experience at Lincoln County High School has been phenomenal, and it wouldn’t have been better without Mrs. Wheat.",0.0,"Lincoln County High School

My name is Logan Blake Owen. I plan to attend The University of Alabama in Huntsville and pursue mechanical engineering in the fall. The teacher I picked to attend Evening With the Stars with me was Mrs. Tracy Davis 7th and 8th grade science teacher at Highland Rim. If you know Mrs. Tracy, you know that the word teacher doesn't begin to describe what Mrs. Tracy is. If you were lucky enough to have her as a teacher, you know that she gives everything she has to offer to every student every day. She touches her students lives, not only by teaching them science, but also playing a role in their emotional and personal development. She truly wants every student to succeed, not only in school and education, but in life. Thank you Mrs Tracy for your profound impact on my journey.",3.0,"Lincoln County High School

To celebrate the achievements of our Top 10%, LCHS presents a daily countdown of our top-performing students. Today’s honoree is Mr. Justin Williams, #7 of the LCHS Class of 2020.

After graduation I plan to attend the University of Florida with the goal of getting my PharmD. The teacher I chose to honor is Mrs. Amanda Logan from South Lincoln. She made me enjoy science, which played a large part in leading me to my current goal of becoming a pharmacist. I will especially miss her, along with all the other wonderful teachers I’ve had throughout my time in high school.",0.0,"Lincoln County High School

Hi, my name is Ben Bassham. I plan on attending the University of Tennessee Knoxville after graduation. I will be a nursing major and plan to become a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist.

Without my family and my friends, I would not be the person I am today. The teacher I invited to The Evening with the Stars was Mrs. Susan Edwards. Starting my sophomore year, I was excited to be in Spanish with her as my teacher. She always made learning interesting and exciting. Mrs. Edwards always had a smile on her face and never failed to make me laugh. Mrs. Edwards most definitely made my high school experience one to remember and I am very thankful for her. Thank you Señora Edwards!",0.0,"Lincoln County High School

To celebrate the achievements of our Top 10%, LCHS presents a daily countdown of our top-performing students. Today’s honoree is Mr. Adam Suszczynski, #22 of the LCHS Class of 2020.

Hi, my name is Adam Suszczynski. I plan on attending the University of Alabama in Huntsville after graduation, and I will be a nursing major. I would like to thank my family and God for always keeping me on the right track with every aspect of my life. The teacher that I invited to the Evening With the Stars is Mrs. Brandy Dunivan. She was my 7th grade English teacher at Highland Rim, but she is a lot more than that to myself and my friends on the basketball team. To us she was a second mom, and she never failed to put in some extra effort just to put smiles on our faces. From cooking brownies for days after games to simple conversations every day in the hallways, she truly made my middle school experience so much better. She has always been so kind to my family, and I will never forget the memories she helped me make. Thank you Mrs. Dunivan!",0.0,"Lincoln County High School

To celebrate the achievements of our Top 10%, LCHS presents a daily countdown of our top-performing students. Today’s honoree is Miss Riley Ary, #23 of the LCHS Class of 2020.

My name is Riley Ary and I am graduating as number 23 in my class. I will attend the University of Alabama in Huntsville to study business management. While getting my degree I plan to take part in the Disney College Program to gain hands-on experience in my future career path. After college I hope to pursue a career in the Walt Disney VIP Tour Services Department.The teacher I chose to honor is Mrs. Clair Byrd. Mrs. Byrd has been my guidance counselor for the past three years at Lincoln County High School. She has helped me academically and emotionally, and I will never be able to express in words how thankful I am for her. From figuring out my college plans to motivating me when everything seemed to be crashing down, she's helped me through it all. I do not think I would be where I am without her help throughout my high school career.",0.0,"Lincoln County High School

We have been working very hard this past week to prepare for tomorrow. Please come take advantage of our services. All children are welcome regardless of the school they are enrolled in or free or reduced status! We want to see everyone. We do ask that you be patient with us tomorrow. It is VERY hard to prepare for an unknown amount of people. We could feed anywhere from 300 to 3,000 people tomorrow. Each child will receive 6 meals so that is a possible 9,000 meals. This means our staffs could possibly be preparing as people come through if their pre prepared meals run out. If this happens, your patience is appreciated.

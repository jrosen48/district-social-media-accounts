We incorporated dots into ALL of our subjects! We read The Dot by Peter Reynolds and discussed making our mark to see where it will take us. We have been learning about the neighboring states of Texas and filled in a teacher-made connect the dots page and labeling, we have also been learning about adding and subtracting decimals, so we practiced dropping the dot into our answer using dots.

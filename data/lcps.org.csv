OPENING UPDATE:

GSSV has decided that the safest way to open the 2020-2021 school year is all virtual learning except for some science labs. We will be operating with a synchronous model meaning that students will be expected to join their Zoom class sessions every day. We are working with the local school divisions for a plan for those students who do not have strong Internet that allows Zoom streaming.

This letter is being mailed home to students today, along with the 2020-2021 GSSV calendar, that provides more details. More information will be forthcoming in the next few weeks as logistics are worked out including Orientation Day and lab days.

Central Yearbooks Heads Up!
Just a heads up that with schools shutting down and many of the spring events being canceled, we have been getting great pictures from our students at home and will have lots of those in the yearbook. If anyone has any last-minute pictures they want to send, get them to us by Saturday.
In addition to that, the yearbook plant shut down temporarily and pushed back deadlines. We talked with them and decided that we wanted to get a complete year with every event possible in there so we will send in our finished book on June 1 as soon as graduation is done this weekend. This allows us to get these last few events in the book as well and tell the complete story of the year. The yearbooks will be back to us near the end of June and we will contact everyone, send out announcements, etc when they arrive. Here are just a few pictures from the Sword and Shield from last night with these and many more in the yearbook.",0.0,"Central High School

Attention parents of 5th graders:

We will be hosting an informal “drive-thru” promotion ceremony for our 5th grade students on Thursday, May 28, 2020 at the KES bus loop from 5:00-6:00PM.
With no more than ONE CAR PER STUDENT, you may enter the bus loop and pull around to your child’s homeroom teacher (they will be spaced around the loop). Each teacher will hand any belongings of the student and any certificates earned this year to the student as you pull up.
Although this is not the ceremony our students deserve, we wanted to send them off to middle school with a chance to say “good bye”.
Our staff will be practicing social distancing and ask that our guests do the same. You are asked to stay in your car at all times. Please be respectful and patient, as we do plan for many cars to attend our drive-thru. Please reach out to your child’s teacher with any questions!",0.0,"Kenbridge Elementary School

Our amazing teachers spent their day delivering graduation signs to the seniors of all 11 schools. While some students weren't home, we hope they enjoyed their surprise waiting for them in their yard when they returned.

We have missed you all the past 8 weeks and are proud of how hard you worked to make the most of this situation. We have no doubt you will continue to do great things!

Shoutout to Ms. Jackson from two KES parents:
“Ms Jackson has called me to check on my son. She made sure he received his learning packet. Ms Jackson offered to assist in any way to further his learning. I’m glad she made herself available to help him with questions or anything else we may need as a family.”
“Since the closing Mrs. Jackson has reached out to us checking on my son several times. It’s obvious her heart is a hundred percent into what she does . The amount of care she has shown is amazing. Having her support during this unpredictable time has been amazing. She is always willing to help and has made it clear if we need anything she will help. Truly a blessing to have her as my son’s teacher.”

Do you know a staff member that is making a difference for our students, families, and community during this time of our school closure? Fill out this form if you would like to share:

Shoutout to Ms. Braxter from a KES parent:
""Ms. Braxter has been very supportive before school was released and after with my son. She has built a very good relationship with my family and is always checking in making sure we are okay. She is an amazing teacher and I hate that school was cut short so my son couldn’t end the year with her. I feel any student that comes in contact with her will be very happy to have her as a teacher. I will end with one word that describes Ms. Braxter and that is “sunshine” because whenever she is around she will brighten your day.""

To start the highlight of the 2020 Chargers Baseball players it seems fitting to begin with our lead-off man.
BEN ANTHONY
Ben Anthony is a senior captain that has been a 3 year starter on the varsity team. Ben has been a stand-out middle infielder having played 2B as a sophomore and then moving to SS the past two seasons. His play on the field has given him individual honors such as All-District and All-Region while helping the team reach the playoffs. As our lead-off hitter he set the table for others and did whatever was needed to help the team win.
Ben is a a talented player on the baseball field because of his athleticism and great attitude. I can't say enough good things about his attitude and him as person. He is truly a leader by example and someone that his team can count on to always do things the right way and to give his best. Ben is a great representative of the team, of Central High School and of Charger Pride! Benjamin Anthony Michael Anthony Wanda Elliott Anthony Kayla Anthony Sandy L. Noblin-Anthony

To start the highlight of the 2020 Chargers Baseball players it seems fitting to begin with our lead-off man.
BEN ANTHONY
Ben Anthony is a senior captain that has been a 3 year starter on the varsity team. Ben has been a stand-out middle infielder having played 2B as a sophomore and then moving to SS the past two seasons. His play on the field has given him individual honors such as All-District and All-Region while helping the team reach the playoffs. As our lead-off hitter he set the table for others and did whatever was needed to help the team win.

Additionally, he mailed Mrs. Lawson AND Brooklynn personalized letters, a poster, signed copies of his books, and a signed copy of an unpublished book of his.

Central High School staff shared their #Back2SchoolVA2019 experience with us recently:

The school floors are glistening and the bulletin boards promote inclusion and being kind in our school. The faculty and staff were treated to dinner for our Open House and school supplies were donated by a local industry, ABC Recycling. Students entered the building--full of smiles and happy to return. Finally---as you can see, we are located within the rainbow and our school is full of endless pride and opportunities.

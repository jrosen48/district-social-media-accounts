Tonight I finished recording The Phantom Tollbooth (20 chapters). It truly is a great book and I really enjoyed it. The links are not public, but can be found at the LCPS Enrichment Channel. If you have never read this book, I highly recommend it. Unfortunately, it is often seen as a children's book and ignored but older students and adults. There are so many valuable lessons, high level vocabulary, mathematical reasoning and philosophical ideas. Like all books, it is best if you buy the book, but if you just want to listen, check it out. (please try to get past the first few chapters where I didn't know what I was doing and was a 'talking head' :) )

There are also so many other amazing resources here for that extra enrichment parents are looking for to keep children engaged and able to learn about things that interest them. Check it out!

Canaan (pictured middle with his parents) thwarted an attempted kidnapping in progress on March 25 by pinning the suspect to the ground until a Doña Ana County Sheriff's Department Deputy arrived on the scene.

NM PREP Middle School Academy and NM PREP High School Academy are intensive two-week residential summer STEM programs held on the campus of New Mexico State University. The Academies have been designed to spark student interest in STEM, specifically in engineering, while engaging students in leadership, team-building, and hands-on activities that simulate real-world engineering experiences.

Participating students gain insight into life on a university campus, gain self-confidence and self-identity in studying and working on STEM projects, and have the opportunity to interact with other students from across the state, as well as current NMSU undergraduate students and engineering faculty.

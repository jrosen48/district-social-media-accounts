Use park lights instead of leaving headlights on when it is dark. Headlights can blind other drivers. Stay parked until all students are done loading or unloading and the bus has turned off the red lights. Buses will wait for commuters who want to leave before the bus or they will pull over at the next safe turnout so commuters can pass. Have students gather backpacks and coats as soon as they see the bus coming so they can be ready and waiting outside of the car when the bus stops. Have them wait at least 15 feet from the bus and approach the bus only after it has come to a complete stop.

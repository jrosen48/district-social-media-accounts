Our Lebanon School Board is working with the firm Hazard, Young, Attea, & Associates to conduct a national search for a new superintendent of schools. The School Board‚Äôs desire is to include as many people from our community as possible.

The first step in the search process is to build a Leadership Profile of traits and qualifications the community wants in the next superintendent. In the coming weeks, the search firm will conduct interviews and focus groups to glean more information. Once all of the information is collected and the Leadership Profile is complete, the recruitment, interview and selection process will take about two months. A calendar of dates will be posted here when it is finalized.

We have several important community events that are happening this upcoming week. On Monday at 6:30pm, there is a community suicide prevention event at Lebanon High School. Several organizations from around the community are helping with this student-led event. The mental health of our students is a growing concern for our district, and it is good to see so many members of our community rally to support our kids. We also have Open House and curriculum events at LHS on Wednesday evening and at 7 Oak on Thursday evening. The week will end with the Classroom to Career event on Friday the 29th. Over 30 industries are coming together to host a hands on event for students from Sweet Home and Lebanon school districts. Our goal is to expose 1,000 students to local, living wage careers with local industries. The Boys and Girls Club and Rick Franklin are the chief sponsors of this event, and it has been thrilling to see so many people come together in support of our students. The Expo will take place all day on Friday near the Santiam Travel Station.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1542159349175809&id=478484695543285,,0.0,"Weekly Message from Superintendent Hess:

The snow and freezing rain is continuing to fall and should continue for a couple more hours. After that, the temperature will not get above freezing until sometime late tomorrow afternoon. Almost all roads will be extremely slick and unsafe tomorrow morning so we have cancelled school. Our surrounding communities are experiencing similar challenges. Stay safe tomorrow and this evening. We will try again Friday!",2016-12-14 22:27:50,,

LMS parents: In case your child(ren) come home with questions I wanted you to know that I read what is typed below at 9:37am at 9:11am every year. Mr. E

Excuse the interruption staff and students…

When I finish reading this message we are going to observe a moment of silence to reflect upon the attacks on America that happened on Sept. 11th 2001.

At 8:46 am Hijackers deliberately crashed American Airlines Flight 11 into the North Tower of the WTC,

At 9:03am Hijackers deliberately crashed United Airlines Flight 175 into the South Tower of the WTC,

at 9:37am Hijackers deliberately crashed American Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon,

At 10:03am After learning about the other attacks passengers on United Airlines Flight 93 launch a counterattack on hijackers, seize control of the aircraft, causing the hijackers to crash the plane into an empty field.

Many lives were lost and America changed forever. Please remain silent.

Thank you.

The Village of Lakeview is closing all outdoor playground equipment. This includes the Lakeview Community Schools playground equipment.

Please see attached flyers for full details.

Tuesday, August 20th from 1:30-3:00 at the Tamarack Library will be “Planning for What Happens After Early On”. This is a new workshop and one that I am excited to be hosting. Not many parents fully understand what to do when their child graduates out of Early on and this workshop helps them lay out a plan.

Thursday, September 19th from 6:30 to 8:30 at the Seiter Center will be “Assistive Technology in the IEP”. This will assist parents with writing a PLAAFP statement to include assistive technology, addressing goals and creating an implementation plan.

I hope you can attend and look forward to bringing these to your community. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks so much!

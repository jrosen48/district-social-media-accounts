In case you missed the mayor's daily update, we are rolling out free Wi-Fi zones to better serve our community. Lex-Link is currently available at the temporary drive-thru location (679 W. Church St.) and the museum. We understand these are challenging times and not everyone has access to internet service at home. We hope Lex-Link will be a resource for our community. Follow us for more updates and additional Wi-Fi location announcements. #LexLink",2020-03-27 20:11:05,,

We broke our highest record by over $2,000 since we started this fundraiser several years ago. This year you helped us raise over $4700. This money goes toward our Christmas Toy Drive. Friday's counting alone took 5 people working all day to make our deadline to announce the winners. We had to team lift 3rd grade's jug and cut it open to get everything out!

We would like to say a special thank you to the Firstbank Tellers at the Natchez Trace branch for counting our deposits. They could not believe the size of the growing deposits each day!

Most of all, to our parents on Facebook, Thank You! The spirit of competition was fierce this year. You provided us with much needed comic relief while counting all of the loose change. We decided to post some of our favorites.

We broke our highest record by over $2,000 since we started this fundraiser several years ago. This year you helped us raise over $4700. This money goes toward our Christmas Toy Drive. Friday's counting alone took 5 people working all day to make our deadline to announce the winners. We had to team lift 3rd grade's jug and cut it open to get everything out!

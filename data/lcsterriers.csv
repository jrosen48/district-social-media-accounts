All of the school districts in Hillsdale County, including the Litchfield Terriers, will be delaying the opening of school until Tuesday, September 8, 2020.

By delaying the start of school we are hoping to see a decrease in statewide infections. Delaying will also give us an extra two weeks to plan and prepare to provide the healthiest learning environment possible.

This was a difficult decision to make, but every Superintendent in the County believes that this was the right decision for us.

We will continue to provide updates to keep you informed of the changes that are taking place. You can email me at mcorey@litchfieldschools.com, or call me on my cellphone at 517-250-2220.

GO TERRIERS!!!

Today, I am issuing a “Stay Home, Stay Safe” Executive Order. It goes into effect tonight at midnight.

The goal here is simple: Stay home. Stay safe. Save lives. If we all stay at home, except for critical work and needs, we can mitigate the spread of COVID-19.

Let me be clear: Your grocery stores will still be open. Your pharmacies will remain open. Your banks and credit unions will still be functioning. You can fill your car with gas.

The full list of critical services that will remain open is available at Michigan.gov/coronavirus.

I know this is difficult. I know that this is disruptive. But doing this will save lives. When we look back at this, we must be able to say we did everything we could. We will get through this together.

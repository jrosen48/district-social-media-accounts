Sweatshirts, snow pants, and coats,
shoes and socks too!
All these things have been lost
But are looking to be found by YOU!

Make sure you stop by the tables
to take a look and see if you find
these items that have been making
your mom lose her mind!

We don't want moms and dads to continue to look for that beloved shoe, sock, coat, hat, snow pants, or sweatshirt! Stop by the lost and found table!

New this year is also a FREE TABLE. If you are in need of any of the items on the table, please utilize these donations for your kiddos this winter!",0.0,"Just a reminder...check the lost and found at the Elementary when you're there for conferences tonight!!

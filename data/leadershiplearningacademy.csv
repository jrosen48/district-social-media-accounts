Good afternoon, Flyers. There is a winter storm predicted for late tonight and tomorrow morning. We are going to be watching the weather closely, but as things stand right now, we are planning to hold school as usual. Please watch your email and our LLA Facebook page for notifications regarding any change to that plan. In the event that we have a late start, or cancel school due to weather, we will always post it on our Facebook page and communicate through email and OneCall text by 7:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. Please keep in mind that you always have the right to keep your child home should you feel that the conditions are not something you want to travel in. Even if our school is open, we support you if you make that choice. Have a good evening and stay warm! 02/02/2020",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1652442561564566&id=199092580232912,,0.0,"Please read and share!!

Today a parent reported to us that a student here at LLA was approached in a neighborhood near us by a strange man. The man was asking for directions to a gas station. When the student told him where it was he asked to be shown on his phone. When the student approached the vehicle the man was exposing himself. The student immediately started screaming and running home. This was immediately reported to the police and it sounds like it has happened multiple times in Layton recently. I am sharing this with you to keep you aware. The student is upset but is ok.
The male in the car was described as looking like ""Maui"" on Moana and driving a red car.
Please note this did not happen on the street of our school, but a neighborhood close to here. We are watching out here as well and will immediately contact police if necessary.
We love having your children here at LLA and want them safe and happy!

I hope you all had a great weekend. This year the office is treating our teachers with 12 days of gifts for all the hard work they put in. Tomorrow, instead of sending them to the Bahamas (which I wish we could), we are allowing them to be comfortable in their pajamas. Please feel free to have your students join if they would like. If they decide to participate in pajama day, make sure they are school appropriate.

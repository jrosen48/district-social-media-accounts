1.) make sure the laptop is connected to the internet AND

2.) let it restart (automatically) once or twice to finalize the update.

Once enough computers load the update, connectivity should improve. We have new servers to install over the weekend so we can keep getting better and better every day (and send those high school students back to school on Monday).

Here’s to Leander ISD Summer Reader of the Week Tristan Pratorius-Thurman for turning his love of reading into more than just a pet project.

Tristan is heading into second grade at Camacho Elementary. Tristan’s favorite book right now is It Will Be Okay by Lysa TerKeurst. HIs favorite books make him laugh and have good pictures. He’s got plenty of company to entertain with a good book. His two dogs Lola and Little Bit, his cat named Fern, and Jumby the hamster make a great audience!

When it comes to reading, he keeps his teacher’s best advice in mind: “Don’t give up and keep trying your best.”

Congratulations LISD Summer Reader of the Week Tristan Pratorius-Thurman for pet-rifying us with his passion for books!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10158211946256690&id=114935171689,,0.0,"He loves all creatures great and small!

Ahmed Muein has some #biggoals. That’s what makes him Leander ISD Summer Reader of the Week!

The second-grader at Christine Camacho Elementary is currently reading The Diary of the Ice Princess. Along with reading, Ahmed likes to play Beyblades and the card game UNO. He has filled his summer stack with books about superheroes and the Fly Guy series.

“My teacher said you can make a record in reading!” Ahmed said.

While Guinness World Records doesn’t keep a record of the most books a second-grader can read, we can see Ahmed is a top contender! Besides, he’s already claiming the most important title – LISD Summer Reader of the Week!

Ahmed Muein has some #biggoals. That’s what makes him Leander ISD Summer Reader of the Week!

The second-grader at Christine Camacho Elementary is currently reading The Diary of the Ice Princess. Along with reading, Ahmed likes to play Beyblades and the card game UNO. He has filled his summer stack with books about superheroes and the Fly Guy series.

“My teacher said you can make a record in reading!” Ahmed said.

With graduation dates coming soon, we would like to provide our graduates and families an update regarding our ceremonies. We wish we could be together, celebrating as normally as possible. Health and safety continue to be our top priorities.

Due to the recent guidance by Texas Governor Greg Abbott, we will need to limit attendance to our ceremonies to 100 people or less. As a result, we will be hosting a ceremony where graduates will:

- celebrate graduates with their families,
- receive a diploma, and
- walk the stage at Gupton Stadium.

Unfortunately, we will not be able to celebrate with the entire class of 2020 together.

It also makes us realize how much our campuses are the pulse of our school communities. That’s why we can appreciate LISD Volunteer of the Week Joanne Peacock even more!

The former Reagan Elementary PTA president immerses herself in all things fun for students. During her leadership, she spearheaded major events like the book fair, international fair, fun run and carnival. Her volunteer spirit kept her involved even after her term.

“Joanne has invested much of her time into supporting our Reagan community,” Reagan Elementary principal Marianne Norman said. “She is always willing to serve and support in any way that we need. We appreciate the time that she gives back to our campus.”

With a servant’s heart, Joanne also provides leadership for student after-school activities, Math Pentathlon and Destination Imagination.

Thank you Leander ISD Volunteer of the Week Joanne Peacock for keeping the campus heartbeat alive and well!",2020-04-15 11:23:27,,

This week’s Super Kid, Myreen Zaidi’s brilliance sparkles in her integrity.

Through the smallest gestures, Myreen shows care and compassion. Whether it’s helping someone clean out their desk, getting a jacket for a friend, opening a lunchbox, finding a lost piece of homework or sharpening a pencil, she’s so much more than a helpful hand. The definition of integrity–doing the right thing, even when no one is watching–truly defines Myreen.

“In my 20+ years of teaching, I have never met a kinder child,” River Ridge first-grade teacher Katie Haedge said. “I call her ‘Queen Myreen’ because she has such integrity, and everyone loves her because they see her shine in all that she does!”

Lest we not forget such character and class is coming from a first-grader, Myreen is setting an example of servant leadership for older students and throughout the River Ridge community.

Lauren is a positive role model for all students and always goes out of her way to support her peers.

""It's my pleasure to have Lauren at the campus,"" Principal Charlie Rodriguez said. ""She is always smiling and has a positive attitude. I enjoy seeing her in the hallways and giving her high fives. She truly is an amazing student. I've known her for two years, and she always goes above and beyond to help others.""

Lauren is active in her school as she participates in the Cox Choir, Run Club, and she also loves to swim.

Congratulations, Lauren! Thank you for being a shining example for Cox as an LISD Super Kid!",2019-10-03 16:54:01,,

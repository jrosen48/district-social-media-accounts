Tutor Zacho Moberg and Site Coordinator Andrea Glickman sprang into action. ‚ÄúWe knew we had the ability to work with this child to help her feel better,‚Äù said Zacho. Andrea quickly cut 22 sheets of pink paper and they got to work. Slowly the smile began to return to this little girl‚Äôs face.

Not only did they create 22 Valentine's cards from scratch, but they were able to complete the most important parts of her Reading Power curriculum for the day.

‚ÄúThis little girl was beaming as we carried the new cards to her class,‚Äù Zacho said.

We love hearing and sharing these ‚Äúmission moments‚Äù that make tutoring for Reading Power so special. Thanks to Andrea and Zacho for saving the day!",2020-02-21 14:43:09,,

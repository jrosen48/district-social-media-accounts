We know this adjustment has been strenuous on many of you and our Principal Prize Patrol is ready to hit the streets to deliver some smiles!

What's the Prize Patrol you ask? The Prize Patrol is our admin making surprise visits to homes where parents and students are working together to overcome the challenges and meet the rigor of parent and student learning expectations.

We bring pizza dinner, drinks, dessert, recognition certificates, and balloons. Don't worry we follow all social distancing protocols in our visits.

The best news is that all you have to do for your chance to win is ensure your child is attending his / her live sessions for all required classes each day, making sure your student is completing all work on time, and reaching out for support when needed.

If you are juggling the challenges of working, parenting, and schooling, and your child is meeting the obstacles head on, then you might just be our next surprise visit!

Keep up the good work for your chance to win! 💚 #weloveourfamilies #knightstrong",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1005054829944424&id=319390768510837,,0.0,"Hello Knights!

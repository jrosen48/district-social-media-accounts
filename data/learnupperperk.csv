The UPSD Transportation Department is excited to release our new Bus Status App, just in time for the New Year! Starting on January 2, 2020, this free app will be used as a communication tool that will provide students and parents the ability to receive push notifications to your smartphone or tablet about one particular bus, multiple buses or all the buses within just a few seconds.

The Bus Status App will be the quickest way for you to get updates on any bus delay, change or adjustment from the normal daily times and routes. Anyone can download the app including babysitters, grandparents or even older students themselves.

Once you download the Bus Status App, simply select your preferred bus(es) as a favorite and alerts will be sent directly to your phone or tablet (you might need to allow push notifications to your phone as well!)

More information is on our transportation webpage: http://www.upsd.org/departments/transportation",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2738389186218553&id=943532252370931,,0.0,"NEW TO UPSD IN 2020: BUS STATUS APP

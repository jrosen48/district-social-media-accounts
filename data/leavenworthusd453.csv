Making sure you're well-stocked on the essentials is smart with uncertainty about how COVID-19 social distancing recommendations could affect your daily routine and your family's needs. Regardless of how COVID-19 spreads, however, Leavenworth County will NOT order the closure of grocery stores or pharmacies.
So, buy what you need to provide for your family for up to two weeks for general preparedness. But there's no need to stock up for any more than that. A little consideration for our neighbors is going to go a long way as we get through this together. #KansasStrong",6.0,"Leavenworth County Health Department

LHS hosts an eastern region DECA competition with 13 schools and 450 students from the area. Students compete in career areas including business management, finance, hospitality, marketing, entrepreneurship, and personal financial literacy.

This certainly develops leaders and entrepreneurs, but more than that imparts lifelong skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, teamwork, and communication.

This event also serves as preparation for the state competition in March at KSU.

As posted on the LHS Raider page -
Sharing an incredible story here...so proud of our RAIDERS! Go Pioneers!

What an honor it is to coach theses incredible young men and women. Our future looks strong and determined.

It’s been a long road back to Nationals. We have been training to win the title since November 4, 2018. The Raiders have put in 100s of hours of practice with first place parents supporting us the whole way.

The hard work has paid off with a 3 and 0 season heading into the big event.

We believe in this team. They have what it takes to be National Champions.

Keep your head up. Eye on the prize. It’s time to turn it up and make all of you champions. Be proud of yourself and your team. You can do this!!

11 days and a wake up until we are headed to Georgia to earn the title!!!

As posted on the LHS Raider page -
Sharing an incredible story here...so proud of our RAIDERS! Go Pioneers!

What an honor it is to coach theses incredible young men and women. Our future looks strong and determined.

It’s been a long road back to Nationals. We have been training to win the title since November 4, 2018. The Raiders have put in 100s of hours of practice with first place parents supporting us the whole way.

The hard work has paid off with a 3 and 0 season heading into the big event.

We believe in this team. They have what it takes to be National Champions.

Keep your head up. Eye on the prize. It’s time to turn it up and make all of you champions. Be proud of yourself and your team. You can do this!!

11 days and a wake up until we are headed to Georgia to earn the title!!!

What a cool accomplishment! Way to go, Ayden Bartlett!

PrepVolleyball.com is proud to present its Senior Aces, the top 250 volleyball recruits in the Class of 2020.

Passing serve is a critical skill in the college game. Bartlett makes it look effortless. An absolute gamer in the back row, Bartlett has the ability to make opposing servers think the court is shrinking. While muscling up big-time digs in clutch moments is nothing new to her, it is Bartlett’s ball control and passing that separate her from other back row players throughout the country. Bartlett has been playing a year above her grade for the past several years in club ball. The respect earned from her older teammates for her tireless work allows her to be a vocal leader who delivers strategic communication to her hitters during every play. An Honorable Mention All-State setter for her high school team, Bartlett has impacted the game in myriad ways over the years. Following in a long line of big time liberos, she is heading to the University of Louisville to make the rest of the ACC think twice before serving her way.",0.0,"An amazing LHS senior...off to do great things in the future...

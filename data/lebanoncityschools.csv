It's the LAST DAY of school for the CLASS OF 2020! In the last couple years, LHS has established a new tradition for this day - the Through the Years Senior Farewell Tour. The seniors don their caps and gowns, load up on buses and visit every school. Students and teachers line the halls, hold up signs and cheer as the graduating seniors parade the hallways for the last time. We normally host this as a FB Live event. Obviously, the Farewell Tour can't happen in the way it normally does.

Congratulations goes out to Logan Moore, a current senior at Lebanon High School. Earlier in the Spring, Logan was named as a National Merit Finalist for Lebanon High School. Finalists represent the top 15,000 seniors (the top 1%) in the US based on performance on the PSAT, overall academic performance, and an application process. Logan has advanced from a semi-finalist to a finalist and should learn later this spring if he will be selected as a National Merit Scholar!

Logan has been accepted into the University of Cincinnati's College-Conservatory of Music (CCM). He intends to pursue a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) degree in Electronic Media (E-Media) and is contemplating an additional major/minor in Marketing.

I have been reading to my grandparents every day on FaceTime since March 16th. We spend an hour together reading. My brother and I take turns reading chapters and then my Grandpa reads to us. Here is a picture of us on FaceTime.
I'm glad you liked my picture. We all read different books. My brother (Anderson, Kindergartner at Bowman) and I both read different chapter books. My Grandpa likes to read mystery books to us. We have read about 20 books together over the past few weeks.

This is the seventh year in a row Lebanon has earned this distinction and the eighth time overall. Only 47 schools in Ohio were selected this year and a total of 754 districts were given this award nationally. The award is given based on overall involvement in the music program, the health of music offerings in the schools, administrative support and other demographic data related to performing arts.

We're fortunate to have a group of dedicated music teachers focused on bringing top quality musical experiences to our students and community. Congratulations to each of them and THANK YOU for continuing this tradition and bringing the joy of making music to our community.",2020-04-13 13:29:30,,

And what are they doing? How about this: preparing, packaging and delivering more than 73,000 meals to students all across the county during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“It is not an easy undertaking even for our most experienced staff members,” said child nutrition director Amanda Cagle, “but it's a labor of love for many.”

When the Scripps National Spelling Bee kicks off in May, Bryan Armstrong will be in Washington, D.C., representing Lee County Schools on the competition stage — thanks, in part, to Connemara.

It’s not only a type of stone and the region of Ireland where it's found, but “Connemara"" was the word that clinched Bryan’s victory, his trophy and an all-expense paid trip to the national bee.

So, how will he prepare for the big event? “I don't know,” said the West Lee Middle School sixth grader. “I'll probably read a lot of books.”

Sweet Carolina Chicken Bang Bang.

It’s a new dish the Southern Spice Girls created. And it’s what served them up fourth place in the 2020 North Carolina Jr. Chef Competition at Johnson and Wales University in Charlotte.

Carlee Dollar, Shaughnesty Dorsett, Jacora Murchison and Brianna McNeill — the culinary team from Southern Lee High School — got plenty of complements from the judges for a dish they worked long and hard to refine.

The first version was nasty, says Murchison. But the team worked hard — and what they created in the end was INSPIRED.

Becoming a National Board Certified teacher is not easy. It’s a distinction awarded only after a rigorous assessment. Not many professionals try, and even when they do, it can take years of work and several attempts to achieve the honor.

So when Lee County Schools has not just one ... not two ... not three ... not four ... not five ... but SIX teachers receiving National Board Certification in one year, it’s a really big deal.

Congratulations to Melanie Altman, Jessica Jackson and April Richardson of Tramway Elementary School; Cindy Kelly and Stephen Roman of Lee County High School; and Mary Beth Stec of Deep River Elementary School!

Read all about what it took and what it does for their students. And be INSPIRED!

When seniors returned to class after holiday break, you can only imagine their shock realizing that high school is almost over and a very different, possibly uncertain future is just ahead.

The good news is that all of their work over 13, 14, even 15 years is about to pay off. Because nine out of every 10 of them will leave high school with more than a diploma. For some, it means critical flexibility in college. For others, walking into a career without the time and cost of taking certification courses.

Last year’s high school graduates left with 43 college degrees, 1,485 career and technical credentials, and academic credit for 2,244 college classes. And there was even more, which makes all of us INSPIRED!

The final score wasn't what we hoped, but when the 3AA state championship ended, the Lee County High School Yellow Jackets had a lot to be proud of. They played hard. They represented the community well. And they learned some lessons for the future.

The community backed them all the way, too, something players and coaches appreciated. Senior wide receiver Tim Lett compared it to a popular TV show.

“It's crazy,” he said. “It's like on Friday Night Lights — the whole town is behind you. You have random people coming up to you. You don't know them, but they know you.”

Last Friday, Tucker Debo watched as a day of fun known as the “Winter Games” unfolded at Floyd L. Knight School. Nearly 80 JROTC students from Lee County High School, where Debo is a senior, visited the elementary campus for a day of fun, games and connecting with the school's special needs student body. Activities throughout the day included multiple sporting relay events in the gym – a basketball shoot, a “snowman bowling” event and several more – as well as arts and crafts activities in the school's classrooms.",0.0,"Lee County Schools added 9 new photos.

When Lee County High School's JROTC cadets marched into Floyd L. Knight School it wasn't for any formal ceremony. They were there to conduct ""Winter Games,"" a day of fun and games for the school's special needs students.

Senior Tucker Debo and Tyler Profio, now a midshipman the U.S. Naval Academy, came up with the idea to hold games in the gym and arts and crafts in classrooms.

All of it seems truly INSPIRED, but what sounded really cool is something called ""Snowman Bowling."" No, we're not sure exactly what snowman bowling looks like, but we've got a pretty entertaining idea in our mind. ⛄️🎳

Josephine Shelton has always had a knack for building things. So it was a logical move for her to enroll in Chris Garner's core construction class when she entered Lee County High School as a freshman. Shelton – now a junior – has not only completed that core class, but Masonry 1 as well, and will start Masonry 2 next semester. Shelton is now looking towards construction management as a career after taking Garner's classes, which is something Garner tries to teach his students about. “My main focus is to show these kids that they can learn a trade. Even if they don't want to do it for a living, it can still help them get to where they want to be. And if they do want to do it for a living, there are doors I can open for them.”",0.0,"Lee County Schools added 9 new photos from December 1, 2019.

Crockett's busy schedule was rewarded recently when the North Carolina Science Teachers Association named him the Outstanding Science Teacher of the Year for the state's fourth district, which includes Lee and 10 other counties. He was presented with the honor at the NCSTA's annual conference in Winston-Salem.",0.0,"Lee County Schools added 7 new photos.

Mrs. Schaefer’s class read “Change Makers” then decided that they too wanted to be change makers. As a class, they agreed to adopt the residents from Countrywood Plantation in Mantachie. They had a bake sale to raise money and then potted plants for them and bought blankets and other goodies. When they visited them to take their goodies, they read Dr. Seuss books to the residents in honor of his birthday! Lots of smiles and laughs were had by both the residents and her students.

Students first watched a biography video on Martin Luther King, Jr., and read a biography on Pablo Picasso. Classes had an open discussion about how different life was for the two men, as well as the similarities they shared.

Students viewed Pablo Picasso’s art piece “Bouquet of Peace,” discussed an article on its significance, and learned of Picasso’s role to create peace in the world.
Students then heard pieces of Martin Luther King, Jr.’s famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech. They discussed specific quotes from his speech that spoke to students personally about peace.

Classes later created their own “Bouquet of Flowers” collage, patterned after Picasso's work.
Once they completed their pieces, students selected a portion of King's speech to write on cards that were placed on their flowers.

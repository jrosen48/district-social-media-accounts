Two days ago I was notified by David Luther from MOSPRA that I received the Missouri School Public Relations Association, Administrator of the Year Award.

Patty Cox, Kelly Fleming, Joanie Shackelford, Jessica Shaffer, Jennifer Corson, and Heather Shaffer. This is a wonderful group of ladies that jumped in with both feet when I asked them to be a part of my PR team.

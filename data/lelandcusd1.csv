LET'S HEAR IT FOR OUR GRADUATES

I know in the big scheme of things, this is NOT a big problem.

But, I would like to give a shout out to all the grade school, high school, and college students who might be missing out on graduation and many other milestones this spring.

My daughter is one of those kids, so I thought I would post some photos of her as a first grader and as a senior. Parents or graduates, feel free to post yours here or at WGN Morning News Facebook page and we will show them on the air this spring.

You have until 2/27/2020 to order your gear. Even though our HS baseball team is sponsoring the store, the gear is appropriate for ANY Leland Baseball fan! We are currently trying to add some youth sizes, as well. Make sure to check back for details! https://www.bsnteamsports.com/shop/20PANTHBB

ALSO - be sure to get your Leland kids registered for summer baseball/softball/t-ball. Registration is open for that until 3/2/2020 as the LYAA will need to get rosters into the leagues. Even though the onsite registration is over, you can still register online at www.lyaa.org.

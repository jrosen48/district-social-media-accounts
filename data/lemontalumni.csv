Lemont High School's Creative Writing students had a special treat on a Friday afternoon... a double Google Meet in the #CITGOInnovationAcademy with two accomplished alums! The class had a chance to chat with Ed Kulzer '96 and his sister, Alex Fletcher (that's her pseudonym; she was Tracy Kulzer '95). Ed, who joined the chat from New York, has had a diverse career in the creative arts. He recently won an ""Outstanding Multiple Camera Editing"" Emmy for his work on Sesame Street! Alex, who took part in the conversation from Los Angeles, has enjoyed a successful writing career. Her trilogy - ""Light as a Feather"" - not only was picked up by Simon & Schuster for publication, but recently made into a television series by Hulu (Light as a Feather- Hulu)! Our students certainly benefited from hearing how Ed and Alex have used their creative gifts to succeed! Their mom, Patricia LaPorte, sat in on the session with the students... likely beaming with pride! #GoLemont #BlueRibbonSchool #ILSchoolStories",0.0,"Very cool stuff.... an awesome opportunity for our students to talk with two successful Lemont High School alums! #GoLemont #BlueRibbonSchool

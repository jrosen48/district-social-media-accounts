My life has been altered quite a bit from the coronavirus. Sports have been canceled which I was really looking forward to. School is now online, which is going alright but it’s just not the same. I really wish we could go back to school because teachers can then explain things and you can ask them questions in person. Also, I won’t get to finish my 8th-grade year in school, and we can’t take pictures at the end of the school year. Almost everything is closed and we have to stay home. It’s just boring having every day even the weekends be exactly the same. My level of appreciation for life as we used to know it has gone up tremendously. I’ve learned to not take things for granted and to appreciate everything we have. In the blink of an eye, everything can change so just appreciate everything you have and are able to do is what I’ve mainly learned from this.

Natali is committed to providing a safe place for the children in her care. As a child, school was her solace, and she wants to provide the same loving, nurturing, and supportive environment that she knows will change their world for the better – as it did for her. Positive interactions and relationships are her priority, not only with her students but also their families. Every child has the capacity to learn and thrive, and her philosophy rests upon helping children find their unique connection to what they are learning.

Congratulations Natali!",0.0,"Every year, Child360 honors outstanding early educators throughout Los Angeles County with the Annual Child360 Early Educator of the Year Awards.

International Woman's Day is Celebrated once a year on March 8 and the month of March is recognized as Women's History Month. This year, our Felton Parent Volunteers were inspired by a quote, ""Here's to strong women, may we know them, may we be them, may we raise them."" They wanted to share that message with Felton girls to remind them that they can be whatever they set their minds to.

Volunteers collaborated with Parent Liaison Karen Rodriguez and Library Technician Maria Fernandez to host an arts and craft activity this week. After learning about influential women in history, students wrote words on flower petals to describe girls and women, putting them together to create a flower. Most girls shared that they were thinking about their moms. Very heartwarming!

From individual counseling to conflict resolution circles and scheduling students, Aura Martinez, Diana Jimenez, and Carlos Ramirez are always available to help students. All three LMS counselors are committed to working together to meet the unique needs of adolescent children. They are vital members of the LMS management team and students and staff members alike count on them for their calming presence and sage advice. They are thankful for having the opportunity to work within a great leadership team because everyone is supportive and they can all count on each other.

When speaking to them, they all shared that the most rewarding part of the job is to see the students grow throughout middle school and work towards their goals. Aura, Diana, and Carlos - thank you for guiding our students through their adolescence and helping them overcome barriers to reach their goals. You are very appreciated!

Lessons are designed with the children’s stages of development in mind. The Counseling Center has been equipped with puppets, games, books, crafts, and posters that creates a safe and caring environment. For example, last week the hot cocoa cup mindfulness lesson was delivered to the students. The objective of the lesson is for students to learn the definition of mindfulness, participate in a mindfulness exercise, and be able to identify at least two things that bring them joy.

Ms. Arce leads the students through a calm and soothing exercise. Students learned to breathe in through their nose and out through their mouth. By the end of the exercise, students were relaxed, calm, and were opened minded. Thank you Ms. Arce for helping our students build invaluable skills they can use inside and outside of the classrooms!

For example, she motivates and supports student challenges through daily responsibility contracts tailored to the needs of each child. The responsibility contract strengthens the partnership between counselor, teacher, and student. The consistency of the daily contracts promotes student organization and responsibility, allowing Ms. Romero to focus on individual student success plans.

Once a student reaches 10 days of ""perfect"" completed responsibility contracts, they celebrate with a small pizza lunch party in their honor. The ultimate goal is to develop excellent student habits that will become intrinsic and lead to long-term student academic success.

“By forming connected relationships with caring adults, students are able to grow, heal, and maximize their potential as lifelong learners,” Emily says. Because of this belief, Emily founded the Juntos Wellness Center in 2012 with a vision of strengthening opportunities for students to get the social-emotional support they need and deserve.

Just for fun: On rainy days, everything and anything can happen! Pictured here is Emily guiding students to their classrooms after they had lunch. With the rain coming down so hard, she makes sure to bring a large umbrella to help keep the students dry. Thank you, Emily, for all that you do!

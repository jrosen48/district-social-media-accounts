As part of DXs continuing mission to further Diversity and Inclusivity through Education, we are thrilled to share that DX has committed to an annual $2,500 scholarship at Leonia High School to a student of color who exemplifies excellence in their studies, excellence in their extra-curricular activities, excellence to their community, and who will be seeking a STEAM degree in college.

This year, we are proud to have awarded the first DXcellence Award to Alyssa who will be attending NYU in the fall to study theater and music. With a 4.3 GPA and commitments to DECA and National Honors Society, Alyssa is part of the fabric of her school, yet she also takes the bus each day from Fort Lee into the city to volunteer and sings with the Young People’s Chorus of NYC. Good luck at NYU next year Alyssa!",0.0,"Very nicely done!

Good morning members of the Leonia community,
As you may know, on Wednesday the Governor revise his executive order allowing for 100% online digital distance learning for the upcoming school year as a method of instruction. As a result, several schools have revise their plans; some pushing back the start date of school, some going fully digital and some revising their hybrid plan.

The Leonia school district will be continuing with our hybrid in person learning for those who chose that method of instruction for their child. To avoid an every other day schedule, we added slight modification to our plan. Please Click on the link to read more. Notification will be sent out via E blast later today.

Last week the student leaders from the Senate met with Mr. Sernatinger and me to discuss showing their appreciation for all the work the staff at LHS does throughout the year, and especially during the time of distance learning. They decided to put together a video for the staff to show their appreciation since they couldn't show you in person. In addition, the Home & School Association, on behalf of the parents of LHS wanted to include their own show of gratitude for what the teachers have done for their students. I hope you enjoy this amazing video the students created. I would like to give a special thank you to senior Darya Ameri, for editing the video and to Julia Greenberg, Azra Schorr, Allison Nakajima, Lauren Oh, Julia Principe, and Maddie Racciatti all helped coordinate the students and planning of the video.

Lion Pride
April 23 at 3:52 PM ·

Hello Leonia and Edgewater Residents! We are a group of sophomores from Leonia High School (Julia Vazquez, Anthony DeCicco, Olivia Aloi, Sofia Principe, and Blake Klein) who are eager to help those struggling in our community. During a time of great stress and uncertainty, we created Lion Pride as a way to give back to those in need. We will be selling t-shirts and lawn signs that support this cause. All proceeds will be donated to local food banks that support both Leonia and Edgewater. Moreover, our goal is to also help our many small businesses in the area. We have faith that our community will take this opportunity to think of our fellow neighbors. Our sales will start soon, spread the word!!

We are certainly in challenging times, in terms of education, our health and personal finances. Some of you have reached out to me to request assistance because of the loss of revenue in your households.
After speaking to the members of the Board of Education, we have agreed to stop any additional payments for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year. The June payment, already paid, will be used to partially fund the program.
Dr. Martinez and the Pre-K teachers are providing engaging lessons for their students. Although distance learning is not equal to in-classroom instruction, it provides students with structure and learning opportunities during the self-quarantine.

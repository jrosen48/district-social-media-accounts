The school shorthand names are case sensitive. Also, be sure to include the dash (-) in-between the school initials and lunch pin.

The First Day of School for students has been pushed back to Wednesday, August 19th. Teachers will return on the 12th and have an opportunity to attend CANVAS training sessions on the 10th and 11th.

Masks will be required on buses, during class transitions and when not able to social distance 6 feet. Most classrooms will not have 6 feet of social distancing and parents should expect their children to wear masks in these cases. Schools will get creative in providing opportunities for students to have ""mask breaks"" to take the masks off in secure locations.

When a student or staff member tests positive we will notify the appropriate audiences and work with the Leon County Health Department to contact trace, decide if quarantines are required and discuss possible classroom or other closures. Each situation will be handled individually to decide the safest and best decision based on the facts of the positive case.

CoronaVirus 2019 / Re-Open Leon Schools",210.0,"Re-Open Leon Schools Overview:

The First Day of School for students has been pushed back to Wednesday, August 19th. Teachers will return on the 12th and have an opportunity to attend CANVAS training sessions on the 10th and 11th.

Masks will be required on buses, during class transitions and when not able to social distance 6 feet. Most classrooms will not have 6 feet of social distancing and parents should expect their children to wear masks in these cases. Schools will get creative in providing opportunities for students to have ""mask breaks"" to take the masks off in secure locations.

When a student or staff member tests positive we will notify the appropriate audiences and work with the Leon County Health Department to contact trace, decide if quarantines are required and discuss possible classroom or other closures. Each situation will be handled individually to decide the safest and best decision based on the facts of the positive case.

Please visit https://www.leonschools.net/reopenleon for more information about the plans to re-open schools in August.

I would like to give a huge thank you to our local community for quickly springing into action and creating these awesome 3D printed ""ear saving bands"". The TMH ER will use these daily. Special thanks to Cobb Middle School, specifically: Principle Sarah Hembree, 6th grade STEM teacher Hannah Acree, 6-8th grade Technology teacher Kacey Yu, and Mark Graham 6th grade STEM teacher. Also Margaret Ely for organizing with the school.

I hope to thank each of you personally when this is all over.",2020-04-12 17:07:13,,

WCTV teams up with Leon County Schools and Second Harvest of the Big Bend each year to collect peanut butter and jelly for hungry children, but with our schools closed and so many families struggling, WCTV wants to do more.

The money raised this year will go to buy peanut butter and jelly and a variety of other healthy, kid-friendly foods that can be distributed to hungry children right away.

Second Harvest will even be able to quadruple the buying power of your donation by buying foods like peanut butter, mac and cheese, cereal, milk and juice in bulk. That means your $5 donation has the buying power of $20 and your $10 donation has the buying power of $40.

PBJ PLUS! is a virtual, quick and easy way to help over 20,000 children in our area who are food insecure.

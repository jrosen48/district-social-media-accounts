Littleton Elementary School District #65 hosted a Tunnel of Hope drive-thru eighth grade promotion parade last weekend. The PTA gave each student a gift bag. Students also got a yard sign and the wire to put it in their yard, along with a flashdrive with a promotion video and highlights from the past year. Families drove their cars decorated in school spirt through the balloon arch as staff cheered for each student.

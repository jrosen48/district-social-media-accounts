Today, Governor Whitmer signed an Executive Order, which has stopped face-to-face instruction and closed school buildings for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year. The Executive Order states school districts are to develop and implement a continuing instruction plan for students. The staff at Leslie Public Schools has begun working on developing such a plan. We have not worked out all the details to this plan but will as soon as possible. Many of you responded to a technology survey this week. This information is needed to help us develop our plan. Thank you for responding to the survey.

I know that the Executive Order creates a lot of questions. We are doing our best to follow every aspect. As we get more information, we will pass it on to you.

At this time, please follow the Stay Home and Stay Safe directive, practice social distancing, and wash your hands as often as possible.

Thank you,

Traveling (with all my masks and lots of hand sanitizer!) to see family and friends has been a highlight of my summer. Reggie has been a great travel buddy, too! I even made a new friend (a pony) named Starlight.

Did you know that even though there will be no Minnesota State Fair this year, you can still find food vendors popping up around the Twin Cities? And I have made a few stops and practiced social distancing by eating some delicious food in my car (fried pickles pictured here!).

I got a chance to read an amazing book that I would recommend to everyone, called the Birchbark House by Louise Erdrich. When I brought it with me camping I had no idea that the story took place on Madeline Island. I actually got to read the book on a beach with Madeline Island in the distance.

Sending best wishes to everyone for a wonderful summer so far.

I have been enjoying the warm weather by going on kayaking and swimming adventures with my family. Even my pug Oskar who usually doesn’t like water has joined us!
One thing I’ve been doing more of is taking pictures in nature if I’m on a bike ride or walk. Here’s one of the moon on a beautiful evening.

Enjoy your summer and I look forward to seeing you soon and am excited to begin the school year!

We are normalizing difficult at LUA. ✨

Why? Because to some children 'difficult' gives the impression that

""This is not for me."" Or

""I must not belong."" Or

""I'm not smart enough."" Or

""This is a sign that I should stop.""

We, however, know that difficult means ""I will have to give my greatest effort repeatedly over time. I will have to be persistent!"" ✨

Teachers will share personal stories of how they overcame something difficult with persistence. ✨

Perhaps you will consider doing this at home as well! ✨

Lewis Cass Schools is hosting an elementary / middle robotics tournament on November 2nd. We need parents who would willingly support their little kings by volunteering some time. Before you say, I don't know anything about robotics....you truly do not need to know anything about robotics to fill the spots. You can be trained in about 5 minutes in the morning/afternoon of the event. For instance, scoring is just tapping the screen and it adds the score up for you. You will get to work with elementary students from all over the state. The tournament runs from 8 to 4, but you can do a morning or afternoon slots. If you can do an afternoon slot that would be awesome as it harder to fill those slots. You will get lunch AND be helping out your little kings here at Cass.

If you would be interested in helping, please fill out the parent volunteer form below. If you have any questions, feel free to email me. Its great to be a King!

Before you say, I don't know anything about robotics....you truly do not need to know anything about robotics to fill the spots. You can be trained in about 5 minutes in the morning/afternoon of the event. For instance, scoring is just tapping the screen and it adds the score up for you. You will get to work with elementary students from all over the state. The tournament runs from 8 to 4, but you can do a morning or afternoon slots. If you can do an afternoon slot that would be awesome as it harder to fill those slots. You will get lunch AND be helping out your little kings here at Cass.

If you would be interested in helping, please fill out the parent volunteer form below. If you have any questions, feel free to email me. Its great to be a King!

Hopefully everyone has seen the last communication from DK. We are moving ahead to reopen on June 22 for summer. I am just now getting a feel for the numbers interested and will have final restrictions from the state for June next week. Every option avail to us will be used BUT we are working thru the 5 pages of restrictions that are currently in place.

Unfortunatly family's that attend will be charged full time weekly rates whether they are in attendance or not. We will most definitely have to limit the number of students. We will not be able to accept any new enrollments and the full time, full year students will be admitted first. . We want to be sure we open up to as many as we can handle safely. Yes, our program will look very different with no field trips, swimming and play equip. Hopefully those restrictions are waived soon. Please be assured if you can find other arrangements for summer, your position for the fall will still be available. If you have any questions, please feel free to email me.",0.0,"LCLC info ‚¨áÔ∏è

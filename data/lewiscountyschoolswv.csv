The Marching Minutemen keeping it classy!

From Adam Loudin...
The LCHS Band only had a few hours to rehearse this week in preparation for tonight’s game against Elkins.

Allen Heath chose to spend some of that time teaching the Elkins High School fight song to the band. The game was supposed to be a home game for Elkins and had to be played at Lewis County due to safety issues with Elkins’ facility. Mr. Heath felt the Elkins team deserved to hear their fight song played and I couldn’t agree more.

A true display of class and sportsmanship. Bravo!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1508524372667488&id=518057041714231,"Krista Adkins is with Emily Thompson and 4 others.
20 hrs ·

Just another example of why LC Marching Minutemen are some of the best people I have ever worked alongside.

Tonight, the #lcmarchingminutemen volunteered to play the Elkins fight song so their team and fans would feel supported in tough times.

Beyond proud of these incredible young people and the staff leading them.

To the Elkins Tiger Band, we tip our hat to you and the adversity you have faced this season.

To our Tigerette friends, thanks for entrusting us with your routine.

Here is the snapshot of what school will look like upon re-entry from a student's perspective. Of course, guidelines will change as we navigate this uncharted territory. Please know that school officials are still working out logistics, and policies are fluid with the ever-changing COVID situation.

Please be patient with all of us. There will be questions. Some that can be answered; some that may not have an absolute answer. There will be changes, modifications, and adjustments.

However, what you must remember, is that we are all doing our best during the biggest educational crisis of our lifetime.

Many thanks to all who made this video possible. A big thanks to Mr. Whiston, Vincent Snuffer, Lily Garton, Allison McWhorter, Brian Fisher, and Dustin Cogar. And, as with most things, there are lots of behind-the-scenes-people who keep us all afloat. Many thanks to all who have worked tirelessly to give our students the best and safest education possible.

Today was my first day at the school in awhile. It just so happens that I heard this Fred Rogers tune “Sometimes People Are Good” for the first time the other day and it knocked me out.

Manchin, FCC Commissioner Rosenworcel Encourage Lewis County High School To Submit Speed Tests During COVID-19 Pandemic | U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia

May 14 at 2:10 PM ·

Today in West Virginia, many places still don’t have good connectivity, broadband, even cell service. This problem is especially urgent right now as students rely on broadband access to continue their schoolwork during the coronavirus pandemic. That’s why Federal Communications Commission Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel and I are partnering with the students and faculty at Lewis County High School to bring attention to the lack of high-speed broadband internet in rural West Virginia.

We visited Lewis County High School in October to discuss broadband access, and the importance of conducting speed tests in order to create accurate coverage maps for rural states like West Virginia. Now, we are calling on students to visit manchin.senate.gov/speedtest, complete a speed test, and submit their information so I can show the FCC their maps are just plain wrong, and so we can make federal funding available to bring high-speed broadband coverage where it’s needed most.

This instruction is only for households that believe they would now qualify for free/reduced meals.

We want to encourage you to complete an application even though schools are doing remote learning – because federal benefit programs that are becoming available due to COVID-19 may be tied to your child’s free/reduced price meal status. If at any time your situation changes, you may contact the board office or update your meal pricing application in School Café.

Hello, Wildcats!!

The staff members at PCES have missed you greatly and would like to ""see"" you even from a distance. Next Tuesday, April 14th, we are organizing a staff parade beginning at 1:00 PM.

The parade route will be traveling down Berlin Road, back to Quarry Glen Apartments, to Horner, hopefully in behind a High Rise-John Street, over East Weston Hill, through McGary area, through town, Broad Street, out to Pricetown Fire Dept and back around the hospital.

Please note the date and time are weather permitting but we hope to see each of our Wildcat families out in full force and of course practicing appropriate social distancing! Our staff members will be traveling from the safety of their individual cars and we ask that you maintain your own distance as well and do not congregate in a group. Your safety is extremely important!

Three Little Pigs Unit:
This week we studied the different variations of Three Little Pigs! In The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs we had the chance to listen to Mr. Wolf’s side of the story. The kids and I still think that his story isn’t the truth. We then read the story The Three Little Wolves and the Big Bar Pig! The kids definitely found this to be their favorite variation. We used the Double Bubble Map to compare and contrast this story with the original Three Little Pigs ! Our last variation of the Three Little Pigs was the story Three Ninja Pigs! Throughout the week our kids worked through several stations in which they had to use their creativity and knowledge of the story to complete the activity. Our students designed houses on paper to keep the big bad wolf out! We used the Fairy Tale STEM kits to build a house for our 3 little pigs and today they built houses out of DOTS, marshmallow and toothpicks! Another successful unit packed full of learning, fun and creativity!",0.0,"Leading Creek Elementary School

Tomorrow, March 9, LCHS will celebrate WV's signing of the 19th Amendment. Thanks to Mrs. Joanna Barnette and her team of helpers, we will have a special program for students. All are encouraged to participate by wearing 1920's attire, and if you are stumped as to what to wear, choose purple. Here is a little background of three of WV's pioneering women suffragettes.

The freshman class is being led to initiate positive school climate by community and staff volunteers as well as junior and senior students who participated in Grace Training under the direction of Pete Bryant and Scott Pagel from Building Hope. This initiative is encouraging students to “Be the Difference”. The goal by the end of the day is to know your classmates better. They are hoping to break stereotype molds by not making generalized assumptions.

Good Morning, Wildcats!!

Our school wide book “Cam Jansen and the Snowy Day Mystery” kicked off with quite the mystery this morning. Please click below for a video of the kickoff. A separate post will include individual photos.

Each student in grades Pre-K through fourth received a copy of the book. We are asking that parents / guardians read one chapter per night with their children. Prior to starting the school day, Mr. Hall will ask a question about the assigned chapter as well as the questions will be posted here. There will be prizes for correct answers as well as a plethora of activities and lessons coordinated around our book and the mystery theme.

Please take this opportunity and participate as a family by reading along each evening and helping PCES crack the mystery!!",0.0,"Peterson-Central Elementary School

Next week was supposed to be our Homegoing week. Student Council would like to have some virtual fun and have our dress up days anyway. We invited the 6th graders so they can start in on the Homegoing and Homecoming competition!

Here are our days:

Monday: 'Merica-no school this day but it honors Memorial Day
Tuesday: Beach day
Wed: Sports day
Thur: Out and About in Nature
Fri: Spirit Day

This is a pre-homecoming competition, submit a picture of your outfit by noon each day to Mrs. Spencer (espencer@lewalt.k12.mn.us). Mrs. Spencer will then send out a form link at 3:00 for everyone to vote on their favorite picture voting ends at 11:00 am the next day. Winner receives their choice of prizes including activities passes, tshirts, ala cart gift cards, and many others in the fall. The grade with the most overall wins will receive 5 homecoming points toward winning homecoming and owning the spirit stick next year. I know seniors the prizes don't really do much for you, but we would love to see you dress up anyway!

Just this weekend most families have received the 2020-21 School Calendar. Please note there is a misprint within the calendar regarding the month of March and the first week of Spring Break. First issue, March has 31 days not 30 as indicated in the calendar. Secondly, Spring Break is currently scheduled for March 27th through April 11th with school resuming on Monday April 12th. If you look at the calendar you will notice only the second week is shaded. Spring Break is a full two weeks barring any changes or directives from the Governor’s office. We apologize for any confusion.

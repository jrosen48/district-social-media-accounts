Starting tomorrow, staff will begin or continue the process of touching base with families and students, checking in on their wellbeing and collecting information about possible resource needs that families may have. We know that maintaining the skills and knowledge that students have gained this year is important, and we recognize that remote learning is not the same as homeschooling or in-class learning. As a District, we are committed to rolling out remote learning slowly, as we continue to address the needs of all of our learners. Over the coming weeks, students and families can expect to hear from teachers and staff through calls, texts and online means.

We recognize that showing one another flexibility and grace in these times is even more important than other times, and, working together, we will do our very best to support our children with their education and wellness.

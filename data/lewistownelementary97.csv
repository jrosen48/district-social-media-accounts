Sadly, we cannot all be together to celebrate our teachers at school this week, but that does not mean we can't celebrate them from home! When I was teaching I would have my students write letters to their favorite teacher that made a positive impact in their life. I would like to add that as an assignment for our students this week. The teachers have always loved getting the friendly notes in the past and I am sure it will bring a smile to their faces.

If you would like to mail the letters to the school I will make sure they get to the teachers. The school address is 15501 E.

Mrs. Reed needs your help! My tree bulletin board has been decorated all year with student-made artwork. I would like to change my cover photo from winter, but I still would like student-made artwork.

I would like to spell SPRING using people and here is where the help is needed. I will be having a contest and combining the letters to spell Spring for my cover photo on my Facebook page.

How to enter?
1. Take a photo of your child/children making a letter with their body. (Choose any letter - S, P, R, I, N, G and can be upper or lowercase and can be standing or laying on the ground)
2. Post your photo below in the comments before Sunday night (April 5) at midnight.
3. At least one person in the photo needs to be a K-4 student at Lewistown Central Elementary. (The entire family can join in too!)
4. Photos can be taken indoors or outdoors.
5. An example is in the comments below.
6. I will choose the best photo for each letter and combine them to make my cover photo until summer.

Good luck & thanks for your help!",0.0,"Mrs. Reed's Music Room

198,3.0,,18.0,,2285906261652499,"Winter has officially arrived! Please remember that children need the appropriate winter attire when waiting at a bus stop. Temperatures are expected to dip below zero in the next several days. Students should wear heavy coats, hats, gloves/mittens, and warm footwear. If you are unable to supply any of these items for your child, please contact your child’s teacher. We will do our best to provide what you need.

Tips on appropriate dress for cold weather:

*Wear several layers, the layer of air between each piece of clothing acts as extra insulation.
*Wear clothing that insulates, shields and breathes. Wool and polypropylene are good insulators.
*Outer layers should be wind and waterproof.
*Wear wool socks and well-fitting waterproof boots.
*Wear a hat to prevent heat loss.
*In most cases, mittens are warmer than gloves.
*In extreme cold, cover all areas of exposed skin.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2285906261652499&id=1935692363340559,,0.0,"Winter has officially arrived!

Hope you're enjoying your summer. Though it's likely that school is the furthest thing from your mind, I would like some input from the students on what next school year may look like.
A group of administrators and teachers have been working on plans for this coming fall. An important part of our planning is gathering the opinions of those involved.
Please spread the word that a student survey has been sent out through school email. I would like to have as many students as possible complete the survey in the next 24 hours.

The Eagle Walk is a recent tradition for graduating seniors to be recognized and put their achievement on display. This year we are doing things a little differently because of COVID-19. Instead of parading Seniors through the elementary and junior high schools, we are going to parade through the streets of Lewistown. Please join in on the celebration and wave to the seniors on Wednesday, May 20th as a police escort leads them along the route in the attached picture. Rain or shine, the parade will begin from the high school at 12pm. See you there!

The planned route is to: start at FHS parking lot, down Brassey to 1st street, turn left and go to Main street, down Main to Entrance street just past Subway and turn right, take Entrance down to Boulevard and follow Boulevard to 7th Ave, turn left on 7th Ave and go past Highland Park to the truck bypass, turn right on truck bypass and follow back to Brassey, turn right and head back to the high school.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2986351288121956&id=564885523601890,,0.0,"Fergus High School

Lexington Three made the decision to move the graduation ceremony from Friday night to Saturday morning in an effort to preserve the longstanding tradition of graduates receiving their diplomas on the high school football field.

The reasoning behind this is that it's less likely for storms to develop during the morning hours as opposed to evenings during the summer months.

B-L High School is one of three statewide finalists vying for the prestigious title in the high school division. The school was chosen to enter the final round of the competition following a rigorous 20-page application process and an extensive on-campus evaluation by the Palmetto’s Finest Awards Committee back in November. The school underwent its final on-campus evaluation by the Palmetto's Finest Committee early this Spring.

Regardless of today's outcome, BLHS is already a winner in our books as it's an extremely high honor to have gotten this far in the Palmetto's Finest selection process.

Since we can't be together this year in person to properly honor our employees, we are asking that local businesses, restaurants, churches, etc. post a note of encouragement to our Panther staff members on their roadside or business signs, if possible.

Our wonderful employees always work hard for our students, but they've been going above and beyond since the middle of March to ensure that learning has not stopped despite our school closures.

We appreciate your help in advance and would love to see signs flood the town of Batesburg-Leesville during Staff Appreciation Week! Our employees are truly educational heroes!

Thank you, Jennifer Richardson, for writing this awesome poem!
Thank you, Ashley Fort, for narrating it!

We love our B-L Panthers!

(The poem can also be found below.)

Once upon a time, in a town so far and dear.
There was a small school, whose students had no fear.
For they were mighty Panthers, who stood tall and proud.
And never cowered down in the face of a crowd.
They worked hard in school each day, and as the years went by.
They realized their school had given them the power to try.
Many years went by, and students grew up tall.
But then they had children, who returned when they were small.
For the love of the Panther Nation is something that is strong.
And with the roar of a B-L Panther, you cannot go wrong.
Happy Birthday B-L Panthers, for this is your 100th year.
And with students just like these, we have nothing to ever fear.",,,0.0,"We shared this video a few weeks ago, but one of our staff members wrote a poem to go along with it and WOW IS ALL WE CAN SAY.

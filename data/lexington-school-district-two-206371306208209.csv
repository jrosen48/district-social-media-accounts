Happy Friday!

We are SO excited to have our B day students in the building on Tuesday morning and have created a video that will answer LOTS of questions!

Our faculty worked very hard to make sure that everyone is informed of all of the things students and parents need to know before starting school next week.

The video is about 15 minutes long, but I promise it will not disappoint!

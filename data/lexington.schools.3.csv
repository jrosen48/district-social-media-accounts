As I've shared in every communication, the situation with COVID-19 is changing daily (often multiple times). The LCHD has issued a Public Health Resolution. It is recommended that the school start date be postponed until September 14th in Lafayette County. In addition, this resolution states all sports are to be discontinued for the fall semester/term as it is impossible to safely conduct these activities using Covid-19 prevention recommendations. The trends for our area will be analyzed mid-October to determine if our rates are low enough to safely resume sporting activities.

Lexington R-V will comply with this guidance. We are working on calendar and other adjustments needed. More information will be provided as it becomes available. Thank you for your continued support and understanding as we work through this together.

Even though I never had the pleasure of meeting you, you left your mark on your class. They are stronger because of the lessons you helped to teach them. They are more compassionate and caring because of your loss. They will never forget you and would want you to be apart of every bit of this year. You will always be in their minds and their hearts. I wish I would have had the opportunity to be your principal, but I do know this....You left your mark on this world.

T-roy you have made it. I have enjoyed watching you grow as a person the past 3 years. You are always willing to be a friend to a person in need or enlist to serve our country. You have the world by the horns, make sure you control it instead of it controlling you. I have loved watching you in athletics for the past 3 years. Whether your dreams of being QB1 was realized or your ability to play O-Line at 190lbs, I always appreciated your heart. Keep that determination. Remember to always have a new pair of boots for dressing up and sometimes it is important to tuck in your shirt.

Kaylor you are apart of an exclusive club. You are in the ""Chicken Sandwich Bandits"". Only a few people will know what that means, but it was a memorable part of our fall during XC. I will always appreciate how hard you worked on the athletic field and I know that you will do great things in your life. Work hard and take your dreams.

There are times in life where you shake your head and ask ""why"" and the answer is sometimes ""just because"". These statements are true to who you are. You enjoy taking life to the limit and then back. I appreciate your ability to smile in most situations and then to think about how to help make it better. I will miss the times where you would come to my office just to ""poke the bear"". Please remember, it is ok to show people that you care all of the time. It is not weakness. You have a kind heart, make sure you show it to the world.

Thank you for being you. You are a great young man and I have been impressed with you from day 1. I will miss our talks before Golf this spring. I will miss your determination on the Football field, but most of all I will miss your ability to help a person in need and problem solve when needed. I have no doubts that you are going to change the world. Go get it!

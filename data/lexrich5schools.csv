The change comes as a result of a new federal and state-approved waiver, allowing districts to distribute meals ‚Äúto a parent or guardian to take home to their children.""

Parents will be required to show their students' ID cards, if they have them. If they do not have them, they will be required to sign their name and list their children‚Äôs names in order to receive the meals.

The Fenton Arts Council and the Cause & Affect Gallery are collaborating to bring a NEW 3-part ART exhibit to downtown Fenton. We are currently looking for images of student artwork to be in the virtual part of the professional exhibit. Any local student in grades Pre-K through High School is eligible to participate. Simply take a picture of the art piece and submit it through the link below. It's Easy!

Here are a few tips:
Phone photos are fine.
Try placing the art on a dark background for the photo.
Take a few photos of the same art, using different lights, and choose the best to send.
Try to have the camera, or camera phone, shoot the piece straight-on, not at an angle.
If you can, try shooting outside, in the shade.

The exhibit opens July l0, so we need lots of student art in time to put the images into a virtual sideshow.

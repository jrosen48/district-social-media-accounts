Work will not be returned until your teacher lets you know of a need to return it. Teachers will continue to monitor students completing Waterford (PK – 1st), and Prodigy & Epic (2nd grade).

Thank you also for being patient with the calls in order to determine the best manner to provide continued learning.

The purpose of this message is to clarify the schedule for TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2020, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 2020, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 2020, and FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 2020.

There are no classes today, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2020.

We will follow a regular schedule on WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 2020 and THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 2020, as originally scheduled, unless conditions warrant a schedule change.

This FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 2020, was originally scheduled as a FOCUS FRIDAY.

However, because we canceled classes on TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2020, we will have a regular school day on FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 2020.

All students are required to attend school for a full day on FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 2020.



If you have any questions please call Central Office (806-385-3844) for clarification.

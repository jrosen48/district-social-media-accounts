I hope this finds you safe and healthy. I want you to know that we all miss you very much. I have come across a really fun activity that I wanted to share with you all. In the words of Dr. Seuss The more that you READ, the more things you will KNOW. The more that you LEARN, the more places you'll GO. Are you ready for a fun reading challenge? Are you ready to read here or there? Are you ready to read everywhere? I challenge you to check off as many as you can and email a picture of yourself reading in these various places to Ms. Malpass at kmalpass@lfapa.org, so she can post them on Facebook. Have fun reading and learning, we cannot wait to see the places and books you are reading. We hope to see you soon. Take care and stay healthy.

I hope this finds you safe and healthy. I want you to know that we all miss you very much. I have come across a really fun activity that I wanted to share with you all. In the words of Dr. Seuss The more that you READ, the more things you will KNOW. The more that you LEARN, the more places you'll GO. Are you ready for a fun reading challenge? Are you ready to read here or there? Are you ready to read everywhere? I challenge you to check off as many as you can and email a picture of yourself reading in these various places to Ms. Malpass at kmalpass@lfapa.org, so she can post them on Facebook. Have fun reading and learning, we cannot wait to see the places and books you are reading. We hope to see you soon. Take care and stay healthy.

I hope you are healthy and well. Service is a fun and rewarding way to keep you and the kids engaged while they are at home.

A few fun ideas are collecting food for your local food bank, clean up litter at your park, send thank you pictures and letters to service members, local resident nursing homes, and first responders, do some yard work for your neighbors. Here is a link for some more ideas.

https://kidworldcitizen.org/35-service-projects-for-kids/

Also, if you are running out of books to read at home, I like to read books through the Hoopla app or www.hoopladigital.com website. All you need is a Maricopa County public library card. With that you can check out books digitally for free. Google Books https://books.google.com/ is another free resource that requires just a computer or a phone. Another fun site is freerice.com. Kids can play educational games and the organization will donate rice to the World Food Programme. They can have fun and learn while doing a bit of service.

Take Care and I hope to see you soon!!

Kids spend a lot of time and effort on their drawings. What happens, however, when they aren’t allowed to see what they are drawing?
For this challenge, you are going to need to give your child a pencil and a piece of paper. Next, each kid will wear a blindfold and then attempt to draw an object of their own choosing. To help the game go a little faster, you can have selected what objects the kids should draw, and you can set a time limit for everyone to submit their drawings.
Now, these challenges can be played in several ways. One way to play the blindfolded drawing challenge is for everyone to decide on who has the best drawing. Another way is for the other children – to guess what they have drawn. The first person to correctly guess the picture is the winner. Here is a look at how some other kids managed to do this challenge: https://youtu.be/U4qecKundmg

Playdough is definitely a favorite in my classroom and at home with my own kids! Kindergarten students can also work on making letters, sightwords, and shapes we have learned with the playdough. Everyone else can get creative and create! Have fun!

Colored Playdough
Materials

1 cup water

1 tablespoon vegetable oil

1/2 cup salt

1 tablespoon cream of tartar

Food coloring

Saucepan

1 cup flour

Directions
1. Combine water, oil, salt, cream of tartar, and food coloring in a saucepan and heat until warm.
2. Remove from heat and add flour.
3. Stir, then knead until smooth. The cream of tartar makes this dough last 6 months or longer, so resist the temptation to omit this ingredient if you don't have it on hand.
4. Store this dough in an airtight container or a Ziploc freezer bag.",,,0.0,"Here is a recipe for Homemade Playdough from Mrs. Raub: I know parents are looking for something fun and hands-on to do with their children.

With the cold season’s arrival we would like to reiterate some of the dress code rules in place for outerwear. These rules and regulations are both in the enrollment packet and student agenda.

If your student(s) would like to wear a sweater in the building it must meet the following criteria:
• Zip up or button up solid sweater (no logos/characters/designs) in royal blue, navy blue, gray, black or white may be worn.
In respect to outer wear outside of the building, students can wear any color coat/sweater/jacket to and from school.

If your student(s) is wearing a sweater, in the building, that is out of dress code your student(s) teacher will send home a notification. More than one notification and your student(s) will be sent to the front office and a phone call will be made immediately.

If you have any further questions or concerns please feel free to call us.

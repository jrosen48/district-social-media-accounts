I want to invite and strongly encourage everyone to tune into this afternoon's historic SpaceX astronaut launch from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.

The mission, called DEMO-2, will launch NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley into orbit on a Crew Dragon spacecraft atop a Falcon 9 rocket. Liftoff is set for 4:33 p.m. EDT (about 1:30 p.m. our time).

You'll be able to watch the SpaceX launch live here and on Space.com's homepage, courtesy of NASA TV, beginning at 12 p.m. EDT (9:00 a.m. our time).

In order to allow these incredible ladies some time with their families and to celebrate Good Friday and Easter Sunday, we will NOT be serving meals on Friday, April 10th (Good Friday) or Monday, April 13th (Easter Monday) only.

It's only been one day and I know I speak for everyone here...we miss your kids! I know your child's teacher has been contacting you and keeping you up-to-date with schedules, work, and resources to assist you in keeping your scholars sharp over this temporary school closure.

Tomorrow, Friday, March 20th will be the last day to come and pick up packets and devices in the office. After Friday, the facility will be closed to the public with the exception of our morning meal program.

During this closure, a small skeleton staff will remain on campus to make sure bills are paid, lawns are mowed, food is served, and the campus is monitored and kept safe.

We can't wait to return to normal operations. Until then, please stay safe, stay healthy, keep your kids busy and keep our community, our state, our country, and our entire world in your thoughts and prayers.

Sincerely,

Mr. Borba

Licking Heights High School
14 hrs ·

On this day, we would normally observe a schoolwide moment of silence in rememberance of all the heroes that lost their lives on 9/11. Although our students are unable to join us today, we encourage you to join us in a moment of silence today at 8:46am, 9:03am, 9:37am, 9:59, 10:03, or 10:28.

This is also a video you can share with your family that displays a walk through of the 9/11 Memorial & Museum.

BATTLE FOR BROAD STREET T-SHIRTS

COVID-19 has altered our Battle for Broad Street plans this year and significantly limited our ability to raise funds this year.

It is important to the Rotary Club of Pataskala to raise money for local scholarships and the Battle for Broad Street is critical to that mission.

Since hosting our traditional spaghetti dinner gathering is unworkable with current restrictions and attendance at the game will be severely limited - we are selling 2020 commemorative T-Shirts online (thanks to help from Branham Apparel and the City of Pataskala).

T-shirts are $20.00 and all Rotary proceeds will be used to fund scholarship opportunities for Southwest Licking and Licking Heights students. The order form will be online from now until September 7th @ 8AM. Shirts will be available for pickup beginning Friday, September 11, 2020 at the Pataskala Police Department.

We appreciate your continued commitment to our community by supporting this event from a distance.

Best of luck to both teams!

Families, we thank you for your patience as we continue to refine our reopening plan for the 2020-21 school year. School district personnel are working diligently with the Ohio Department of Education, county health departments, a group of staff and parents, and our fellow school districts in Licking and Franklin counties to develop a thorough, flexible, and sustainable educational plan.

We realize families and staff need time to make plans to balance education with other life responsibilities and I have several key points to share, with the goal of releasing our full plan as early as next week (the week of July 20).

Families:

Today I received notice that one of our student-athletes participating in summer training tested positive for COVID-19 earlier this week. Due to this self-reported positive test, we are following our reporting protocols and working with our local health departments. The individual is currently self-isolating at home.

Some positive news is that because we followed appropriate safety protocols, which include daily temperature assessments of all individuals entering our buildings, the risk to others is minimized. We know the last time this individual was in our facility was June 23, more than 14 days ago. Our high school building was closed at that time for deep cleaning due to another previously confirmed positive case through the STNA program.

I will provide additional details that I am able to share from the local health departments as they become available.

Families,
Thank you again for your cooperation and flexibility throughout the 2019-20 school year. Below are some additional updates that will be of interest.

As an update to my June 4, 2020 letter regarding Mr. George Floyd’s death and implications, I received some social media responses, but many more emails. The contents of the emails are often supportive; yet, also alarming to read the information. The past few years we have been affiliated with a firm that provided site based coordination and professional development, so I am reaching out to them as well as some other organizations to help facilitate a plan moving forward. More updates will be provided when available.

Families,

We know that the Class of 2020 wasn’t able to have their Senior Walk this year so our teachers got together and created this video. We know that this will not take the place of having that milestone, but we wanted to still celebrate you as we would if you were still walking the halls at LHHS. We ❤️you Seniors. #OnceAHornet #AlwaysAHornet

It is hard to believe we are rapidly approaching the close of the 2019-20 school year. As I mentioned in my last letter, we will stop virtual instruction this week on Friday, May 15. Teachers and staff will be available through Fri., May 22, our scheduled last day of school for students to submit any missing work or assignments. There will be no final exams this year.

We will be utilizing May 18 - 22 to allow families to collect student personal belongings, return district textbooks or library books, turn-in loaned technology devices, and submit any outstanding assignments. This includes any district materials in your child’s possession. Please see the attached for building specific dates and times as we work to ensure the safety of families as they gather to collect belongings.

Following our communication yesterday, Tues., March 11, we have received breaking information from today’s address by the Governor to the state of Ohio. Due to Governor DeWine’s ban on mass gatherings of 100 or more people, we are postponing this weekend’s Licking Heights High School musical and next week’s district art show. The status of upcoming field trips to Florida (LHHS marching band) and Washington, D.C. (eighth grade) is not determined at this time, pending further guidance.

Governor Mike DeWine, with the Ohio Department of Education, is also recommending the closure of all K-12 schools at the end of the day Mon., March 16 for three weeks. This extended spring break would run through April 3. We will know more information when we receive the official executive order from Governor DeWine.

We will continue to provide information as this situation develops. Please watch the district website and your email for updates. Thank you for your cooperation and flexibility during this time.

It is our hope that this opportunity will provide a creative outlet for students to learn more about the dangers of vaping, while also providing ODH with youth-centered videos that could be used for further mass media campaigns to discourage vaping use among youth.

The contest is open to all Ohio high school students or Ohio high school homeschooling students. Students are asked to produce a 25- to 45-second video that addresses the dangers of vaping. For details on the contest rules, please visit www.odh.ohio.gov/videocontest.",2020-02-25 10:11:32,,

In fact, as of this week the project is 60 percent complete. Also, as a reminder districtwide all students will see overcrowding relief as we will now be dividing our total student population by six buildings (instead of the current five buildings).

The Board of Education recently reviewed the following district reconfiguration and master schedule. A variety of factors were considered regarding school hours, including districtwide transportation needs and city traffic concerns.

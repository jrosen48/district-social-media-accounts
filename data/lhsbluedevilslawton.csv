Why apply for free or reduced priced meals? Even if you pack lunch each day, eligibility for these meals makes you eligible for other important services from our school such as reduced fees on advanced placement tests and summer school. All applications are confidential. Eligibility for lunch all makes a student eligible for breakfast. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and we have a great hot breakfast!

New guidelines were released today for eligibility for free or reduced priced meals at school.

Here is a link to the Lawton Community Schools 2020-2021 Application. http://www.lawtoncs.org/PDFs/Free-Reduced_Lunch/APPLICATION.pdf This will also be available soon through your lunch account.

We want to let you know that we are working to prevent mosquitoes and allow our students and community to use the grounds as usual.

We want to advise you that TruGreen will be on our property this evening providing mosquito prevention and control measures. Specifically, they will be using a product called TalStar on the elementary playground, all wooded areas, and treelines on both campuses. This product is safe an hour after application.

We ask all community members and students to stay off our grounds this evening to allow TruGreen to work and the product to dry. The product becomes inert in twelve hours. However, out of an abundance of caution, the playground will close after school today and remain closed for 24 hours.

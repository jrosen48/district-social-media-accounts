During today’s afternoon dismissal, a motorized vehicle driven by a minor without a driver’s license drove through the student pickup line. Fortunately, no students or staff were injured. The vehicle was stopped immediately, and the minor was removed from the vehicle. The situation has been turned over to our school resource officer and the Henry County Sheriff’s Department. We greatly appreciate the admirable response of our staff and the cooperation of the parents picking up their children. The safety of our students and staff is always our top

During today’s afternoon dismissal, a motorized vehicle driven by a minor without a driver’s license drove through the student pickup line. Fortunately, no students or staff were injured. The vehicle was stopped immediately, and the minor was removed from the vehicle. The situation has been turned over to our school resource officer and the Henry County Sheriff’s Department. We greatly appreciate the admirable response of our staff and the cooperation of the parents picking up their children. The safety of our students and staff is always our top

Kona Ice Findlay (cash or credit/debit), The Snack Shack (CASH ONLY), Koral Hamburg Food Truck (cash or credit/debit) and 2nd Chance Food Truck (cash or credit/debit) will be serving from 4-7. They will be set up in the parking spots along the fence by the football field. There will a few tables and chairs outside to eat at. Feel free to have a seat or take it to go after you meet your amazing teachers. Please keep the food/drinks outside so the trash is contained to one area for an easier clean up. Check out the menus in the pics. Don't forget to bring back your Kona Ice cups because they get cheaper refills for the life of the cup. A portion of Kona Ice sales will come back to PTO. The community is welcome to enjoy the trucks too. With this being a new idea maybe throw a blanket in your car or a few chairs if you plan on eating there. I didn't want to have a ton of tables and chairs set up and they not be used.",15.0,"Open House is Monday, August 19 from 4:30-6. While you are here,stop by and enjoy the Food Trucks

This message is to provide clear, accurate information to the Liberty Center community regarding last Thursday evening’s incident. School officials and the Henry County Sheriff’s department began the investigation process Thursday night immediately after receiving information of a possible threat to the school. The student in question was not permitted to attend school until the investigation was completed. The results of the investigation determined that there was no threat made toward the school. Additionally, there was never a threatening note as was indicated by a social media post. The student in question will not be attending school for the remainder of the school year. This decision is for this student’s well-being. There are no criminal charges or school consequences pending against this student.

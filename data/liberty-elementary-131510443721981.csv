Governor Newsom announced this afternoon that schools in Counties who do not meet the 5 criteria will not be allowed to have in-person instruction and must begin school with Distance Learning. Unfortunately, Tulare County currently only meets 2 of the 5 criteria which means Liberty must begin school with the Distance Learning Model. We will be sending out summer mailers with more information on how we will transition to Distance Learning. We are saddened that we are unable to move forward with our plans of offering in school instruction or distance learning dependent on parent preference. At this time, we ask for your patience as we work to put together a new Distance Learning plan.

Send those pennies, dollars, and/or checks with your child so their class get positive points.

Send silver coins for them to “bomb” a class of their choice so that class can lose points.
.
All money in their classroom bucket at the end of the game will go back to that classroom.

Good luck to all classes. This should be a lot of fun.

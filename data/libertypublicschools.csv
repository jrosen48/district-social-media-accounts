I hope your day is ending on a good note. The Liberty Schools Fencing Advisory Committee met last night and had a productive first round of discussions. As a first step in getting our campus looking and working well we need to remove the old fence and I have a proposition to community members but please understand that further action may require Board approval. If anyone is interested or knows of an interested party who would want to remove our current fencing for repurposing or recycling, please email Phillip.garland@libertyps.org with your contact details. Plan B would be to find someone who is interested in repurposing or recycling the materials but can’t uninstall the fence themselves please respond to this email.

Obviously if we find someone to remove the fence then we can put more effort and finances toward our total project of beautifying, securing, and enhancing our schools grounds and parking areas. Please ask around to see if this could be a win-win for the taker and the district. Thank you for your attention.

Important Notice to all Students Riding Bus #2 AM Route

Due to a shortage of bus drivers, in the near future there may be a change in the timing of bus #2’s AM route. It is possible that this route will need to run approximately 20 minutes later. If this situation does arise, you will be notified as far in advance as possible.
Please make sure that the school has current contact information that would allow us to send an “all-call” if needed. Information will also be posted on the school’s Facebook page.
**At this time there is no change. However, we wanted families to be able to plan for this possible change.

Thank you for your understanding in this matter.

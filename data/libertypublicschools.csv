I hope your day is ending on a good note. The Liberty Schools Fencing Advisory Committee met last night and had a productive first round of discussions. As a first step in getting our campus looking and working well we need to remove the old fence and I have a proposition to community members but please understand that further action may require Board approval. If anyone is interested or knows of an interested party who would want to remove our current fencing for repurposing or recycling, please email Phillip.garland@libertyps.org with your contact details. Plan B would be to find someone who is interested in repurposing or recycling the materials but can‚Äôt uninstall the fence themselves please respond to this email.

Obviously if we find someone to remove the fence then we can put more effort and finances toward our total project of beautifying, securing, and enhancing our schools grounds and parking areas. Please ask around to see if this could be a win-win for the taker and the district. Thank you for your attention.

Pandemic-EBT food benefits will be issued automatically to families whose child(ren) received free or reduced-price lunch at school through the federal lunch program. This includes all students who attend a school that provides free meals for all. Each child will receive $420 on a new or existing EBT card that can be used like a bank debit card to purchase food from participating stores. P-EBT benefits are not limited by immigration status and public charge rules do NOT apply.

Today’s the day! Grab a friend and go vote! Polls will be open from noon to 9 p.m. at the high school gymnasium for voting on a proposed $560,000 facilities project that will repair and restore the baseball and soccer fields located behind Liberty High School.

The cost of the project will be funded fully from Capital Reserve funds. There will be no increase in taxes to local property owners and we will receive approximately 82 percent in building aid back from New York State Education Department.

It’s up to you whether or not we address the drainage issues at the fields. Thank you for taking the time to vote for Liberty Pride!",0.0,"Liberty Central School District

Heading out to vote? Make sure to practice hand hygiene frequently to reduce the risk of exposure to respiratory diseases, like COVID-19. Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

It wasn’t until I went out and got my hands dirty that I realized the value of scientific research.” 🌿🧪

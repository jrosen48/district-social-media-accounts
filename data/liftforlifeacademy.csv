Tonight we celebrated the class of 2020 and it was unforgettable! High school students dream to walk across the stage in front of their family, peers, and teachers and unfortunately that couldn’t happen for the class of 2020. But in true LFLA fashion... we made it happen so that students COULD “walk across a stage” in a very unique drive thru graduation! I am so proud to be a teacher of these wonderful seniors and that they allowed me to be a part of their journey.

Today we discussed the six basic animal groups - mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates. We all learned that Monte and the goats are mammals, that the chickens are birds, and that Miss Kathy has fish and amphibians in her pond (and maybe reptiles).

TODAY'S CHALLENGE: Do a classification chart of the six animal groups. List the animal groups and their characteristics, and find pictures (or draw pictures) of an example from each group. For example, mammals are warm-blooded, vertebrate animals, most of them have hair, paws and whiskers, and the mothers feed the babies with their milk.

Let me know if you make an animal classification chart - I'd love to see it! I hope you have fun learning about all the animals in our world. And I'll see you tomorrow with another Facebook Live video!

P.S. If anybody plays Pooh Sticks, remember to send me a video or picture.

#HispanicHeritageMonth Spotlight:

⭐️Celebrated Mexican artist Frida Kahlo was born in Mexico City to a German immigrant father and a Mexican mother. She contracted polio when she was young which caused her to walk with a limp. In 1925, Kahlo was traveling on a bus when the vehicle collided with a streetcar. She suffered several serious injuries, including fractures in her spine and pelvis. During her recovery, she began to paint, finishing her first self-portrait the following year. Kahlo was regarded as a feminist icon for her creativity and political activism. She was the first Mexican artist to be featured in the Louvre and Mexico has declared her works national cultural heritage, prohibiting their export from the country.",0.0,"Thank you Arkansas Lighthouse Academies for this wonderful spotlight on Frida Kahlo for #HispanicHeritageMonth.

Lifetime income inequalities in our schools’ communities affect the quality of life for many of our students, resulting in an endless cycle of poverty. By providing our students with the means to achieve success personally and professionally, we aim to break this cycle and truly transform our students’ lives for the better.

The work we are doing at LHA not only affects our present students, but also has the potential to impact these communities for generations to come. Upon graduating from Lighthouse Academies, many of our students have developed our same passion for improving their communities, and many even plan to return after college to make a difference. Over time, we believe that the work we do will make a lasting difference in these communities by not only inspiring students to achieve more, but by providing them with the guidance to do so.

Class of 2024 -

LHS summer school has been canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If your student plans to take PE their Freshman year at LHS, during the regular school year, there is nothing you need to do.

If your student wants to earn one or both of their PE credits using Summer PE or a PE waiver, I’ve attached the policy for the class of 2024, only. This will need to be returned to Mrs. Tolliver by July 27, 2020. Please read carefully, and give me a call at 812-882-6168 if you have questions.

I hope all of you are well and we look forward to seeing you at Lincoln in August.

Good morning all,

I certainly know that many of you are dealing with larger issues this morning from the storm. It is an E-Learning or counted day for education in the VCSC but this is secondary and quite frankly if it does not occur today, it does not occur.

Many of you are without power and this includes many of our staff members as well and they simply may not be available during the hours of 9AM to 2PM.

As we have learned with Covid-19, we have to be flexible. We just did not know that today that Covid-19 would become secondary for many of us and our attention would turn elsewhere and with this we must be flexible today and patient as we have too many people dealing with much larger issues than that of education and this is primarily related to the storm from last night.

Hopefully we will slowly start to return to what is the new normal for the time being, but today, education is far more secondary.

Hope you all are safe and with this, please stay safe!

We have been getting a lot of questions about Chromebook chargers and we have some tips for you.

Amazon won't be shipping Chromebook chargers at this time (or at least until May 4th) because they aren't deemed essential. So, we found another site that is. Chromebook Parts is a site our Tech Department uses for all our needs and they have told us they are currently taking orders and shipping on time. We will attach the links below.

Senior – Junior  https://www.chromebookparts.com/Acer-C740-Power-Adapter-Grade-A-KP-0650H-006-146-p/ada-sng-103-2.htm
Freshman  https://www.chromebookparts.com/Acer-11-C732-Chromebook-AC-Power-Adapter-p/ada-sng-3288-7.htm

Also, remember that you don't need a Chromebook to access your school Google account. You just need a computer, tablet or smart device. As long as you can get to Google, you should be able to get to all of your items. Thank you again for your patience and if you have additional questions, please use our VCSC Helpline (vcschelp@vcsc.k12.in.us and 812-882-6376).",0.0,"The Online Alice

FYI: Parents of current juniors/incoming seniors: If you would like your student to receive state-required immunizations at LHS by Knox County immunization staff, please return the vaccination interest forms to the Lincoln school nurse by the end of this week. This will be done in April and interest forms were mailed home last week. If you return the form, we will send home further consent and insurance forms that will be required for your student to have these shots done at school. If you do NOT return these forms, we will not be able to vaccinate your student at LHS. You would then need to set up an appointment at the Immunization Clinic or with your doctor to have these immunizations done prior to the 2020-2021 school year. Please contact the school nurse if you have any questions. Thank you!",0.0,"The Online Alice

FYI: Parents of current juniors/incoming seniors: If you would like your student to receive state-required immunizations at LHS by Knox County immunization staff, please return the vaccination interest forms to the Lincoln school nurse by the end of this week. This will be done in April and interest forms were mailed home last week. If you return the form, we will send home further consent and insurance forms that will be required for your student to have these shots done at school. If you do NOT return these forms, we will not be able to vaccinate your student at LHS. You would then need to set up an appointment at the Immunization Clinic or with your doctor to have these immunizations done prior to the 2020-2021 school year.

We had a great response to our recent survey about what is going well and how we can improve as we continue to offer online instruction.

Many parents were very complimentary of the teachers, the ability of students to connect via Zoom, and the quality of education that is continuing through Lincoln Academy.

Some feedback that we are working on is-

1-Streamline communication, so there aren’t as many emails going out.
2-More consistent schedule for Junior High Students without class conflicts
3-One location to know what is expected of students in the course/class.

We are working with teachers and staff members to get these in place starting next Monday. We will be updating our webpage with information and reminding you how to access this updated information.

We love to serve our students and their siblings lunch each day.

Here are a few things to consider when ordering, by 9:00am each day:
· Please remember to use the same email account for all of your students’ orders
· Ordering students must be a student of Lincoln or have a sibling that attends Lincoln.
· Each student must have their own separate order. Do not lump families on one order.
· Please make sure your students name is in the correct space. ie: first name on first name line, last name on last name line.

We have a computer program that organizes this for us. If the order is not filled out correctly and exact, we must manually change the orders.

We are so happy to be able to see you all come through each day! We miss spending the day with our fun students.

Spring is here - and Zupas' salads are perfect for this time of year. And who can resist their chocolate-dipped strawberries. Their kids' meals are well priced, too!
Join us anytime 5-9pm at Zupas in American Fork. Bring the flyer that will be passed out at school Monday, or mention our school's name to the cashier for our school to get credit.
This restaurant requires a minimum of sales.... so if you can make it, great!!!!

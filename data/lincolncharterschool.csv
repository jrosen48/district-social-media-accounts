Karson Nelson and I had a phenomenal time 😃

Also, greatly appreciated NC General Assembly Representative Jason Saine for his attendance and for taking the time to learn more about what this school means to the Lincoln County community as well as to 2,000 students ranging from a total of 14 districts.

Today is national kindergarten day. This kindergarten mama is so heart broken. I am so sad that Wade is missing the fun spring things like field day, field trips and playing with classmates! I am the most heartbroken over the fact that his time with Meredith Gilleland Fonseca & Donna Leatherman was cut short. I can’t put into words how much these two ladies will FOREVER mean to me! My Wade was a terrified, shy, and very nervous kindergartener and with love and support from these two, he transformed into a confident, smart, and outgoing student. He really “came out of his shell”. I was very involved in his classroom and formed relationships with the kids as well! I miss them so terribly! I am excited to know that I will (hopefully) have another year with these amazing teachers when Wyatt gets there! Mrs. Fonseca & Mrs. Leatherman are beyond amazing at what they do. God placed Wade EXACTLY where he needed to be!

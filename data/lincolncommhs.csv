Payton Lanning also picked up two shutouts on the day, making him the new career shutout record holder for Lincoln (with 16 and counting). The old record of 15 career shutouts was held by Brenton Saylor, who graduated in 2003. Congrats Payton!

The cast and crew of the Lincoln Community High School spring musical production Fiddler on the Roof invite you to come spend an evening with them as they interpret the beloved musical. Fiddler on the Roof takes a light-hearted, serious, sad, funny look at being a parent who was raised to adhere to family and religion traditions, trying to cope with new ideas and compromise, especially for Tevye when it comes to his daughters.

The play will run Thursday, Friday, and Saturday starting at 7 p.m. with a matinee on Sunday at 2 p.m. on the Mac McLaughlin stage at the LCHS school auditorium.

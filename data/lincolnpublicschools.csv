We have received an update from the health department regarding face coverings with exhalation valves or vents...

NEW FROM THE CDC:
Face coverings with exhalation valves or vents will not be allowed. Face coverings with one-way valves or vents allow air to be exhaled through a hole in the material, which can result in expelled respiratory droplets that can reach others. This type of mask does not prevent the person wearing the face covering from transmitting COVID-19 to others. Therefore, CDC does not recommend using these face coverings for source control if they have an exhalation valve or vent.

**The face coverings described can be seen in the photos below**

For more guidance on appropriate face coverings for the upcoming LPS school year, please visit https://bigfile.lps.org/coronavirus/",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157238086185880&id=96652800879,,0.0,"LPS families,

If you have any questions about your order, or you need to make arrangements to order a cap and gown, please contact Lincoln Graduation at (402) 937-0812.

Information about the schedule for next week will be coming Friday from your school.

Just a reminder, we are planning a July 26 graduation (either in person or virtually dependent on current health directives) for Lincoln‚Äôs six public high schools. More information will be announced in June when we have a clear picture from local health officials.

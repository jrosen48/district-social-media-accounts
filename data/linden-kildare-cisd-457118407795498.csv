Just a reminder of our new schedule for the remainder of the school year starting this week. We will run our routes and deliver meals on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. We will double up amounts on Monday and Wednesday to help with Tuesday and Thursday.
Also, we will shift our Instructional Deliveries and Pick-up to Wednesday‚Äôs instead of Tuesday‚Äôs.

We hate that we will not get to finish the school year together on campuses, but are grateful we still get to see you and connect with you from our buses.

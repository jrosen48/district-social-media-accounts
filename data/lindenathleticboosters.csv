Thank you to all our sponsors and 2019 attendees. We are proud to announce that the event was a great success. Thanks to all your efforts we made over $6000 for our athletic programs. This includes $3000 in raffle profits which were distributed to the individual sports accounts that provided raffle items.

We are already making plans for next years event. The date has been set for January 25th, 2020! We've listened to many suggestions on how to make the event even better. If you'd like to help plan next years event please consider joining us at our next general meeting on Tuesday, March 12th.

Please take the time to thank all of our sponsors, without them we could not have pulled this off.

Congratulations to Kyle Korman, Alia Frederick, Kevin Bates and Liz Rakowski who have each been named as State Bank Athletes of the Week.
Senior Kyle Korman threw a lifetime best, 134"" in the discus to place 2nd in a field of 47 throwers from 17 schools at the MSU Outdoor. Kyle becomes the first LHS athlete to earn Athlete of the Week honors in all three sport seasons.

In her first meet of the year at the Spartan Classic Invitational, Alia made it to the 100 Hurdles final and placed 5th (17.53a). She also had an outstanding race in the 300 Hurdles placing 3rd with a time of 48.08a.

Kevin had a outstanding week both hitting and pitching leading Linden to a perfect 4-0 record for the week. Offensively he went 7 for 13 (.538) while scoring 3 runs, batting in 4 RBI's and stealing 3 bases. Kevin also pitched and picked up the win vs. Swartz Creek on Friday pitching 5 1/3 innings striking out 4.

In league games against Sw. Creek, and in the Cheasning this week Liz Rakowski, was .562 at the plate, with 7 rbis and scored 2 runs. 9 for 16.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=800274530068795&id=347125572050362,,0.0,"State Bank Athletes of the Week

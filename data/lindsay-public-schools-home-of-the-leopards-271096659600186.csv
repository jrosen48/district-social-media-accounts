As we prepare for the upcoming school year, we have worked hard to develop a plan that focuses on the health and safety of our students, teachers and staff. The Return to School plan is outlined on our school website with education options, new procedures and enhanced safety protocols that were designed to meet the unique needs of our students and their families. We will undoubtedly face challenges this school year. We will continue to put children first and make decisions we believe are in the best interest of our students, teachers and staff.

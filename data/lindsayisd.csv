In conjunction with the final couple weeks of school assignments, LISD is offering a great opportunity to supplement your last report card for the year! LISD is committed to providing educational experiences that go above and beyond the typical “textbook” lesson. One of our main goals is to prepare students for life after school. With that in mind, we want to challenge our students with what we are calling the”Knight Challenge.” The specific details for each grade level are posted on the LISD website at www. lindsayisd.org. Each student who completes the proposed requirements for their respective grade level and who completes the appropriate survey will receive an additional grade of “100.” The assignment will be considered a daily grade within the grading process and will be applied to each class the student has.

On the web site, you will see the link for each grade level for both assignments and the survey.

Please contact your child’s respective principal if you have any questions.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2288945721413714&id=1486644001643894,,0.0,"LISD Students and Parents,

You have likely heard that Gov. Abbott has closed all schools state wide through April 3rd.

Starting next week staff will begin creating plans for students to have access to school work. As these plans become available, we will let you know.

All UIL competitions have been further delayed until May 4th. As we get further guidance from them, we will let everyone know.

Staring Monday, March 23rd, we will provide meals to all LISD students who would like to participate. Meals will be served in a “To Go” format. They will be available from 11:00-12:00 each day that we are not in session due to closure. If a student needs a meal but it can’t be picked up during the allotted time or if the meal needs to be distributed to the student’s home, please let us know and we will get the meal to the student. Please contact your child’s campus principal if you would like to participate in the meal program.

As additional changes come our way -we will let you know ASAP. Please contact us if you have any questions.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2252649055043381&id=1486644001643894,,0.0,"LISD Community,

Scholars in the Environmental Activism Through Art Elective spent this morning’s class printmaking catch basin designs on t-shirts. The elective was created by Ms. Howard, Link’s Fine Arts Teacher, as part of Link’s participation in the City of Newark’s Adopt A Catch Basin Initiative. Today’s lesson was inspired by the work of Berlin-based Raubdruckerin (which means “pirate printer”). The scholars have also been working on amazing street mural designs for Link’s adopted basins, which they will paint over the next 3 weeks.#beautifynewark #environmentactivismthroughart #adoptacatchbasinnewark",0.0,"Link Community Charter School

Scholars in the Environmental Activism Through Art Elective spent this morning’s class printmaking catch basin designs on t-shirts. The elective was created by Ms. Howard, Link’s Fine Arts Teacher, as part of Link’s participation in the City of Newark’s Adopt A Catch Basin Initiative. Today’s lesson was inspired by the work of Berlin-based Raubdruckerin (which means “pirate printer”). The scholars have also been working on amazing street mural designs for Link’s adopted basins, which they will paint over the next 3 weeks.#beautifynewark #environmentactivismthroughart #adoptacatchbasinnewark",2019-05-10 20:28:24,,

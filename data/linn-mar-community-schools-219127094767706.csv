Students from eight LMHS student clubs (Student Council, FFA, Red Cross Club, Key Club, Robotics, LM buddies, SODA, LMTV) are hosting a unified club project this month to gather donations and funds to support the LMHS Pride Food Pantry.

The pantry serves many students at the high school who have food insecurities and allows them to take the food home, discretely, without worrying where their next meal is coming from.

For an extra incentive, the student clubs have made this a challenge and the winning grade and class can receive discounts to the WPA dance later this month. #wearelinnmar

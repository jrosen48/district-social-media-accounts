Sex trafficking is an appalling criminal enterprise. As many as 300,000 children in the United States are at risk of becoming victims, and as Arkansans, we can all agree that this scourge needs to end once and for all.

In central Arkansas, I am proud to work with the The Centers for Youth and Families which, for over 130 years, has worked to buildup healthy children, families, and community centers. These centers have expanded their missions for care by providing trauma-informed treatment for victims of human trafficking.

Proud to announce that The United States Department of Justice has awarded nearly $500,000 in grant money to this amazing organization. This grant money will support housing assistance for victims of all forms of human trafficking throughout the United States. Specifically, programs that provide 6 to 24 months of transitional housing with support services to victims of human trafficking who are in need of housing.",3.0,"Each of our teachers completes professional development about Child Trafficking.#LISAcares

Today, on Purple Heart Day, we honor our brave service members who have received this award in recognition of their being killed or wounded in action. We salute these heroes and express our eternal gratitude for their service and sacrifice.

The Purple Heart is the oldest military award still in use. Its predecessor, the Badge for Military Merit, was created by George Washington on this day in 1782.

William Brown and Elijah Churchill were the first soldiers to receive the Badge of Military Merit for their service in the Continental Army during the American Revolution.

Henry credits the STEM-forward curriculum of LISA Academy for putting him on the path to a career in computer science. “I got a much more focused education on mathematics and science [at LISA Academy], which are important for computer science,” he said. “We have really small class sizes so it’s easy to get a better education and more personal connections with the teachers, which I think is really important.”

Each Monday at 8am we will post a new virtual field trip to Headquarters and show off some of the ASP equipment that students always ask us about. (Will post at 8am, but you can watch it anytime!!) You might even learn something yourself! We hope you enjoy these videos, and make sure to comment under the videos if your kids enjoyed them!!

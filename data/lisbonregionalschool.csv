The decision to close school or call a two-hour delay is always a difficult one and is always taken very seriously. This morning, at a late hour, I was notified that a Lisbon and Landaff school bus were off the road and several roads were not passable due to trees being down in the road. Many failed attempts were made to contact the Lisbon Highway Department to discuss the situation. Lack of cell service always makes those communications a challenge. Given the information I was provided, I had no choice but to call the two hour delay. I apologize for the inconvenience of the late call.

Dear Parents,
We hope you are having a great summer and are looking forward to the start of a new school year. We wanted to write and once again give you a little information about your child’s classes this fall. The fifth and sixth grade rooms are still located at the end of the hallway past the main office.
Your child’s survival list for the upcoming year includes:
- an assignment book or planner
- one, 2-inch binder
- four, 3-hole punched folders (1 each of red, blue, green, and yellow)
- one, 3-subject notebook
- pencils
- 1 or 2 highlighters
- markers or crayons and other art supplies you might like to use other than what is supplied.
Enjoy the rest of the summer.

Hello 4th Graders, August 2018

My name is Ms. Marro (rhymes with tomorrow) and I will be your new 4th grade teacher at Lisbon Regional School! I am so excited to meet all of my students and become a part of this wonderful community!
I hope you are having a fantastic summer! I definitely am, but busy getting our classroom ready! On the back of this letter you will find a list of supplies, if possible, needed for the classroom.

This is my second year teaching at Lisbon Regional School and I cannot wait for all of us to be together for the upcoming school year!
I would like to get to know a little bit about each of my students before the start of school on August 27th. Please feel free to send me an email at: almarr@lisbon.k12.nh.us and let me know something about you.

I hope you’ve been having a great summer! I’ve been busy enjoying the sunshine! I hope you’re getting excited about school and are ready for a fun year of learning.
To help our class run smoothly, you will need the following things for the year:
o a pair of scissors (with your name on them)
o 2 or 3 regular pencils with erasers
o a pencil box
o 2 glue sticks
o a set of 8 colored pencils
o and if possible, a container of Lysol/Clorox wipes and a box of tissues to donate to the class (to wipe down desks and door knobs)
PLEASE do NOT bring any binder or folders of any sort because you will not have the extra room in your desk.
Enjoy the rest of your summer, play outside, and read a book in the sunshine if you’re bored! I will meet you outside on the first day of school!
From,

I have purchased Student Planners for each of you to help keep track of your daily assignments. To help our class run smoothly, you will need the following things for the year:

a pair of scissors (with your name on them)

2 or 3 regular pencils with erasers

a pencil box

2 glue sticks

a set of 8 colored pencils

and if possible, a container of Lysol/Clorox wipes and a box of tissues to donate to the class (to wipe down desks and door knobs)

PLEASE do NOT bring any Trapper Keepers, binders, etc. of any sort because you will not have the extra room in your desk.

Enjoy the rest of your summer, play outside, and read a book in the sunshine if you’re bored! I will meet you outside on the first day of school!

Hello, August 2017

My name is Ms. Marro (rhymes with tomorrow) and I will be your new 4th grade teacher at Lisbon Regional School! I am so excited to meet all of my students and become a part of this wonderful community!
I hope you are having a fantastic summer! I definitely am, but busy getting our classroom ready! I will be sending out a school supplies list very soon with items you will need for the classroom.
A little about me: I am a graduate of Granite State College with a Bachelor of Arts degree and a dual certification in both Elementary Education (K-6) and General Special Education. For the past four years I have worked with students at the Elementary School in Franconia, NH and I am so excited to have my own classroom at Lisbon Regional School!

Hello, August 2017

My name is Ms. Marro (rhymes with tomorrow) and I will be your new 4th grade teacher at Lisbon Regional School! I am so excited to meet all of my students and become a part of this wonderful community!
I hope you are having a fantastic summer! I definitely am, but busy getting our classroom ready! I will be sending out a school supplies list very soon with items you will need for the classroom.

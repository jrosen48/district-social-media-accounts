Epidemiologists, on the other hand, use it to predict hot spots for influenza.

Our goal is to increase self-response rates during Non-Response Follow-Up (NRFU) operations. By self-responding to the Census, residents can stop the knock! Respond today at my2020census.gov or by phone at 1-844-330-2020 (English)/844-468-2020.",0.0,"Llano County Office of Emergency Management

According to the CDC, this flu season has seen an elevation in flu cases for the last 8 weeks and IS expected to increase in the weeks to come. There have been many reports on social media about students contracting flu and strep during our 3 week break. As of now, our school is germ free. During our break our school was fogged with hospital grade disinfectant.

Parents, please: launder your students coats, hoodies, gloves and hats frequently. Also clean their backpacks with Lysol or Clorox wipes. (And continue this practice once a week).

Remind your students to sneeze or cough into the crook of their arms. And to WASH THEIR HANDS...constantly.

Do not eat or drink after their friends. Keep their hands off their faces, do not chew on pencils, erasures or other non-edible items.

If your student has a severely running nose, constant cough or fever DO NOT SEND THEM TO SCHOOL. Rather take them to the doctor.

If you have any questions, please call our School Nurse, Marrijane Steelman, 325 248 2235 OR msteelman@llanoisd.org.

There have been many reports on social media about students contracting flu and strep during our 3 week break. As of now, our school is germ free. During our break our school was fogged with hospital grade disinfectant.

Parents, please: launder your students coats, hoodies, gloves and hats frequently. Also clean their backpacks with Lysol or Clorox wipes. (And continue this practice once a week).

Remind your students to sneeze or cough into the crook of their arms. And to WASH THEIR HANDS...constantly.

Do not eat or drink after their friends. Keep their hands off their faces, do not chew on pencils, erasures or other non-edible items.

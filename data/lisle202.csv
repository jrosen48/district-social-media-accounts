We're here to bust some myths about COVID-19!
‚Ä¢ People of all ages can be be infected, although some are more vulnerable.
‚Ä¢ Cold weather and snow do not kill the virus.
‚Ä¢ The virus can be spread in areas with hot and humid climates.
‚Ä¢ Hand dryers do not kill the virus. You can use paper towels.
‚Ä¢ Thermal scanners detect a fever, one of the several symptoms of the virus.

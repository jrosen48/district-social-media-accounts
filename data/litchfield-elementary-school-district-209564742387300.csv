Today the teachers of BBR were honored by their PTSA and principal! Teachers did a drive through appreciation. They saw signs and posters giving thanks for all their hard work - given a flower and a basket full of goodies! Then to top it off, served a yummy to go lunch of tacos and rice!! We are so lucky to have such wonderful support!

Life looks a lot different these days as we are all struggling with our new “normal”.

Robey PTSA still wanted to show our appreciation to our ROBEY teachers for all of their hard work, dedication (especially now!) and support through this school year.

Usually we try to do something special for the teachers each school day. So we decided to still do that but in a one stop, social distancing way!

Here are a few pictures of today’s drive-thru Teacher Appreciation event!

Made a video to inspire Christina Farrington‘s students while school is out and their spring musical is on hiatus. She is doing such wonderful things for her students. It is so wonderful to see such a caring teacher. Teachers deserve so much credit. Theatre was an important part of my education. I’m happy to see her continue to educate and inspire with this art form.

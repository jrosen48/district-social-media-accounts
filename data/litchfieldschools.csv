LITCHFIELD ELEMENTARY STUDENTS DESIGN FACE-SHIELDS!
Litchfield's 1st and 2nd grade teacher is THE BEST! Mrs. (Breezy Sauer) Litchfield Sauer had her class create their own face shields in class. Here they are wearing the shields they created earlier in the day. Mrs. Sauer had personally bought some face-shields to wear in school but had a hunch she could make them for less. She spent $30 on 60 face-shields for the elementary. She bought foam and elastic at Hobby Lobby and used clear projector sheets for the shield. A little hot glue and some staples created a safer classroom. The student's favorite part are the stickers which helped the students identify their own masks and take ownership of their project.

On Friday the staff did professional development on how to better use the technology and looked at the survey. We talked about what was working and what will need to be improved. The major reflection was how to use more projects/videos/interactive lessons to improve learning.

What is inside THIS box?

Today at our 11:30 storytime, we read the book ""What is inside THIS box?"" By Drew Daywalt.

My challenge to you -- take a picture of a box and tell me a story about what is inside YOUR box!

.....

Inside Mrs. Moser's box is a magical library! It knows exactly what book you should read... there's only one problem! When you open the box, you can't see what's inside!!!

So it's a good thing you have a librarian who is willing to find a perfect book for you! 📚😁📖",0.0,"Litchfield School Library

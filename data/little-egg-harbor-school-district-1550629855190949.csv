L.E.H. & P.R.S.D. Families,

As you are well aware, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to escalate in our area. To ensure the safety and well being of our staff, students, and community the Little Egg Harbor and Pinelands School Districts will remain closed through spring recess. The tentative date our schools will reopen is April 20, 2020. Please note, during spring recess (April 10th-April 19th) food will not be available to families. Refer to the Pinelands website, Food Finder link for resources to assist with feeding your family. Lastly, teachers will not be providing lessons or assistance during the spring recess time period. Students should use that time to catch up on any incomplete work.

Additionally, if you need a Chromebook for your student, we are limiting loaner devices to one per family due to the limited number of devices available in both districts.

Thank you for your patience. Stay safe!

The children at GJM in the Kindergarten classes will be reading a book called The Mitten Tree by Candace Christiansen. The story was about a woman named Sarah who made mittens for all the children in the neighborhood who did not have mittens. The children in the story were very appreciative of Sarah's thoughtful act.

In keeping with the holiday spirit of giving, our classes would like to create a mitten tree at the GJM and Frog Pond Schools. We would like to collect new or gently used mittens, jackets, hats and scarves for the local families who do not have these items to keep them warm this winter. If you would like to donate items, please send them in with your child to put on the tree in their building. We will collect mittens and such until December 13th, 2019. If you have any questions, please contact Mrs. May at Lmay@lehsd.org.

Thank you for your kindness.

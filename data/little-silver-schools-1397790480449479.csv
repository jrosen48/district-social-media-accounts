I also, want to thank the students for their grit and determination in facing the challenges of remote learning. Also, the parents and community for supporting the staff and students through all that this year has thrown at them.

Thank you to the PTO for all your help with the end of the year ""celebrations"" for the Class of 2020. From gifts, parade route planning and honks of happiness, to the most important...the amazing slide show at the conclusion of the graduation ceremony.

To the students and families of the Class of 2020 you have left your mark in the history of Markham Place and helped to forward our story and traditions in ways we didn't know were going to be thrust upon us. You did it with class, hard work, and true Warrior Spirit. You will be missed. Best of luck in high school.

The first phase of this restoration is repairs to the curbs and sidewalks. When that work is complete the contractor will move to complete other concrete work within the Borough. Milling and paving will be completed sometime either in the last week of June or early July.

The construction on Markham will be a moving work zone, as the contractor finishes one area they will move to another section of the road. This means that the are of Markham that was closed off one day may not be the same area closed off the next. There will be NO through traffic on Markham. Residents in the area closed on any given day will only have access through the area the police officer is stationed. Please be aware of where the officer is that day.

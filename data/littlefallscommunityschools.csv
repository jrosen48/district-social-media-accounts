According to the Morrison County Historical Society, our mascot became the Flyers back in 1928. Before 1928, we did not have a mascot. Schools started choosing such nicknames in the late 1920's.

To Liz, personalized learning means “meeting each student where they are at and adapting the curriculum to best fit their needs.”

When she has free time, Liz loves being outdoors. She especially enjoys spending time with friends while camping, fishing, or just sitting around a campfire. Liz says she really enjoyed hiking the mountains of Southwest Oregon, visiting the ocean, and exploring the small town shops. She would love to relive this experience if given the chance. Carrie Underwood is the musician Liz would most like to see in concert.

Marissa graduated from SCSU last spring with a secondary math education degree and a minor in special education. She joins our District as a math teacher at the high school. Marissa is looking forward to working with the students and staff of the district.

To Marissa, personalized learning means “that each student can learn in a way that works for them. Every student learns best in a different way. Personalized learning allows the student to learn in a way that is tailored to their individual needs.”

When it’s time to relax, Marissa enjoys listening to music, watching movies, and completing jigsaw puzzles. She also is a fan of hunting, fishing, camping, and spending time with her family. A trip to Alaska complete with a glacier tour and dog sledding is on the top of Marissa’s list as a dream vacation.

This video focuses on ways to support math and reading (mostly math) at home by creating simple routines. Although Distance Learning is wrapping up, these routines will help ensure that your student continues to make gains over the summer.

This committee would meet twice a year (perhaps virtually), and would give us necessary feedback and ideas to continue to improve the way we are doing Title One at Little Falls Community Elementary Schools.

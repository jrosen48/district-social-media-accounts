Dear Little Ferry Family,

Many towns with local hospitals have decided to do clap outs in honor of the medical personnel and first responders who have and continue to sacrifice so much for our health and safety. In keeping with that spirit of appreciation for these heroes -- tomorrow evening, Tuesday, March 31st at 7 pm sharp, I’m respectfully asking all Little Ferry residents to clap outside their front door or windows for 2 minutes. I will also be asking local churches to ring their bells. Also, if you have one at home -- let’s all hang or fly the flag of the United States of America outside our homes as a sign of our unity. Stay healthy and safe!

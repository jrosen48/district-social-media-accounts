Littlefork-Big Falls High School knows how to treat officials right and set a great example for fans.

Here's an email sent to the MSHSL by Kyle Lamppa, one of the officials in these photos.

When officiating basketball at Littlefork-Big Falls, they provide ""referee helpers"" during the game. They are kids ranging from 3rd-5th grade. They are dressed in referee striped shirts with a screen print on the back of ""respect the refs."" During timeouts, they run onto the floor, bring us water to drink, chat with us, and then head back to the sideline. They are prompt, safe, and really add to the enjoyment of officiating events at the school. The students, their parents, and the administration at the school should be commended for thinking of this gesture and really making our night with it. On long winter nights, officiating multiple games a week, it truly is the ""little"" gestures that make it worth while. Kudos to Littlefork-Big Falls.",0.0,"üß°üñ§üß°üñ§

This weekend we celebrate teachers and all school-related support staff. The Livermore school district is winding up its first week of distanced learning, and it is obvious that an incredible amount of work was done over the summer. You work very hard for our children, and you deserve a treat! Stop by for a free bag of popcorn or candy this weekend! Any employee from all school districts in the Tri-Valley and beyond is eligible for the free treat.

We now have WONDER WOMAN 84 popcorn tubs in stock - before the release of the new movie! These beautiful looking tubs are collectible, and can easily be repurposed. They are in stock this weekend, so don't miss out! Also, the Pineapple Slushy Floats were a big hit last weekend, and they are still available, along with Orange Slushy Floats.

Thank you to everyone that donated to our GOFUNDME page - your generosity has been incredible.

We are open this Friday - Sunday from 1:00 to 5:00 each day. Check out our full menu here: https://www.vinecinema.com/food-menu",0.0,"Wow- thank you to the Vine Cinema for your generous offer!

#livermoreschools #livermorecounts! #Census2020",,,0.0,"Members of our child nutrition department and volunteers have been working hard EVERY SINGLE WEEK to pack and distribute grab-and-go meals for our students. On average, they are distributing between 2500-3000 meals per day, up to 15,000 per week! We could not be prouder of their commitment to the service and support of our students and families!

The school lunch program is one that is funded through census data. With all that is going on, you may have forgotten that the 2020 Census is taking place right now! We cannot think of a better way to honor the work of our child nutrition team than by completing the 2020 Census!

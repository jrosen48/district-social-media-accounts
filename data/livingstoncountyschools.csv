We have 1700 boxes to give away, so don't be bashful!. There is a mixture of lots of different things, but so far we are noticing A LOT of jalapenos, so if you like em, come get em. Each box has 4 sealed containers, with a variety of everything.

Again, there is NO INCOME REQUIREMENT. Anybody can take part in this program and come. We have volunteers (thank you to all of them!!) who will load your car up so you don't even have to get out.

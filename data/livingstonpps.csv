Before someone gives me a hard time, Forgive me for mispronouncing the word ""Episode"" in this one, it happens, 😂.. You're free to laugh at me, it wont hurt my feelings.

In this episode of The Livingston Parish Thread, we talk GOING BACK TO SCHOOL with the very hard working Assistant Superintendent of our Livingston Parish Schools, Jody Purvis and one of our phenomenal elected School Board Members, Kellee Hennessy.

Today was AWESOME! Several of our ELA classes got to meet Karen Land, an Iditarod racer, writer, and wilderness advocate, and her dogs Noggin and Chloe for their unit on animal/human allies. We learned that the Iditarod is approximately 1049 miles, can take over 10 days, and requires a lot of endurance (and clothing). Several students got to try on gear! Did you know a sled and the dogs can be as long as a basketball court? For more information on Karen Land and the Iditarod, visit https://www.lomlibrary.org/author-visits--interactions.html.

Mrs. Carter & her students rolled out the red carpet! Thank you! A birthday cape, cake & gift. All I did was help Mighty Moms promote ‘Childhood Hunger Awareness Day’ in Livingston Parish. It was an honor!

We read ‘Maddi's Fridge’ - a book about hunger and friendship. Hoping we continue to help make a difference in the lives of these children.",2019-09-04 19:30:54,,

September is #LibraryCardSignup Month and we're celebrating by speaking with our community leaders to find out why they believe having a library card is so important. First up, Livingston Parish Public Schools Superintendent Joe Murphy. #mylpl

""Reading is the most fundamental skill that we must teach in our schools. When we teach and encourage our students to read, we open the universe for them and we make it a special place because they’re able to explore things they never thought was possible. Our libraries serve our schools, our community, our parents, and they are a vital link between the school system and our community.

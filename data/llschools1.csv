Good morning Lady Tiger fans, today is the day!! Just a couple of things to share:
We are having a send off today between 4:45- 5 for the girls. We will leave from the high school pool, circle down by the middle school, and then head back up to the freeway. Please join us in making the send off something special for them! With the shutdown off all fans and families this is a weird time for everyone. Also remember we have 3 seniors who will never have the opportunity to play for another state title in front of their family and friends, and we need to show them all of our love and support! Bring signs, wear your tiger gear and be ready to cheer them on as they pass by. Next, we will be having a watch party today at Calvary chapel in Belen. We have a ton of food, and it’s all free to everyone who wants to join! GO TIGERS!!! 🐯🏀🧡💙",0.0,"Village of Los Lunas Village Government Valencia County Admin and Government Llhs Tigerettes LLHS Tigers Official Valencia County News-Bulletin

The one where we were quarantined!

Day 5 - Pajama Day (you can use your night time jammies or your day jammies) :)

Please share pictures with us @ contactus@lp.noacsc.org

Don't forget to log on to Google Classroom and participate with the online activities. It's Movie Day! Find a movie that was created from a book idea, pop some popcorn, grab a drink and snack and settle in!

This wraps up our school year. We will miss you terribly (we already do). Please take time to read over the summer. Keep your brain working. Practice math. But also get outside and enjoy the sunshine. Stay healthy. And know that we care about you so very much.",0.0,"Leipsic Local School District added 10 new photos.

The one where we were quarantined! The end of 2019-20 school year sure has brought on an unusual ending. Definitely not one we hope to ever experience again. This has been a learning curve for students, parents, administrators and teachers. Proudly, we have all adjusted well and we are in this together.

This year our Right to Read Week will be a virtual experience. This will wrap up our school year and we hope we can get ALL our elementary students to participate with us.

Please share pictures each day with us @ contactus@lp.noacsc.org

""I'll never forget my time at Leipsic High School. I'll always remember everyone who has pushed me to become the person I am today, whether that is teachers, coaches, friends, and family. I will most definitely miss playing sports and being on the field/court with all my friends who I can call family. The accomplishments we all made as a team, class, and individually are amazing. One of my favorite memories would have to be this past football season. Who would've thought we would be just the 3rd team in Leipsic history to make it to the regional finals. I can't thank my coaches and teammates enough for the impact they had on me as a player and a person. I will miss these moments for the rest of my life because they are a part of who I am and also once a Viking, always a Viking. I also want to thank all my teachers and school officials for always supporting me and pushing me to be the best I can be. I plan on attending Bowling Green State University to major in Sports Management.""",0.0,"Leipsic Local School District added a new photo.

We also want to celebrate those moments right now! The moments that need to be and should be remembered by all our school children. Don't forget to be a kid!

Breathe deeply and courageously, and take one step after the other; because beyond the darkness, there is always light! Tamara Levitt

March 12, 2020 - Governor Mike Dewine mandates Ohio schools to an extended 3 week Spring Break. Teachers & students @ LLSD literally had less than 24 hours to adjust to what a remote learning environment would look like.

Have there been adjustments along the way....of course. Is the scenario perfect, of course not. Are we extremely proud of our students, parents & staff members.....ABSOLUTELY!

Here is to making lemonade out of the lemons life has thrown at us. We will be updating this album....OFTEN! Feel free to share pictures of your child(ren) in their remote learning environment. Send them to contactus@lp.noacsc.org

We also hope families are able to use this time to reconnect and even get out and get some fresh air.....we will take those pictures as well. Together we will get through this and be better because of it.

We are currently living in unprecedented times.....this is new to all of us. We truly are in this TOGETHER! Teachers are missing students. Students are missing teachers. Friends are missing friends! A parent was out delivering meals to the senior citizens of the community today when they got the idea to stop by a few teachers houses and get them to come out and wave. The pictures were sent to the school and an idea arose. We contacted teachers and asked them to send us their ""waves"" to the students. We will continue to upload them throughout the next week. If a student would like to send back a ""wave"" feel free to send them to contactus@lp.noacsc.org

We are all in this together, and we are all feeling like we could use a ray of sunshine about now. Hang tight! Keep some fresh air with this warmer weather we are getting. And let's keep working together!!

Enjoy!

March 12, 2020 - Governor Mike Dewine mandates Ohio schools to an extended 3 week Spring Break. Teachers & students @ LLSD literally had less than 24 hours to adjust to what a remote learning environment would look like.

Have there been adjustments along the way....of course. Is the scenario perfect, of course not. Are we extremely proud of our students, parents & staff members.....ABSOLUTELY!

Here is to making lemonade out of the lemons life has thrown at us. We will be updating this album....OFTEN! Feel free to share pictures of your child(ren) in their remote learning environment. Send them to contactus@lp.noacsc.org

Have there been adjustments along the way....of course. Is the scenario perfect, of course not. Are we extremely proud of our students, parents & staff members.....ABSOLUTELY!

We are currently living in unprecedented times.....this is new to all of us. We truly are in this TOGETHER! Teachers are missing students. Students are missing teachers. Friends are missing friends! A parent was out delivering meals to the senior citizens of the community today when they got the idea to stop by a few teachers houses and get them to come out and wave. The pictures were sent to the school and an idea arose. We contacted teachers and asked them to send us their ""waves"" to the students. We will continue to upload them throughout the next week. If a student would like to send back a ""wave"" feel free to send them to contactus@lp.noacsc.org

We are all in this together, and we are all feeling like we could use a ray of sunshine about now. Hang tight! Keep some fresh air with this warmer weather we are getting. And let's keep working together!!

Enjoy!

Sometimes the books have to go down and kids and their families need to get outside and get some fresh air. Or have a family game day/night. We want to also share these moments because these moments are what will help all of us get through this time.

We also want to celebrate those moments right now! The moments that need to be and should be remembered by all our school children. Don't forget to be a kid!

What happens when a world pandemic hits.....you make a choice to do the very best you can under the conditions you are faced with.

March 12, 2020 - Governor Mike Dewine mandates Ohio schools to an extended 3 week Spring Break. Teachers & students @ LLSD literally had less than 24 hours to adjust to what a remote learning environment would look like.

Have there been adjustments along the way....of course. Is the scenario perfect, of course not. Are we extremely proud of our students, parents & staff members.....ABSOLUTELY!

Here is to making lemonade out of the lemons life has thrown at us. We will be updating this album....OFTEN! Feel free to share pictures of your child(ren) in their remote learning environment. Send them to contactus@lp.noacsc.org

We also hope families are able to use this time to reconnect and even get out and get some fresh air.....we will take those pictures as well. Together we will get through this and be better because of it.

Have there been adjustments along the way....of course. Is the scenario perfect, of course not. Are we extremely proud of our students, parents & staff members.....ABSOLUTELY!

LES 1st grader, Cambree Newell, took her Kindness Matters remote learning assignment to a new level. During a facebook live video segment her teacher Ms. Frick and student teacher Miss Clymer talked about Kindness Matters.

What happens when a world pandemic hits.....you make a choice to do the very best you can under the conditions you are faced with.

March 12, 2020 - Governor Mike Dewine mandates Ohio schools to an extended 3 week Spring Break. Teachers & students @ LLSD literally had less than 24 hours to adjust to what a remote learning environment would look like.

Have there been adjustments along the way....of course. Is the scenario perfect, of course not. Are we extremely proud of our students, parents & staff members.....ABSOLUTELY!

Here is to making lemonade out of the lemons life has thrown at us. We will be updating this album....OFTEN! Feel free to share pictures of your child(ren) in their remote learning environment. Send them to contactus@lp.noacsc.org

We also hope families are able to use this time to reconnect and even get out and get some fresh air.....we will take those pictures as well. Together we will get through this and be better because of it.

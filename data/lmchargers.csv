As we approach August, I wanted to reach out to everyone and include a few details surrounding bus transportation provided for students in grades 7-12 to Pocahontas.

*The bus leaves at 7:40 a.m. Sharp!

*The bus arrives back to Laurens at approximately 3:40 on a regular school day.

*We do not take attendance, it is optional transportation.

*The bus leaves from the front of the LM School and from the bus loop at PAC.

*There will be bus expectations that will be communicated to both parents and students.

*Students are expected to follow the bus expectations and if a student fails to do so the parent will be responsible for transporting their student to and from school for a set period of time determined by administration.

*There will be a shuttle provided to Middle School students involved in sports for practice purposes.

Please be on the lookout for additional communication as things are rapidly changing. We will communicate any changes as we continue to be informed.

Let‚Äôs do a ‚Äúwalk around the sun‚Äù in celebration. August 31, 2020 marks Montessori‚Äôs 150th birthday. Educators and Families around the world are celebrating her legacy.
.
Maria Montessori was an Italian physician, educator, and innovator, acclaimed for her educational method that builds on the way children learn naturally. She opened the first Montessori school‚Äîthe Casa dei Bambini, or Children's House‚Äîin Rome on January 6, 1907.
.
Montessori developed the Montessori Method of teaching based on observations she made of children in her own childcare center. The Montessori Method is based on the idea that children learn best when the environment supports their natural desire to acquire skills and knowledge.
.
We at Lee Montessori implement high-fidelity Montessori (as a tool) in a community that is racially and socioeconomically diverse, with the end goal of empowering each child we serve to be empowered to transform society.

Tahiira Lee, Montessori Guide
Lee Montessori was named after one of the kindest, most talented, and committed Montessori teachers to ever walk the earth. Tahiira Lee was born and raised in Washington, DC and attended Dunbar Senior High School. She went to undergraduate school in Oklahoma and continued her education at UDC, Trinity and Loyola University, where she earned her Montessori diploma.

Tahiira Lee, Montessori Evangelist
Beyond her work in the classroom, Ms. Lee recognized the need to promote Montessori in Washington, DC, especially in low-income communities and to students of color. As a result, not only did she inspire generations of students, but also a number of professionals whom she either introduced to Montessori or helped flame the fires of their passion for the work that we do. Several of these people were instrumental to the founding of Lee Montessori Public Charter School. #leemontessori #blackhistorymonth2020 #tahiiralee",,,0.0,"Today we honor Tahiira Lee in honor of Black History Month.

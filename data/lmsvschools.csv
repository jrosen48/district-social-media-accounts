Many have asked whether schools will be able to reopen on April 13th. Earlier today we sent out an update to share what we know at this time. Here is an excerpt:

""As long as the statewide ‚Äústay at home‚Äù order remains in place, and as long as county health restrictions on gatherings and social distancing remain in place, our schools will remain closed. Please be assured that we will inform you right away if health orders are lifted and we are able to reopen. In the meantime, we should all be prepared for the real possibility that health orders will remain in place well beyond spring break and that schools will not be able to reopen on April 13. In the spirit of planning for the worst but hoping for the best, we are developing a distance learning plan for all students in the event that our schools must remain closed beyond April 13.""

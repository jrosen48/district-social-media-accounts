I sent a request to my parents a few weeks ago, asking them to sign up to contact a student and send them an uplifting email. So many of my parents participated and were so willing to help make my students smile! One parent, Ms. Ridgley Chapman, reached out to me and offered to provide some intentional support considering her background in child development. Since then Ms. Chapman has done weekly check-ins with these students. This was far above and beyond what I initially imagined.

""Fourteen-year-old Ahmed is stuck in a city that wants nothing to do with him. Newly arrived in Brussels, Belgium, Ahmed fled a life of uncertainty and suffering in Syria, only to lose his father on the perilous journey to the shores of Europe. Now Ahmed's struggling to get by on his own, but with no one left to trust and nowhere to go, he's starting to lose hope.
Then he meets Max, a thirteen-year-old American boy. Lonely and homesick, Max is being bothered by a bully at school, he doesn't speak a word of French, and just can't seem to do anything right. But with one startling discovery, Max and Ahmed's lives collide, banding the boys together to help Ahmed survive.""

At the end of the first half, the score was 1-0 Knights.

The second half was even more physical as both teams would not let down. CSD found an opportunity to break through and score 12 minutes into the second half. Junior Ally Smith worked hard in the backline while senior Kasey Hahn and sophomore Bri Hatch fought hard mid-field. Junior goalkeeper Kaela Rasenberger had 4 saves. The game ended in a 1-1 tie.

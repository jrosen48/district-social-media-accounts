Especially during these times when everything has turned upside down for students, please know our counselors stand ready to help them with their concerns, fears, stress, anger, and any other challenges students are facing.

Review with your children that it is normal to feel a range of emotions, and a counselor is someone who is a caring adult that can help them with their concerns and feelings. Also, share that they can ask to speak to their school counselor if they feel they need help while at school.

You can see a list of the counselors by campus at the LISD Counseling page: https://sites.google.com/lockhart.txed.net/lockhart-isd-sel/home?authuser=0",2020-09-11 16:09:47,,

The 2020 US Census numbers will determine how our government will allocate federal funding for things such as nutrition programs, emergency services, roads, medical services, school programming, and to also determine the number of representatives Texas has in our US House of Representatives.

It is incredibly important to everyone living in our country, and certainly in Caldwell County--a region experiencing tremendous growth. Help Caldwell County get the support it deserves with an accurate count by participating in the 2020 Census. Look for information being mailed to you by the US Census Bureau mid-March.

Thank you for your patience and support on our first day. Everything went really well for our first day. We were all happy to see your children. Here are a few reminders for our start and end times:

-Please have children here no earlier then 8:05 in the am and 11:50 for pm session. Kids can be picked at 11:15 for am session and 3:00 for pm session. 3rd grade can go to the cafeteria if they are here early. 4th will go to the side of the voting gym and 5th will enter into Sturdevant in the back of the Intermediate.

-Please use the crosswalk to come across highway 87. We have help at that point.

-Please use our parking lot to park your car if you get here before anyone else. Use up all the spaces before lining up. We can have two lines of pickup to make sure we have enough room for everyone. Please keep an area through the middle clear for vehicles to come through and park if needed.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1450934581757702&id=101568523360988,,0.0,"Intermediate Students and Parents...

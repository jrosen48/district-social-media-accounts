Today is Census Day! Complete the Census online in approximately five minutes or less at 2020census.gov.

The Census determines how much federal funding and services our towns, cities and schools (!) receive each year for the next decade.

Each undercounted person means an estimated $1,675 less per year (or $16,750 per person in Oklahoma over the next 10 years) in lost funding, grants and support for our communities ‚Äì so accurate representation is important!

Parents,
Here at Locust Grove Schools, we take the safety of our students very seriously. Today the Middle School administration intercepted a report that three female students made threats against the school. These students were immediately contained by administration and local authorities, and removed from the school. The district is currently cooperating with law enforcement through the investigation, and will take appropriate disciplinary action based on the facts of this case. The district will not further comment on this incident due to federal and state privacy laws.
Sincerely,
Dusty Torrey

Several news outlets have reported today that a number of Long Island school districts did not submit reopening plans to the state as required. Locust Valley was included on this list and today I was in contact with the Governor's office and the Department of Health to clarify. Although I received email confirmation of my submission, if something in that submission was amiss, I assure you that it will be rectified in a timely manner and schools will open in accordance with the reopening plans we shared with the community.

Thank you for trusting that we can resolve this misunderstanding and move on with the important business of opening schools next month.

The pink-themed bake sale raised more than $500 for the cause, but just as importantly, raised awareness of an important topic.

Reading was a family affair for fourth graders at Locust Valley Intermediate School when their parents and guardians took time out of their busy days to come to school for a community read-a-long.

Sitting on blankets under trees or in the warmth of the sun, students and their families read a variety of books. District administrators and teachers read to students whose families could not attend.

Parents of English language learners came together for an orientation session to learn about school processes and procedures, various services their children will receive and who to call when they have questions.

Amy Watson, coordinator for ENL and world languages, K-12, ran the orientation with the help of teaching assistant Cynthia Ergen. The parents not only absorbed the information shared, but had the opportunity to ask all the questions they had.

“Bilingual children have unique qualities that we want to help them develop,” Ms. Watson said. “The best way to do so is to work in partnership with the students and their families.”

Some of the topics covered included how to access the parent portal and eBoard, as well as how the ENL program operates and the individual services students receive based on their English-speaking skills.

While this orientation was for families just entering the district, there will be other events held for all ENL families, including Bilingual Night on Oct. 17 and 24.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2098205297155017&id=1444911089151111,,0.0,"ENL Orientation Welcomes Parents

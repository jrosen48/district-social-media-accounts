This evening, the San Joaquin County Office of Education (SJCOE) and San Joaquin County Public Health Services (PHS) announced revised guidelines regarding the 2020-21 school year. Due to the rise in confirmed cases of COVID-19 and increased hospitalizations in San Joaquin County, PHS and SJCOE strongly recommend that schools begin the 2020-21 school year with all students on Distance Learning through at least the end of August, 2020.

Lodi USD Board Members have acknowledged that this health crisis continues to change and that we need to continue to be flexible throughout the school year.

The Board will discuss the revised guidelines tomorrow during their Board Meeting in order to give revised direction regarding the start of the school year. The Board Meeting will be available to the public on GoToWebinar and livestreamed on YouTube. There will be time for public comment.",2020-07-14 00:07:47,,

Three cheers for Laura La Rue, one of the five finalists for San Joaquin County Teacher of the year we are celebrating this week. This English teacher at Bear Creek High School (Lodi Unified School District) has been an educator for 23 years.

""What truly elevates Ms. La Rue as an exemplary teacher is her ability to meet the needs of all students,"" writes Bear Creek High Principal Hillary Harrell in her nomination. ""Ms. La Rue monitors her students very closely throughout her instruction, and she adjusts it as necessary to meet their needs. Most teachers with her level of experience would not ask others for help, but Ms. La Rue continually asks for suggestions, especially for students who struggle.""

Congratulations Laura La Rue!

The Board of Education recognizes the negative impact this global health crisis may have on many students, especially seniors preparing for graduation. Therefore, the Board approved the modification of certain graduation requirements for the class of 2020.

For the senior class of 2020:

‚óæÔ∏èThe 4 year English requirement is reduced to 3 years, which is in alignment with the state minimum requirement. This eliminates 10 credits of English.

‚è∫The model mirrors what the District offered in the past as a result of budget concerns.

‚è∫The current plan is to offer credit recovery for this year‚Äôs 11th and 12th grade students to give them opportunities to meet graduation requirements.

‚è∫Concerns have been expressed regarding Government/Economics as many students take this opportunity in order to take other classes during the regular school year. This addition is being considered.

Patrons are invited to attend both the regular meeting at 5:00 pm and the budget hearing at 6:00.

In 1979, the program was extended to recognize students who demonstrate exceptional talent in the visual, creative and performing arts. In 2015, the program was again extended to recognize students who demonstrate ability and accomplishment in career and technical education fields.

Parents Tribute 2020

Parent Tribute 2020

We’ll begin with a giant hip, hip hooray
As we pay tribute to Adams' great parents today!
We really miss seeing your children’s faces
But overnight we were forced to change places.
Though the world’s situation has turned things around
These are wonderful things about you we’ve found.
For two months you’ve become the teacher for your child
With challenges and concerns, along with times you’ve smiled.
Since you are your child’s first and most important teacher
You do all you can to assure them a bright future.
You’ve learned to do Reflex until the light turns green
And passing a lesson a day in Dreambox is the routine.
New websites have become some of your daily tools
Like Zoom, Lexia, Remind...some sites used at schools.
You jumped in to help your own student succeed
To make progress in AR; encouraging them to read.
You’ve shown patience, help, kindness, and support
And trusted us while we worked as an Adams team cohort.

Our hats are off you. Your work is never ending,
Know our thanks, love, and respect we are sending.

This year's theme was Environmental Stability that would benefit Cache Valley. The students were asked to think creatively about a problem within Cache Valley and work together as a team to design a solution.

They began this project in December and designed a greenhouse at the school that could provide people access to fresh foods, the opportunity to learn how to work and plant, boost mental health, and create a better environment. Their idea was that our school would act as a pilot program and then we'd provide the procedure to other schools within Cache Valley to do it as well. The students even 3D printed a greenhouse model for it! They placed first place and won $3000.

An additional team did a project on traffic and road congestion and took 5th place and won $500.

It was an honor to see so many of their faces, and we were disappointed to miss a few (primarily because they were at work).

Are you wondering if homemade face masks are a good idea? The CDC recommends that homemade cloth masks—when combined with good hand hygiene and social distancing—can help slow the spread of COVID-19 in a community.

Intermountain Healthcare is proud to partner with Latter-day Saint Charities and University of Utah Health to provide the global community with informational resources as we work together to stem the spread of COVID-19.

As partners, we have developed informational guides regarding homemade cloth face masks as well as a pattern for how to make a face mask, which you can view at the link below:

As we plan to provide school lunch to students who need it during the dismissal we want to make sure we provide lunch for all students who come to school for it. In order to help us plan appropriately, please use this survey to indicate if your children will be going to the school to pick up school lunch during the dates of the school dismissal.

As a reminder, students may pick up a lunch at the elementary school they are geographically closest to. We will not serve food at the middle school or high school, so students in grades 6-12 should also go to the elementary school in their neighborhood for lunch.

Please contact the district office at 435-755-2300 with any questions.

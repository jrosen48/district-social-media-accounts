Chieftain Elementary is conducting a ""Random Acts of Kindness Week"". Each day has a theme where students get to dress up and participate. Also, during this week, students are encouraged to conduct their own random act of kindness for others. Our Student Council chose as one of their random acts of kindness to clean up the cafeteria after all the lunches were completed. They recognized all the hard work by our custodian, Gary Sullivan.

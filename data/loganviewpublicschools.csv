Attention Logan View Music Supporters. Friday, November 15, 2019 our band is participating in the Battle of the Pep Bands in Pender, NE. at 7:00 p.m. Come out and enjoy pep band music from several schools in the area.

Admission will be $2 and once again this year, we will have individual buckets for each participating school that your fans will put their admission into, and are also welcome to give a free will donation too. All of it will be added up at the end of the night and awarded to each respective school with the school bringing in the most money being awarded the ""Entourage Award"", making it a bit of a fund raiser the more of your fans you can get to come. There will be concessions available and the event will start at 7pm.

If you can't make it and want to donate some $$$$$ there are several people going that can put your donation in the bucket. Thank you for the support. The kids appreciate it.",0.0,"Traci Myers Hilbers

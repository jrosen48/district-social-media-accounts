The Lohn JV Eagles were victorious Thursday night against the Olfen Mustang JV team at Eagle Stadium winning 44-0. Lohn first score came as Bryan Otte takes the kickoff return and runs it in for a touchdown. Otte would score two more times. Other scores were made by Jory Richardson (playing in his first game as an JV Eagle) scoring three times and DJ Stewart who had one TD. Also, Taylor Bass ran in two PAT's.

The Eagles also picked up a safety as the Mustangs were tackled in their own endzone. The game was called at the 4:29 mark in the third quarter leaving the final score at 44-0. Earlier, the Jr High Eagles had a great game as they defeat the Olfen Mustangs by the score of 26-8 - Great job Jr. High Eagles!

Overall, a great effort by the JV Eagles! Next game for the Eagles will be against the May JV at home on Sept 20th.",0.0,"Brady Today had a great post about the two games last night! Way to go Eagles!!

London teachers and students receive annual training in Signs of Suicide in several different grade levels. Please remember, students who are at risk may be at an even greater risk due to the death of a peer. It is very important, whether you have received this training or not, that If you or someone you know needs help right away, you call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), call 911, or go to the nearest emergency department.

This afternoon, administrators at Matthew Thornton School called for a Secure Campus at the advice of the Londonderry Police Department after a report was made of a suspicious person near the school. In keeping with our District protocol, the other three schools in the vicinity also entered Secure Campus status.

The schools resumed normal operations immediately after that determination was made.

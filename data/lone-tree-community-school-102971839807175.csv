It's SENIOR NIGHT! It's also white out...wear your white!

Just a few new things we need to adhere to in our covid world: face coverings on are a must for entry, there is very limited seating on the lower level bleachers, entry is located in the elementary lobby (no south parking lot entry), and there is a limited concession stand.

We will be live streaming if you would rather cheer from home:

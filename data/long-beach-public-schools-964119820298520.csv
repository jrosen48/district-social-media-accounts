I hope you all are doing well! Today, I wanted to be sure to give a shout-out to our dedicated food service workers, under the direction of Mr. Kyle Swan. Do you know that we are distributing over 400 meals daily? Our food service workers have been amazing---out there rain or shine, making sure our students have meals. We are so grateful for their service!

As we begin our third week of at-home learning, we wanted to ask for your feedback. I have spoken with some parents via phone or email, but wanted to give you all a chance to let us know how it’s going. Here is a link to a super brief survey. Let us know what is working, and what needs improvement.
https://forms.gle/d81TJMv6b9S7zpDc6

Please take just a few minutes and let us know your thoughts. And be honest! We really want this to work for our families!

And lastly tonight, the final of our “cheerful video” series. This time it’s our Admin Team, trying to bring some cheer and laughter to your day!

Teams were tasked with uncovering clues that directed them to specific locations in the gymnasium. Fourth-grade officials checked the responses, and if correct, select team members “travelled” to stations that represented different continents and bodies of water. There they received envelopes containing questions and challenges for their respective groups to complete.

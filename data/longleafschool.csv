We stood for our States, for our students, for our profession- GREAT TEACHERS CHANGE LIVES!

Thank you CCSSO - The Council of Chief State School Officers, Extra Yard for Teachers, the College Football Playoof Championship, the City of NOLA and all of the individuals and Education advocates who made this opportunity possible. The #NTOY19 Framily stood in unity and celebrated EACH and EVERY moment from this last year, our individual paths and our collective journey.

I love you all! I have loved representing as the NC TOY, and apart from being a husband, a father, and a #EducatorDiplomat, the true honor of my life. More to come as I reflect on this experience and the next steps of this blessed adventure, we call LIFE! Kelly Keen McKinney and I are coming home, to NC, to The Shire...

IT’S FINISHED!!

Nothing can replace the human experience of performing with one another!

This video at least tries to simulate that feeling, and give a final product to all of the hard work the students have put in.

After Hours was about to embark on our jazz festival circuit season before the school closure. We couldn’t let all of the hard work go to waste.

So they came together, each in their own homes, and recorded this.

We WILL get through this and be able to Breathe Again!

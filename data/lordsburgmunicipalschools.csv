Dear Families,

Students of Lordsburg Municipal Schools are being hit hard with the flu. Today, HMS brought in another Health Care
Provider to help see your children before the weekend.

Per Dr. Lucas our Superintendent, if your student goes home sick, they may not return the very next day. They have to be free of serious symptoms for 24 hours before they can return or have a Health Care Provider’s note saying they can return.

Flu symptoms: fever, headache, general aches and pains, fatigue, weakness, exhaustion, chest discomfort, cough, sore throat, sneezing, stuffy nose. May turn into bronchitis or pneumonia.

Cold symptoms: general aches and pains, some fatigue, stuffy nose, sneezing, sore throat, chest discomfort, cough. May turn into sinus congestion and earache.

It is not too late to get the flu shot. Please contact your Health Care Provider.

We need to inform you of a situation that occurred at LHS this morning. Allegations were made by several of our students that another student was threatening to “shoot up the school.” We took these allegations seriously, as our students’ safety is our top priority. We notified law enforcement immediately. Our local law enforcement officers supported and secured our facility. Simultaneously, law enforcement was able to make contact with the student and family and found no credible threat had taken place. As a precaution, we continued to run our campuses in a “shelter in place” mode for the duration of the morning. Since there was no credible threat to our campuses or students, we resumed normal procedures at lunch.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=971564953053955&id=284634015080389,,0.0,"Parents,

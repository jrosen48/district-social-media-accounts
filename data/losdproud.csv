I am delighted to begin sharing my educational leadership lens with you here in my first LOSD blog. It has been wonderful to settle into our home here in Lake Oswego, to become part of this beautiful community. I have continued listening and learning from students, teachers, classified staff, administrators, parents and community members. I am inspired by both the strong foundation here in LOSD, the talented and dedicated staff, and the exciting work ahead. In many ways, education is having a watershed moment right now. More than ever before, we are preparing our students to build a future that we cannot yet imagine. Innovation and a rapidly changing world is impacting teaching and learning. Preparing our students well means developing global competencies, including academics and activities, and the knowledge, skills and dispositions needed to thrive in a diverse, interconnected world.

The 2019 Local Option Levy would maintain existing funding while levying homeowners an additional $0.25 per $1,000 of assessed value for a total cost of $1.64 per $1,000. An owner of a home with a median assessed value of $450,000 would pay an additional cost of approximately $9.33 per month. An estimated total levy of $738 per year would be assessed on the median homeowner if the levy passes. If the proposed levy does not pass, the total tax assessment would decrease when the current levy expires in 2020.

Next thing we knew, other people in town were asking for Sox Boxes to put out at their places of business, as well.

For the last month, Ben has been collecting socks and donations for socks. Yesterday, he began the sorting process. Today, we will pick up the remainder of the Sox Boxes. This weekend, we will sort them and Monday or Tuesday, we will bring them to two shelters in Lafayette.

There are hundreds of pairs here!! I am blown away by the influence that LAVCA has had on Ben's life! He never would have done this if he had stayed in public school.

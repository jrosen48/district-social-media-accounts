Please find our State Leadership and Skills Conference Update attached. In light of the coronavirus, we have made the difficult decision to alter the manner in which our 2020 SLSC will be conducted. The conference, set for April 15-18, 2020, will not happen in person. Together with our SkillsUSA NM Board of Directors, we plan to hold a ""virtual"" conference.

Thank you for everything you do and for your continued support,

The City of Lowell has opened an emergency shelter in the gymnasium of the Stoklosa Middle School, located at 560 Broadway Street. The shelter will accommodate asymptomatic individuals experiencing homelessness that have been exposed to individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19. No individuals who have tested positive will be directed to the Stoklosa site.

The emergency shelter is intended to support the mitigation of the risk of a COVID-19 outbreak within the population served by the existing shelter. Its opening comes following extensive planning untaken by the City in partnership with Southern Middlesex Opportunity Council (SMOC) and the Lowell Community Health Center to address the distinct vulnerability that the coronavirus crisis poses to individuals experiencing homelessness.

The current events round was a highlight as Elizabeth Zhan, Sara Skaff, Jack Soucy, and Erin Shetler swept all 6 questions and earned a perfect score of 60. In the toss-up round, Evan Blaschke was quick on the buzzer and well supported by River Kelly and Rutt Kho. In the bonus toss-up round our youngest team member, 6th grader Dash Hanson had a clutch response in the science categories that enabled the team to earn bonus points. The team really saved their buzzer speed for the aptly named speed round, though, where they added 90 more points to the team score, due in large part to the multiple answers provided by Nana Opoku. These nine students represented the school with dignity and pride and they look forward to competing again next week in the semi-finals.",0.0,"Congrats to the Daley Middle School Knowledge Bowl team!

Join KYUK and Pamyua for a Yuraq Music Video Collaboration!

Quarantine has us stuck inside but that can't keep us from dancing. Send us a Yuraq Selfie video to ""Tarvarnauramken""/""Blessing Song"" and we'll produce one video with all of us dancing together.

Here's what you need to know:
- Send your video to wellness@kyuk.org by Tuesday, April 14

-Please film yourself dancing to ""Tarvarnauramken"" or ""Blessing Song"" as performed and recorded by Pamyua in this YouTube link:

Use this version of the song so that we are all dancing to the same beat.

-Please film the video horizontally or in landscape.

- Give us some attitude. Make us laugh or make us cry. Wear your best qaspeq, your favorite Y-K Delta hoodie or a homemade mask. Express yourself through your performance and clothing and don't be afraid to show us what you got!

-Stay Safe and Healthy!

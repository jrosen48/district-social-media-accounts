Safety Tips for Motorists When Sharing the Road with ""The Big Yellow Cheese"" (<---joke--we love and appreciate our drivers and fleet!!❤️❤️)

--Pay attention to the bus's flashing warning lights and mechanical ""stop sign arm.""
--Make a complete stop when the bus's warning lights are flashing, or the stop sign arm comes out. Do not proceed until the arm is lowered and the lights stop flashing.
--Lower your driving speed around schools and especially where children are loading and unloading from buses and cars.
--Share the road with the yellow bus.

Since March 16th, these heroes have served over 70,000 meals to the youth of La Porte. Rain, snow, or sunshine, the team was out there helping LPCSC families.

There will be no meals served next week so that the team can prepare for the summer feeding program, which goes from June 1st-June 25th and will run Mon-Thurs from 10-12 at the same seven locations that have been used for the past weeks. A double meal will be given on Thursdays.

Thank you again, food service team. Your work has not gone unnoticed and is deeply appreciated.",2020-05-22 18:05:35,,

Isabella, who is a fourth grader in Miss Cooper's class, has been working very hard all weekend sewing masks to donate to local health care workers. The masks she is creating have a pocket to insert a filter and a spot to insert a pipe cleaner or wire for above your nose. Bella we are so proud of you!

As a result of this decision, the La Porte Community School Corporation has now officially closed all buildings to the public and limited access to those employees deemed to be ""essential"" in order for us to maintain critical operations.

Parents, students, and community members are encouraged to visit our website and follow social media for important announcements including our food distribution schedule.

Mrs. Messacar from the Soil and Water Conservation District gave a presentation on the different animals in LaPorte and what they do to stay warm in the winter. After going over vocabulary like hibernation, adaptation, and migration, they were able to inspect the pelts of native mammals! Then, they played a game where they had to sort different animals into their survival tactics. Did you know that some amphibians essentially freeze during the winter?

Leap Day gives us an extra 24 hours, and Mrs. Lebo and a group of art students used it to make a beautiful difference. After a great deal of prep work by Lebo, she and a group of talented Slicer artists spent their Saturday morning at the Adult Probation Department at the La Porte Security Complex. The new offices require probationers to enter through the Courthouse, go through screening, and then walk down a long hallway to get to the offices. The LP County Commissioners approved having LPHS improve “the tunnel” with paintings. Inspirational quotes were chosen to line the walls in hopes to connect with probationers coming into the office.

A counselor from Mr. Braden's former elementary school in Plano, Texas, saw the pictures from LPMS and was inspired to bring the magic to her school as well. Mrs. Carreno, the counselor from Texas, just sent some of her photos of their finished product to Mr. Braden.

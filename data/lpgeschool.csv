Hello everyone!
I hope your summer is going well!

There will be summer volleyball practices starting July 7th on Tuesdays and Thursdays for grades 7-12. We will be having two different times scheduled for players to come in and practice their skills, 10:00-11:30am and 12:30-2pm. Our goal for having two different time slots is to limit the amount of people in the gym at a time and to allow more one on one work with a coach.

Players please check you school emails to find out more information. Players should bring their own water bottles, shoes (both volleyball shoes and running shows), towels, or anything else they may need. If you have any questions contact the head coach via email.

Last week, May 4-8, 2020, was Teacher Appreciation week, and the LPGE elementary school (all staff) decided to celebrate with their students on Friday. There was a parade of parents and kids in cars and on bicycles going past the school, waving, laughing and cheering because they miss each other.

Distance Learning is just that- distant. One of the main reasons teachers go into this profession is to be WITH their students in the same room looking over their shoulder and assisting them in any way necessary. That being said, teachers are doing an outstanding job of helping students virtually. There are so many challenges, and both students and teachers have risen to the occasion. THANK YOU so much for your dedication.",4.0,"Long Prairie Area Chamber of Commerce added 71 new photos to the album: LPGE Stronger Together Parade.

Just some insight to help clarify the food distribution process. Any Lincoln Park family can pre-order the meals for all of their students using the www.mypaymentsplus.com website or the app. All pre-orders must be made by Noon on Tuesdays. You can then pick these items up at whatever school you choose in your pre-order. If you do not pre-order, you can drop in on the high school site and pick up your meals there. Unfortunately, you cannot just drop in to the elementary sites, you will need to pre-order for that. Also, we were aware that there was a problem with the app and that has now been resolved. More information regarding the meal distribution can be found on our site. www.lincolnparkpublicschools.com/returntolearn",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3299760330090521&id=199766476756604,"LINCOLNPARKPUBLICSCHOOLS.COM

It was a difficult task and at times we faced huge crowds and moments of zero people in line. We faced some people getting in line hours before we opened to people arriving just as we were closing. Through it all, we saw smiling faces, LP pride, and a task complete. Thank you to our Director of Technology Mr. Ken Jacobs for planning all of this and to all our countless staff members that worked tirelessly to ensure we got out as many of these devices as we could.

Jenna Brewer

All District and All Region player last year, I can almost guarantee she would have been an All State player this year. You talk about pure softball player she is at the top of the list. She knows the game inside and out. Every time she stepped to the plate I knew she would see 8+ pitches, get a hit or both. It was always fun and exciting to watch her at the plate. She played multiple infield position and she played everyone well. She is continuing her Education at Trine University as a Bowler. I am so proud of her, because she is able to go to next level regardless of the sport. To her I say, “Go strike out!” Never thought you hear a softball coach say that, bowl all the 300 games you can. Show them your competitiveness and desire to win! Don’t be a stranger to the program and best of luck to you, Go Rails!",0.0,"Lincoln Park Softball

Jade Bates

Jade Bates, Jade Bates, Jade Bates, as the team chants in the dugout! Jade is the best combination of athleticism and softball player I have ever coached. She is the player every team wants. Every coach would say, “I’d love to have that #9.” I’m grateful she was a Railsplitter. She wore that orange and blue with pride! The 5 tool player they talk about, she is just that, she can hit for a high batting average, for power, runs the bases well, throws well and fields well. She is undecided where she wants to attend school, but where ever she goes I hope she takes the opportunity to walk on to the softball team because they would get a great athlete, softball player, and most importantly a GREAT person. Jade was also an All League, All District and All New Herald player for us two years in a row(she would have done it again.) Don’t be a stranger to the program, Go Rails!",0.0,"Lincoln Park Softball

Day 3 of 5 Celebrating our Seniors is

Emily Kaczur

Em as I like to call her, might be the toughest on the field player I have every coached. She shows no emotion high or low and she pitches in the freezing cold with snow falling, with no sweatshirt or jacket just her jersey(picture below.) Pitching is not easy and it is stressful, but she did it. She will be continuing in the Middle College program at WCCCD next year then looking to transfer. Em is a coach in the making, although I feel there is still a ton left in the tank. She has been All League and All News Herald. I wish you all the best! Tell your sister I’m not so bad!

Day 2 of 5 Celebrating OUR Seniors Is...

Kali Johnson

What can I say, I’ve know Kali since the days of 8u Mini Stealth Fall Ball. We had a team full of kids that didn’t really play a lot and ended up 3rd in the League. When I took over at LPHS she began playing more and more softball. Softball is her #1. As a sophomore on Varsity, she finished the season as one of the top hitters. Unfortunately with the cancellation of her Senior Year and a Knee injury junior year, I was only able to have 1 season. Kali is continuing her softball dream at Albion next year. She is a fantastic leader on and off the field. When she talks people listen. She will be a deadly hitter and fielder in time, Albion is lucky to have her! Please don’t be a stranger to the program!

Happy Monday!
I miss you all and hope you are staying active and motivated to stay healthy! Attached is a video of one of my students that created an obstacle course using sidewalk chalk! I am so proud of his dedication to staying healthy and active. I am challenging you to create an obstacle course of your own or using the following example:

I really liked this example because it gives you ways to use sight words, verbs, letter recognition, and you could even use multiplication problems or other math problems for older students.

Parents, We hope this post finds you all well and safe. We want to thank you for your continued effort and support through our implementation of our Distance Learning Plan. Each of your children should be actively engaged in their teacher's Google Classrooms and completing assignments daily. I realize that this can be challenging for parents as they navigate through schedules and assistance for their children. Ms. Randall, Mr. Brehmer and Mr. Masters will be holding a question/answer session for parents. This is not mandatory, but if you have questions for us, this would be a good time to attend. If you can't attend and have questions, you can feel free to email Ms. Randall at tara.randall@lpps.info. Use this link to join the meeting. Thank you all and have a great day!

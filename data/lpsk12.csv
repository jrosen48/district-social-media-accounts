1st grade teacher Mrs. Metherd is growing baby chicks virtually with her class. She candled (held a light under) the eggs and it looks like 9 of the 12 eggs have some development in them and is hopeful some will hatch. Do you know the phrase “Don’t count your chickens before they hatch.”? Mrs. Metherd says be sure to talk to a parent about what you think it means.

Chicks take 21 days to develop and grow and Mrs. Metherd provided a timeline and coloring activities for her students to follow developments along on their daily chick journey.

Once the chicks hatch we'll share photos of their progress over the summer!

Mrs. Holt asked her 5th Grade class to write to seniors at a few different nursing homes. One fifth grader, Brendan made a pen-pal by doing so! Brendan and his family thought the first response from his pen-pal in the nursing home was sweet and could be shared to let students know they made a huge difference with that writing exercise.

Our School Lunch Heroes truly are a bright light for our district, community, and most importantly our students. We have served nearly 35,000 meals since schools have closed and we could not do that without our AMAZING team. We are so proud of their hard work and dedication in ensuring students are provided with nutritious meals no matter the situation.

As a way to show our staff (and everyone!) just how much we love and appreciate what they do, we teamed up with some of our friends here at LPS to create this video. We hope you enjoy it, and take the chance to thank your school lunch hero today (and every day)! Not all heroes wear capes, some wear aprons. ❤️

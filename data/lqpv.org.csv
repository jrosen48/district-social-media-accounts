Through the coordinated efforts of the Lac qui Parle County Sheriff’s Office, the Lac qui Parle County Attorney’s Office, the MN Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and staff members at the Lac qui Parle Valley Schools, the author of the threatening message written on the wall of a bathroom stall in late February was identified and has confessed to writing the message.
It was determined that the student acted alone and, given the individual's cooperation, the school district no longer considers the matter a threat to students or staff. The student has been removed from the school pending discipline. Since the author is a minor, we are unable to release information about the individual.
We appreciate everyone’s patience and assistance during this investigation.

🎾 Children playing outside should keep a 6 foot distance from each other
🛴 Cleaning & Disinfecting indoor and outdoor play equipment is important

Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Lac qui Parle Valley Prom, originally scheduled for May 2, is being postponed. The plan is to find two alternative dates. Option #1 would be a date in June and Option #2 would be a date in July. If the COVID-19 Pandemic pushes into the date that is selected for July, Lac qui Parle Valley would be forced to make the difficult decision to cancel prom for the 2020 school year.

One of the challenges we are facing is to find a site, as the Lac qui Parle Valley schools will be under construction during the summer months. The other concern that the prom/daybreak committee is working through is finding a date that works for the entertainment and vendors that have been reserved for the original May date.

We are asking that parents email their student's teacher either a scan or a picture of their child's completed reading log. The teacher will then confirm that the 10-hour goal was met and then award the student their ticket in the teacher's dashboard. After the ticket has been awarded, the teacher can either print or email the ticket to the student. Reminder: reading logs are due by April 30th and teachers can award tickets until May 15th.

HH Families,

The HH At Home Learning Courses are up and running! Blackboard e-mails were sent out with the course codes this morning. Teachers will also be sending the course codes home via SeeSaw. If you have not received the needed course codes, please contact me at jeffrey_smecker@L-Spioneers.org.

Our goal this week is to get as many students enrolled in the courses as possible and start getting them acclimated to the online learning environment. While we certainly wish we were doing all of this under a better set of circumstances, we are optimistic about overcoming the challenges we face while continuing to support your child's education. Our staff is collaborating virtually every day to create a positive and supportive online learning environment.

To accomplish this, we will be using Schoology as our central resource. Schoology will serve as the main hub for students to access a variety of resources your children will be using during the closure. More information will be out later this week regarding access to devices.

Be well and be safe,

Today is Activity Thursday with Maya. Share with us your favorite outdoor/indoor activities.

üêæHello Everyone! I can not wait for you to share what you have been doing. I have been spending a lot of time outside with my family going on long walks. I miss all of you and can‚Äôt wait to see you when we get back.

Here are a few fun facts about me.

*I am 5 years old.
*My birthday is Oct 17.
*I was part of the great thinkers dog litter.
*I was the first SSD dog place at L-S.
*I live with my cousin Shepard and my 2 human siblings.
*I love to go to work everyday, and when I come home I enjoy some quiet time under my human‚Äôs bed.
*I love neighborhood walks, and long hikes in the woods.
*Most of all, I love people (especially dog people).

Can‚Äôt wait to see what you are all doing.

Today is throw back Thursday for Mini Thon. Teachers and students are dressed up in clothing from earlier eras of their life. I guess I could have worn a purple vest today, like the one I had when I was a pup in training, but instead I found mini-Maya. She looks a lot like me when I was just a wee pup. So some of my handlers are working with throw-back Maya today.

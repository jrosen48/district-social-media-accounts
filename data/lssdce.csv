Are you interested in growing healthier happier plants in your landscape? Did you know that there are over 400 species of native bees in Minnesota, and they are essential in the health of many of our native plants, shrubs and trees? They also fill a large role in pollinating many of our vegetables, ornamental flowers, and herbs. Even better still, many of our native bees are stingless, meaning they are safe to encourage living on your property. If you are interested in better understanding native bees, how to support them within your own property, and what they can do for you, join us for a session all about bees. Register by 10/15.

If you're renewing a driver license in MN, this is now optional before you go to take less time in the DMV. DE instructor Chris Belanger just did it, and said it was pretty painless.

With the launch of the new FAST/DS system on October 1, take a moment to learn about the importance of the new pre-application feature. This process will allow applicants to enter a significant portion of their driver’s license application online before going into a driver’s license office. This process takes about 10-15 minutes and will cut down on wait times at the driver’s license office. Consider completing the pre-application. This feature can also be used by anyone who is renewing their MN license or requesting a duplicate MN license, in addition to anyone who is obtaining a MN credential for the first time.

Pre-application can be found on our website at: (https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/dvs/Pages/default.aspx)

LASD School Lunch Heroes - No need for a Cape when you have an Apron!

The food service ladies have been serving between 150 - 180 bagged lunches each day since the middle of March which must still meet strict government standards. Michelle and Shannon operate the curbside service and Kelli goes on the road to deliver meals to those without transportation. The transportation department has provided a school van which Debbie Evans and Bruce Weaver have stepped up to drive.

When we asked these ladies why they didn’t hesitate to help, the answers were simple. First, and foremost, they love and care about the well-being of their students, and secondly seeing how grateful the families are as they disperse the meals is a reward that makes it all worthwhile.

Thanks to all our everyday heroes out there!",5.0,"Our food service workers go above and beyond! #thunderboltsflyworldclass

A great opportunity to support the Thunderbolt Foundation is happening right now! The Picket Fence Brigade, an anonymous group of Adams County community members, launched the Cheery Bird project to support non-profit businesses in Adams County that have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Five hundred wooden birds have been distributed to local businesses, where local residents are encouraged to pick one up for free, decorate it, and post a picture to the Facebook Cheery Birds group, on instagram with #cheerybirds, or email it to picketfencebrigade@gmail.com.
When a picture is posted, include the name of the Thunderbolt Foundation and the Picket Fence Brigade will donate $20 to our non-profit!

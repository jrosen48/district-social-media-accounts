This year, all Legacy Traditional Schools will have one dress down day per quarter. Dates will be sent out soon with more information. There is no fee to participate in dress down day.

Students will have a chance to show their school spirit on Legacy Day on the last Friday of each month that school is in session. On Legacy Day, students may wear spirit T-shirts (purchased through the Legacy site (https://shop.legacytraditional.org/) or PTO/PVO), regular uniform polo, or school shirts that were made in previous years, including school musical shirts, sports jerseys, student council shirts, etc. Expectations for pants, skirts, jumpers, shoes, outerwear, jewelry, cosmetics and hair will remain the same as a normal school day.

Finally, Spirit Week will be held towards the end of the school year. In the spring, students and parents will be able to vote on the theme for each day of Spirit Week.

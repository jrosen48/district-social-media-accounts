While we are all sheltering at home and unable to attend school in person, I thought it might be fun to participate in a virtual math challenge together! Here are videos of my own kids (ages 4 and 5) representing the number 5 in very different ways. How many unique ways can you come up with to show 5? For younger students, this could be visually or with a simple number sentence. For older students, it might be a word problem or even a complex multi-step equation! You don’t have to post a video if you don’t want to, a picture is ok. I can’t wait to see what you come up with!

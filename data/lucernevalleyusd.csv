After I graduate I plan to go to school in Nevada and work as a heavy duty diesel mechanic then start my own business. I have been showing market goats at fair for quite a few years. My favorite memory of fair is teaching the kids about agriculture. I love being on the Junior Fair Board and meeting the new people.”

It started Thursday night as the girls would open up playoff action taking on Packinghouse Christian. The defense from the lady Mustangs was the stat of the night as our girls held the Bears to just 4 baskets made all game. Senior Krystian Otwell would lead the Mustangs scoring 17 points and the girls would take a win in the 1st round of playoffs 33-11.

Next up was a home game vs the #5 seed Coastal Christian. This game was a nail bitter, going back and forth as both teams would play excellent defense.

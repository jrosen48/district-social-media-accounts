The Arroyo Grande Police Department is hosting a regional active shooter training exercise at Arroyo Grande High School on Tuesday, July 30, 2019 and Saturday, August 3, 2019. The training will begin at approximately 8:00 A.M. and end at approximately 5:00 P.M. on both training dates.

During the training, you should expect to see a large law enforcement presence at the high school. You may also hear loud explosions or the sounds of simulated gun shots throughout the day, both of which are not emergencies and are part of the training exercise. Several areas of the campus will be blocked off with caution tape, and “Police Training” signs. A safety officer will be easily identifiable with a red training shirt and the participating officers will be in police uniform.

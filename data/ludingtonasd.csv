Have you been working from home and having quirky problems with VOIP calls and such using Skype for Business (or other similar clients)? Problems can be things like people not able to hear you (but you can hear them), calls dropping, etc.

If so, look and see if your router has a setting for SIP ALG (Session Initiation Protocol Application Layer Gateway) and disable it. In many, many cases this will fix your call problems.

All informational materials distributed by the District were reviewed by legal counsel and determined to be consistent with state election law. Additionally, the use of public resources by the District for a communication about a local ballot proposal less than 60 days before the election does not violate Michigan law. Almost three years ago, on April 28, 2016, a federal court ruled that the “60-day” prohibition was unconstitutionally vague and permanently enjoined the Secretary of State from enforcing the law.

SANTA'S WORKSHOP IS COMING TO TOWN!!
Ludlow PTO will be hosting our Annual Santa's Workshop Dec 3rd thru 5th & on Saturday Dec 7th from 8-12 with Breakfast with Santa. Check your child's backpack next week for a Fun Services flyer, an envelope to safely and conveniently hold money for your child's shopping, and the scheduled time when your child will be visiting the workshop.Students will be visiting the workshop during their specials.
At this time, we are looking for Santa's Helpers to assist our young shoppers while they shop for their loved ones. We need helpers to help budget their items on their list as they enter the workshop. They also need assistance with wrapping and tagging-there is a job for everyone!.
Volunteers are needed Tues (Dec 3rd) thru Thurs (Dec 5th) from 8am to 3pm. Even if its for an hour, we can use you!! Simply send us a msg or reply on here so we can mark you in!!
Attached is the schedule when your child will visit the shop.
Thank you!!",2019-11-30 20:02:17,,

Tonight our Lady Panthers young and old came to together with By Grace Alone Farm Ministry and First Baptist Church to serve the community.

This week is fire safety week. Kindergarten, First and Second grade students visited the firehouse today. During this visit we talked about the theme of the week, to Plan and Practice your Escape. We empowered them to be a hero by asking you, their family, about their home escape plan. Take the time tonight to work on your family home escape plan, before it’s too late.

A home escape plan includes working smoke alarms on every level of the home, and near all the sleeping areas. It also includes two ways out of every room like a door and a window. A clear path to a meeting place that is safely away like a tree, mailbox or light pole. Practice this plan twice a year. We also discussed closing doors to bedrooms as they sleep.",0.0,"Thank you, Ludlow Fire Department!

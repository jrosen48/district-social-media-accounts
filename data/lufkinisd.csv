The steel beams are going up at the new Lufkin High School Multi-purpose building. The brand-new building will stretch over 65,200 square feet and house a competition gym, practice gym and cross-court volleyball. The facility will also be used for assemblies, pep rallies, competitions for events such as robotics and other school sanctioned activities.

Dear Parents and Staff,
Luling ISD has been notified that a Luling High School student who attended the girls’ strength camp on Monday, June 8th has tested positive for COVID-19. The student did not attend the strength camp the remainder of the week.

Coaches enforced all UIL guidelines during practice, however due to CDC guidelines for schools, the girls’ strength camp has been cancelled for the next two weeks. The two coaches who were present during Monday’s practice will self-monitor at home for the next 14 days.

If your child attended the strength camp on Monday the 8th, we advise that you monitor her health, follow the CDC guidelines for people who have had close contact, and contact your primary care physician if she develops symptoms.

The district will remain transparent with our families and will continue to take necessary precautions in order to maintain the health and safety of our students, their families, and our staff.

Sincerely,
Erin Warren

Every staff member is an educator. No matter what your job description says, at the end of the day, you are working to provide an education to students. And all of us know that this job is so much more than imparting knowledge. What you do for kids is unparalleled. Even though our year with them was short, you made a difference in their lives. I appreciate you.

Love,
Mrs. Warren

TEA has mandated that districts progress monitor student performance on remote learning. This means that students must return specific assignments and we must grade them. Student performance on these assignments will be reflected on their final report card.

Last night the Board approved our proposed changes to the grading guidelines for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year. We believe these new guidelines will allow us to measure a students' mastery of the district curriculum, provide timely and meaningful feedback to students and parents, and allow for multiple opportunities for students to demonstrate mastery of learning while at home.

Out of an abundance of caution, LISD will extend Spring Break for another week. While there are still no confirmed cases in our community, administration has made this decision in the best interest of students and staff.

All Luling students will be eligible for ""grab and go"" breakfast and lunch for the week of March 16th - 20th. Details on where meals can be picked up and the hours available will be forthcoming.

Administration has begun working on an instructional support plan for our students. Information related to this plan will be sent out as soon as it is finalized.

We do not yet know if students will need to make up this time. We also do not know what the next steps will be after this initial closing. Therefore, please continue to watch our Facebook page and website (www.luling.txed.net) for additional information as it is available.

Sincerely,
Erin Warren
Superintendent

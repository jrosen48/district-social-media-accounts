To Our Spring Sport Seniors,

My heart goes out to every senior who has lost their final season as a Raider or Lady Raider. You should all know that, in spite of your shortened senior year, your impact on the Lumberton Athletic Program has been significant. You leave Lumberton High School with a tremendous amount of respect from your coaches. The commitment, character, and work ethic that you all have displayed over the last four years has raised the standard of Lumberton Athletics. While the pain and disappointment of losing the remainder of this year is intense now, it will slowly fade. I trust that the teachings of our program, lessons of hard work, integrity, and teamwork will carry on for your entire life. Please continue to be safe as our country recovers from this pandemic.

Parents,

Lumberton Intermediate would like to thank all our parents for your participation in on-line and packet learning. This has been a season of change, and I feel that our staff and parents have definitely risen to the occasion. Thank you! Moving forward, from our return from Spring Break until we return to school we will be utilizing again paper packets and online. Many of our students enjoyed having both, but please know that either option is fine to use to enhance your child’s academics. Packets for the next phase will be available the week after spring break and how we distribute these packets will come soon as we concrete our final plans. We want to make sure we are ensuring the safety of our staff, parents, and students. Please watch our webpage for more information.
I hope everyone enjoys their Easter weekend and Spring Break! Take time as a family to enjoy games, outdoor activities and family time during this season of being quarantined.

Hoping all my school family and students stay safe and well!

Governor Abbott Announces Temporary Closure Of State Parks And Historic Sites

From Texas Governor's Office:

AUSTIN - Governor Greg Abbott has directed the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) to close all state parks and historic sites as part of the state’s efforts to strengthen social distancing practices and prevent gatherings of large groups of people. Historic sites and state parks will close to the public starting at 5:00 PM this evening and will reopen at the direction of the Governor.

""Social distancing is our best tool to curb the spread of COVID-19 and save lives,"" said Governor Abbott. ""The temporary closure of our state parks and historic sites will help us achieve this goal by preventing the gathering of large groups of people. I urge all Texans to continue to stay at home except for essential services as we respond to COVID-19. By following these social distance practices, we will overcome this challenge together.""

The College Board is developing tools to mitigate the impact of school closures on students in the Advanced Placement Program. All AP students and teachers will be able to draw on the free online resources that were provided to every AP classroom this fall. Additional resources will be made easily accessible to AP students and teachers through mobile phones and other devices. These include free online AP lessons and review sessions from some of the top AP teachers in the country.

The AP program is finalizing streamlined AP exam options that would allow students to test at home, depending on the situation in May. We’re working to give every AP student the opportunity to claim the credit they’ve earned. The AP Program will communicate the details of these additional solutions to educators and students by March 20.

The College Board’s focus will remain on student safety and ensuring all students have the tools they need to work, and opportunities to receive the credit they have earned, during this challenging time.

Please do not flush items such as baby wipes, paper towels, clothing, diapers, or other items not intended to be flushed.
Flushing of these items may cause blockages in your sewer line and possibly the Districts main lines resulting in sewer backups. This also applies to so called “flushable wipes” which do not break down and commonly cause blockages. The term flushable doesn’t mean it won’t cause problems.

Keeping hands clean is one of the most important things we can do to stop the spread of germs and stay healthy.

Stop Germs! Wash Your Hands.
WHEN?
•After using the bathroom
•Before, during, and after preparing food
•Before eating food
•Before and after caring for someone at home who is sick with vomiting or diarrhea
•After changing diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toilet
•After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing
•After touching an animal, animal feed, or animal waste
•After handling pet food or pet treats
•After touching garbage

HOW?
•Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap.
•Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Be sure to lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
•Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the “Happy Birthday” song from beginning to end twice.
•Rinse hands well under clean, running water.

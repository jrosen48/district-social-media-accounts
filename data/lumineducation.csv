Dr. Montessori opened the doors to her first school in 1907. Through the learning materials she designed herself, students' natural curiosity and innate desire to learn took root and by 1911, the Montessori Method had grown into a worldwide movement.

Her legacy continues on today at Lumin Education, Dallas' first public Montessori school, where we encourage students to engage in hands-on projects and to follow their own instincts and curiosity to discover and embrace the world around them.

Feeling estranged from your own child is painful.

Research indicates the most important predictor of a child’s emotional and psychological stability is the closeness of the parent/child relationship. If your child is not opening up when they are upset, the relationship may not be as close as it needs to be. There are two habits that parents routinely engage in that shut down communication and drive a child away: negating feelings and mistaking sympathy for empathy.

In many cases, honoring your child’s feelings is all they need to feel better. Simply knowing their parent understands allows them to feel secure and forge ahead. Some sympathetic statements, on the other hand, disrupt any chance of emotional attunement, instead of helping them work through their difficult feelings.

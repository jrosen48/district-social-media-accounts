Congratulations to Tessa ""Katheryne"" Cline from the Lumpkin Site! Tessa has been in four different high schools within the last four years. In February of 2020, she decided MECHS was the best option to graduate on time. In her free time, she enjoys watching Netflix, reading, and spending time with her animals. Her future plans are to work her way into college and eventually own and operate a business of her own. Tessa lives by the mantra, “One day at a time.” She feels as though the five simple words can carry anybody through a tough day. Tessa would like to thank everyone at MECHS who helped her stay on track with her study agreement and get graduated. We are so proud of you! #classof2020 #mechgrad #mountaineducation #seniorspotlight #mechsgrad2020 #1stchoicefor2ndchance",0.0,"Mountain Education Charter High School

Words can not express how proud I am of our shooting team members. We’ve put in a lot of practice in the hot and cold, shot a lot of shells, and coached each other through good and bad days. Today our Jr team came up a little short. I’ve seen these kids shoot better, and I know they will bounce back. Our Sr team got it done today. State Champions!!

We would like to thank Matt & Misha Mohr for hosting our teams practices. As well as, Danny Grounds and Hank Hughes for running throwers so the kids could focus on shooting. And thanks to Luther BancFirst for sponsoring the teams shirts this year. The tradition continues....

Just a reminder that there will be no more charges in the cafeterias starting May 7th 2018 and all charges need to be paid in full by May 4th 2018. If charges aren't paid and there isn't any money on your child's account they will either need to bring their lunch or bring money daily or pay in advance.

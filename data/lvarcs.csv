167,2.0,,5.0,,1233429473513154,"HS Concert Update:

Due to a very high demand for last minute tickets to the Jr/Sr High School concert tomorrow, Wednesday, December 18, 2019, LVA is requesting that parents attend the concert following the schedule below:

All performers will be transported to Salisbury High School from LVA.

Doors for the Band Concert will open at 6:00pm. The band concert will start promptly at 6:30pm. We ask that only parents who have students performing in the band portion of the concert attend this session. The students performing only in the band concert will be dismissed at 7:15pm.

Doors for the choir concert will open at 7:15pm. We ask that only parents who have children performing in the choir concert attend this portion of the show. The choir students will be dismissed immediately following the concert.

We apologize for the change in schedule. However, this should allow for all families to be able to see their children perform tomorrow evening. For future concerts larger venues and/or separate concerts will be considered.

Parents, today at 2:30 the fire alarm went off and the building was evacuated. We were required to wait for the fire department to inspect the entire building (this was not an incident in our part of the building). Staff retrieved coats for the kids and everyone was safe throughout the evacuation. It is my understanding that a pipe coming into the building that feeds into the sprinkler system broke and set sprinklers off in another part of the building.... which activated the fire alarm.

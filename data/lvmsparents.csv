From us in healthcare:

Dear Teachers, ❤️

We were terrified.
We were not ready.
We didn’t know what was to come.
We did not want to change our ways.
We couldn’t imagine what each day would look like.
We were stressed, exhausted, overwhelmed, and anxious.

But fast forward 5 months.

We are ok.
We have adapted.
We are stronger together.
We are essential.
We feel our worth.
We make a difference and others know it.
We are proud to go to work.

I know many of you return to work tomorrow or this month and it is scary but I promise it will be okay. Be flexible, be strong, be creative, and be proud! You are so needed and remember that now more than ever these kids need your 💙 and support.
We’ve got this (teachers and nurses) and this too shall pass!

Just thought you could use a little encouragement from some people who have felt what you feel.

Wear your mask and wash your hands!

Love,
Your Heathcare Friends!
❤️💚💜💙💜💚❤️

Just wanted to let everyone know that the Halloween parade has been moved to Friday of this week, not Thursday. Please plan to send your kiddos with costumes Friday. That was to be a crazy day...but we will move Hat Day (the exchange for Black and Gold last month for the Pirates) to next week. Thank you for your understanding. Notification will be coming home from school soon!",0.0,"The Halloween parade is one of my favorite Ligonier events! It will be held FRIDAY 11/1 this year @ 10am on the diamond....

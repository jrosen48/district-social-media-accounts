While they are currently far from our schools, the winds have impacted the air quality in the Las Virgenes area.

We understand that fires can trigger emotions from last year’s Woolsey Fire. LVUSD staff has curated resources to support the potential feelings that might surface in your family at: Community360.me.

LVUSD management will monitor both the fire and the air quality tonight. In addition, we will also be monitoring the possibility of electrical power being turned off as a safety precaution.

We will send an update tomorrow by 7:00 AM as the situation progresses. Please check your email and our social media for updates.",2019-10-24 20:00:49,,

Update for a very serious incident that was reported January 15, 2019 at Lost Hills Sheriff’s Station. On Tuesday January 15, the station received an attempt abduction/kidnapping report near Paul Revere Road, in the City of Calabasas. Patrol Deputies, Detectives and additional resources immediately began an investigation which resulted in a manhunt for a predator that was reported to have attempted to kidnap a 13 year old child.

Detectives conducted interviews of potential witnesses, canvassed the local area, and reviewed surveillance videos for information. After days of dedication to this incident, the 13 year old was re-interviewed, at which time detectives ultimately determined there was no crime and that the entire incident was a hoax.

We want our communities to know we take every threat or report serious and will investigate it and use as many resources available. The criminal report has been closed and we are not seeking any suspects.

As you navigate the coming days going into the Thanksgiving holiday, we’ve curated resources related to supporting your family members and their possible reactions to the wildfires and the trauma of this past week. Please go to our Community360 Website (www.community360.me) for resources curated by our staff and partners at Ludington, Engage, and Give an Hour. Throughout the coming days, we’ll continue to update this page with support resources.

We know that this is a challenging time for many in our community. Our hope is that these resources can help guide conversations, help you understand the range of reactions your family might have, and give you tools to process this past week’s events.

We hope that you find this to be of support.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1987474988007501&id=203279163093768,,0.0,"Dear Families,

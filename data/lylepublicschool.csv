Tomorrow, July 30th, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz will announce his recommendation on how Minnesota schools should open their doors for the 2020-2021 school year. Over the past several weeks, the Lyle administration and staff have been developing plans based on the three models Governor Walz presented: In-Person Learning, Hybrid Learning, and Distance Learning. Following the Governor’s updated guidance presented tomorrow, we will need additional time to finalize our plans. We appreciate your patience.

We will continue to update families as information is made available. We will update you on a Special Board Meeting where families are invited to view via Zoom and will be given some time to ask questions.

During these unprecedented times, we continue to ask for your patience and understanding as we prepare a plan that is best for our community while keeping our staff, students, and families safe.

Crazy enough, one mama gave birth to a new baby girl during the lesson as well 😍 Mrs. Hall would like her students & Lyle students to help her name the new baby! The name must start with the letter ‘D’. Please comment what name your child/ children come up with so they can help Mrs. Hall make her final decision! 💗",2020-04-17 17:31:10,,

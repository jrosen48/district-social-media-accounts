But it's important to keep in mind that there are other very serious diseases that you can protect your children from by making sure they are up to date on immunizations.

The state has made some changes in immunization requirements. Among them, you must provide medically-verified immunization records to the school before your child can attend, and some exemptions can no longer be claimed.

The state is REQUIRING everyone to wear masks at school this coming school year, unless a child or adult has a documented medical reason not to. 😷

It will NOT be easy for youngsters to get in the habit of wearing a mask, and now is the time to start helping them get used to it.

Think of it like teaching your child to wear a seatbelt; yes, it's inconvenient and maybe a little uncomfortable, but if everyone does it, we're all a LOT safer.

The other benefit - by starting to do this now, we may be able to keep the spread of COVID-19 low enough to start school in-person and keep it that way.

We hope everyone is doing well and staying healthy!

As everyone knows this is an especially stressful time. With social distancing, most public activities being closed, businesses being close and a virus going around. There are certain things in your control and certain one out of your control. All of this directly effects your stress levels and potentially health. Sometimes it good to see things placed in front of you to get an overall outlook to be able to get your stress under control.

Attached is a chart on items in your control and items out of your control. The best thing you can do for you is isolate the items in your control and focus on them and try to do what is in your best interest. Try not to focus and stress on the items out of your control. Now we all know that’s not entirely possible, but if we can mitigate the stress about those items hopefully it will bring down some anxiety and make our lives just a little easier.

Please take care everyone!",0.0,"A message for our students: There is a lot that is beyond our control right now. But you can still make a difference by focusing on what you can control.

We hope everyone is doing well and staying healthy!

As everyone knows this is an especially stressful time. With social distancing, most public activities being closed, businesses being close and a virus going around. There are certain things in your control and certain one out of your control. All of this directly effects your stress levels and potentially health. Sometimes it good to see things placed in front of you to get an overall outlook to be able to get your stress under control.

Attached is a chart on items in your control and items out of your control. The best thing you can do for you is isolate the items in your control and focus on them and try to do what is in your best interest. Try not to focus and stress on the items out of your control. Now we all know that’s not entirely possible, but if we can mitigate the stress about those items hopefully it will bring down some anxiety and make our lives just a little easier.

Please take care everyone!",2020-04-27 12:50:55,,

Football parents: we are looking at attending Elgin High School's football camp this year. This is a camp ran by Eastern Oregon University coaches and football players. This will also be a camp where some of the teams we will play in our new league will be. It Makes sense for us to go to the Oregon Camps instead of Washington camps. We will be trying to fundraise to drop the price per player. If you are able to pay for all of it yourself then that is great too. This is roughly 4 months away so there is plenty of time to rally up some $. Looking forward to another season of Football. If you are interested in sponsoring a player or would like to donate to the cause.

It's a Giving Tree, and it has a couple of dozen tags with a child's gender and age, and list of what he or she needs and wants. Many of them are kids from Lyle whose parents can't provide a lot of extras during the holiday season.

Can you help make a child believe -- well, if not in Santa, at least in kindness?

Go by Mugs Coffee, 221 West Steuben Street in Bingen and select a tag from the Christmas tree.

Once you’ve purchased the gifts, just wrap and return them with the original tag to Mugs by December 16, which will allow time for delivery of the gifts to our families before Winter Break begins.

Maybe you can take a friend and enjoy the small joys of relaxing over a great cup of coffee while you're there. Make it a little gift to yourself.

Today, 10/9/19, at around 2:30, an individual in our school needed medical attention. In order to protect the privacy of the individual and allow the ambulance crew space to work, we called a Level One lockdown, and asked teachers to keep their students out of the hallways.

Because the ambulance was still in the lower parking lot at dismissal time, we had all bus riders board their buses in the upper level parking lot.

We call lockdowns for a variety of reasons. We took these precautions today out of an abundance of caution and concern for the sick individual and our students.

Kingdom East Families: WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU!
How can we best meet your needs remotely this fall? Please complete this ONE-question survey by clicking the link here:

https://forms.gle/iy5QrEEdXvbHhwNd7

Due to low staff numbers, including those in key site leadership roles, the Afterschool Program will be offering remote programming for Session 1 for students in grades K-8. Starting in late September, KEAP opportunities will include online enrichment classes, take-home enrichment kits, and phone/online homework help. There will be no in-person KEAP programs at the schools in September or October. We plan to offer in-person programming starting in Session 2 (after Thanksgiving) when we are confident that we have staff members in place to safely manage Covid-19 precautions and safely logistics.",0.0,"Kingdom East Afterschool Programs - KEAP

Good morning Kingdom East Families!
A note today about registration for the Fall semester 2020

You should be receiving documents from your school asking for enrollment information. We collect this information at the Pre School and Elementary School level in order to plan for class size and to give teachers an idea about what their duties will be for the fall. We are planners!

At the High School level we collect residency information so that when we receive money from the state to pay for high school tuition it can be dispersed accurately for the students who live in our towns.

Take note this week. Check your snail mail and your email. Lets get all this paperwork done early!!!!! Thank you for your help!",0.0,"Kingdom East School District

Good Morning KESD families.
Here is a clarification on our providing meals for you at this time of school closures.

We at KESD do hope that you have contacted your school and gotten on the list for meals for your children. If something changes for you we are here to help you.

Please be aware that we can only provide meals to children ages 1 - 18. Babies have a different set of nutrition need and we cannot meet that need as an organization.

We thank you for your patience during this first week of meal delivery. We are learning as quickly as we can what the community needs are and meeting them with wonderful volunteerism and positive attitude.

You are our neighbors and we hope that you will continue to reach out to us with concerns or questions. Have a wonderful Wednesday.",2.0,"Kingdom East School District

Influenza, or “the flu,” is a highly contagious viral infection of the respiratory tract (nose, throat and lungs) that can cause secondary complications and attack other target organs in the body.

KATHERINE HANDY - I would like to recognize Katherine Handy for all the work that she does and being so helpful. The K-2 teachers at Burke are all new to the district, two of us are new to teaching, and Katie has worked tirelessly to make sure we are fully supported. Katie has helped us with so many things since the beginning of the year. She has helped us plan, input data, prep materials, coached us to improve our instruction, subbed, etc. She also has a ton of other responsibilities within our school and the district, yet she makes sure we have everything we need! She is MUCH appreciated and deserves to be recognized!

The K-2 teachers at Burke are all new to the district, two of us are new to teaching, and Katie has worked tirelessly to make sure we are fully supported. Katie has helped us with so many things since the beginning of the year. She has helped us plan, input data, prep materials, coached us to improve our instruction, subbed, etc. She also has a ton of other responsibilities within our school and the district, yet she makes sure we have everything we need! She is MUCH appreciated and deserves to be recognized!

Thank you,
Molly Fried",2020-02-13 07:53:58,,

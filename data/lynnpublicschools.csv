Our goal is to ensure that all students have high-quality learning experiences and that families have everything they need. During this difficult time, we want to ensure that we are responsive to the most critical needs of our families and soliciting input for our plans going forward. It is very important to hear from LPS families about which supports should continue and those that should be improved or added.

This survey is an important opportunity to help us understand your experiences and needs during this time and will help with our planning. Thank you in advance for taking the time to respond. Note that you are welcome to skip any question you do not want to answer.

This survey will be available until June 22nd.

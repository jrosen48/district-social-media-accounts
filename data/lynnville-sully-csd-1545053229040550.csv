Incoming 9th graders and families,

In any normal school year, we would have typically held a freshmen orientation sometime in the spring of your 8th grade year. At that orientation, we try to answer questions about various topics such as graduation requirements, student schedules, eligibility, etc.

With the COVID-19 Pandemic, we obviously were not able to hold that event in person. Instead, Mrs. O'Halloran and I have put together a video for you to watch on your own time.

Please take a look, and get in touch if you have any questions.

As of Monday March 16, 2020, all Lynnville-Sully facilities will be closed for four weeks (as per Gov. Kim Reynolds’ recommendation ). School is scheduled to resume on Monday, April 13, 2020. All school activities/practices between March 16 and April 13 have been canceled or postponed. As always, our first priority is the health and safety of our students, families and staff.

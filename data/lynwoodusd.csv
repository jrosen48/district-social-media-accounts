Lynwood High School Community,

Today at approximately 9 a.m. a portion of the 5000 building on our campus collapsed. We are pleased to report that no one was injured. Two parked vehicles did sustain damage in the incident. We have contacted our building contractor and are in the process of assessing the cause of the issue and evaluating all building structures on campus. Above all else, we want to ensure that our facilities remain safe for our staff and students. While the damage was limited and the safety of personnel was preserved during this incident, we take this very seriously and are working to prevent future concerns. Out of an abundance of caution, we will keep all staff out of the area of issue and will continue to limit staff on campus while we work with our facilities experts. Please know that we are dedicated to making sure our school is a safe and secure environment for all of us. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to reach out to me.",14.0,"A statement from Lynwood High School today.

In the nice and sunny months, the walk down to the playground is no issue, but any kind of moisture or precipitation makes for a messy journey to and from the playground. In addition, because the lawn leading to the playground lies on a slope, it makes for a difficult journey for any students requiring ADA accommodations.

On October 31, 2019, LCSD maintenance crews were up before the sun to lay the concrete for the new sidewalk. On November 5, 2019, Sutro Elementary held a ribbon cutting ceremony in which one of their students who will greatly benefit from the sidewalk, Journey, was able to cut the ribbon with her classmates. This is a wonderful improvement both for all students, staff and visitors to the Sutro playground.

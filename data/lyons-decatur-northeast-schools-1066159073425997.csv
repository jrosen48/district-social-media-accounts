I am extremely pleased with my science students who, despite our current challenges with COVID-19, have attempted to prioritize learning as part of their home expereience.

In particular, I have a research student, Sam, who has continued to forge ahead with further data collection on her science research project in identifying Microplastics through Spectrophotometry. In the past 4 weeks, she has gathered 40 new data points on 4 different plastic types.

Down below is an example of one of her 40 graphs and the data table she's beginning to fill out so she can perform statistical analysis.

I appreciate the passion for learning she and other students have demonstrated in light of this tough time. Keep it up students! There is great purpose in your efforts. Don't let passivity, fear, and disappointment keep you from purpose and passionate pursuit of your interests; especially THE HARD STUFF. You can do it!",0.0,"Paul Timm

Just moments ago Governor Walz ordered Distance Learning to continue through the end of this school year.

He recognizes the difficulties to the Class of 2020 of not experiencing commencement, missing prom and not being able to participate in extra-curriculars. He feels the Class of 2020 will long be remembered for their participation in helping to eliminate this disease.

Governor Walz thanked teachers. They are working hard to reach out. They are working to reduce inequities between children and offer all the help they can for our students. Thank you to MACCRAY teachers!

Please know that, at MACCRAY, we will continue to educate our students and reach out to them. Reach out to us if you see a way we can better help you.

We want to help as this new world opens up to us.

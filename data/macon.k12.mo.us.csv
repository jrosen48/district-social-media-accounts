MMS Students and Parents,

First of all, thank you for patience and understanding as we made the switch from in-person to online learning for our 6th grade students late yesterday.

Today Macon R-1 has been working closely with the Macon County Health Department to identify students and staff members that have been in close contact with the individual that produced the positive test. Individuals deemed to be close contacts will be notified by the Macon County Health Department and advised on how they should proceed.

Further contact tracing will continue over the next couple of days as the results of the pending tests are made known. Currently, the plan is to keep the 6th graders at home again tomorrow (9/4). Please continue to check your email and our social media sites for any updated information.

It’s virtual art show time! I’d love to make a slide show of student work to showcase our kids work on our school page. This could be a picture of the online challenge we did online here, a picture of a work they did in class before the stay at home order, or even something of their own creation just because.

If you’d like your student to be featured in our show, please submit the following to either this post or to my email

Hmallett@macon.k12.mo.us

Please include a picture, student name, title of artwork. (Optional: a short 1-3 sentences about the work. Could be an interesting fact, how they made it, why they chose it for the show etc.)

please send by Friday May 15th so I can put it together over the weekend.",0.0,"Macon R-I Elementary Art

Here is our next art challenge fun for all ages, even adults! Choose a famous painting to recreate. These are good options I found online, but there are SO many. If you’re browsing lot’s of famous paintings, do so WITH parent supervision please. Be creative and have FUN!

1. Choose your artwork. Can screenshot an image you find online. A simple google search of famous paintings will give you lots of options. Or even a gallery of a museum site would work too.
2. Get dressed up and gather props
3. Have someone take your photo
4. Post to Facebook and share below.
(Can even use an app like pic collage to put the original pic with your created picture... and bonus points if you add the title/artist)

here are some resources/ideas about the challenge:

Even though school is out, students involved in leadership organizations continue to work behind the scenes to prepare for next year.
Jasmine Stewart, Macon Senior, is a State Officer for Region III FCCLA next year. She is pictured doing her interview with the Department of Education as she runs for state President. Normally, this would take place at the state conference in front of 8000 members from across the state. This is just an example of how our amazing students are adapting to the changes thrown at them and making the best of the situation.

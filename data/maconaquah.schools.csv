We had a great turnout at our public forum, and there were so many great questions that were asked. Our COVID-19 Back to School Guidelines have been approved by the School Board, and the official copy can be found on our corporation web page (https://www.maconaquah.k12.in.us/). The FAQ page has been updated to list new questions asked by parents and members of our community. Please do not hesitate to ask questions as they arise. Prior to the start of school, we will be sending out guidance over proper ways to wear face coverings, and signs and symptoms of COVID-19, so please be looking for that. We appreciate all of the support, and look forward to seeing our students on August 3rd.

We want to say thank you for all of the feedback we've received over our plans for returning to school. We had a great turnout at our public forum, and there were so many great questions that were asked. Our COVID-19 Back to School Guidelines have been approved by the School Board, and the official copy can be found on our corporation web page (https://www.maconaquah.k12.in.us/). The FAQ page has been updated to list new questions asked by parents and members of our community. Please do not hesitate to ask questions as they arise. Prior to the start of school, we will be sending out guidance over proper ways to wear face coverings, and signs and symptoms of COVID-19, so please be looking for that. We appreciate all of the support, and look forward to seeing our students on August 3rd.

Go Braves!

Maconaquah’s Back to School Task Force has finished the initial COVID-19 Back to School Guidelines. The guidelines can be found at https://www.maconaquah.k12.in.us/updates. It is very important to inform our patrons that the COVID-19 Back to School Guidelines HAVE NOT been School Board approved.

Maconaquah School Corporation will be holding a public work session on July 6th at 6PM in the high school auditorium to further explain this document and to answer any questions that have not already been answered within this document. There have been changes made since our first release to the public, so please read through these guidelines carefully to note those minor changes.

With the Governors new guidance, all buildings and campus grounds will remain closed until July 4th at the earliest. This means no students on campus grounds (outside of the item pick-up dates below). Teachers will continue generating online work for students to complete Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. For those students who do not have access to online content, please contact your building principal.

We have decided to push back student item pick-up to the week of May 25th. This will also give students the chance to have completed all school work for the 2020 school year, allowing students and parents to ask any pertinent questions prior to pick-up times. Each building will have their own guidance for pick-up, with those specifics to come in the next few weeks.

I had a great time teaching your students music this year. As we look to your student being in 6th grade next year, they have some decisions to make about music. Please click HERE to go to the web page we have created for parents/guardians. There is a video that explains the music options for your student.. After you watch the video, complete the google form. We would like to have a Parent/Guardian to complete the form for each student. If you have any questions please contact me.

Maconaquah Families,

We wanted to make you aware that we received information this afternoon that one of our employees has tested positive for COVID-19. This individual was one of the volunteers helping with Maconaquah’s Food Service Day on April 2nd. This individual helped pack lunches, however, she did not distribute food in the pick-up line. If you have any questions regarding COVID-19, please contact the Miami County Health Department at 765-472-3901. At this time, we will continue to provide food service to the three agencies previously mentioned (Bunker Hill United Methodist Church, Amboy Christian Church, and Helping Hands).

Camille is a great student to have in class. She always tries her best and is a really good friend to all of her classmates. She is also a great listener and follows directions quickly.

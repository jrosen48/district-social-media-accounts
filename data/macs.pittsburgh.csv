Ms. Stout is looking for volunteers to assist during the book fair. Please click on the link below and select the time you are able to come in. Remember, you can volunteer to come in for any class, not just your child's! We could really use the help with counting money and helping kids choose books.

We really appreciate your help and it also goes towards your volunteer hours at the school!

Thanks to the families that volunteered so far! We had a great response from kindergarten, so all volunteer spots are filled for those times.

We could especially use some help with our first grade friends on Monday from 12-1.

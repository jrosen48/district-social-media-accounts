Both elementary schools celebrate their communities and pull design inspiration from the area, as well as the history of the schools. The Harder campus design is abstract and celebrates the long time mascot of the campus, the Hawk. At this point in construction, throughout the campus you will see the swooping roofs that mimic a hawk in flight, as well as a light color palette.

Seana Condit-Gordon, Principal at Bret Harte Middle School in Hayward, is today’s #CA15Hero. When Seana showed up for work on March 13th, she didn’t realize it would be her last day coming into the office. She led the school’s effort to get remote learning devices to every student, and even went as far as hand delivering devices to the homes of students who couldn’t make it in to pick one up.

In Hayward, CA, students conducted a study on the effects of styrofoam and plastic pollution on campus. After seeing the results from the studies, the school district made a move to improve which materials were being purchased and used. A district-wide ban on styrofoam food trays and a switch to healthier alternatives won! The district decided to curb the destructive polluter - single-use plastic bottles and switch to 100% refillable, infinitely recyclable aluminum PATHWATER bottles. We're celebrating the 5th Day of Partnering to Save the Planet by thanking Made in Hayward for making strides in their sustainability initiatives this year!

Congrats to Jordan Robinson of Hayward Unified School District’s Mt. Eden High School, who took the stage at San Francisco’s Orpheum Theatre last month to perform his slam poetry as part of the Hamilton Education Program.

The #eduham program is a national partnership giving public school students the chance to see Hamilton performed live and integrate the show into classroom studies. Before the students see the show, they’re introduced tothe people, events, and documents of the Founding Fathers’ era. Students also learn how Lin-Manuel Miranda, the show’s creator, incorporated primary sources into the songs he wrote for the show and use that knowledge to produce their own performance pieces. Some students are selected to perform their own works onstage before seeing a matinee of the show.

Jordan performed his poem on the life and significance of Benjamin Banneker, a free African-American almanac author, surveyor, naturalist, and farmer who helped survey the original borders of the District of Columbia. Watch, learn… and rise up!",3.0,"#MadeinHayward We're so proud of our talented students. #artseducation #Hayward #Hamilton

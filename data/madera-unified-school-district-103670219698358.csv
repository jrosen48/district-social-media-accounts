We are honored at the opportunity to partner with the INCREDIBLE MUSD, and in just 5-weeks, produce this INCREDIBLE project. It took many long nights and weekends to get this to air, but we hope that what we’ve made will make you – the students, families, and community of Madera – proud.⁣

Thank you to the producers in-studio and at home, who worked countless hours putting this all together, the team filming on-location working 12+ hour days to capture great quality material, and our team of editors who were charged with making these films that the Class of 2020 so deserves, thank you!⁣
⁣
And the biggest thanks goes out to the MUSD Board, Todd Lile, and Babatunde Ilori for trusting us with your students’ stories. We are grateful and honored to be a part of this project. Its meaning extends far beyond this moment.⁣

Teachers have been the spark, inspiration, and guide for many generations of students.

The conference, which theme was, “It Starts With Us,” was made up of workshops to give Madera Unified classified employees the opportunity to learn new skills that will aid them in their professional and personal development. Workshops ranged from understanding challenging student behaviors, Central Valley gangs, eating healthy and reducing stress to Graphic Design 101. Keynote speakers included Sayra Vasquez, co-host of Despierta Valle Central, and Dee Hankins who shared his life experiences as a child in foster care for 18 years and how resilience gave him the ability to bounce back.

Back to school is just around the corner! There is perhaps no greater benefit to society than the education of our youth. It will be the (often) thankless task of our fantastic educators to accomplish this goal, and we at the Madera Police Department would like to personally thank them for all the incredible work they do every day. With that said, it is the task of the Madera Police Department that the safest conditions possible are always upheld to provide the best learning experience for our youth. For the first few weeks of school, we will be out with several extra officers strictly enforcing all traffic violations in or near school zones. Please allow yourself plenty of time to drop off your children, and expect heavy traffic. Stay tuned to our Facebook over the next several days for some tips on traffic, and some infractions our officers will be focusing on. Thank you all for such a great summer!

On May 11th, 2019 Solar Suitcase #543 built by sophomores Victor Cisneros, Richardo Yanez and Jacob Gomez, found its permanent home at Syekumulo R.C. Primary School in Bungoma, Kenya! (a Kibera slum near Nairobi)

Previously, the school had unreliable access to electricity, experiencing outages on a daily basis. With the addition of a sustainable energy source like the Solar Suitcase, the school will be able to light the classrooms, offices and library. This will increase study time for the students attending the school and will help them to achieve higher grades and better scores on entrance exams to higher education. The adults who work at the school will be able to charge their cell phones and other devices, as well as, benefit from added security.

To our three Stallion Scholars that built this amazing gift for our friends in Kenya, and their instructor Mr. Brian Richardson that led the way, we can’t express our immense pride in words. Nothing less than a priceless legacy, well done.",3.0,"Madera South High School

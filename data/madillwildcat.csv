Son of Christopher Harvey, his #1 biggest fan and his rock.

I lived in Madill from the age of 8 until my freshman year. I moved away for two years, then came back to my roots in Madill and started playing Basketball for the Wildcats & Coach Weiberg. I have loved playing video games ever since I was 5. Call of Duty is my favorite game. I want to thank my Aunt Savannah and Uncle Chase for helping me throughout my school years. Just letting y‚Äôall know I couldn't do it without you guys and I will forever be grateful. For my Dad, thank you for teaching me and showing me the right way to be a young, respectable man. I can't thank you enough. I will continue being great for you and I will never give up. I love you pops.

Madill Public School and 98.7FM are sponsoring the Senior 2020 Celebration Parade on May 15, 2020 at 7:00pm.

Seniors can decorate their vehicles and parade down Lillie Blvd and around The Square. During this time, messages from teachers and recognition of student accomplishments will play on the radio. Patrons can line the streets while tuning into the radio to support our Wildcat Seniors.üéì üíõ üñ§

Following the parade, we will light up the sports fields around town from 8-9pm. More specific information and the parade route will be posted in the upcoming weeks.

üéìSeniors, please forward your spotlight information to Mrs. Clement as soon as possible! Check back daily to the MPS page for more Senior Spotlights!",2020-04-20 20:03:03,,

They performed a cheer and a routine with the school fight song. The team is made up of seventeen members currently in the 7th and 8th grade. They tried out last April to make the team for the 2019-20 school year. The team started practices in the summer.

When the school year began, they went to once a week practices. They have been committed to working together and learning from one another. The team has grown in experience and it shows. The students have a full course load and also participate in many other school electives.

Thursday and Friday are exchange days at Madison Central. As all of your children come to grab their belongings and return their chromebooks, there is one person that will not be back next year to greet your child's smiling face. Linda Linda Lindsey Wood is officially retiring. Linda has been showering the children of MCS with her love and affection for 43 years. She has found special places in her heart for many a child, bringing in coats for some, daily hugs for others, a shoulder to cry on when needed, and always up for a personal walk with your child to their classroom. She's gone above and beyond to keep your children safe and loved. She's been an integral part of so many of our lives. Thursday and Friday there will be a special mailbox at the main entrance of the school for you and your children to drop off any cards or hand written notes or drawings or anything else you and/or your child would like to give to Linda for her to open up and cherish. It's the perfect time to share some love ❤️❤️❤️ in our crazy 2020 world!! Let's fill this mailbox with love for Linda!!!",0.0,"We will miss you, Linda Wood! #MCSBlue Forever!

Due to the pandemic, the Village of Madison is, unfortunately, unable to hold the Summer Recreation Program this year. While we are saddened that we will be unable to provide this to the community, it is also important that we follow appropriate government guidelines for the health and safety of the children, staff, and families. In lieu of this, we have made in-kind donations to our local food programs. This morning, we were pleased to provide our local food cupboard, located at the Madison Baptist Church on North Street, with many non-perishable food items and toiletry products. Hopefully, this will enable those in need to get the food and hygiene supplies they might need during this difficult time. If you or someone you know has need, or if you wish to donate, the Food Cupboard can be reached at (315)824-2993. Due to COVID-19, the Food Cupboard cannot take walk-ins currently, but can package the items needed for pickup.",0.0,"Village of Madison

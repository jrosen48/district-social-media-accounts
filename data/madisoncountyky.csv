Heartwarming story this fine Wednesday! We had gotten a sweet pup in the shelter this week and upon intake we realized he had a chip registered to a family in Loveland Ohio. After some phone calls we were able to place Kristofferson back with his family whom he hadn't seen in years!
This sweet boy was excited to say the least after his family traveled all the way to Berea, KY to claim their handsome dog! We sure love happy endings and this serves as a perfect example of why microchipping is so important! Anyone may have their pet microchipped at the shelter for $26.50 as that's a service we are happy to provide.

TUSSEY: Correcting corrections — New jailer experience brings great change

Richmond Register
April 22, 2019 at 6:08 PM ·

JAILER STEVE TUSSEY'S COLUMN: In recent months, our facility has garnered media attention for the removal of bad actors from the jail. I want to reiterate what I have said before about my commitment to having an efficient and well-run detention center. Our staff will abide by our legal obligations to report incidents occurring in our facility, we will follow national standards and procedures outlined by the Department of Corrections, and we pledge to be transparent with both law enforcement and the citizens of Madison County about the state of our facility. As Jailer, I am honored and humbled to serve the people of Madison County. I am proud to represent the dedicated staff at the Detention Center who as local sworn law enforcement agents, with the authority and the responsibility to enforce the laws of our great Commonwealth, serve as great community partners.

TAYLOR: Limitless opportunities for county

Richmond Register
March 18, 2019 at 6:16 PM ·

JUDGE/EXEC REAGAN TAYLOR'S COLUMN: You can never have too many tools in the economic development tool box. When the Kentucky Economic Development Cabinet requested applications for counties interested in participating in the newly announced federal ""Opportunity Zone"" program, we jumped at the chance to submit a request for proposal. Six months later, we were thrilled to find out that our application was approved. Now, the real work of educating investors, businesses and entrepreneurs, accountants, bankers, land owners, and citizens on what an opportunity zone is and why it is such a potential advantage for our county has begun.

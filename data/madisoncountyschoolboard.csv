Many of them stealing time from their own at home during their dinner times with family to answer your questions. I heard somewhere ""A man that don't work won't eat"". I think that applies here.

Madison County Parents/Guardians of students with IEPs,

Greetings! This week report cards will become available for all students. In your report card packet, please look for a letter from your ESE teacher and/or therapist explaining how services will be delivered due to the governor’s mandate of school closures. We have your child’s best interest in mind and will do our best to provide all services described in the IEP. Of course, these services will look different because we are changing to a virtual delivery or phone conference during the COVID-19 crisis. Please reach out to your teachers or therapists as soon as you receive their information, so sessions can be scheduled.

Also, if you have not already completed an ESE survey, please go online to esesurvey.com at your earliest convenience. This survey assists our department to better meet the needs of students.

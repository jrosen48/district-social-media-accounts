It is with a heavy heart that tonight I report the IHSA Board of Directors have voted cancel the State Basketball Tournament. This decision was made in compliance Governor's guidance on public gatherings in response to the COVID-19 virus outbreak.

This turn of event does not diminish all our team has accomplished. As far as I am concerned they are State Champions!

The Illinois High School Association (IHSA) has made the decision to limit the number of fans each team is allowed to bring to the State Basketball Tournament in Peoria to 60. As a result, the decision has been made to offer the available spots to family members of players first. The players provided names of family members who were planning to attend games Friday and Saturday this morning. At this time all 60 slots are filled. Individuals not on the list will not be permitted to enter the game.

Because of the restrictions IHSA has put on attending the game there will be no fan bus on Friday or Saturday. The game Friday will be available live to at the Jr/Sr High in the auditorium.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3095051470552627&id=1164120156979111,,0.0,"Madison Family,

We are excited that our boys basketball team has advanced to the final round of the Sectional Series. The game will be held today, Friday March 6th, at Dupo High School at 7:00pm, doors are scheduled to open at 6:00pm. We wanted to remind everyone about a couple of items.

1. Admission to the game is $6 for every person entering including children. This admission fee is set by IHSA and they do not make allowance for a different rate for children.

2. At the conclusion of the game, all spectators are expected to stay in the bleachers. They should ""NOT"" come onto the floor for the awarding of the Sectional plaque.

3. There will be additional ticket takers as well as concessions available in an effort to reduce lines.

Come join us for a great evening of basketball as we cheer our team on to another Madison victory!

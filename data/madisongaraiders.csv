Tomorrow is our Curb-Side lunch pickup at Madison County High School from 11:00-12:30. We will pass out Friday lunch and breakfast. We are unable to do meals during spring break.

However, after break we are expanding back out to the schools to do Curb-Side meal pick up at Comer, Colbert, Hull-Sanford, Ila and Madison County High School. On Mondays we will give 3 lunches and breakfasts, and on Thursdays we will give out 2 lunches and breakfasts. Kids still need to be present (sorry, that's the regs), but you will drive up to the table, a helper will set the needed number of bags down and the driver can reach out and pick them up, maintaining a distance.

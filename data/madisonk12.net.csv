An extra shout out to Virtual Academy Team ~ Ms. Greene, Mrs. Norton, and Mrs. Fox ~ for their work preparing for our Virtual Academy pick-up this afternoon! We distributed 160 devices and virtual information packets to families in two hours! Thanks to our families for your patience in our car line! Thanks to our staff who were running at full speed to deliver those materials!

And as always, we owe the biggest thanks of all to Ms. Campbell and Mrs. Rathbone for leading our tech team effort!

Madison County Stay Home Order Extended: Please see attached the most recent Stay Home Order from the Madison County Commissioners and the Madison County Manager extended through May 31.

Governor Cooper announced on March 23, 2020 an extension of his Executive Order requiring that schools remain closed through May 15, 2020. While the Madison County Stay Home Order can be changed, based on a local decision or a decision by the Governor, the Governor has made no statement to either extend the school closure period or reopen schools. We are expecting a decision by May 1, 2020. As soon as we have information from the Governor, we will share that immediately.

In the meantime, please continue the outstanding work you are doing to implement remote learning, provide meal service, and please continue following safety guidelines and best practice procedures, outlined by the Madison County Health Department, that have allowed us to remain one of only seven counties in North Carolina without a COVID-19

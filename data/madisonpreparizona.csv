All students must answer this question for their NON-LIVE classes Monday-Friday by 11:59 pm for each day. You must show up for your LIVE classes, and that counts as your attendance for those classes.

Hello Patriot Fam,

As of right now the CAA has decided to postpone the Fall sports season. Therefore, James Madison Prep has no choice but to comply with the league and postpone all of our Fall practices and extracurricular activities.

The leagues intention is to begin practices in September and to have games start in October. The goal for the league and our school in general is to wait for the metrics to decrease within the state of Arizona. Once those numbers have steadily decreased for a number of weeks, the league will have another board meeting and decide whether they believe it is safe to start a Fall sports season. Your coaches will be in contact with you soon.

For quicker information from your coaches be sure to download the ‚ÄúRemind app‚Äù on your smart devices, as well as the school app, for updates on practices, start times and other important school/EC information.

Any other questions regarding extracurricular activities, please contact Coach Aljuwani: aaljuwani@madisonprep.org.

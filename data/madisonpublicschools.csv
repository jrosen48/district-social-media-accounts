Dear MPS Community,

On Friday, we announced school closures for an undetermined time period.
Madison educators established a resource bank to assist parents and students in optional district activities. This bank serves as a foundation for the addition of regional and local resources during this unprecedented school break. These activities are optional and do not take the place of instruction. They are designed to offer parents a guide for approximate grade level activities.

We suggest that a daily schedule of learning activities be established in homes based on the individual needs and interests of your child. We hope this bank is a helpful menu to keep your learner engaged.

We look forward to adding additional activities. We wish you good health and a future with a reasonable return to school. In the meantime, we hope this is a helpful school community resource.

In order to assist Jeffrey, Ryerson and Brown parents in planning their Thursday morning and their afternoon parent/teacher conference, I‚Äôd like to share some information.

It is possible that inclement weather may arrive overnight Wednesday continuing into Thursday morning, necessitating a delayed opening. The current forecast is calling for a transition to rain, but there may be an extended period sleet and freezing rain in the early morning hours. We will continue to monitor this forecast.

Given the number of conferences scheduled, the planning done by our K-5 teachers, and the arrangements made by parents to attend, if there is a delay to the start of the school day on Thursday, we will still continue with our scheduled K-5 early dismissal and hold our parent/teacher conferences in the afternoon.

In the event of a delayed opening combined with an early dismissal, the school day will still ‚Äúcount‚Äù towards the required 180 school days for the 2019-2020 school year.

Recently you may have noticed a few stories in the news regarding a potential mosquito-borne virus in the area, specifically the Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) virus. At this time, only one mosquito in Madison has tested positive for the virus and no human cases have been reported. However, the Madison Health Department has released a statement and a few educational tips to help residents reduce the risk of being bitten by mosquitoes:

‚Ä¢ Minimize time spent outdoors between dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most active.
‚Ä¢ Wear shoes, socks, long pants, and a long-sleeved shirt when outdoors for long periods of time, or when mosquitoes are more active. Clothing should be light colored and made of tightly woven materials that keep mosquitoes away from the skin.
‚Ä¢ Consider the use of mosquito repellent, according to directions, when it is necessary to be outdoors.

We will continue to monitor this situation as we work with our health professionals and follow their guidance.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2426547930754772&id=182083111867943,"MADISONCT.ORG

With that in mind, it has come to my attention that we have experienced a number of drivers passing school buses while our buses are either picking up, or dropping off, our children. This is occurring while the red flashing lights and safety arm stop sign is visible to drivers. I have met with the Madison Police Department (MPD) and our bus company, Durham School Services, to discuss this concern. I want to assure you that the MPD takes reports such as these very seriously and confirmed that they will follow up on any reports of this nature. Additionally, we are fortunate to have a team of incredibly caring and vigilant bus drivers that will do all they can to keep our children safe. I ask that if you witness such a violation that you report this information to the Madison Police Department. This is a significant safety matter and we will need all in the wider school community to work together to keep our kids safe.

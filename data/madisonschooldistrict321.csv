Having a last day of school without students in the building is something we never thought we would experience.

These last four months have been hard, for all of us! We have stretched, done things that are unfamiliar and maybe even uncomfortable. But, we have all stuck together.

Our appreciation for our students, their parents and our wonderful teachers and staff has never been so great. Our appreciation for a community that unites in crisis and works together has never been so great.

So, as we close this school year and launch into the summer (and hopefully less stressful times), we want to thank you for being #madisonstrong.

We thank you for being patient.

We thank you for trusting us as we made hard decisions.
Thank you for working with us as we navigated unchartered waters.

Have a wonderful summer! Stay safe!

- Help a friend with homework over Skype or Facetime

- Crowdsource a food delivery to a local hospital, EMT crew, or fire department (your child may need help with this!)

During this, we ask that you maintain social distancing guidelines and remain in your cars at all times and keep your car moving.

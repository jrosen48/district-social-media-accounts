High School Baseball will hold it's first practice this Sunday, January 13th from 7-9pm at the high school gym. There will also be a parent/player meeting this Sunday at 6pm in the High School/Middle School lunch room. Practices are scheduled for 7-9pm every Sunday through the month of February (7 practices).

As in years past, there is a $100 player fee that covers team insurance, state registration fees, umpire costs, and equipment costs. The player fee must be paid before the February 3rd practice starts. You can certainly pay before that time, but if a player is up in the air, this will give them three practices to try it out without having to pay.

Players are required to wear indoor shoes for practice to protect the gym floor.

Any questions, please contact myself:

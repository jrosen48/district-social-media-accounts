Thank you to all the families who took the time to drop-off their student's first educational packet for weeks 1-3 and pick-up the second packet for weeks 4-6. As a district, we realize that some families were not able to make the drop-off and pick-up time scheduled for their student's specific building. In order to ensure all students have equal access, we have placed the week 4-6 education packets on our website. The packets can be accessed by going to the following page: https://www.madriverschools.org/Page/2967

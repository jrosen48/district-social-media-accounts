We handed out over 1500 learning packets on Monday! It was great to see many of the parents and students drive through the line to receive their packet. Thank you all for the smiling faces and positive comments.

We printed and assembled more packets over the last two days, and they are currently available outside the front door of the district office. Please come by tonight or anytime tomorrow to pick up the grade level you need. Once we run out of these we will not be printing more.

Thank you!

Queridos Padres,

¡Entregamos más de 1500 paquetes de aprendizaje el lunes! Fue genial ver a muchos de los padres y estudiantes conducir a través de la línea para recibir su paquete. Gracias a todos por las caras sonrientes y los comentarios positivos.

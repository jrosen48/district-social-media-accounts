This year's flu has hit hard, after conferring with administrators, coaches, and healthcare officials, we have decided to use two AMI days for this Thursday(Jan. 30th) and Friday(Jan. 31st). We have too many students, teachers and staff out sick to effectively conduct school, and this will give everyone the chance to get well.

There will be no 7th grade or Jr. high games Thursday against County Line, but Jr. Girls and both Senior Teams will travel to Mountainburg Friday night.

Parents, please wash your child's coats, jackets, backpacks, lunch boxes, etc. with a disinfectant cleaner before they return to school. Please see that their hair is washed, and emphasize the importance of handwashing.

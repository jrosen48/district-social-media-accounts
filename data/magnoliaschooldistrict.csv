After a successful rollout of the solar energy project, now the district has incorporated two fully electric buses to its fleet. Thanks to the efforts of Magnolia School District Board Member Mr. Gary Shields, the District applied and was awarded a highly competitive grant from South Coast Air Management District. The grant included funds for the buses and electrical infrastructure needed to charge them daily. Each bus features air conditioning, seatbelts and child seats, a wheelchair ramp as well as the Child Check System to make sure no students are left on the bus. In addition to the 36 regular seats, the floor can be reconfigured to carry up to 9 wheelchairs. The buses will pick up students in the morning return to be charged and then return for afternoon drop-offs. Be on the lookout for these energy efficient buses at our schools!

Anytime tomorrow through Friday at 8:00 AM, calls will be coming to you from a blocked number...it is your teacher calling.

We are taking a survey of our student population to determine who has Internet access and technology devices at home. Automated calls will not work for this survey so teachers are calling from their personal phones. This is the quickest way we can get the information from you.

It is VERY important that you answer the call so we have accurate data.

If you do not wish to answer the blocked call, please email your student's homeroom teacher in Elementary school or your student's remediation teacher in the Jr./Sr. High School by 8:00AM Friday. They will get back to you through email. Teacher emails are on our website at www.mabears.net

We appreciate your prompt response and cooperation in assisting us to collect this data.

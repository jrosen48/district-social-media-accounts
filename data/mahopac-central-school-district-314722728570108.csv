Prior to March 13th, 2020, the Jazz Band began working on a level VI program of music for one of our upcoming performances: NYSSMA level 6 major ensemble festival. We were planning to perform A Night in Tunisia, arranged by Michael Philip Mossman on that program.

None of us could have ever anticipated how our lives would change on March 13th. For our jazz band, March 10th was the last day that we got to hear each other play at the same time in real time.

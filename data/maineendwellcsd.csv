Our community is celebrating the Class of 2020 with a Cap and Gown Pick Up Party today and tomorrow.
Both days, seniors are invited to the High School to pick up their cap, gown, and their class T shirt. Each senior will decorate a tile that will be displayed at the HS, and they will have a chance to take a picture in their cap and gown or their shirt.
With social distancing in effect, the seniors will drive to each station where they will have their car decorated, they will receive their cap and gown and then participate in the other activities.
When the seniors arrive at the HS they will see signs of well wishes created by community members.

With the most recent ""stay-at-home"" order by the governor, we will only be providing lunches on Friday for the next two weeks. Your school contact will be reaching out with details. We also have extra work packets if you need them.

This let's us know that your child is working through their daily school work and gives us an opportunity to answer any questions they may have! If we are unable to reach you, your child will be marked absent for the day.

Hey Facebook fam.. by now, I‚Äôm sure you have all heard the news with the Schools shutting down for the next 3 weeks because of some of the challenges we‚Äôre facing involving the Coronavirus..

Having said that- We know and understand that our kids depend on school lunches to have a good meal for the day.. in many cases, it will be their only meal of the day..

If you are going to have trouble with lunches for your children while the schools are closed, or know of someone that is going to need some help with food for their children during this time, please DM us.. we‚Äôd like to try our best to help..

We are a community business, if our community/friends & families are hurting, so are we..

We WILL get through this together!

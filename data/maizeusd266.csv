Parents can supply their own face masks for their children, as long as they meet the definition in the district's T4T Reopening Guide posted at www.usd266.com/T4TReopeningPlan: ""Wearable, breathable covering of the nose and mouth. May be made of natural or synthetic materials and should consist of more than a single layer of material.""

When needed, schools will have face masks available for students, as well.

Anyone needing to access Maize High School during that period must do so by entering the parking lot by the baseball and softball fields from the north.

Bond projects will add a new intermediate school to the northwest corner of 45th and 119th streets in Maize and the new aquatorium pool-auditorium center to the southeast corner of Academy Avenue and 119th Street.

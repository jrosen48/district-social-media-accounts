Use recycled-crusty-painted barn wood from western Kentucky and design your arrows your way! Then add fun details from felt or wooden flowers to vintage rusty pieces and whatnots. Make two arrows in this workshop so you can take both paths- the road well AND less traveled!

They have anything and everything you could possibly need for a craft and the best part is you are welcome to ALL of it!! We had so much fun even my 2 year old! She was quite messy but there was not 1 time her ""mess"" was frowned upon. These ladies encouraged her to keep creating and let it be known that they loved seeing the mess because that meant someone was using their creativity and ""MAKING"" something😍 The price was very fair and i learned they also offer art classes and much more.

Due to school closures, I will be offering free art lessons on our Facebook page each weekday until our kiddos return to school. These will be family oriented for a range of ages and utilize supplies typically found in your home.

Creativity can ease stress, expedite learning & allow us to see circumstances in different ways. Since we will all be home gathered together over the next few weeks unexpectedly, it is the perfect time to discover and grow new talent! We will be offering take home kits from the studio for additional lessons beginning next Wednesday.
I always pull from my classical training as a BFA studio art major and 25 years as a professional artist, but also love to introduce process learning- In other words- I like to show you how to do it AND get messy!

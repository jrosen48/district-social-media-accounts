The beginning of the school year is right around the corner, and I hope you all had a lovely summer! I know the fires have been a worry. We are keeping all the firefighters and victims' families of the fires in our hearts. Hopefully, it will be contained soon, and no more lives will be lost.

I just wanted to remind everyone that registration begins August 13th in the main office of the middle school. Please come in to pick up your registration packet and turn it in once it is completed. Students will then be able to receive their class schedules. If you have any questions or concerns about the schedule, we will be able to address it when school begins. We allow a two week grace period as the high school does to make any corrections. Our wonderful school counselor, Kelley Jayne, will be able to assist the students.

See you soon!

The beginning of the school year is right around the corner, and I hope you all had a lovely summer! I know the fires have been a worry. We are keeping all the firefighters and victims' families of the fires in our hearts. Hopefully, it will be contained soon, and no more lives will be lost.

I just wanted to remind everyone that registration begins August 13th in the main office of the middle school. Please come in to pick up your registration packet and turn it in once it is completed. Students will then be able to receive their class schedules. If you have any questions or concerns about the schedule, we will be able to address it when school begins. We allow a two week grace period as the high school does to make any corrections. Our wonderful school counselor, Kelley Jayne, will be able to assist the students.

See you soon!

Things are about to get very busy. My ski film shows in Truckee, CA on April 11; one day before the start of the Snowsports History Celebration, in Squaw Valley. On April 13, we drive to Mammoth Mountain for a ski day, and my film shows that night in the town of Mammoth Lakes.

Early Saturday morning we drive back to Squaw Valley for a ski day, and that night we attend the Ski & Snowboard Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony Dinner Event.

Threaded into all of this, Cate and I are being hosted for a ski day by: Heavenly, Northstar, Kirkwood, Sierra at Tahoe, Homewood, and IMPORTANTLY, our Host Tahoe Donner, who I have partnered with for our film showing at the Alder Creek Adventure Center.

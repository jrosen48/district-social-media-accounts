In the 1920's, the Mau Movement was a non-violent movement for Samoan independence. The motto of the Mau was Samoa mo Samoa, which meant Samoans for Samoa. They were a peaceful organization, but despite their efforts for non-violence, they were met with violence in 1929 on the street capital of Apia, when the New Zealand military fired into their peaceful demonstration, killing 11 Samoans including the Mau Movement leader and high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.

Afterwards, our scholars shared their group presentations on the Mana Academy school creed. This exercise was to help our scholars brush up on their presentation skills and apply the cognitive skills they acquired in their project based class to help them internalize the values. Our school creed was created by our own scholars in 2015:

We are the scholars of Mana Academy.
We embody the dreams and aspirations of our ancestors.
We represent our families and communities.
We are dedicated, committed, and focused.
We respect ourselves and all people.
We will not yield to uncertainty or fear.
We will not accept mediocrity.
We take ownership of our academic success.
We are future college graduates.
We are united.
We are family.
We are MANA!",2017-09-02 00:57:27,,

Our scholars were amazing today at the annual Utah Association of Public Charter Schools Charter Day on the Hill at the Utah State Capitol. They shared the cultural dances, songs and chants taught at Mana Academy, shared student projects such as the paintings of Queen Lili ªuokalani of Hawaii and Queen Salote of Tonga, a STEM Math project focused on the School to Prison Pipeline, meet students from other charter schools and shared their mana with members of our state legislature. Thank you Senator Luz Escamilla and Rep. Karen Kwan for stopping by our table and visiting with our scholars.",2017-01-26 22:22:12,,

During the term, they researched policies, the proliferation of for-profit prisons, interviewed school resource officers, their peers, faculty, presented their findings in a video and slide presentation.

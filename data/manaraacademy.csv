Teachers are some of the hardest working people I've ever known. In these times of uncertainty, the care and concern teachers have about their students is evident. I'm honored to have been invited to provide an upcoming training on teacher and student wellness, self-care and social-emotional support, for the educators of Manara Academy in Texas. These topics are more important now than anytime in recent history. Since they will kick off their year with online learning, this little slide-deck is just an ""extra"" I'm adding, specifically for the scholars of their district (with tips and tricks to get the most out of their online experience). The biggest thing I hope to impart is HOPE. It's worth burning the midnight oil for. We will all get through this.",0.0,"Wendy Warner Young

This past Saturday the Manara School Board voted to add Pre Kindergarten instruction to Irving and Arlington elementary campuses for the Fall of 2018. This will enhance our student achievement and provide students with a strong academic foundation for success. The program will be tuition-free for eligible students who meet the state criteria, but will also be available to others for a fee.

If you, or someone you know, has a child who will be 4 years old on or before September 1st, 2018, please let them know about this amazing opportunity for their children. Apply by clicking on https://tinyurl.com/ManaraPreK. Or, you can visit the Manara web page and click on the word ""Apply"".

This is just one more step for Manara to become the best charter school in Texas!

For Irving Elementary:

Dear Manara Families, we are looking forward to seeing you [tonight], August 15, 2017, from 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm for Back to School Night. The event will be designed differently this year for our returning families. There will be signs posted in the building with class lists, and you will go directly to your child’s class. You can drop off school supplies as well as hear a brief presentation from your child’s teachers. Presentations will begin at 6:15 pm. For students in grades 4-6, they will need to purchase a student planner. Each student planner costs $6.00 each, cash only. The crew teachers will have planners available for purchase on Back to School Night. Our facilities manager will be in the K-4 gym starting at 5 pm to share information and answer questions about bus transportation and school meals.

For Irving Elementary:

Dear Manara Families, we are looking forward to seeing you [tonight], August 15, 2017, from 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm for Back to School Night. The event will be designed differently this year for our returning families. There will be signs posted in the building with class lists, and you will go directly to your child’s class. You can drop off school supplies as well as hear a brief presentation from your child’s teachers. Presentations will begin at 6:15 pm. For students in grades 4-6, they will need to purchase a student planner. Each student planner costs $6.00 each, cash only. The crew teachers will have planners available for purchase on Back to School Night. Our facilities manager will be in the K-4 gym starting at 5 pm to share information and answer questions about bus transportation and school meals.

For the past two years we have worked with them to send water filtration kits all over the world. This year we extended our partnership to their Shoes for Orphan Souls project. Irving Elementary donated 170 pairs of new socks and shoes! We took 80 kindergarten students and 50 sixth grade students to volunteer and learn more about how Buckner helps our local community as well as communities across the globe. Students had an opportunity to tour the warehouse where the shoes are sorted, stored and delivered. Students learned about the harsh reality that many kids face by taking turns walking on various types of ground found around the world including sharp rocks and jagged concrete. Also,students wrote encouraging notes to the recipients of the shoes they donated. Finally, students learned how the water filtration kits that Buckner sends to countries without clean water work.

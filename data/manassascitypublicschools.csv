With the help of many volunteers, OHS developed a plan so each of its 477 graduates could be celebrated. Adhering to strict health guidelines, Manassas City Public Schools provided each graduate an opportunity to receive their diploma, walk across the stage in their cap and gown and share the moment with a limited number of guests.

""PREDICT- I plan to test the surface tension of water and salt water, I predict that the salt water will have the strongest surface tension.
Constants:
1. The amount of water in each jar
2. Same coins to test the surface tension
3. The same technique when dropping the coins into the jars
Procedure:
1. Get 1 cup of water
2. Pour 1 cup of water into two separate jars
3. Then pour 1 TBS of salt in one jar
4. Put one coin at a time into the jar of salt water until surface tension brakes
5. Then after the surface tension broke, I dumped all the coins out to use the same coins in the water jar
6. Then I put one coin at a time in the jar of water till the surface tension broke
Outcome: I found out my hypothesis was wrong the jar with just water had the strongest surface tension then the salt water.""",0.0,"Huskies learning from home!

Baldwin Elementary School has been recognized as a Project Lead The Way (PLTW) Distinguished School for providing broad access to transformative learning opportunities for students through PLTW Launch. It is one of just 404 elementary schools across the U.S., and just 4 in Virginia, to receive this honor. As a school, we believe Project Lead The Way Launch Modules provide the vehicle for teaching students through inquiry, promoting innovative thinking, and emphasizing the 5Cs (Critical thinking, Creative thinking, Collaboration, Communication, and Citizenship) Now, more than ever, we can see how these skills will serve our students in their future and why they are essential to educating the whole child.

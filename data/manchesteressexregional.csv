Manchester Parks and Recreation & The Summer Playground Staff are excited to announce that they have developed a plan to bring some creative recreation activities to you this summer! Due to the MA Covid-19 guidelines, we will not be able to run the traditional in-person Summer Playground this year.

Instead we will be offering weekly “Playground Kits” to enjoy at home. The kits will include a new art or STEM activity with all necessary supplies, directions and access to a video tutorial from your favorite Playground Counselors! Each kit will also include socially distant play ideas. These Playground Kits are the perfect way to participate in a new variation of Playground while engaging in some fun and exciting activities. More information on kit registration is coming soon!

We are also planning some small group programs that residents can register for at: https://manchesterma.myrec.com/info/activities/default.aspx and are working to add more soon! Manchester Parks and Recreation",0.0,"Town of Manchester by the Sea

Listening to some of the most amazing children's authors tonight, authors of color, (Jason Reynolds in photo), talking about how to address the topic of racism with kids. The conversation began in our MMES Library several years ago when I gave 3rd, 4th and 5th graders a Multicultural and Global Lit Challenge to expose our students to marginalized societies and different life experiences across the globe. I am passionate about this topic. We have a long way to go but so proud that this conversation is not a new one at MMES! Our MMES kids are, for the most part, very removed from marginalized societies - a blessing and, during these times somewhat of a curse in terms of understanding - but through literature they learn so much about this great wide world and their response to this literature over the years has been extremely empathetic and engaged. Put great books of diversity in the hands of your kids. They will get it. Email silags@mersd.org for related book lists.",0.0,"Mersd LibTech

Listening to some of the most amazing children's authors tonight, authors of color, (Jason Reynolds in photo), talking about how to address the topic of racism with kids. The conversation began in our MMES Library several years ago when I gave 3rd, 4th and 5th graders a Multicultural and Global Lit Challenge to expose our students to marginalized societies and different life experiences across the globe. I am passionate about this topic. We have a long way to go but so proud that this conversation is not a new one at MMES! Our MMES kids are, for the most part, very removed from marginalized societies - a blessing and, during these times somewhat of a curse in terms of understanding - but through literature they learn so much about this great wide world and their response to this literature over the years has been extremely empathetic and engaged. Put great books of diversity in the hands of your kids. They will get it. Email silags@mersd.org for related book lists.",2020-06-05 07:57:17,,

What a treat today!!! Our first Gr 4 LIVE Stay Home Book Club Meeting over lunch had a very special guest, author Ralph Fletcher!!

His book FLYING SOLO was our May Book Club book. Since most of the kids couldn't access the book due to the school closure, I asked Ralph if he would join our meeting and give us a little Book Talk to inspire us to read the book eventually! He shared where he gets his ideas and even showed us Japanese and Korean FLYING SOLO editions where they changed the book title to ""Without Teacher."" LOL So fun!

MMES Music Teacher Miss Dooley is a big fan of Google Doodles...those fun, timely changes that are made to the Google logo to celebrate holidays, anniversaries, famous people, etc. Today's Google Doodle made Miss Dooley particularly happy because it shows one her favorite instruments, the theremin!

The theremin was one of the first electronic instruments, and it's the only instrument you play WITHOUT touching. It works by sensing the distance between the instrument and your hand. Here's a performance by the most famous theremin player, Clara Rockmore:

The Snyder Family has taken the Challenge with this funny poem from the good old days when we could go to work and school!

Lucky Trade by Matthew M. Fredericks

I told my mom I'd go to work
if she would go to school.
She thought that trading places once
just might be kind of cool.

So she agreed; I packed her lunch
and made her wash her face
Then Mother said, ""I wonder why
you want to take my place?""

""I wonder what you do at work.
I'd like to meet your boss.
Now hurry up and brush your teeth
and don't forget to floss.""

""There's just one other thing, Mom,
that I forgot to mention:
I'll pick you up at four o'clock -
today you have detention.""",0.0,"Mersd LibTech

The Sanson Family has taken the Poetry Challenge with an original work - written this morning! Well done! Gets us ready for the season!

Once Chance
by Lucas

It's the bottom of the 9th, you're down by one run.
In your head you think confidently, that this will be fun.
You have only one chance.
You step in to the box, and get in your stance.
The pressure is real, your whole team relying.
You hit the ball perfectly, and make it go flying.
The pitcher winds up, and hurls the ball.
Then in your head, you make the call.
You throw your hands outward with all your might.

Currently, we have 4,200 residences still without power. JCpL does have crews through out Manchester. I understand CW 5 has recently been restored. I know people have received a 8/11 timeframe from JCPL for all to be restored. Please know, that’s when they estimate all service calls to be completed. I just finished a conference call with JCPL and other Mayors where they indicated 85 percent of all residents will be restored by Friday at midnight.

For those residents without power and need to go somewhere cool and air conditioned, you can go to the Whiting Firehouse and/or the Civic Center at Manchester Town Hall... both locations are open 4:00 pm to 8:00 pm today.

Yesterday they both would’ve graduated from Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University with their Master of Music degrees. The pandemic changed what would’ve been a wonderful day of pomp and circumstance into a small celebration. They both worked so hard for this, and we are lucky to have such qualified, extraordinary and dedicated individuals teaching Manchester's aspiring musicians!

The written notice must be sent to the PTA President, the Recording Secretary and the Nominations Chairperson: 20 days before the Membership/Voting Virtual meeting, which is May 28th @ 7pm.

We’re gonna help each other virtually

Even though things aren’t the same
We just want you all to know
That we’re still here to support you
Even all the way from home

We are so proud of your efforts
You’ve been doing very well
With the help of your parents
Things are going very swell

It is best that we be safe
We just want you all healthy

All you can do is your best

We will handle all the rest.

As you are probably aware our Auditorium has limited seating for Graduation. I am currently working on implementing one of the following resolutions-
*Reserved seating for each students' family (4-6 seats) then open seating first come first serve
*Reserving the entire auditorium and giving each student 12-15 tickets each (depending on class size)
*Somewhere in between with a combination of both
*Leave as it has been- completely open, first come first serve

We will also have open seating in the cafeteria with live stream in there as well as on Facebook. I am asking for input from parents, alumni, community members. Please DO NOT comment on this post. Please contact me personally by stopping at the high school, calling 580-782-3343, or emailing me at treese@mangum.k12.ok.us

Mangum has had a long tradition of providing local scholarships, however, many of
them no longer exist. At this time, we have eight scholarships generously given by local businesses and
community organizations. As the need for higher education and career training grows, so does the need for
financial aid. If any individual, business, or organization is interested in learning more about establishing
a scholarship for our students, please contact me, Kylie Peeler, at Mangum High School, 580-782-3343.

#whymcs Day 1 - Location location location.

Our 2 schools are located in the Lower East Side, with convenient public transportation (F, M, J, Z, and numerous bus services) and gateway to Brooklyn. This is a historical, culturally diverse and vibrant community, with whom we have developed a close relationship. Here's a picture of our 2nd grade hanging out with the firefighters of Engine 15 in LES. We learned a lot about fire safety and the profession that day, and even gained some future courageous firefighters!

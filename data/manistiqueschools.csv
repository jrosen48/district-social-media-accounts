Greetings. I hope this communication finds you safe and healthy. I wanted to let you know that we received an Executive Order from Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Schools across the great State of Michigan will be rolling out Distance Learning Plans in response to the COVID 19 Pandemic.

In the meantime, we will continue to collect previously assigned work at Jack's Fresh Foods and Little Bear Arena until April 9th.

The Building Trades class is now taking orders for cedar deer blinds. The structure measures 5'x5' with 6'2' head room.

Features include:

Treated wood insulated floor
Solid cedar siding on all walls.

One piece rubber roof system.

Three plexiglas shooting windows.

All proceeds go directly to the Building Trades Program at Manistique High School.

The entire building is constructed by high school students under the direction of the instructors.

A true bargain considering the quality. $500 each, first come first serve

We're raising money to support the teachers and staff of Manitou School District in this challenging time for education. The funds will directly support teachers and staff, empowering them to do things like:
• Buy instruments for an after-school rock band
• Purchase materials for yoga or mindfulness
• Build a sensory corner to encourage self-regulation

Our goal is to bring hope and joy to our teachers and staff by ensuring that there is still support for new and ongoing extracurricular projects that lift our educator’s spirits while serving our children.

The goal is to turn on the lights in as many buildings, businesses and homes across our region for one hour on May 20, 2020 beginning at 8:20 p.m. (2020 military time) to give a symbolic yet visible display of support for our (and really, your) local graduating seniors, and to let them know the entire city is cheering them on to the finish line. Residents, businesses and organizations are then encouraged to post a photo or video of their unique and visible light source (porchlights, exterior lighting, fleet vehicles, large-scale buildings, holiday lighting, lanterns – the more creative and visible the better!) to social media on May 20 with a congratulatory message for graduates. #BeTheLightMSSD City of Manitou Springs",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=282608796471153&id=125657322166302,,0.0,"We would like to make you aware of an initiative within the Pikes Peak Region to honor the graduating class of 2020.

The mother of this 1st Grader at MSES gave us permission to share this video with everyone.

Each morning, before she begins her remote learning with her teacher (Ms. Carter), she watches this video (of Andy Grammer's ""Don't Give Up On Me"" ft. PS22 Chorus) in the presence of her mom. Her positive approach to the day is a powerful example of how a wise child makes the best of the moment.

At tonight’s Board meeting, we announced an updated plan to distribute devices. Instead of waiting in line, we are asking parents to click the link below to complete a form indicating that your student or students still need a device. The devices will be delivered to the home address indicated on your student’s registration as soon as they are ready. Deliveries will be made using proper social distancing to ensure the safety of our families and our staff. All remaining devices will be delivered using this process. Please do not come to the pickup sites.

As a reminder, students do not need to use a district-owned device. Any device with an Internet connection can be used to access all programs and apps needed for virtual learning. Students who are unable to get a device before school starts tomorrow will not be penalized in any way.

Thanks to those that dropped off today. It is a great start but we need so much more!!

Help Common Ground Network to provide hundreds of needed supplemental food bags to be given out to children and families in our community in this season of social distancing and Coronavirus concerns. You can help by dropping off food items in front of the Missions Building, Building D at the First Methodist Church Mansfield, 777 N. Walnut Creek Dr. Please place items in the big blue bins, just outside the entry door marked ""D-102"".

We are especially in need of single-serve entrée items kids can easily open and safely heat, if needed. Microwaveable is good, but please, nothing that requires refrigeration, stovetop or oven. Here are a few examples:
Ramen noodle microwavable cups
Mac n cheese microwavable cups
Tuna (easy open can or foil package)
Chef Boyardee pasta microwavable cups
Cereal
Fruit cups
Breakfast bars

Many activities were held at Manson elementary, middle and high schools on Friday, November 8th!

The day got off to a great start by honoring our veterans with a special breakfast of pancakes, bacon and eggs and a perfect cup of coffee all prepared and served by Manson high school students. Assemblies were also held at both schools where many veterans were in attendance. Students had an opportunity to thank each Veteran with a hand shake and a hello!

During this month of honoring our Veterans, a school-wide Penny War was also going on to benefit our friends at the Tatley Outpost build 3 tiny homes on their Veteran run farm. The class that earned the most gets to take a field trip to the farm, do some yoga therapy, do some work and help with the tiny home project. A total of $2,125.17 was collected by all our students. As a nice surprise, local business “Chelan Fresh” also donated $1,000 to Tatley Outpost making the total donation of $3,135.17.

Many activities were held at Manson elementary, middle and high schools on Friday, November 8th!

The day got off to a great start by honoring our veterans with a special breakfast of pancakes, bacon and eggs and a perfect cup of coffee all prepared and served by Manson high school students. Assemblies were also held at both schools where many veterans were in attendance. Students had an opportunity to thank each Veteran with a hand shake and a hello!

During this month of honoring our Veterans, a school-wide Penny War was also going on to benefit our friends at the Tatley Outpost build 3 tiny homes on their Veteran run farm. The class that earned the most gets to take a field trip to the farm, do some yoga therapy, do some work and help with the tiny home project. A total of $2,125.17 was collected by all our students. As a nice surprise, local business “Chelan Fresh” also donated $1,000 to Tatley Outpost making the total donation of $3,135.17.

Thank you for your service Veterans!",2019-11-08 19:10:34,,

Manson Chamber of Commerce salutes Manson High School Drone Club member, Jon Fernandez!

Not only does instructor Kate Sorenson teach her kids to pilot drones and take spectacular video, she teaches them to use Apple's Final Cut Pro editing software, the gold standard for video editing. These two skills alone are incredibly valuable work/career tools our kids are learning here in Manson.

Recently, we sent Jon, one of Ms. Sorenson's students, a script, a voiceover track with music, and a bunch of sponsor logos. With the footage the Drone Club shot at last years Manson Rat Rod Show, Jon fully edited and produced the TV commercial we will start airing this week on Local Tel. Jon took on this project not having any prior TV commercial editing experience. He did FANTASTIC! Please help us thank him for his strong efforts and for giving back his community with his new skills and talents. We will be posting his work very soon!",0.0,"Manson Chamber of Commerce

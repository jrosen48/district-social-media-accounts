As you may know, the Illinois State Board of Education released yet another large document significantly contradicting the guidelines previously sent out to all school districts. There has been a lack of coordination and communication that has caused Illinois Schools to be working with a moving target in many areas.

Due to the most recent guidelines and restrictions released, Manteno School District will be offering both remote and in-person instruction at all three schools.

The schools will also be sending out a Frequently Asked Questions document outlining some of the changes we have made in the buildings that may be helpful to you as you make your decision.

Manteno Middle School families:

It is with much disappointment that we inform you that today we received an email from the IESA notifying member schools that they are cancelling the regular season and IESA state series in the sports of boys and girls golf, boys baseball, girls softball, and boys and girls cross-country for the 2020-21 school year. There are no plans to try and re-schedule the activities or conduct them later in the school year. The safety of student athletes, coaches, officials and fans was the primary factor in the decisions made by the IESA board.

We are excited that winter and spring sports are still scheduled to be played. We can’t wait to see our athletes put the Manteno Panther uniform on and step back into their respective sports.

Thank you for flexibility, understanding and support as we navigate uncharted waters in sports. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Josh Carlile at jcarlile@manteno5.org or call the Middle School office at 815-928-7150.

Parents of incoming Kindergarten students. Yesterday was going to be our in-person registration. We would still like to work on registering your new Kindergarten student. We can mail the packet to you, we can email it, or you can pick up a packet on Monday’s at the high school from 10-1. If you want a packet mailed to you or emailed to you, please email Ashley at amartinez@manteno5.org Our goal is that we can have packets for new students back by May 15th, if possible. We would ask that for turning them in, you email them back to Ashley or you can drop it off at the high school.

If a student is currently in our pre-school program or our head start program, there is nothing they need to do until online registration is turned on.

It was a great year of learning ~ not only learning academics but learning HOPE, RESILIENCE, and life lessons that we would not have known without living through the pandemic. Although the school is part of the Manvel Community, the Manvel Community is DEFINITELY part of our school! We are thankful for the privilege of working with you and your children this year. Have a safe & healthy summer! ~ Mrs. Hiltner",2020-05-27 18:23:02,https://video-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/10000000_255711482202888_1989235328870776832_n.mp4?_nc_cat=104&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=9EITNLSShJMAX9-wh33&_nc_ht=video-atl3-1.xx&oh=28a2b5fabfee24f39ef87f441605f117&oe=5F5EFBA8,

Stage two of the football field house update is complete! Over the last two summers, we’ve added lockers and now graphics to finish off the building that was built in 2017 through generous donations from the community and alumni.

Current and future generations of Adrian Maples will remember what Rex Willnow meant to the football program and district through his memorial door.

And the best part? It's all ready for graduation this weekend!

Adrian Maples Athletics
June 11 at 5:14 PM ·

It is a great honor to introduce the class of 2020's senior athletic award winners! These student-athletes were selected by the Adrian Maples coaching staff for the awards. While we typically celebrate them at the senior awards banquet, it was a pleasure to celebrate with their families today. Their names will go on the board outside the athletic office (dating back to 1975). The Maple Fans Club purchased the plaques for the award recipients. Congratulations seniors! #GOMAPLES

Today is National Administrative Professionals Day, and I would like to personally recognize some fantastic people who are vital to the success of the Recreation Department. Mrs. Hayes at Prairie, Mrs. Richard at Lincoln, Mrs. Rodocker at Michener, Mrs. Schefka at Alexander, as well as Mrs. Moore from the High School Athletic Office.

These staff members go above and beyond in assisting with student registrations, parent questions, last-minute communications, as well as offering insight on how to better the experience for the students in their building. The success the Recreation Department has experienced in our short year and a half of existence is due to their hard work and support, and I could not do it without them.

So, on behalf of Adrian Public Schools, the Adrian Community Recreation Department, and the students and families of APS, thank you for all you do in helping to provide our students with an exciting and high-quality educational experience.

I would love to teach folks how to make these masks because many people can sew but just need direction. My video will help.

I have tweaked my measurements to 10x8. Anyone can contact me for assistance.

I am currently working on a order of 60 for U of M and UTMC. Plus, I was asked by a Captain in the Army to help get 300 for their group in Alaska.

If my video is shared - it might encourage those folks who know how to sew but haven’t tried to make a mask - it might encourage them to try.

The need is HUGE and anyone who can help, should! If I can get time, I’ll get some masks to you.

Many families have asked about the future of graduation ceremonies for our current senior class. While there are many uncertainties in our future as a community, I want to let our students and community know that in some way, in some form, and at some time, we will have a graduation for the class of 2020.

While there are many uncertainties out there for us to face still, we will find a way to make a graduation happen. Sorry that I can’t share anything more specific, but know it will take place once things calm down and we have better answers.

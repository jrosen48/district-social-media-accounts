On the evening of Thursday, April 30th, the teachers will drive the streets of Amboy, Good Thunder, Mapleton, and Minnesota Lake. It is our goal as a district to show the parents, the students, and the community that the teachers are here for you, regardless of the circumstances.

Please understand that we aren’t able to drive every street and road that students live on, but we hope that if you don’t live on one of these streets, you might consider driving and parking along the route. It is our hope that we can wave and see as many students as possible. Please stay in your yard or in or next to your vehicle as we drive by. Please remember social distancing while we wave at students from the safety of our vehicles.

When: Thursday, April 30th (See maps for approximate times for each town)

Thank you for the incredible response to this week’s survey. We are already using the data to make decisions about the best ways to serve the students of Maple River.

Later this evening, we will open the online system for daily student lunch orders. Lunches must be ordered daily and can be picked up daily between 11 am and 12:30 pm. If you would like to order lunch for your student(s), please visit this web page https://www.isd2135.k12.mn.us/Page/4134 and follow the directions. Pick-up locations are listed within the web page. For families without transportation, there will be limited deliveries available. Please use this option only if absolutely necessary. Families who participate in the Backpack or PowerPack programs will still receive that weekend resource in addition to this daily lunch option.

As we create the systems necessary to meet the needs of our students, we appreciate your patience with the inevitable kinks needing to be worked out.

As a way to provide agricultural land owners with tax relief, the 2019 Minnesota State Legislature passed an amendment that will increase the Ag2School tax credit on school bonds from 40% to 70% over the next three years. The credit will increase to 55% for taxes payable in 2021, 60% in 2022, and 70% in 2023 and thereafter.

With the Ag2School tax credit paying for 51% of the total project over the life of the bond, local taxpayers will pay less than half of the $63.3M project cost.

Minnesota taxpayers contribute to the State of Minnesota's General Fund, however, Blue Earth County taxpayers pay less than 1% of the income taxes paid to the State of Minnesota. Over 60% of the Ag2School funding originates in the 7-county metropolitan area (Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington counties.)

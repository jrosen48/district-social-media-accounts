In addition to the staff, we had several students and community members participating and additional staff cheering on the teams, as well. In teams of ten, each participant climbed nearly 1,000 steps and raised over $8,000 on behalf of Maple River. I couldn‚Äôt have been more proud to see so many Eagles joining together for such a great cause. Even our mascot ü¶Ö was in attendance! This is an annual event, so if you‚Äôre interested in participating next year, please let us know,‚Äù said Superintendent Dan Anderson.

As a way to provide agricultural land owners with tax relief, the 2019 Minnesota State Legislature passed an amendment that will increase the Ag2School tax credit on school bonds from 40% to 70% over the next three years. The credit will increase to 55% for taxes payable in 2021, 60% in 2022, and 70% in 2023 and thereafter.

With the Ag2School tax credit paying for 51% of the total project over the life of the bond, local taxpayers will pay less than half of the $63.3M project cost.

Minnesota taxpayers contribute to the State of Minnesota's General Fund, however, Blue Earth County taxpayers pay less than 1% of the income taxes paid to the State of Minnesota.

They travel to the US with the desire to be part of an American family, to experience an American high school, to improve their English, and to share their culture while learning more about their host family‚Äôs culture. This school year, we welcomed Sofus Ellingsgard from Denmark, Florian Theuner from Germany, and Rachel He from China to our district. They took part in many school activities, including football, track and field, and school dances.

‚ÄúThese students add so much to our school and community, and I would love to continue to spread the word and find more host families for this year and those to come,‚Äù said Decker.

If you are interested in being a host family or have questions about the program, please contact Melissa at decker5@hickorytech.net or call 507-382-3980.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2237100266325212&id=828505623851357,,0.0,"Over the past five years, Melissa Decker, local coordinator for CIEE (Council for International Educational Exchange), has placed 14 international exchange students with host families in the Maple River School District.

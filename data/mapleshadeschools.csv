The Yocum playground got a fresh new look today along with an additional piece of playground equipment for our students to enjoy! We were extremely fortunate to have so many volunteers come out and help with this project, especially our friends from the business community.

ARI summer interns partnered with Yocum to build and donate a recycled tire dinosaur for their playground. Project leader, Steven Reitz, coordinated the effort with his mother, Yvonne, who is Yocum's Vice-Principal. Steven led a team of volunteers from ARI, the school, and the community in Yocum’s effort to improve their playground and Go Green. Reitz said, “Giving back and working for the benefit of children has given us the biggest reward of the summer. I can’t wait to come back and see the kids enjoying their new dinosaur.”

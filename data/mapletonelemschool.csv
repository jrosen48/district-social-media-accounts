Anxiety is a normal reaction to stress and can actually be beneficial to kids at times. Anxious thoughts trigger the brain to send out a warning signal for impending danger. When a child begins to cross the street without looking and an oncoming car is in the child’s path, for example, the anxious response signals the child to step back to the curb.

For some children, however, anxiety can become excessive and interfere with normal daily living. Anxiety can make it difficult for children to interact with peers and establish friendships, separate from parents to attend school or other activities and make it difficult for kids to learn.
It can also negatively impact their sleep, their eating habits, and their physical health.",0.0,"Many children and adults are dealing with anxiety during this time. This is a great reminder for us all when we see these behaviors.

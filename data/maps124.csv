In order to allow our teachers and youngest students some time to acclimate to the ISBE guidelines, MGS will move forward with small preschool classes. We will invite students who were enrolled in class last school year, first. After the class has some experience with how to implement procedures for our youngest students, we will then invite those 4 year olds who had previously signed up for screenings to be screened and enrolled. If space allows, we will then open up screening to additional 4 year olds and then 3 year olds. We understand that this is different than in the past, but we want to 1) ensure we know how to best serve our littles and keep them safe and 2) ensure that our 4 year olds who will enter kindergarten next year are served. We will send a message when we will start the screening process and those that had been signed up will be contacted.

Join Us in this School Wide Activity to Build a Rock Garden

WHO: ALL OF YOU--Students, Parents, Teachers, Families and Friends

WHAT: A MGS Rock Garden

WHERE: At the Front Entrance of Milford Grade School

WHEN: NOW

WHY: Because MGS will continue to grow and work together.

Please spend time with your families painting small rocks (1in-5in rocks) with positive messages, inspiring words, and fun pictures. You can grab some unpainted rocks from our garden if you need rocks to paint. When you are finished painting your rocks, come back to MGS and add them to the garden. Drive thru the bus lane to drop your painted rocks off in the garden. You will see the garden as you near the front doors of the grade school entrance.

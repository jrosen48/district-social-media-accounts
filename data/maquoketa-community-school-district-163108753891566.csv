Our 3rd Quarter Before/After School program began yesterday and we are continuing to receive updates regarding student transportation needs. If you have changed your address or have changed from parent pick-up to needing bus transportation please call your child's building as soon as possible so we have accurate transportation information for your child.

Due to some of these changes, student drop-off times may vary from when they have been previously dropped off. The After School Program staff will do everything possible to contact families if busses are running behind schedule. If needing to contact the program after 4:00 pm, please call your child's attendance building and enter the prompt to contact the After School Coordinator on duty if you have questions or concerns regarding your child's arrival time. Thank you for your participation in this program and for your patience as we work to ensure that your child has fun and arrives home safely.

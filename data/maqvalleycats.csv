Tomorrow's XC meet at Anamosa has been CANCELLED due to wet conditions. They received too much rain over night to make it possible to run tomorrow.

Tonights JV game has been PPD at this point. Plans are in the works to try and make it work Monday. More details later today or this weekend in regards to the JV game.

Tonights Varsity game at Winthrop is still on. They will be conducting their Homecoming activities at 6:15 PM and we are planning to start the Varsity game between 6:45 PM and 7:00 PM. You won't miss any of the game if you are there at 6:45. They are not sure how long the Homecoming activities will take because it is not what they normally due. Just like us, they are trying to make things work with lots of changing factors.

I hope to see everyone in Winthrop tonight. Stay dry! I will post information if the game is going to be broadcasted in any way but at this point there is no LiveStream or Radio tonight.

üíî It's with a VERY heavy heart that the choice was made to not participate in State this year. This was not an easy decision. My first thought was the 2 seniorsü•∫. But, they would be the only factor into why we would go. The competition has gone mostly virtual. If we went we would be competing over lifestream to judges in other states. Of our two routines one in particular is very visually appealing. I think the facials, tricks and quality of the dance would be lost in streaming. I would rather save these 2 dances for next year with the hope that things are more back to normal.
I'm heartbroken over this and feel what a let down this is for the girls. I hope we can go forward having amazing season and with the extra time we could add in some new dances to the basketball season.

Extremely proud of the student athletes showing up early in the morning to get themselves working toward a return to Fall sports. 80 total athletes have attended workouts on Mon, Wed and Thu mornings.

We are doing everything on the track right now and it has gone really well. Each time they keep getting a little better.

Thank you to the athletes who keep coming back and thank you to the coaches who are helping each day.

Coach Conner, Whittenbaugh, Dutra, Manternach, Teymer, Huegel and Cassutt have been vital to the success of what we have gotten done returning to workouts.

Tomorrow will be the first day our kids are going to utilize our new timing system. Can‚Äôt wait to see what the Cats can do.

Maquoketa Valley Girl's Basketball team is going to put on a 1 Day zoom camp for girl's in 5th - 8th grades. We have always said, ""you don't need a hoop to get better at the game of basketball."" Now it's time to prove that theory correct! During these tough times we're trying to do our best to stay connected. All you need is a computer and a basketball!! The camp is this Monday April 20th at 8 a.m. If you're interested please email at scotmoenck@maquoketa-v.k12.ia.us and he will get you set up with a free zoom account.

The IHSAA and IGHSAU have implemented a Family Week that will go into effect next Summer. From the date of Saturday July 25th 2021 to August 1st 2021 there will be no individual, group or team workouts allowed for any state sponsored activities. This would include all sports for grades 7-12.

Something of this nature was already planned for this summer here at MV but due to our current situation, those restrictions will not be placed on our athletes & coaches. If we are allowed to get back to working with the kids, I think we are all going to be pretty excited to do that and not need another break since we are currently on a longer break than we even want.

I wanted to share this information so if you happen to be doing some long-term vacation planning, July 25th-August 1st 2021 might be the ideal time for your family and student-athlete(s) to get away before Fall Camps begin.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this.

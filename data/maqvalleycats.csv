Tomorrow's XC meet at Anamosa has been CANCELLED due to wet conditions. They received too much rain over night to make it possible to run tomorrow.

Tonights JV game has been PPD at this point. Plans are in the works to try and make it work Monday. More details later today or this weekend in regards to the JV game.

Tonights Varsity game at Winthrop is still on. They will be conducting their Homecoming activities at 6:15 PM and we are planning to start the Varsity game between 6:45 PM and 7:00 PM. You won't miss any of the game if you are there at 6:45. They are not sure how long the Homecoming activities will take because it is not what they normally due. Just like us, they are trying to make things work with lots of changing factors.

I hope to see everyone in Winthrop tonight. Stay dry! I will post information if the game is going to be broadcasted in any way but at this point there is no LiveStream or Radio tonight.

💔 It's with a VERY heavy heart that the choice was made to not participate in State this year. This was not an easy decision. My first thought was the 2 seniors🥺. But, they would be the only factor into why we would go. The competition has gone mostly virtual. If we went we would be competing over lifestream to judges in other states. Of our two routines one in particular is very visually appealing. I think the facials, tricks and quality of the dance would be lost in streaming. I would rather save these 2 dances for next year with the hope that things are more back to normal.
I'm heartbroken over this and feel what a let down this is for the girls. I hope we can go forward having amazing season and with the extra time we could add in some new dances to the basketball season.
Thank you all for the support 🖤💛🐾

Barring any major upcoming changes, we are hoping to have a regular soccer season this year although it may look a little different. I am opening up registration now until the end of the month. You can use the google form or print out the attached pdf to register. Registration will not be complete until waiver form is signed and fees are received. If player numbers in a level are low, we may need to combine teams with Manchester and Ed-Co to guarantee everyone gets a chance to play games.

A signed waiver and fees can be mailed to Delhi Soccer (Lisa Smith) 2966 235th Avenue Delhi, IA 52223 or brought to first practice in the beginning of August. More information to come once registration forms are received.

I had believed it was 1960. Now I’m pretty sure it was the Fall of 1959 and the first graduating Class was 1960.

Was there a year we didn’t have a team?

Yesterday during commencement, it was announced our Class of 2020 was the 62nd graduating class of Maquoketa Valley.

So I am confused. Can anyone straighten me out? The question I really want answered is...this Fall will be the 61st, 62nd or 63rd Maquoketa Valley Football team?

Thank you for any help you can provide. I never thought something so simple would have me this confused.

Here are the dates:
Prom: Saturday June 6th @ Delhi Legion (Grand March @ park prior to Dance from 8-11 pm).
Graduation: Sunday June 7th @ 4:00 pm

If the guidelines have not been lifted for these 2 June dates, we will plan for these dates:
Prom: Friday July 3rd @ Delhi Legion (Grand March @ park prior to Dance from 8-11 pm).
Graduation: Sunday July 5th @ 4:00 pm

If the guidelines still have not been lifted by July 3rd, prom will be cancelled and we will proceed with a graduation ceremony on July 5th. We discussed doing a car parade for graduation on July 5th if the social distancing guidelines have not been lifted.

Hope everyone is doing well. Take care.",2020-04-22 09:31:28,,

The IHSAA and IGHSAU have implemented a Family Week that will go into effect next Summer. From the date of Saturday July 25th 2021 to August 1st 2021 there will be no individual, group or team workouts allowed for any state sponsored activities. This would include all sports for grades 7-12.

Something of this nature was already planned for this summer here at MV but due to our current situation, those restrictions will not be placed on our athletes & coaches. If we are allowed to get back to working with the kids, I think we are all going to be pretty excited to do that and not need another break since we are currently on a longer break than we even want.

I wanted to share this information so if you happen to be doing some long-term vacation planning, July 25th-August 1st 2021 might be the ideal time for your family and student-athlete(s) to get away before Fall Camps begin.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this.

Also, the AD gets to test the lights and make sure they are working after a long winter. 😉

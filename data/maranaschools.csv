I started my teaching career at Roadrunner in 2010 as a Reading Specialist and left in 2019 to stay home with our kiddos. I have taught Kindergarten, 1st and 6th grade and enjoyed all my kiddos! I love spending time with my husband on the beach and taking trip with our children and grandchildren. It brings me joy and happiness to see them laugh, grow and become amazing individuals.

Hi everyone! My name is Sierra Pederson and I will be teaching kindergarten this year at Dove Mountain. I grew up in Tucson but moved to Little Rock, Arkansas to attend college. I recently graduated from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock in December 2019 so I am a first-year teacher! Woohoo! I have an (almost) 2 year-old son, Cayden, and a hermit crab, King (named after my favorite author Stephen King). In my very minimal spare time, I enjoy reading, Yoga, and watching baseball games (go Diamondbacks!).

Hi from Meaghan Marshall, the new part-time special education teacher. Hailing from western NY, but a happy desert dweller since 2006, I am thrilled to join the staff at Dove Mountain this year. In my 13 years as an educator I have worked in public and private schools and with students from grade K-12. I love teaching, reading, travelling, adventuring, hiking, organizing, and my family (p.s. Go Red Sox!). My husband and I have 2 wonderful children at Dove Mountain and the incredible experience they had last year impressed me, playing a big part in my desire to be part of the Jaguar Team.

I believe that if you feel a balance of excitement and nerves about a new endeavor you’re in the right place and space. Education is not currently what anyone has experienced before and I am feeling the energy and the butterflies, so I know I’m in a good place!",0.0,"Welcome to #maranaschools Mrs. Marshall!

As an Arizona tax payer, you can allocate your public school tax credit by making a donation of up to $200 / individual and $400 / married couple. This will result in a dollar-for-dollar tax credit when you file your state return. What better way to ensure Arizona's future than by investing in our young leaders? MUSD will use your donation to fund after-school tutoring, student athletics, field trips and other areas of greatest need.

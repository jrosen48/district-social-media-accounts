The Marathon Alumni Association Board of Directors, after much discussion, thought and realization, has decided to cancel the Alumni Banquet because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This decision was not arrived at easily. Considering the safety of our Alumni, the Seniors and their parents is utmost, and based on the uncertainty and fluidity of the COVID-19 restrictions, plus the unknown as to when we can return to ""normal,"" the cancellation was difficult if not prudent.

We are working on contingency plans for the seniors and their parents, but no final decisions have been made. Please be aware that when things become clearer, we will have more information available.

Please stay safe!

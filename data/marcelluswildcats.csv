Due to changes in income levels during the pandemic and subsequent closures and furloughs, filling out a 2020 Application for Free and Reduced-Price Lunch at this time is essential. Not only may you qualify for free (or reduced) lunch for your student(s), but a processed application may entitle your family to receive a pre-loaded P-EBT card.
Visit the link below to apply online, or pick up an application at the school on Tuesdays and Fridays during meal distributions. If you picked up meals on Friday, April 24, you would have found an application in your bag of On the Go Meals.

Please return all paper applications to the School on the next distribution day. If your application is processed by May 12, your family will receive a P-EBT card for the months of May and June.

We are requesting only households with Middle School or High School students fill out the applications. Our Elementary students qualified last year.

It is with great sadness to inform you that Marcellus 2020 Prom is cancelled. This decision was not made lightly. After hours of considering the logistics, the prom committee, along with the high school administration made this tough decision.

To our students, we know many of you have been waiting for this memorable high school experience, but in the midst of this pandemic and state lockdown, it would be a health and safety concern. We are also unsure of when restrictions will be lifted. It is almost impossible to keep a venue date in these uncertain times as so many important events had to be cancelled and rescheduled.

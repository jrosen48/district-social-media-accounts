We stormed Area 51. (most requested) We visited Unicorn World. ( I know...it‚Äôs FICTION!) We saw the Eiffel Tower and had many more adventures on six different continents. We drove our car, took an airplane, a hot air balloon and a row boat. ( We just imagined the Unicorn World visit) We enjoy playing a life-sized racing board game with student-sized game pieces!

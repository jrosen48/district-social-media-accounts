A bit of patience and determination was involved. Our kids embraced it! They made their own ice cream treat, they helped their peers, they persevered, they had FUN! Kids had many positive comments about the activity: this was awesome, I loved it, the ice cream was delicious, I didn’t know you could make ice cream with milk, you can have some of mine( when one student shared his ice cream with a peer when his didn’t turn out). Congratulations on the best PBIS reward yet. As the students gathered their ingredients they were asked what the letters BLUE meant and over 95% were able to respond correctly. Thanks to all that made it a success!",2020-02-13 10:23:49,,

Next week is the NYS Math Assessments. I wanted to start by congratulating our students for their hard work during the ELA assessment. Every student gave it his/her best shot and I am proud to say that we met the 95% participation standard. We recognize that it is you, the parents, who are responsible for helping us reach this goal. I hope we have a similar showing next week during the math test. Remember that these tests should not be stressing your child. Emphasize that they should try their best because the measures help us assess what we need to improve upon from an instructional standpoint. Once again - we were very proud of all your children’s diligence during the NYS Assessments and we look forward to showing our best again next week.

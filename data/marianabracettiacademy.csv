Last week, we released our 2020-21 School Selection Registration Form. The purpose of this form is to help us have raw data and numbers as we finalize our plans for September. For this reason, it is critical that this form is filled out before July 10th.

The easiest and fastest way is to complete it electronically at: bit.ly/MBAregistration2020 Should you prefer to send in a hard copy you may do so by mail, or during our meal distribution or Chromebook collection. Please make sure to complete it for each child that attends or plans to attend MBA for the 2020-21 School Year.

As a reminder, families who do not complete the form will automatically enroll their student in our hybrid model.

We understand and recognize you all have many questions related to school reopening in September (both virtual and in-person). We are closely following and monitoring this ever changing situation alongside national, state, and local officials. We will continue to provide updates and information as it becomes available.

One of the biggest ways you can support our seniors is by showing them love ALL day long!! Find your grade-level and color, get dressed and send a picture of yourself (and a message for our 2020 grads!!) as we host a virtual color day.

In addition to being incredibly kind, Liv has risen to the challenge of virtual learning just as she does in the classroom. Most importantly, she exemplifies our 4 pillars through her positive attitude, willingness to try and try again, and good nature. Check out why teachers nominated and selected her below:
.

🔹Olivia is so kind. She always took the time to say hi and ask me how my day was going. She brings a positive energy everywhere she goes. - Ms. Kain
🔹Olivia is so much fun to teach. She is always so hardworking, happy, polite, and easy going. Even though she would eat stinky salads in my classroom after school & is always looking for “beef”, she is a model student with a fantastic personality. - Ms. Klein
🔹Olivia's kindness and goofiness made my first semester at MBA memorable. I loved chatting with her about the Nintendo Switch, especially Gris! - Ms. Riley

Governor Wolf recently announced his intent to cut $280 million from charter school budgets next year.

This would have a disastrous impact on the quality of program we can offer our students. We would have to make tough decisions and cut $2.5 million dollars from our school budget.
We need to demand that the Governor and our Philadelphia legislators remember that our students are just as deserving as every other public school student in our state. It is unfair to de-fund charter schools in order to give more money to district schools. We can’t let this happen.

The safety of your children is our highest priority, and it is imperative that we practice a variety of emergency drills to familiarize students with necessary procedures. In addition to our monthly fire drills, we practice other drills throughout the school year. Tomorrow, the students and staff in grades 6-12 will participate in an enhanced lockdown drill to practice barricading the classroom door in case a violent intruder gains access to the building. Although evacuation should always be the primary response when safe to do so, we want to provide the staff and students multiple strategies to ensure their safety and security. We will conduct a similar drill with our elementary students once they have been prepared. Please support us by reviewing the importance of following all of MBA’s safety protocols and directions with your children.

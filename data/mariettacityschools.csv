The DOT removed seats and we are moving on to the next phase. To any student who wishes to participate, please reach out to me via FB Messenger! All are invited because TOGETHER, WE ARE THE GENERATION THAT WILL END CHILDHOOD HUNGER!

I will be posting updates and pictures as things progress!

This morning we held a special called MCS Board of Education meeting dedicated to our reopening plan.

Our priority is simple: provide every MCS student with a quality education in the safest of learning environments.
To that end, MCS will offer two learning options to our K-12 students this fall: in-person learning and virtual learning.

We understand the return to school is a deeply personal decision for each family; we also acknowledge that different students have different academic needs.

Marietta City Schools is prepared to continue instruction for students through our digital learning platform. With your help, we are launching a new program called “Connect-a-Kid.” This program will allow us to outfit school buses with mobile wi-fi “hot-spots” that will be placed in safe locations throughout our community. Additionally, you can temporarily support a Marietta family who may need access to a computing device and internet access in their home.

For just $35, you can provide one month of internet access for a Marietta student. If you would like to “Connect-a-Kid” and support such technology needs, please donate online at www.marietta-city.org/donationsandvolunteers.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157634783286154&id=123955636153,"MARIETTA-CITY.ORG

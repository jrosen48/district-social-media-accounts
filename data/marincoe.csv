Given the poor air quality due to wildfires in Northern California the Department of Marin Health and Human Services recommends that outdoor sporting activities be cancelled today, Monday October 9th and that children and all residents remain indoors and limit outdoor activities as much as possible.

Wildfires smoke can be harmful, and children, older adults, pregnant women, pets, and people with preexisting respiratory and heart conditions may be more likely to get sick if they breathe in wildfire smoke. For more information about protecting yourself from wildfire smoke, go to:
https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/wildfires/smoke.html

The Marin County Government has opened a temporary evacuation center at the Marin Veterans’ Memorial Auditorium, 10 Avenue of the Flags, in San Rafael. The temporary center (no cots or sleeping quarters available) serves as an overflow location for Sonoma and Napa fire evacuees, with capacity up to 2,000 people. For additional information visit MarinCounty.org.

In case you have forgotten, masks are still recommended when out in public where you can't social distance.

How to wear a mask:
1️⃣ Wash your hands
2️⃣ Secure the mask behind your ears
3️⃣ Make sure the mask is covering both your mouth and nose
4️⃣ Pinch down the nose if you can to make it snug

❌ Don't touch the front of your mask!",5.0,"Indiana Department of Health

Did you know that over 200 different species of birds have been found at Eagle Marsh? With the dedication of our incredible members and volunteers we have been able to record the birds that live in and migrate through Eagle Marsh.

Birds are all around us and birding is an incredible activity to help you connect with nature, that almost everyone can do! Through the practice of birding one can become more observant to what is happening around them, especially the small details.

During this time we encourage you to get outside and explore your backyard or a close natural public space with the people you live with. To help make looking for birds a little more fun, we've created an Indiana Backyard Bird Bingo game for you and whoever you live with to enjoy!

Five students from McCulloch, one from Justice, and two from Riverview attended the Indiana Music Education Association conference in Fort Wayne as performers in the 2020 IMEA All-State Honor Choirs.

These students went through a very difficult audition process to be accepted into choirs consisting of the best 150 singers their age in the state. This was also Marion’s first year to audition any fourth graders - and both made it - so special congratulations to their music teacher Erika Pappas!

The students rehearsed all day Thursday and Friday and finished their time with a great performance. Please congratulate them when you see them!

Students from Mrs. Chitwood's seventh-grade science classes got creative to meet curriculum standard that requires them to demonstrate their knowledge of Earth's layers by building a 3D model!

Some of the students chose to construct their models using cake, Rice Krispies, Skittles, Styrofoam spheres, and clay. Others designed with colored paper, forming a pop-up book.

Students reflected on the projects in their journals, noting they had fun as they learned what the layers are made of, how deep each layer is and how very hot the layers are.

Students worked in small groups and learned how to work together, solve problems, and communicate better.

One student said: ""I love projects because I get to create and use my hands to show what I know. I can't wait for the next project.""

A Message From Your School Counselor

Events like the recent outbreak of the Coronavirus can confuse, worry, and stress children to a degree that causes them far more harm than good. Young children should be spared details about infection rates and death tolls, which can needlessly terrify when they are ill equipped to process the information in the way that adults are able to. Please avoid the news and other types of social media to keep children calm.
I am available to talk with children and parents through telephone or e-mail to discuss these issues. Please feel free to e-mail me (lwillis@marion.k12.sc.us) or call me at (910)785-6485. I know that it is hard to maintain normalcy, but please continue to let children do their school work and have fun. Remember to keep them on a schedule as much as possible.

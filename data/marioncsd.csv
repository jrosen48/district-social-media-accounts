To the Entire Black Knight Learning Community,

At the Marion Board of Education meeting on August 17, 2020, the board voted to alter our school calendar. The Superintendent’s Conference Day on March 12th, 2021 is now a student attendance day, and the first day of school for students’ attendance this fall was moved from September 8th to September 9th. Part of the reason for this change was to align our calendar with that of the recently changed WF-L BOCES calendar. A more significant reason for this change was to have an additional conference day with our staff at the beginning of the year to complete the training and protocol reviews for all of the health and safety mitigation requirements related to the COVID-19 virus.

We apologize for any inconveniences this might have caused for your families.

AMAZING JOB TO EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THE PRODUCTION OF BEAUTY AND THE BEAST! Just received these comments from Elenbe judges. A virtual awards show may be coming at the end of the month.

ELENBE 2019-20 Judges' Comments for Marion, ""The Beauty and The Beast""

Very Impressive! Felt like I was watching a ""Broadway Musical"".
Your production was over the top! Everything was like a Broadway production!
Excellent entertaining program. Well done!
A perfect choice for Marion; A real feast for the eyes. Every little princess in the audience was enthralled (I sat behind one and watched her react). I expected Marion to wow me with ""Be Our Guest"" and was not disappointed - it was eyepopping!
Overall good show. You do a very good job with such a large cast. Most in big costumes did a great job of moving and facial expressions.
Good show. Some delay in between songs. There were some missed lines, but a lot of lines to remember. Mrs. Potts did a great job. Everyone moved and danced well with the elaborate costumes. great job.

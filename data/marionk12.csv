Today, PREPS held a superintendents breakfast. I had the honor of joining my fellow superintendents across the state of MS in meeting with education majors from William Carey University and Delta State University. I certainly enjoyed talking with them about sharing their future teaching careers with us in MCSD. I loved hearing that new teacher excitement in their voices and seeing the smiles on their faces as they shared their goals and plans for teaching. I also loved sharing with them why Marion County is a wonderful place to work. I appreciate Dr. Ben Burnett and Dr. Patti Permenter for this wonderful opportunity to meet with these future educators. I was super honored to be asked to pray the opening prayer at the breakfast! May all these future teachers love education like I have loved it throughout my time as an educator. Teaching is the best career choice ever.

Senior student-athletes are encouraged to post a picture of themselves on social media in their uniform, favorite school apparel, or the IHSA Student Advisory Committee’s Salute to Seniors shirts.

Re: Remote Learning Packets

Good Afternoon!

Just a quick reminder, that the buses will be rolling out of the Elementary School in about 30 minutes, delivering the next packet of Remote Learning Materials! We hope you are able to turn in your previous packet with completed work and that you're in place for today's, which will take us through the rest of the month of April, and even Friday, May 1st!

Thank you,

Re: Next Learning Packet Delivery

Happy Thursday Greetings, Everyone!

I’d like to share a quick reminder that our teachers and staff have been putting together the next set of materials for our Remote Learning Packets, which will be delivered to you NEXT MONDAY, APRIL 20th, in the afternoon, with the buses rolling out of the Elementary at 1 PM. In addition, the packets that you’ve been working on since last Wednesday can be turned in when you receive your new packet. Please do your best to meet the bus, so that we may help your mail carriers out by keeping your mailboxes empty. Any packets that are not able to be delivered will be taken back to the Elementary School. If you missed your packet and/or missed turning in work from the last packet, please call 295-2313, ext. 301 and leave me a message, so that arrangements can be made to make the connection. And again, thanks so much for your cooperation and participation!

Re: All-Call and Full Update tomorrow (Tuesday)

Good Evening/Good Morning, Marissa D. 40 Family!

I just wanted to share a quick heads-up prior to sharing an All Call tomorrow, pertaining to TWO THINGS:

1) Continual Remote Learning Packet #2: is being delivered on Wednesday afternoon, with the buses set to roll out of the Elementary at 1 PM. (Yes, PLEASE place the materials sent out in Packet #1 back in the folder/envelope in which it was delivered and hand it to the awesome delivery staff when they pass out #2)

2) Food Service Meals Distribution: After providing meals this week each day, the Distribution will change to Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, beginning next Monday, April 13th.

Much more information coming in a full update tomorrow.
Thank you,

WOW!
We can't thank the community enough for their outpouring of support at yesterday's fundraiser for Marissa Post Prom. We went through 160 pounds of fish and are thrilled to announce that we were able to write a check to Post Prom for $700!!! It was great to see everyone and we can't thank you enough for not only keeping our doors open, but for supporting Marissa Post Prom in their fundraiser!

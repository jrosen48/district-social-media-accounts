Marlboro Middle School kept up an annual tradition this year by hosting a breakfast for local veterans, thanking them for their service to our country. The November 8 event featured performances by the Jazz Band and Select Chorus, as well as a delicious meal prepared and served by members of the National Junior Honor Society. It was a wonderful event that honored our former servicemen and women while helping to make history come alive for our students.",2019-11-08 12:26:25,,

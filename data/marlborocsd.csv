Awesome tips for accessibility in this remote-learning era. Share, download, save!

Also: These steps help everyone!! A colleague today mentioned how, in two sections of the same course offered in the same semester several years ago, one section had a sort of closed captioning for one deaf student in the class (on a reader-board above the chalkboard), while the other did not have it. In the class with the captioning, the average student grade for all students was one full letter higher.

EDIT: Someone was kind enough to send me the original source for these, and to let me know that I missed the one for people with anxiety (added in the comments).

Adjusting to life changes in response to COVID-19 may be overwhelming for children and adults. While families across South Carolina are doing the best they can to cope with school and workplace closings, we know that stressors like lost income, lack of child care, food insecurity, less access to healthcare and other resources, along with separation from social support systems, can take an emotional toll.

While families across South Carolina are doing the best they can to cope with school and workplace closings, we know that stressors like lost income, lack of child care, food insecurity, less access to healthcare and other resources, along with separation from social support systems, can take an emotional toll.

Please call 888-CARE4US (888-227-3487) if you witness or suspect a situation that threatens the safety and well-being of a child or vulnerable adult. SCDSS and other agencies are poised to help families remain stable and strong during this tough time.",2020-03-30 16:52:15,,

This program will allow students and parents the ability to anonymously send in reports of serious incidents which could include: Bullying, Cyberbullying, Harassment, Violence, Alcohol/Drug related issues, etc.

While this program will mainly address middle and high school ages, we are making it available to all parents in the district. The STOPit app is a free download from iTunes or Google Play. The Access Code for the District is: #345MCSD. Once you get log in, you can tab which school you need to report an incident to. The school administrators will receive the information, investigate the situation and follow through as necessary.

Now students will have options available to help with eradicating bullying for all. We hope to change the culture to one of acceptance in this community with this new app.

If you have any questions or we can be of any assistance, please call any school and ask to speak to an administrator. #345Marlboro",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2655629021326514&id=1434787673410661,,0.0,"Marlboro County School District is launching the STOPit Solutions program.

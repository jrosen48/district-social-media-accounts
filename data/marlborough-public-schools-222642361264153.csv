I am so very fortunate to have been their teacher! I can tell you, there's no better feeling in the world than when you come in contact with some of your favorite students from all those years ago to see them blossomed into completely genuine and amazing young people. Kyle was only 5 when I was teaching kindergarten, and then the following year when I transferred to first grade I was also fortunate to teach his sister Kayla! This brother and sister duo made my heart melt today. They graduate from Marlborough High School with AP classes, calculus, and beautiful souls, and helpful hands. They were just as charming today as they were all those years ago. I couldn't help but reminiscing with them about the stories I hold in my heart about them... And it is no doubt that they still hold those great big smiles that stay in my memories to this day! Happy Graduation Kyle and Kayla, your ""Miss Demos"" is so stinkin' proud of you both!!

The Jaworek PTO have decided that during these crazy uncertain times, the financial budget for Staff Appreciation Week would be more appropriate to give back to our community, students and families.

As we are EXTREMELY appreciative of our Jaworek Staff and MPS for all the work they have been doing. It felt right to help those in these crazy times. Please take a moment and send your teacher or Jaworek Staff member a little email, Facebook or Twitter note to show your support.

So in honor of our Jaworek Staff we donated food, personal care, diapers and more to the Marlborough Food Pantry.

The over all appreciation from the Marlborough Food Pantry was heartfelt. So many of our Marlborough families are in need of a helping hand.

MPS Remote Learning Art Showcase 2020!

Thank you to Julie Baker, K-12 Supervisor of Visual Arts, for putting together this heartfelt video.
Although our school buildings are physically closed, art teachers continue to connect with students through art. We wanted to showcase the many ways our students are keeping art and creativity alive at home. This virtual art show celebrates all of our MPS artists and the many ways the visual arts enrich our lives.

Here is Chris from Mrs. deAngeli’s fourth grade class at Richer School. This week fourth graders had to create a presentation about ways they can take care of the Earth. Since Chris is also being homeschooled by his mom, Mrs. Smith, who is also the instructional technology specialist at Whitcomb Middle School, he created a self-made green screen room for his presentation! If You would like to create green screen presentations at home, the DIY is to purchase the $1 green plastic tablecloths from the dollar store, and download the DOINK green screen to your iPhone or iPad.

This is Nicholas, an MPS student with a heart of gold!

Nicholas received a $25 gift card to Target from his grandparents. After hearing that some families do not have food due to job loss, he handed me his gift card and asked me to use it to purchase food for the Marlborough Food Bank. His grandparents decided to match his donation, which gave his mom an idea...
Nicholas’ mom Sabrina Lane (special education teacher at Whitcomb) reached out to friends on Facebook to see if anyone else wanted join in and donate as well!

Pictured below are the grocery items that they were able to purchase for the Marlborough Food Bank totaling $1162! The remainder of the funds were also donated via check so that they can purchase whatever else is needed.

Are you looking for something to do that will make a difference? Is cardboard stacking up in your house? Do you care about the environment?
If you are a Marlborough resident and answered yes to any of these questions, then bring your cardboard on down to the City of Marlborough Drop Off Facility. No sticker or money required. That’s right it is FREE. Just show your Marlborough Driver's License to the attendant. We have two compactors set aside just for cardboard. Recycled cardboard is in demand right now, but only if it is separated. When cardboard is mixed with other recyclables (single stream) at the curbside it is not as recyclable. If you have any questions call the DPW at 508-624-6910. Hope to see you there.",8.0,"A message from our Marlborough Department of Public Works!

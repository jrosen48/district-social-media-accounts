I have the privilege of sharing earth- shattering news to the Marlette community.

The Gordon and Gayle Miller Foundation has decided to contribute $10,000 to the Marlette Band program, which will fully fund our ""every 5th grader in band"" campaign. This means, every single student in Marlette elementary will have an opportunity to be in band. 67 students will benefit this year, as well as thousands to come in the future. There are not many campaigns with as great of an impact on the future of students as this one. Truly, I'm blessed to lead this band program.

This community is demanding excellence in music. They continue to awe and amaze me by their willing to stand up and be counted as arts supporters. This endeavor would not be possible without exceptional leadership - Mrs. Sarah Mason Barratt and Mr. Jason Vislosky have been champions of this program rebuild, along with the entire Marlette Board of Education, led by President Jaime Macumber.

From the bottom of my heart, and on behalf of the students of Marlette, I thank all of you.",5.0,"Marlette Bands

Just curious, (and please share this post as much as your heart desires) but are there any instruments out there in the community that need a home? We are searching for playable instruments that have been sitting around that you don't need. Currently looking for donations to replace and add to our inventory. It's in BAD shape. If you have something you don't need anymore that you could give to the school, or even monetary donations that could aid in the replacing of our basic inventory, the kids would benefit immensely. Woodwinds, brass, strings...anything would help. We can provide a tax donation slip for any donations given.",14.0,"Marlette Bands

Hello friends - two things:

1) If you're studious and have been checking the calendar on the website, you'll notice that this Thursday I had planned the meet and greet. It's too soon to get everything ready so look for an alternate date coming soon. I will also include that in the mailing, going out this week.

2) We have a few parents graciously volunteering to handle some items that I can't do alone - food for band camp, uniform fitting, and getting kids water. Andrea Foster needs some help, as do I!

Any other parents, grandparents, or friends of the band willing to help do a few items for band camp? It will be August 17-21st. I will let them talk more about it on the thread below. PLEASE (*you can't see me, but I'm kneeling*) help if you are able. The kids were handling a lot of organization last year. They need your help so all they have to do is focus on learning and getting the show ready.

1) If you're studious and have been checking the calendar on the website, you'll notice that this Thursday I had planned the meet and greet. It's too soon to get everything ready so look for an alternate date coming soon. I will also include that in the mailing, going out this week.

2) We have a few parents graciously volunteering to handle some items that I can't do alone - food for band camp, uniform fitting, and getting kids water. Andrea Foster needs some help, as do I!

Any other parents, grandparents, or friends of the band willing to help do a few items for band camp? It will be August 17-21st. I will let them talk more about it on the thread below. PLEASE (*you can't see me, but I'm kneeling*) help if you are able. The kids were handling a lot of organization last year. They need your help so all they have to do is focus on learning and getting the show ready.

We have received many questions asking when and where families will be receiving P-EBT benefits for eligible students that received free or reduced price school meals.

It is not possible for us to tell you an exact date when you will receive these benefits. P-EBT benefits are being issued and cards are being mailed on an ongoing basis through mid-May.

Who is receiving these benefits? Students that are eligible for free or reduced price school meals will receive P-EBT benefits. This includes eligible students ages 5-18, as well as students under the age of 5 in early childhood education programs (such as Headstart and GSRP) and students ages 19- 26 enrolled in special education programs. This also includes students that attend schools where all students receive free school meals.

I hope you and your families are staying healthy and safe. I know that with school closing, many of you who wanted to order a yearbook probably did not get a chance to do so. Even with the school closing, we will still have a completed yearbook to commemorate your year.

I will still be able to take yearbook orders over the next couple of weeks. Just email me and let me know if you want a book. If you and your parents are able to pay now, that would be great. Checks can be made out to Marlette Community Schools and sent to my home address

Probably not, and part of that has to do with kids all over you at all times, demanding to be entertained while you’re working from home, trying to homeschool, or just trying to have a thought in your head.

Updated DC Trip Cookie Dough Fundraiser:
We have just received word from Savory Foods (the manager of the current Marlette DC Trip cookie dough fundraiser) that they will be unable to provide online options for ordering, despite previous reports. Understandably, the company is completely overwhelmed at the moment, and we are trying to get those orders completed as conveniently as possible for everyone.

If you have orders that you need to turn in for the DC Trip cookie dough fundraiser, you may mail your orders directly to Mrs. George. She will make sure the orders get entered and credit is given to student accounts. Mrs. George's address is: 5834 S. Kingston Road, Clifford, MI 48727.

After the orders are placed, Mrs. George will be sure to give an approximate delivery date, and we will go from there.
Please be sure to contact her at bgeorge@marletteschools.org if you have ANY questions at all.

Stay safe!

Hello Marlette Business Professionals of America (BPA) members. As you are all aware of this weekend would have been the BPA State Competition. In fact today would have been the Final Award Ceremony. This is the first BPA state competition I've missed in my teaching career. As disappointed as I am that I'm not there again this year, I am even more saddened about fact that those of you that worked so hard to get there are not going to have a chance to show your hard work at effort. To my seniors that are in their last year, remember the skills and abilities you've learned being in BPA and use them to your advantage in your next journey. To the rest of the BPA members, remember this is just a temporary situation that will soon pass and you will have many more years to make memories and exceed at BPA. In honor of the 2019-2020 Marlette BPA chapter I am wearing my BPA shirt today to remind me of the amazing students we have at Marlette and the awards ceremony that I am sure would have made us even more proud to be a Red Raider.",2.0,"Students, share your pic in the comments. ❤️ #RedRaiderNation #MarletteBPA

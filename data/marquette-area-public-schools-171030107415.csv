Bothwell Families,

We decided to create two different videos to help our students and families have better insight on the upcoming school year. Though we understand that most of our 7th and 8th graders know the layout of our building, we felt obligated to develop a virtual orientation for our incoming sixth-graders as well as those new to the district.

Furthermore, due to COVID-19, we created new procedures for lunch and recess. Our lunch/recess video tour will help our students understand those new procedures.

Please click below to view our videos.

Enjoy!

Let’s get excited about this outdoor learning space created by Mrs. Crunkleton, (with a little help from Mr. Crunkleton), one of our 6th grade science teachers.
How’s this for socially distanced learning in an authentic science setting?

Good afternoon Superior Hills Families,

I'd like to share two resources/links with you which I’m hoping will help you better understand our back-to-school plans for this coming school year. First, I'm happy to share a virtual town hall we're using as part of our open house this year. I'm so grateful for the help of our students, staff and parents for this pre-recorded video and hope you find it informative. The second resource, which is referenced multiple times in the town hall, is a website highlighting some of the more pertinent points of our back to school planning. Both resources can be found below:

We were proud to award $10,000 to support the Education Foundation for Marquette Public Schools 1st to Finish Childhood Savings Account Fund! This grant is awarded from the unrestricted, endowed Fund for Marquette and will support savings accounts for first graders in Marquette Area Public Schools.

Children’s Savings Accounts (CSAs) are long-term savings accounts that help all children and their families build savings for the future. To help accounts grow, account holders receive incentives such as initial deposits and savings matches from third parties. Family, friends and the children themselves also make contributions. The “1st to Finish” program will open a savings account in the name of each participating first grader. Funds can be used for any qualifying career or educational expenses after high school.

After hearing from parents, students and teachers, we decided to reschedule the parade for Monday, June 15 from 5:30-6:30pm. Many of our faculty and staff will be standing along Mesnard, Tierney, and Hampton Streets to wave you into summer!

Please see the attached map for the parade route. (You should enter Hampton Street, take a right onto Tierney Street, then a right onto Mesnard Street).

We’d like to remind you that this is a residential area. Please use caution, courtesy and care as you drive along the route.
It has been a long time since we have seen you. We hope you are able to make it next Monday.

MAHS would like to congratulate our Local scholarship recipients and Kaufman Award winner.

Ava Gillespie- Kaufman Award
Kya Beltran - Local Scholarship
Emily Hage- Local Scholarship
Taylor Peterson - Local Scholarship

As principal of Marquette Alternative High School I very much want to thank Marquette Area Public Schools Education Foundation for their continued dedication to students. I would also like to thank the Kaufman family for their endless work to better the future of our students.

I am not in the shared video but enjoyed zooming with our winners and I hope they know they have forever changed all of our lives for the better.

Also, thank you to my faculty and support staff for never wavering and never ceasing to offer love to our kiddos.

Being a parent right now can be (stressful, scary, overwhelming, frustrating, exhausting), but it can also be the best it's ever been. Make time to connect with your kids, as a family, every day. That's what our kids will remember about this time when they look back on it from the future. You've got this, parents. ❤️

One month ago today I had an idea.💡

I discovered a need that felt too big to fill alone.

1000 3D printed face shields were needed!
I knew my colleagues would help. And I have network marketing skills😎. So I went to work!

I had no idea it would grow into this.
The network grew so quickly. Makers from all over the region rallied. Word spread. People I never met before joined in and went full throttle towards our goal.

More organizations and businesses reached out for our help. 🙏
And even more stepped up to donate and support our work.💪

As of today this crew has turned in 4,151 3D printed face shields which were distributed all over the Upper Peninsula. And this graphic doesn't even show all the efforts around the U.P.! This is just the little effort that I sparked with a little social media magic. ❤️🙏

Frequently Asked Questions - School Closure COVID-19

Marquette Senior High School
April 2 at 2:04 PM ·

Governor Whitmer announced today that all K-12 schools in Michigan will close for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year. While there are many questions that remain, I would like to answer a few initial questions.

1) As required by the executive order, MSHS is developing a ""Continuity of Learning & COVID-19 Response Plan"" to ensure learning continues for all MSHS students during the closure. Details will be shared once the plan has been finalized.

2) Seniors, on track for graduation, will graduate this year. Details are being worked out for both seniors and underclassmen to advance. (Students will not have to make up the school year)

3) More information is available on our School Closure COVID-19 FAQ page at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J_3FwCpu8V3nvDlNtNyPez50rOVS_kRQsr1_p1zdfpI/edit?usp=sharing

March 22 at 8:35 PM ·

Mr. Pawlowski's 6th-grade sections have been creating an ongoing project throughout the 2019-20 school year. But, because the fourth quarter section of 6th graders has yet to participate in this project, it's not quite finished. However, we thought it would be a great time to share the in-progress results with you during this unprecedented time.

A little about the project - students were asked to make quick (5-10 seconds) clips to complete the statement ""At Bothwell We ______."" The results have been a combination of creative ideas of making words, collaborating with friends, stop-motion experiments, and more. Again, the project is not finished and we hope to add more to the video. I believe Mr. Pawloski stated it perfectly when he said, ""Although it's not finished, I think it still does a lot to remind us that Bothwell is more than a physical place, it is a community that stretches beyond the building walls.""

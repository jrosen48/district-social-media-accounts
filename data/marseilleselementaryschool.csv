The Marseilles Police Dept. is currently investigating a report of an attempt to lure a minor into a vehicle, last night, in the area of Capris Ln. and Broadway St. The person allegedly offered the minor a ride but did not get out of the vehicle. When the minor refused and left, the vehicle drove away. A Facebook post is being circulated stating a vehicle/person with the same description was also reported in Mendota and/or Princeton. Both departments stated that there have been NO reports involving this vehicle or person. We caution the sharing of this type of information without verifying it with local authorities. Please call the Marseilles Police Department at 815-795-2131 with any questions. We will provide updates as available. Thanks and Be Safe!",2020-08-15 15:44:52,,

EVERY PERSON COUNTS!
For every person who doesn't fill out the census, the City of Marseilles loses $1400/yr. Only 65% of Marseilles have completed the census. Estimating a population of 5000, that means 1750 have not completed the census. The numbers below show how much not getting counted can cost Marseilles each year along with the total loss over the 10 years until the next census. PLEASE COMPLETE THE CENSUS AT:

I wanted to share these resources that I put together for LaSalle County. You're more likely to encounter someone having a mental health crisis than you are someone having a heart attack, so it is so important to have these resources handy in the time of a crisis. If you don't save them for yourself, please at least save them as a resource to give to a friend or loved one who may need them one day. No problem is too big or too small to talk about. Even the strongest of people could use a little help once in a while. Please find the strength to take that first step to bettering yourself, the world needs you here. #YourStoryIsntOver

Community members, Pirate Nation invites you to participate in Bright the Night: A Community Graduation Celebration. Let's join together to celebrate ALL GRADUATES from the community. This includes both high schools, all feeder schools, and any college graduates. Every one of these students deserves our support and acknowledgement of their tremendous achievement. Please see the attached flier for a break down of each day. We will open and close the week by lighting up the town for all graduates. We encourage all community members and businesses to participate. Decorate with the colors of your school or put up some lights and hearts. During the week, we invite each school to participate in online acknowledgement of their graduates as well. Please watch our page for more information during that week and please share!!!",2020-05-11 16:12:50,,

We will also provide meals with the next batch coming the week of April 27 along with new paper packets that week if you are in need.

We will continue to update you as we receive more guidance from the Illinois State Board of Education but please know that students will not be retained to the same grade by us or “punished” in any way. We truly want to focus on how we can help our families as we process this news together.

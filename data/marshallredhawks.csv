While people are waiting outside, MHS staff will hand out their technology agreement form so parents can review and sign it before entering the building. This will greatly reduce the wait time, since this was the main culprit of our log jam. Taking the student picture, logging on to a computer, and getting books and schedules was a reasonable wait time and does not require any adjustments.

You have the power to choose.
At MPS, we know there is not just ONE right answer to what school should look like this fall; that's why we are offering our 2,700 students and their families the option to return to the physical building or to select a virtual-only option. If you are ready to make the decision to enroll in virtual-only, you can use the link below. If you would like to hear more about your options, tune in to the July 20th board meeting at 7:00p. Either way, there are two things that are important for you to remember: that you have the power to choose and that we are here to help.

We also plan to have a program printed and sent home to each graduate as a keepsake. Our hope and expectation is that this recognition will be a great placeholder until such time we can convene an in-person, traditional commencement ceremony for our graduates and their families.

If you do not ride a bus, you are expected to stay in class.

Students who drive - be sure to completely remove all snow and ice from all windows so you have clear visibility while driving. DRIVE SLOWLY and give more space than usual between moving vehicles.

ALL AFTER SCHOOL EVENTS/PRACTICES ARE CANCELLED.
The only EXCEPTION is an OPTIONAL Swim Team Practice.

CACC students will ride the 3:10 p.m. bus home from the HS (their usual time).

NO BUS SHUTTLES AVAILABLE TODAY.

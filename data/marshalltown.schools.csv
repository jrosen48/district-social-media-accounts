Esperamos que continúen recuperándose bien de la tormenta del 10 de agosto. Aquí hay una actualización sobre dónde nos encontramos como Distrito hoy, lunes 24 de agosto:

- Todos los edificios del Distrito, excepto dos, están abiertos al público. La Escuela Primaria Woodbury y la Oficina de Transporte del Distrito aún experimentan desafíos con el poder eléctrico y acceso a Internet.

- El personal de la Primaria Woodbury trabajará para responder a los correos electrónicos tanto como sea posible. Sin embargo, no podrán responder llamadas directas a Woodbury debido a problemas con el sistema telefónico, y devolverán mensajes de voz cuando sea posible.

- Se puede contactar a la Oficina de Transporte por correo electrónico, pero el sistema telefónico no funciona en ese edificio ahora.

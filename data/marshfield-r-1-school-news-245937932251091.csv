All Marshfield R-I students will begin receiving FREE breakfast and lunch beginning on Friday 9/11 due to a USDA waiver.

The USDA Federal Summer Food Service Program has been extended through December 30 or until federal money is no longer available. Our school district is thankful to be able to offer this program as allowed by the Department of Health and Senior Services and USDA for our students and families.

Any lunch money already paid for meal accounts will remain on the student's account for when this program is discontinued.

Even though meals are free, it is very important that families turn in completed Free and Reduced Lunch forms for this school year. These forms are necessary for our school to continue to qualify for many of our meal programs, including Summer Food Service Program and and our free after school super snack program.

Dear Private/Parochial/Homeschool Provider:
A meeting will be held with representatives of private schools including home schools that serve students with
disabilities residing within the Marshfield R-1 School District. The Marshfield Board of Education made a
policy decision that we will provide services equivalent to the “proportionate share” calculation for those
disabled students.
This meeting will be held for the purpose of consultation. This consultation will include such topics as the
child find process, proportionate share, the provision of special education and related services that will be
provided, and annual count. Evaluation of the services will also need to be addressed.
This meeting will be held on Thursday, October 1, 2020 via Google Meet (https://meet.google.com/jxq-buurkkq). I will be available to answer questions from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. through the link. If you have any
questions, please feel free to contact Melynda Van Note, Director of Special Services.
Sincerely,

We hate to sound cliché, but we are so thankful to be “BACK IN THE SADDLE”! The events that started last March have been a real “BEE IN OUR BONNET”. At times, it has been an “UPHILL BATTLE”. However, Bluejays are “ALL FOR ONE AND ONE FOR ALL”. We knew that “EVERY CLOUD HAS ITS SILVER LINING” and so we “PUT THE PEDAL TO THE METAL”. They say, “ABSENCE MAKES THE HEART GROW FONDER”, and no doubt that is true. Students are the “APPLE OF OUR EYE”, and we sure did miss them. We spent the summer getting our “DUCKS IN A ROW”, “IRONING OUT THE KINKS”, “WORKING ALL THE BUGS OUT” and “FINE TUNING” this Bluejay Machine. You can “BET YOUR BOTTOM DOLLAR” that we have heard and appreciated the encouragement of our families. While this year has been a “HORSE OF A DIFFERENT COLOR”, we are so thankful for the wonderful week #1 in Bluejay Country! #MJaysConquer",3.0,"Marshfield Schools

Blue Jay Families,

I wanted to share a brief update on the positive COVID case announced yesterday evening involving a K-5 summer school instructor. After consulting further with the health department, we have been informed that the individual is experiencing mild symptoms. Because of this, the students in that classroom will be under a health department quarantine. All families have been notified of this by the school district, so if you have not received a call your child is not affected.

We will continue to work with the Webster County Health Unit to keep our students and staff healthy.

Sincerely,

David Steward, Superintendent",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1703116046533265&id=245937932251091,,0.0,"July 14, 2020

Students may only travel to permanent addresses listed during online registration. There will be NO after school notes accepted for students traveling to addresses parents have not previously listed for their child during online registration. If you would like to list an address in case of emergency after school, please do so during online registration under ""PM2 Address."" Rather than listing days of the week, you will list ""OCCAS."" In the event that your student needs to travel to that address, you will either send a note to school with your child or call the building office.

This program is through the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society and they are working as a team (Team Beimakkusu) to raise money for the organization. They would like to reach out to the community to ask for support with their goal of raising $10,000.

If our Bluejays are able to raise the most money, they will earn a $5000 scholarship! There will be an award ceremony on April 23 to recognize all the teams in the program. We are very excited to help support these students in this unique leadership building program. Please see the attached letter.

Good evening!
1st semester finals were scheduled for this Thursday and Friday, with a review session to be held tomorrow to help students prepare. Obviously, Mother Nature had other ideas, so we have to modify our plans. We want to be fair and make decisions that are in the best educational interest of our students. With that in mind, Mr. Curley has asked teachers to make modifications to finals, which may include reducing the content on the final or forgoing a final altogether so that students can finish papers/projects/presentations. Students should monitor their email and/or Google classroom accounts over the next day, as teachers MAY be emailing classes with more detailed information.

Enjoy what we HOPE is the last snow day this semester!

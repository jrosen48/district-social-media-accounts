If you want to order a yearbook (you must preorder...there will be no extras ordered) or buy a dedication for a student, you can pick up an order form in the office at school. Most kids got one to bring home today (not 5th grade, though...they were partying until the bell rang! lol)
If you own or run a business, please consider buying an ad! If you would like to, please message me and I will personally bring you a form!

Last year was the first year in 6 years that we had a yearbook and it was a great success thanks to the parents and businesses! Thank you all and I hope this years is even better!""",2013-11-01 20:35:06,,

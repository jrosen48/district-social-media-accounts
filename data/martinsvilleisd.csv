Good morning everyone!

Hope everyone is enjoying their summer, but school is closing in. Mrs. Cobb will be doing the Floral Arrangement of the Month Club again and wanted to send the flyer out early!

Order forms and money will not be due until September 30th. The prices this year are for a 3 Month- $60 and for an 8 month- $120. If you need to pay it out until then we most certainly can be accommodating.

I have attached the flyer that you can print out and bring to the office or at meet the teacher. The money and order form must be turned in together and can be turned into the front office or to me. Enjoy the few days you have left and we look forward to seeing everyone when school starts! Also don't forget to consider us if you need floral work done. And if you have any old vases laying around you don't need, we recycle!

SummerStageFestival featured student of the day is Senior Alli Beck who is appearing in the musical The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee in the role of Olive Ostrovsky, and in The Reluctant Dragon as ½ of the Dragon. Alli is a BFA Acting Major.

What is your favorite part of being in this show?: My favorite part of Reluctant is the movement and acrobatics of being the dragon. My favorite of Putnam is the singing and humor.

What is the most challenging part of being in the show?: The most challenging part of Reluctant is puppeteer-ing a dragon and acting without facial expressions.

Why should people come see the show?: Because they're both going to be SO much fun!

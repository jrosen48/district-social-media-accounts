We are diligently working on plans for the new school year. We are still waiting on guidance from TEA on what safety measures must be followed, but we do know that we will open for the 2020-2021 school year.
However, parents that choose to keep their students at home out of COVID-19 concerns will be able to. A remote learning experience will be provided in that situation. In order to help us plan, we need to get an estimate on how many families are considering that option. We realize that you will need much more information before making a final decision, but if you plan on keeping your students at home and participating in remote learning, please email your campus principal with your student's name and grade level.

Due to guidance and regulations provided by the State of Texas and TEA, the Mart High School Graduation ceremony for the Class of 2020 will be held on Friday, June 5 at 8pm. The ceremony will take place in-person on the football field. In order to plan appropriate social distancing measures, we need to attempt to get a count of those guests who wish to attend in person. Please submit the form below to help us with this count. The more accurate the count, the better we can plan for a smooth evening. The ceremony will also be live streamed and recorded in order to encourage only close family and friends to attend in person. This will also allow those in high risk populations to view from home.

It is with great sadness that we announce that we will not be returning to campus for school this year. Governor Abbott issued the statewide decision early this afternoon. While we miss our students and colleagues terribly, we realize that the health and safety of our communities comes first. We will continue with our remote learning plan as scheduled through May 1, and arrange for the remaining 3 weeks of instruction on May 4. Decisions on other end of year activities will be released as they are made. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us if your family needs anything. We love you and wish you the best during this time of separation.

**MHS LADY PANTHERS**
I have set up a Google Classroom designed to get workouts to you. Hopefully you will take advantage of this and not lose all of the progress and momentum gained in strength & conditioning. This week's workouts are already posted and ready for you to complete. These will be designed to do at home with no weights. If you do have access to weights and want a more traditional workout let me know and I will get something to you. If you have any questions let me know!

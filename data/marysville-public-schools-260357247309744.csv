On a side note, the District would like to thank all its food service employees and director, Pam Heintz, for working throughout the months of the COVID-19 pandemic.

""We just love Mrs Sawdon. She has worked with two of my sons and they both adore her. She makes speech fun. My youngest son turned 5 last month. He was very disappointed that his birthday party with all of his friends was cancelled. Mrs Kristen went out of her way to make it special for him (quarantine style) by popping over to say “happy birthday” with a balloon drop off on our front porch. He instantly had a smile on his face and had to tell everyone he talked to what she had done. This among so many other things make her amazing ❤️ Thank you Mrs Kristen for loving my boys and looking out for them ❤️""

With Mr. Lobb's patience, communication, and assistance he and Mrs. Corbat have put together a comprehensive and somewhat easy program to follow and supervise. We are not teachers, and find the job daunting. Mr. Lobb has gone way over and above to help those of us regaled to administrating the program to our children (grandchildren) understand his direction and gives assistance whenever needed to help get the learning out to the children. Without teachers like Mr. Lobb, we parents (grandparents) would be totally lost. Thank you for all you do!!""

Tonight's Pink Out games kick off at 4:00 pm. With the Freshman boys playing Madison and the Freshman girls play Lakeshore.

This will be followed by the JV teams at 5:30 and the Varsity at 7:00. Marysville JV and Varsity girls will be playing Marine City, while the JV and Varsity boys will play Madison.

Twenty-two robotics teams participated in this very successful event!

The competition consisted of 4 areas of judging: Knowledge and Implementation of the programs Core Values, Robot Design, the Innovation Research project, and the Robot Competition Field.

Two teams from Morton Elementary, the Mini Vi-Bots, and the Micro Vi-Bots, had a very productive and rewarding day. Both teams completed the competition in good standings. The Mini Vi-Bots received the Research Award for their Innovation Project presentation of installing Street Lights on the on/off ramps of I-94 at the Marysville Exit. This also provided the team an invitation to compete at the FIRST Lego League State Competitions in West Bloomfield on December 14th!

Dr. Wightman was the guest speaker and introduced the second habit of the program to everyone which is, ""To begin with the End in Mind"".

The ""Leader in Me"" program, in conjunction with Gardens' Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports (PBIS) model, helps students build character by offering practical strategies that bring social and academic learning together for students throughout their day. This approach is supported through continual teaching, modeling and the promotion of positive behavior, creating a climate of greater productivity, safety, and learning.

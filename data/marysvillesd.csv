Wanting to help your children become thoughtful, informed, and BRAVE about race? Make space for your child's respective curiosity. Let your child know that itâs okay to notice skin color and talk about race, whether with respect to toys, characters in books, or in the world. Encourage her to share thoughts, feelings, and experiences by asking questions of her and welcoming her questions. If she makes a negative racial comment, ask, non judgmentally, What makes you say that?

The staff of Liberty Elementary School recently paraded around their local neighborhood holding signs of positive messaging for students and families. Some signs say âwe miss youâ and others say âwe love youâ.

Liberty teachers shared the parade routes in their respective Google Classrooms to inform students of the event.

The Liberty staff would like you to remember that âLiberty loves you always and we will get through this togetherâ.

This week in our discussion with loved ones, we should focus on the people in our lives whose connection brings us warmth. Although we may not be fostering as much in-person connection at this time, we can still reach out to friends and family members to let them know how much they mean to us. Is there anyone that comes to mind that you may want to reach out to? Can be in your home or far away. Although we may not be able to share company with many people at this time, we can still reach out and show them we care.

This week in our discussions with loved ones, we should focus on how we show others we still value them even from apart. Although we may be working from home or separated from friends and relatives, we can show others that we appreciate their presence in our lives. What things do you value in someone when you are separated? How do you show someone you value them from a distance? Showing someone you value them allows you to connect more than you could before.

This week we want to focus on how well we connect with each other, especially in these times of unknowing. How often do you give someone your undivided attention? Giving someone your focus to understand their point of view is a great way to get to know someone from their perspective.

The RAP program is offered to students interested in gaining pre-apprenticeship skills in the areas of carpentry, electrical, and labor. Students will gain valuable transferable skills leading to industry certification, college credit and certification as well as preferred entry into a professional apprenticeship. High school students will learn alongside students from surrounding districts as well as college students offering higher engagement in real-world career-focused instruction. Students will spend an extended period of time, participating in either a morning or afternoon session (3 periods per day) on projects allowing for deeper levels of understanding and experiential learning. Previous construction coursework or experience is advantageous but not required.

Wanting to help your children become thoughtful, informed, and BRAVE about race? Make space for your child's respective curiosity. Let your child know that it’s okay to notice skin color and talk about race, whether with respect to toys, characters in books, or in the world. Encourage her to share thoughts, feelings, and experiences by asking questions of her and welcoming her questions. If she makes a negative racial comment, ask, non judgmentally, What makes you say that?

Cinco de Mayo, or the fifth of May, is a holiday that celebrates the date of the Mexican army’s May 5, 1862 victory over France at the Battle of Puebla during the Franco-Mexican War.

While it is a relatively minor holiday in Mexico, in the United States, Cinco de Mayo has evolved into a commemoration of Mexican culture and heritage, particularly in areas with large Mexican-American populations.

Earth Day was founded in 1970 as a day of education about environmental issues.

The holiday is now a global celebration that’s sometimes extended into Earth Week, a full seven days of events focused on green living. The brainchild of Senator Gaylord Nelson and inspired by the protests of the 1960s, Earth Day began as a “national teach-in on the environment” and was held on April 22 to maximize the number of students that could be reached on university campuses.

By raising public awareness of pollution, Nelson hoped to bring environmental causes into the national spotlight.

This week in our discussion with loved ones, we should focus on the people in our lives whose connection brings us warmth. Although we may not be fostering as much in-person connection at this time, we can still reach out to friends and family members to let them know how much they mean to us. Is there anyone that comes to mind that you may want to reach out to? Can be in your home or far away. Although we may not be able to share company with many people at this time, we can still reach out and show them we care.

This week in our discussions with loved ones, we should focus on how we show others we still value them even from apart. Although we may be working from home or separated from friends and relatives, we can show others that we appreciate their presence in our lives. What things do you value in someone when you are separated? How do you show someone you value them from a distance? Showing someone you value them allows you to connect more than you could before.

To continue our valuable discussions with our loved ones, this week we have another conversation starter for you all! This week we want to focus on how well we connect with each other, especially in these times of unknowing. How often do you give someone your undivided attention? Giving someone your focus to understand their point of view is a great way to get to know someone from their perspective.

Irista is a Heritage High School student who is taking art classes at Legacy High School. Her artwork recently made it into the Scholastic Art Show hosted at the Schack Art Center in Everett.

Below is Irista's artist statement:

""The earth around us speaks to me. It shows me beauty within the darkness. It shows me everything I know. I naturally gather ideas then piece them together. It appears in my head so fast like a snowball rolling down a mountain. Just getting bigger and becoming unstoppable. I try to capture everything I see, something that holds value. Certain individuals have a strong impression on me, and that in turn inspires me in my art. I want to display all the smiles and the people that make me happy.""

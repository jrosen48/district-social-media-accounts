Please remember that pick ups are Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 8-10 am. If you cannot get here until a bit after please text me, 325 218-2659 and I will be happy to have them ready for you.

Please stop by and see us and get some meals for your kiddos, it is such a pleasure for us to be able to provide this service to our families. Everything is individually wrapped and microwave ready to make things a bit easier and to supplement the groceries that you are able to get. It is perfect for grandparents and babysitters.

I want to let everyone know that we Really appreciate everyone who takes the time to come pick up meals. We realize that it takes a bit of your valuable time to do this BUT we really are happy to see you and know that we are doing a little part in helping out our families.

Please remember that pick ups are Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 8-10 am. If you cannot get here until a bit after please text me, 325 218-2659 and I will be happy to have them ready for you.

Please stop by and see us and get some meals for your kiddos, it is such a pleasure for us to be able to provide this service to our families. Everything is individually wrapped and microwave ready to make things a bit easier and to supplement the groceries that you are able to get. It is perfect for grandparents and babysitters. Also, for parents who are already Really busy!

This service is free to all children 18 and younger and they do not have to be enrolled at Mason ISD.

Together we are strong, we are Mason! Thanks to all. Take care and stay safe! Julie Parker",2020-04-21 11:59:51,,

Students, if you have left your chromebook or textbooks at school during the extended break you will need to come pick them up as you begin online instruction. Online instruction will begin on Monday of next week (March 23rd) so you need to make sure that you have what you need to complete the work.

The building will only have one door open, the double doors by the auditorium, and nobody will be allowed inside the building. We will have a staff member at the door that will go to your locker or classroom to get the things that you need. Again, nobody will be allowed inside the building.

Times for picking up chromebooks / textbooks:
Thursday: 1pm - 3:30pm
Friday: 8am - 12pm

Thanks for your understanding and patience,",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3074494339249038&id=210919582273209,,0.0,"From Coach Burns:
Students, if you have left your chromebook or textbooks at school during the extended break you will need to come pick them up as you begin online instruction. Online instruction will begin on Monday of next week (March 23rd) so you need to make sure that you have what you need to complete the work.

The building will only have one door open, the double doors by the auditorium, and nobody will be allowed inside the building. We will have a staff member at the door that will go to your locker or classroom to get the things that you need. Again, nobody will be allowed inside the building.

Times for picking up chromebooks / textbooks:
Thursday: 1pm - 3:30pm
Friday: 8am - 12pm

If you can't make it to the high school during these times or have a question then please call the office at 325-347-1122 ext 221.

Please encourage students to wash hands frequently throughout the day. This is the single best action that we can do to prevent illnesses. (There are some great YouTube videos for the little ones to watch before practicing.)
Do NOT come to school with a fever of 100.4 or more within the past 24 hours. This is without the use of fever reducing medications. You are at a greater risk of getting sicker and others are at a greater risk of you spreading the illness to them.
Keep unwashed hands away from your eyes, nose, and mouth. Use a tissue when available and dispose it properly.
When coughing, turn your head away from people AND cough into your elbow . Praise students for using correct germ etiquette. To decrease your risk of illness, it is best to avoid drinking and eating after your friends/family. We can all do our part to help clean our areas.

Deep in the heart of Texas lies a historic high school stadium known as the PuncherDome.

The PuncherDome has some of the greenest grass in all of Texas in an area surrounded by brown terrain.

The Mason Punchers get the pleasure to play on this field thanks to maintenance hero Alfred Menchaca.

Please encourage students to wash hands frequently throughout the day. This is the single best action that we can do to prevent illnesses. (There are some great YouTube videos for the little ones to watch before practicing.)
Do NOT come to school with a fever of 100.4 or more within the past 24 hours. This is without the use of fever reducing medications. You are at a greater risk of getting sicker and others are at a greater risk of you spreading the illness to them.
Keep unwashed hands away from your eyes, nose, and mouth. Use a tissue when available and dispose it properly.
When coughing, turn your head away from people AND cough into your elbow . Praise students for using correct germ etiquette. To decrease your risk of illness, it is best to avoid drinking and eating after your friends/family. We can all do our part to help clean our areas.

They will receive a precious back pack with a free book inside. For every 25 books read, they can bring back their reading log and receive a beautiful new book! Hopefully this will get books into homes! So, if you or anyone you know has a child in this age group find the booth and sign up! They will also be working with Steady Steps and Head Start.

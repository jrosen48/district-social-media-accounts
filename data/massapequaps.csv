Once a fictional game in the “Harry Potter” book series, Quidditch is now very much a real activity, and one that students look forward to in physical education classes at Unqua Elementary School.

The three-week Quidditch unit goes beyond the game that students play in the gymnasium, and instead is a school spirit competition. Everyone participates, kindergarten through fifth grade, and they are assigned to represent one of four houses from “Harry Potter” – Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin. Students are encouraged to wear the colors of their respective houses on physical education days.

During a match, five players from each team take the court. The chasers score can score points by picking up red balls, known as Quaffles, and getting through the hula hoops that are guarded by a keeper. Other students are assigned to be beaters, who can freeze opponents from other teams. Players can also score points for team spirit, good sportsmanship and finding the golden snitch hidden inside the gym.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1017815445247047&id=268688153493117,,0.0,"Playing as Wizards and Witches at Unqua

Once a fictional game in the “Harry Potter” book series, Quidditch is now very much a real activity, and one that students look forward to in physical education classes at Unqua Elementary School.

The three-week Quidditch unit goes beyond the game that students play in the gymnasium, and instead is a school spirit competition. Everyone participates, kindergarten through fifth grade, and they are assigned to represent one of four houses from “Harry Potter” – Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin. Students are encouraged to wear the colors of their respective houses on physical education days.

During a match, five players from each team take the court. The chasers score can score points by picking up red balls, known as Quaffles, and getting through the hula hoops that are guarded by a keeper. Other students are assigned to be beaters, who can freeze opponents from other teams. Players can also score points for team spirit, good sportsmanship and finding the golden snitch hidden inside the gym.",2020-02-12 10:09:38,,

What’s a better way to think outside of the box then transforming a box? That was the challenge for fourth grade students in the Magnet program at Lockhart Elementary School, who had to turn ordinary cardboard boxes into anything they imagined.

Magnet and STEAM teacher Joanne Markowski said that the activity began by reading “Not a Box” by Antoniette Portis. From there, each student looked as his or her cardboard box as a blank canvas. They transformed boxes into objects such as cars, couches and radios, and landmarks such as the Empire State Building and Mount Everest. One student used an extra-large box and made a doghouse.

Gingerbread cookies were the subject of a holiday-themed science experiment at Fairfield Elementary School as kindergartners and fifth graders worked together to analyze the effects of different liquids on the sweets.

Fifth graders in Margaret Meininger’s class partnered with kindergartners in Melanie Bonagura’s class for the scientific study. Since the older students have conducted several experiments over the years, they were able to guide their younger peers through the scientific process, including making predictions and recording observations.

Each group put one gingerbread cookie into a cup of oil and another into a cup of milk. Students then checked back 15 minutes later to see which liquid caused more of the cookie to dissolve, using magnifying glasses to get a close-up look. During their wait, the buddies read holiday books together and enjoyed the extra gingerbread cookies as a snack.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=971934359835156&id=268688153493117,,0.0,"Fairfield Fifth Graders Lead Gingerbread Experiment

With Thanksgiving approaching, turkeys were in disguise at Unqua Elementary School and they had a little help from students.

Second graders took paper turkeys and created elaborate designs to give the birds new identities, including as athletes, doctors, superheroes and even a Christmas tree. Additionally, the students completed persuasive writing pieces about why their turkeys shouldn't be eaten on Thanksgiving.

In fifth grade classrooms, students completed a similar project with the help of technology. Using Google Slides on their Chromebooks, they also had to create turkeys in costumes and write accompanying stories explaining the reason for the disguise. Students had lots of graphics at their disposal to make turkeys that were hardly recognizable.

Sixth graders at Berner Middle School explored these ancient writings to understand how people communicated thousands of years ago and how historians have used these etchings to better understand the culture.

Social studies teacher Vanessa Canning noted that the sixth grade curriculum focuses on ancient civilizations. She wants her students to understand why writing is important because it preserves history for future generations.

Ms. Canning explained that Cuneiform, the writing system adopted by the ancient Sumerians, used a system of characters instead of letters and the hundreds of wedge-shaped marks were cut into damp clay tablets.

Magnet and STEAM teacher Jennifer Tand wrote down eight names — four male and four female — on sticky notes, as well as eight popular Thanksgiving food items. Children read through the clues, which not only hinted at what food people liked or disliked, but who should be sitting next to each other. For example, no two males sat side-by-side, and the host had to be at the head of the table, but couldn’t be near the corn.

Throughout October, students in Ms. Kelly’s class worked together with their peers in several others classes at Birch Lane to create fall- and Halloween-themed artwork. The completed pieces were affixed to large white paper, and Ms. Kelly, Assistant Principal Joyce Larkin and several students visited Parkview afterschool to deliver the murals. Students were able to meet many of the seniors who will get to enjoy their work.

A famous painting by legendary artist Vincent van Gogh was the inspiration for a geography lesson in Kimberly Kelly’s third grade class at Birch Lane Elementary School.

Students participated in a See, Think, Wonder activity based on the painting, “Wheatfield With Crows.” Using the thinking routine, children made careful observations and thoughtful interpretations. They identified which of the five themes of geography they felt the painting best represented: place, location, region, movement or human-environment interaction.

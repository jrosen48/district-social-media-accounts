MaST's goal is to receive 1,000 signatures toward a city-wide goal of over 10,000 signatures from charter school advocates and supporters.

Parents and Community Members,
Governor Wolf recently announced his intent to cut $280 million from charter school budgets next year. This would have a disastrous impact on the quality of program we can offer our students. We would have to make tough decisions and cut hundreds of thousands of dollars from our school budget. We need to demand that the Governor and our Philadelphia legislators remember that our students are just as deserving as every other public school student in our state. It is unfair to de-fund charter schools in order to give more money to district schools. We can‚Äôt let this happen.

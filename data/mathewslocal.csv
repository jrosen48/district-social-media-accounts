Friends of Mustangs Care! Our food donations have been down this winter. We have 13 weeks left of back pack meals this school year. We are currently serving 57 students at Mathews.

We were wondering if anyone wouldn’t mind picking up a few extra items for us next time you go grocery shopping?

We’ve compiled an ALDI and Sam’s Club price list of our most needed items right now. If you shop either of these stores, please take a look and see if you could donate these items!

Donations can be dropped off in our donation box at Cortland Bank - Vienna Branch (4434 Warren Sharon Rd) or message us for alternate drop off arrangements.

1.Make a gingerbread house - the kids will love eating it and if you make it from scratch, your house will smell amazing!

2. Take a walk or drive to tour the holiday lights nearby.

3. DIY birdfeeder. Let the kiddos find a pine cone. Lather it in peanut butter and roll it in birdseed. Hang it outside the window and sit back and watch!

4. Go caroling at a local nursing home. This will bless the elderly and the kids as well as they experience giving to others.

5. Make popcorn and candy garland and decorate the tree!

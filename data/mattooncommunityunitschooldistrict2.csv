Drew Banks, owner of Lee’s Famous Recipe, wanted Mattoon High School seniors to graduate without having school lunch debt so he donated funds to MHS to eliminate the debt.
Banks, a Mattoon High School Class of 2009 alumnus, said when the closures were mandated by the state in March, he started offering free dinners at Lee Famous Recipe for students in kindergarten-12 grades for about two weeks. During the time Lee offered the free meals, Banks said they had customers offering donations to help support the program.
“I really appreciated them wanting to donate and give back to the community,” said Banks.
Banks decided to match their donations dollar for dollar. He donated money to the high school to pay the remainder of senior high school students’ lunch debt.

Hello Maud School families!

We are writing to let you know about an important resource to help families during the pandemic.
If your child was eating free or reduced-price lunch school lunch in March 2020, you are eligible for
food purchasing assistance of $250 per eligible child!

The Oklahoma Department of Human Services will be sending Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer
benefits, or P-EBT, to eligible families – you do not need to apply. If you already have an EBT card the
benefits will be loaded on your existing card. If you do not currently have an EBT card, please look out
for a P-EBT card in the mail.

Watch closely as the outside envelope may not clearly say P-EBT.

P-EBT is provided to any child who was receiving free or reduced-price school lunch in March 2020.
It will not impact your citizenship or immigration status.

To learn more, visit www.hungerfreeok.org/pebt.
Thank you!

For our children:

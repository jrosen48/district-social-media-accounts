Ms. West’s 9th grade English class kicked off their Shakespeare unit with a guest speaker today. Conor Mullen, a theater artist, came to talk to students about weapons and violence in Shakespeare’s plays. Mr. Mullen, who trained with Shakespeare & Company, is the founding member of Dispatch Combat Collective, an organization that seeks to make stage combat more accessible and safe for working actors. He spoke with the students about the importance of safety and repeat-ability when choreographing stage combat. He also noted that a fight scene is placed in a production not for the sake of violence, but to enrich the story line. Ms. West was excited to welcome Mr. Mullen into the classroom, saying that the presentation will enhance the student’s understanding of the more violent scenes of Romeo and Juliet, which they will be starting next week.",0.0,"Mount Anthony Union High School added 4 new photos.

High School Art Teacher Liz Howe has partnered with Bennington College senior Michelle Freeman to offer pottery workshops for student, faculty, and staff. The fruits of their labor won’t be tchotchkes on a shelf though – Ms. Howe and Michelle are teaching students and staff a variety of ceramic techniques to make bowls for the upcoming Empty Bowls Soup Dinner, hosted by the Greater Bennington Interfaith Community Services.

Though students have been working on the project for a while now, interested staff members took a workshop today, creating bowls to be donated. In total, the school will be donating approximately 60 bowls to the event. Ms. Howe hopes to make this an annual event at the high school to support the larger Bennington Community.

Thanks to everyone who made this year's Financial Reality Fair the best one yet, including the Workforce and Education Working Group, the Department of Labor, Southern Vermont College, and everyone who volunteered! Sophomores from MAUHS (along with their peers from Arlington High School) worked on budgeting to live within their means for their chosen careers, and had to consider some of the difficult choices they'll face upon entering the workforce. For the first time this year, the Wheel of Life was there to disrupt the students' otherwise flawless monthly budgets, sometimes with a flat tire or a chipped tooth, sometimes with a birthday windfall or tax refund. Check out our photos in this album, and see the article in the Bennington Banner (https://www.benningtonbanner.com/stories/students-learn-financial-lessons-through-game-playing,569815) to learn more!",2019-04-08 15:36:18,,

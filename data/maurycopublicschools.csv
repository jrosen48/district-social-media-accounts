Many school districts across the nation will be receiving Federal Grant money from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act. The CARES Act is a law intended to address the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. MCPS would like to make sure we use any money effectively when it comes to technology.

We need your help!

Below is a link to a short survey. By completing the survey, it will help us with decisions around funding for items like Distance Learning and Computer Device needs. Please complete the survey once for EVERY student in your household. For example, if you have 3 students we ask that you fill it out the form 3 times.

Thank you for your help and for taking a few minutes to complete this important survey.

When the name is drawn, the clock will begin ticking to 5 minutes. That senior selected will have no more than 5 minutes to call in and identify themselves.

We will verify the student, and, if they are good to go, they win the car! They can come to the dealership right then or wait. I want to give a BIG shout out to CDJRF owner Eddie Collier and Bre Burton who runs the program for CDJRF; they could have cancelled the program in light of everything that is going on, but, they love our kids and this community and are dedicated to see it through to the end, no matter what!

We are pleased to be partnering with McCanless Trucking in this effort. McCanless Trucking will have a dump truck parked in the teacher parking lot at Central High School. We are asking for cases of water to be donated. We will be collecting the water between 8:00 and 1:00 on Saturday, March 7th.

Special thanks to Mr. Dan Jaynes “The Voice” for all that you do for the band! Nobody does it better 🎙

The CHS Color Guard placed second in the Scholastic AA Division with another stellar show. It is amazing and inspirational to see the improvements our Guard achieve at every performance 🙌🏾

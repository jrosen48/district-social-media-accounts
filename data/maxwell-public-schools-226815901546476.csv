There are several changes that exist when we go to orange. That is outlined in our plan that was shared with everyone. The health department will announce tomorrow where the dial is currently at. With the recent outbreaks that have occurred in Lincoln County, it is prudent for everyone to have an understanding of what those changes will look like.

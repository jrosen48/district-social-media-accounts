Thank you to the Graves County Fiscal Court for approving the purchase of a UV light similar to what you see in the picture below. UV lights are proven to kill both viruses and bacteria. The light will be rotated between ambulances daily so that we can ensure a safer transport environment for our providers and patients. We were also able to purchase a handheld UV wand that can be used to sanitize PPE such as N95 masks. Less than 5 seconds of exposure to UV light from a distance of 2-3 inches is enough to kill any and all microbes on PPE. During a PPE crisis, reusing what we already have may be our only option. UV light technology can help us extend the life of what little supply we have on hand.

The lights were ordered yesterday, and we look forward to their delivery so we can immediately put them into use.",4.0,"Mayfield Fire Department & Mayfield-Graves EMS

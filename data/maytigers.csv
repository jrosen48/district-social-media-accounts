School Supplies Update

The final shopping for items that needed to be added to the list was completed this weekend. Thank you to everyone that volunteers to make our PTO awesome!

Mid-summer the PTO sent out over 200 letters to local businesses and churches in Brown county. Out of those letters we have received a response from 11.

There will be more news in the near future, our district is truly blessed.

Here is a list of community sponsors that helped make the school supply project possible. Please be sure to support them and thank them for their contribution.

North Lake Community Church
Ron and Elaine Keener
United Supermarkets
Demand Staff
May FBC
Waldrop Construction
F&M Bank
Mid-Tex FCU
Bostick's Auto & Truck Sales
Western Bank
ASAP Creative Arts

If you need help with the selection and/or purchasing process of your animal please contact Ms. Perkins as soon as possible. Or, if your student has never exhibited livestock before, but shows interest, get in touch with Ms. Perkins for more information about what all a livestock project will entail. Livestock projects are an excellent opportunity to teach students a variety of life skills such as responsibility, finances, character development, ownership, and so much more!

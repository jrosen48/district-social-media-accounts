Athletic fields across Mt. Blue Regional School District are now open for individual use and independent activities like: walking or running on the track; riding a bike; tossing a football, frisbee, lacrosse ball; batting or tossing a baseball; flying a kite; or playing tennis.

The partial reopening does NOT include: organized or group sports; or league or sport specific games or training events.

The health and safety of RSU 9 community members is crucial as the district focuses and plans to reopen schools in the fall. Therefore, those enjoying the facilities are expected to follow national and state CDC recommendations by maintaining a six-foot social distance from those not in your household and wearing a face covering if/when others are present. The district reserves the right to deny access to those not complying with the use expectations.

Athletic fields across Mt. Blue Regional School District are now open for individual use and independent activities like: walking or running on the track; riding a bike; tossing a football, frisbee, lacrosse ball; batting or tossing a baseball; flying a kite; or playing tennis.

The partial reopening does NOT include: organized or group sports; or league or sport specific games or training events.

The health and safety of RSU 9 community members is crucial as the district focuses and plans to reopen schools in the fall. Therefore, those enjoying the facilities are expected to follow national and state CDC recommendations by maintaining a six-foot social distance from those not in your household and wearing a face covering if/when others are present. The district reserves the right to deny access to those not complying with the use expectations.

Hello Yearbook buyers,

If you are not able to pick up the yearbook in person on Tuesday (6/23: 9am -12 noon), someone else of your family can pick it up, especially if they were the ones who ordered the book in the first place. But we do need to see an ID! We don't want to take the risk to give your yearbook to someone who claims it is for you, but who tries to get one for him/herself since all the yearbooks are sold out. So I hope you understand that we take these ID (and receipt for online orders) measurements in order to make sure that you will get your book.
Also: the person who will pick up the book needs to wear a face mask when approaching our table.

Good afternoon RSU 9 Community,

As you can imagine, the RSU 9 School Nutrition Program is operating at full speed. Since March 17, the second day of our district wide school closure, RSU 9’s school nutrition and other staff have prepared and packaged close to 15,000 breakfast and lunch meals for pick-up, drop-off, and door-to-door delivery by volunteer drivers to those who can’t make it to a pick-up location.

Due to the extremely high number of meals produced and distributed each day, last Friday’s delivery included the final weekend extra meal delivery we are able to provide. If necessary, we encourage you to use other community resources to fulfill your weekend needs.

It is important to note that the funding for these meals comes primarily from the USDA Child Nutrition Program which is for children, birth to age 19 only. Meals should not be ordered or picked up for adults. Your cooperation will help to ensure we can continue to serve meals to the children of our communities.

Warm Regards,

Good Evening,
I know we are all anxiously watching the news about the coronavirus, and you are probably wondering what RSU 9 is going to do so I wanted to send a quick update tonight.

Commissioner Makin held a virtual meeting with superintendents this afternoon, and I have been working with other superintendents most of the day to layout and consider all our options. We reviewed the state and national CDC recommendations for school closures (see attached) during these meetings.

Tomorrow morning I will participate in a virtual meeting of the Western Maine Superintendent Association and then decide on our next steps.

Please know that I am considering all options with the safety of our students and staff at the forefront. I will send another update tomorrow! Stay tuned!

Good Evening,
I know we are all anxiously watching the news about the coronavirus, and you are probably wondering what RSU 9 is going to do so I wanted to send a quick update tonight.

Commissioner Makin held a virtual meeting with superintendents this afternoon, and I have been working with other superintendents most of the day to layout and consider all our options. We reviewed the state and national CDC recommendations for school closures (see attached) during these meetings.

Tomorrow morning I will participate in a virtual meeting of the Western Maine Superintendent Association and then decide on our next steps.

Please know that I am considering all options with the safety of our students and staff at the forefront. I will send another update tomorrow! Stay tuned!

Warm regards,

Tina MeserveRSU 9

In the past 30 days, we’ve seen multiple shootings in Manchester. I'm outraged by the recent gun violence in our city and I want to reiterate that the safety of our residents and visitors, as well as our first responders, is our top priority.

As a result, Chief Capano has increased patrols throughout the city and is using evidence-based policing and hot spot patrol tactics. If anyone has any information about crimes occurring in the city, please contact MPD at 603-668-8711 or anonymously through the Crimeline at 603-624-4040.

And always, if you feel unsafe where you live, or if you have concerns about a friend or family member, there is help available. If you need help, call.",0.0,"Mayor Joyce Craig

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations. Reactions during an infectious disease outbreak
can include:
• Fear and worry about your own health and that of your friends and family.
• Changes in sleep or eating patterns.
• Difficulty sleeping or concentrating.
• Anger or sadness.
• Use of alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs
You can help manage your stress by:
• Avoiding excessive exposure to media coverage of COVID-19, including social media.
• Taking care of your body. Exercise, take deep breaths, stretch or meditate.
• Trying to eat healthy foods and get enough sleep. Avoid alcohol, drugs and tobacco.
• Doing something you enjoy. Talking to friends and family. Share your concerns and how you are
feeling with someone you trust.

Hidalgo County Requires Masks During Stay At Home Order

I had the honor of serving 377 meals in 2 hours with this dedicated group of McAllen ISD employees today👍
They had such a positive attitude and an awesome sense of humor🙂
We practiced social distancing and used our protective gear. I feel blessed that I was part of a team that served our community in such a big way.
I’m looking forward to another great day of serving meals tomorrow.

I had the honor of serving 377 meals in 2 hours with this dedicated group of McAllen ISD employees today👍
They had such a positive attitude and an awesome sense of humor🙂
We practiced social distancing and used our protective gear. I feel blessed that I was part of a team that served our community in such a big way.
I’m looking forward to another great day of serving meals tomorrow.

We are pleased to announce that we are now participating in a federal food service program (USDA) so we can provide free breakfast and lunch for ALL students, regardless of family income. However, the program only goes until 12/31 or until the federal funds are used up by the participating schools, whichever would occur first. Again, these funds are possible because of the USDA program. For those of you who have already deposited money, it will remain in your child's account. This is the most logical process because we don’t know if the program will end on 12/31 or earlier.

We are proud to bring this program to all of our Rambler students.

On Thursday, April 2, Governor Whitmer provided an Executive Order that mandated the closure of all Michigan schools for the remainder of the school year.

We understand the hardship this closure puts on our families, as well as the social and emotional impact it may have on our students. This school closure will obviously raise many questions for students and families. Please know that our administration and staff have been working closely together the past weeks and continue to do so, in order to answer these questions and move our district forward. More information will be available for you in the coming days. We will continue to work together to care for each other, our students, and our community.

Our staff remains dedicated to our students and the McBain Rural Agricultural School District Family. We are committed to ensuring supports for our students and families are in place so that our students continue learning during this school closure.

We are here for you!

We are continuing to try to keep our students connected during this school closure. We have heard from some parents that internet access is hard to come by where they live. We wanted to let everyone know that we have installed some wireless access points near the main parking lot at school. This wifi network will be available from 8AM to 8PM every day. Please see the map below for the best spots to get connected.

There are a few important notes about this free Wifi:

1) The wireless network is called Public Wifi OPEN.

2) Student devices should connect to their normal school wireless network.

3)This connection is filtered!

4) Once connected, you may have to go to www.mcbain.org/wifi and download a certificate. This is safe to download and install.

Recently, Mrs. Bronkema's 21 Things class has been 3D printing custom “Press Passes” created by the 8th grade students. These passes will be worn when students are using their cell phones or doing other work for our Middle School Facebook page. The passes are 100% made by the students and they created their designs in TinkerCAD. There are many interesting designs, some of which can even fit a library card. After all of the passes were printed, students were tasked with creating a 2nd iteration which would fix any mistakes and give them a chance to improve the previous designs. From these updated designs, the class voted to choose 5 to be reprinted and become the official Press Passes for our class.
The winners of the vote were: Trevor, Claydon, Ryan, Baylie, Silas, and Noah.

But, our elementary and middle schools have higher percentages than that, with the elementary at almost 20% absent. One elementary classroom had only 10 students in it.

school elections, due to large turnouts at the previous elections.

There have also been MANY changes in election law with last years passing of Proposal 3. Eligible persons can now register up to, and including election day. However, if you are not registered and would like to, are unsure if you are or where, I urge you to visit

PowerSchool has been reopened. You may now log in and see your schedules online!

Also, the district-wide open house will be held on Tuesday, August 13th from 5-7:00 PM. This will also be the first of two days for students to pick up their school computer in the Auditorium Lobby (with a parent/guardian present). The second day will be Wednesday, August 14th from 5-7:00 PM.

During the open house, we will be hosting a freshman orientation at 6:00 PM in the Auditorium to review important information and have students walk through their schedule and find their lockers.

We want to remind families to keep safety a priority as we approach the weekends. This weekend is Newfest and later in the month Middle River hosts Goosefest. While it is important to support our local communities, we must remember to do it safely.

Maintaining six feet distance, wearing masks in crowds, hand washing, and staying home if you do not feel well are ways we can protect ourselves and keep others safe.

Recently northwest Minnesota including Marshall County have seen a rise in positive cases. In order to ensure we maintain in person school, we need everyone in the community to do their part.",,,0.0,"MCC Families,

We are very excited for the first day of school!
Please review the first day of school letter we sent home in mailings. If you missed it, it can be viewed on our Back to School page: https://bit.ly/319RWDM.

Parents dropping off children: You may bring your child to the entrance of the school but only your child can come in. We surely want to be inviting but it is for everyone's safety.

We want to finish with a big thank you to our staff and parents for their help in the preparation process. The survey data and phone calls with questions, meetings with staff and their hard work, and final dialogue at the board meetings helped us get everything ready. It is definitely a community wide team effort and we appreciate your support!

Enjoy the Labor Day Holiday. Stay safe by washing hands often, social distancing, and wearing masks! We look forward to seeing our students back going to school on Tuesday!

We hope everyone had a great day today. Distance Learning started today. We hope it went well for you. Most families have received their packets. Please contact teachers if you need help. District office is also open from 8:00 to 3:30 each day if you have questions.

Our expansion of our lunch program went well today. We had 244 sign ups for today (488 meals served). If you would like to see the menu for the rest of the week it is posted on our website: http://www.newfolden.k12.mn.us/o/mcc-high-school/dining

On Wednesday and Thursday this week: Sarah, Patty, and Missy will be calling families. We will do this weekly to count for attendance. They will try to answer any questions you have and pass on feedback to our teaching staff and administrators to help.

Thank you all for your patience and understanding!
We miss our students but are glad to be helping the community get through this.

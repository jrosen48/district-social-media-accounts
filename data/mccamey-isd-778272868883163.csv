The top priority of Rankin ISD and McCamey ISD is providing a safe environment for our students, staff, and families. We understand there are health concerns over the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus called COVID-19.

Rankin ISD, McCamey ISD, and all local representatives in Upton County are closely monitoring the situation and tracking information provided by local, state, and national healthcare providers. As of now, there is no indication of an immediate threat to the Rankin and McCamey communities.

Both Rankin ISD and McCamey ISD will resume classes on March 16th as normal, unless otherwise mandated by the Texas Education Agency, CDC, or Texas Commissioner of Education. These decisions are based on emphasizing facts over fear and relying on credible sources for information.

The last Saturday Cross Country meet with these awesome kiddos. The next one will be their District meet on Monday, Oct 14th.

These kids compete week after week in a sport that not many will ever attend to watch. They wake up to go to 6am practices. They don’t get the praise or the glory that other athletes get for their sport. But they do it. And they are building this sport one year at at time. They may not be the best team out there.....yet......but they work at it every day to improve. They run to represent their school and they run to represent their community. I think they are amazing. And it has been an honor to spend these Saturdays with them.

Practitioner Leslie Lawson and the fifth-grade gifted scholars are learning how to properly monitor the Aquaponics Lab. Wet chemistry is used to test PH, ammonia, nitrite and nitrate levels in the system water. These levels are monitored and charted regularly as scholars prepare to introduce fish into the system.

Scholars also monitor plant growth and structure, searching for signs of nutrient deficiency. Hands-on activity allows for a better understanding of the nitrogen cycle and plant life cycles.

This experiential learning is accomplished daily in the aquaponics lab using either the engineering design process or scientific method depending on the activity. Ultimately scholars intend to consistently harvest various produce and hold a regular ""farmers market"" where they can focus on social, marketing, and mathematics skills.

Central Parents:
You will receive a letter in the mail (below) along with your child's grades for 3rd QTR. IF we have an extended school closure, e-learning will begin next week. Our 4th-5th grade content will be uploaded tomorrow afternoon on the following website: bit.ly/mpselearning

*IF you do NOT have a device that connects to wifi, we will have the school open from Thursday, March 19 from 1:00-4:00 PM for you (parent) to come get a chromebook/charger.
*IF you need to come get personal belongings out of your child's locker, you can do that on Thursday afternoon or anytime on Friday. (3/19/20th)

*We ask that you abide by the recommendations by the Southwest Health Department (travel/sick) upon entering the school building.
*MPS will announce on Friday around Noon the plans for the next week or two.
**Please note: Lots of things can change, this is a fluid situation.",2020-03-18 16:47:03,,

More information will be shared about the plans for performances as it is arranged. The plan now is to give these students who worked so hard the opportunity to perform their pieces whether it be for an online audience or otherwise. Unfortunately, I have no other information or details at this time. Obviously our first priority is the health and safety of all involved.

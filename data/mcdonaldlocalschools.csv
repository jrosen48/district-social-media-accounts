I want to say thank you to a few of the people who made this event possible.

Mrs. Evans and Mrs. Smith you completely redesigned graduation and pulled it off without a hitch.

Mr. Ronghi your work on the video was outstanding.

Mr. Carkido you adjusted with every obstacle that was thrown your way. Great job! Your work as the pace car wasn’t bad either.

The staff at both buildings, Mrs. Bosheff, Mr. Jones, Mr. Riccitelli, Officer Smith, and Officer Jones thanks for your efforts.

During this extended school closure we want to ensure that our students continue to receive food on a daily basis.

Tomorrow between 10:30 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. we will offer 5 breakfast and 5 lunches to our students in a grab and go bag. While our primary focus will be students on the free and reduced lunch program, any student in grades Kindergarten-12 can pick up a bag for no charge. Pickup location will be on the Roosevelt Elementary drop off lane. Please stay in your car as we will take your students name and then place the bag in your trunk.

Before and after treating a cut or wound
After using the toilet
After changing diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toilet

Students in Mrs. Burnside’s and Mrs. Wyatt’s Introduction to Business & Technology classes have been busy this week being young business men and women! This week’s focus was on planning, implementing, and product development.

The project began when students learned to create, modify, and edit tables in Microsoft Word 2019. They located and created recipe tables for drinks they believe THS faculty and students would like to purchase from the school store, The Dog House. Drinks included frozen fruit-flavored ice drinks, smoothies, iced coffees, milkshakes, etc.

Students were then introduced to raw materials and cost of goods sold concepts. Next, after reviewing safety in the workplace, students worked in their “business partnership” to make the recipes they had selected or developed. They shared product samples and conducted market research to determine the demand for their product and received feedback on ways to make their products better. Finally, back to the blenders they went to develop their own recipes and start the process over!",0.0,"The engineering design process and small business model are at work in this school-based enterprise!

The TMMS BETA Club has been quite busy this year! Not only does BETA recognize those students of high achievement, but it also provides the opportunity for those same students to actively promote the traits of service and leadership in our school and communities. Our BETA Club has faithfully executed these traits this year and will continue their service. The BETA Club is sponsored by Ms. Williams-Paschal and Ms. Ledger.

Just to highlight a few: they have served in the basketball concession stand, visited the Warrenton Health and Rehab Center (where they delivered Christmas bags to all 68 residents!), and they are currently collecting soda pop tabs for the Ronald McDonald House. We can't wait to see what else they accomplish!

Sometimes short days are the most fun‼️ Mrs. Alligood's class enjoyed learning about dental health. The class did an experiment to show what Coke can do to teeth compared to water. Look at those results! In small groups, students enjoyed writing stories about healthy teeth, working with number recognition, and creating personalized healthy choice books. And what’s better than a hands-on experience learning how to floss and brush teeth. Pre-K fun is definitely something to smile about!!!🤓

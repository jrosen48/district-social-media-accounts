We had an awesome day on the farm today! The amazing kids from Big Sandy Water Institute stopped by for some hands-on fun and education about sustainable farming. We hope you had a good time and learned a lot, kids. We'll see you next year! McGregor Community Education",2019-07-11 14:16:20,,

Wow! What a day! Thank you to Jay and Erik for an awesome adventure on the farm! BSWI environmentalist's discovered all about life on the organic farm! They planted, turned up soil, pulled weeds, played with farm animals, gathered and graded eggs, went on a hay ride, made gourd bird houses, had a lettuce taste test, and so much more! A shout out to our farmer friends who shared their love of horticulture and life on the farm!",0.0,"McGregor Community Education added 38 new photos — at Maple Ridge Produce.

Several animals call Rice Lake National Wildlife Refuge home...like a beaver! Ever wonder why a beaver has that big flat tail? Students interacted through games to learn about the special features animals have and how their activities, behaviors, and body parts help them to survive. Students fine tuned their observation skills on a short nature hike and did some journaling along the way. One of the favorites for students is time at Rice River fishing! A huge thanks to Walt Ford, Manager and the fishing volunteers who made the day so memorable!",0.0,"McGregor Community Education added 22 new photos — in East Lake, Minnesota.

I have not met one kid that does not enjoy kayaking! Expert kayakers Mr. and Mrs. Hadrich teach BSWI students all about safety, technique, paddling and navigating the waters all while having fun! So much fun that some choose to end the session tipping in the kayak...on purpose!
While the first kayak session was impacted by a thunderstorm it did not stop the action! Students were inside learning about pollinators within our ecosystem and interactive games learning about prey and predator relationships.
Have you ever eaten dandelion bread? Our youngest learners tasted it first hand and it was DELICIOUS! Thank you Courtney Kinnett for the wonderful sampling! Prior to the sampling students learned all about edible foods in the forest with an engaging Foe or Friend activity that Lucas the Park Ranger took them through. What a great day of learning!",0.0,"McGregor Community Education added 19 new photos.

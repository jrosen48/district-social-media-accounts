Received a picture last night! Made my day!!

Back in 2013, a young man named Kenny Speciale worked hard in the weight room and loved training! He had a goal of being in the Marines. I went back and found a picture in some files of the day his older friends returned to visit in their uniforms. Yesterday, this same young man sends me a picture after graduating as a Staff Sergeant Drill Instructor! Inspirational to see what our students can accomplish & work toward their goals!!

We are so proud of you SSG Speciale Kennon Speciale!💪🇺🇸 SSG Speciale has continued to make personal fitness a priority in his life and has earned 6 different personal training certifications since graduating. GO WARRIORS!!!

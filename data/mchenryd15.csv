On Friday, these three generations of district teachers finally had the chance to be together in one room! From right to left: in Mr. Goodman's first year of teaching at Riverwood, he had Alyson Kriewaldt in his class. Ms. Kriewaldt went on to become a District 15 teacher at Riverwood, where she had Jacob Burr in her first class! Mr. Burr is now a teacher at Landmark! We wonder - will one of Mr. Burr's students become a teacher as well?! #lmdolphinsrock #d15rocks #rw_rascals",0.0,"Today's learners...tomorrow's leaders! #d15rocks

Dear parents of student-athletes-

We are aware of the state’s guidance released today to allow spectators at our athletic events. Please be aware that these headlines are misleading. A strict capacity limit of no more than 250 persons remains in place on outdoor gatherings (games). The capacity limit includes both teams, coaches, referees and any essential operating personnel. The capacity limit now has the ability to allow spectators if the amount falls within the limit.

MASD will be working on a system to potentially allow a very limited amount of spectators to be able to attend outdoor athletic events at home.

Further details will be provided in the near future.

Sarah Venters, Wolford Elementary Teacher of the Year 2019/2020",3.0,"“I believe being a teacher is more than educating students between the four walls of a classroom. Once you make a connection and begin to know a student; their hobbies, interests, and home life, you begin to see them as your child, not just a student you educate in a classroom setting.”

It’s difficult to overstate the importance of mentors and the impact that they have on MISD students. The time that they invest can lead to improved grades, fewer discipline referrals, improved attendance, more effective social skills and increased self-esteem. For some students, having a mentor has been the driving force that helped them push through to graduation—and on to college.

There are students out there waiting for a mentor. Maybe that mentor is you.

Consider becoming a mentor through the MISD REACH program. Find out more here: https://www.mckinneyisd.net/partners-in-education/reach/

The student councils of McKinney North, MHS and Boyd came together again this year to collect and pack 825 complete turkey dinners for families in the McKinney area—175 more than they collected last year. Working together, these remarkable MISD student leaders spearheaded the annual charitable campaign that provides complete holiday meals for families who might not otherwise have one. In addition to the turkey dinners, they collected enough food to provide several hundred additional holiday meal “starter packs” as well. With help from all the student councils and North athletes, they managed to pack some 1,200 meals in about 14 minutes yesterday afternoon!

“I think it’s awesome,” said North STUCO President Joshua Shelton, “just because our motto this year is MISD Lives Kind.

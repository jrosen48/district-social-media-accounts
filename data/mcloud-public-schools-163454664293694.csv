McLoud Families,

As you may have seen in local news reports, coronavirus cases in Pottawatomie County have increased significantly in the past week. A correctional facility within the county has reported over 100 positive cases with more test results pending. The test results from the correctional facility have led to the significant increase in the county numbers that you see reported daily on news stations and other media. In light of the information above, McLoud Public Schools, in collaboration with local health officials, does not feel that any changes to our school schedule or school protocols are necessary at this time. We will continue to monitor the situation, we will continue to collaborate with state and local officials, and we will continue to prioritize the health and safety of our students, staff, and families.

The test results from the correctional facility have led to the significant increase in the county numbers that you see reported daily on news stations and other media. In light of the information above, McLoud Public Schools, in collaboration with local health officials, does not feel that any changes to our school schedule or school protocols are necessary at this time. We will continue to monitor the situation, we will continue to collaborate with state and local officials, and we will continue to prioritize the health and safety of our students, staff, and families.

Respectfully, Steve Stanley, Superintendent",2020-08-21 17:06:14,,

Dear McLoud Family,

It is hard to believe that another school year has come to an end. A strange end indeed, but an end all the same. We experienced many new adventures this spring. I am certain we will be strengthened by this journey and that it will help us to appreciate the little things.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the students, staff, and community for their support for the last three years. It truly has been a pleasure to serve as the high school principal. I built lasting relationships with many wonderful people. Furthermore, I got to learn and grow along with each of you. For these and a million other reasons, I am truly grateful.

I have accepted a new position within the district and am currently making that transition. I will be the Executive Director of Administrators/Curriculum and Instruction. I am excited at the new challenge and hope to continue to serve the McLoud district to the very best of my abilities.

In closing, I wish you all a very happy, safe, and enjoyable summer. Go Redskins!

Sincerely,

Rhonda Hockenbury",,,0.0,"June 16, 2020

Alright Redskins, here is the plan. I formed a committee and we met this afternoon to discuss graduation. We will proceed with the scheduled graduation parade on May 22nd. Seniors will receive their diplomas on this date.

We have tentatively scheduled a follow-up ceremony to be held on June 20th at 3:00 pm. IF the CDC or the State Superintendent has not cleared us for a gathering by that date we will try July 25th at 7:00 pm as our second option. We are planning to host the ceremony at the high school football field UNLESS Joy Hofmeister, State Superintendent has not cleared schools to host events. If this is the case, we will host at Veteran's Memorial Park in McLoud.

We will observe any and all CDC, State of Oklahoma, and State School Board guidelines at any and all events as our top priority is always the safety and well being of our students and their families.

I hope this eases your anxiety and gives you an event to look forward to this summer to recognize our seniors' rite of passage.

Go Redskins!

The classroom that donates the most books will earn a pop and popcorn party. The winning class will also get to put a pie in the face of our Librarian and Dean of Students. If we are able to collect 250 books our Principal, Mrs. Drew, will get a pie in the face, and if we are able to collect 500 books our Superintendent, Mr. Stanley, will take a pie in the face too. Each book donated will have a special label placed in them to recognize the families that have helped with our Book Wars. Mrs. Rich has an Amazon wish list for books, and the link has been shared to the Intermediate Facebook page if you are looking for ideas on what we will need. We are excited about the opening of our new building next year, and hope to pack the library full of amazing adventures for our students!📖❤️
Let the Book Wars Begin!!",,,0.0,"❤️📖In an effort to help Awaken our New Intermediate Library Intermediate classes will be having a Book Wars contest during the month of March. 4th-6th Students are challenged to donate new or gently used school appropriate books to help fill our new library. The classroom that donates the most books will earn a pop and popcorn party. The winning class will also get to put a pie in the face of our Librarian and Dean of Students. If we are able to collect 250 books our Principal, Mrs. Drew, will get a pie in the face, and if we are able to collect 500 books our Superintendent, Mr. Stanley, will take a pie in the face too. Each book donated will have a special label placed in them to recognize the families that have helped with our Book Wars. Mrs. Rich has an Amazon wish list for books, and the link has been shared to the Intermediate Facebook page if you are looking for ideas on what we will need. We are excited about the opening of our new building next year, and hope to pack the library full of amazing adventures for our students!📖❤️

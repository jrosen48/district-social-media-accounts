As you may have seen in local news reports, coronavirus cases in Pottawatomie County have increased significantly in the past week. A correctional facility within the county has reported over 100 positive cases with more test results pending. The test results from the correctional facility have led to the significant increase in the county numbers that you see reported daily on news stations and other media. In light of the information above, McLoud Public Schools, in collaboration with local health officials, does not feel that any changes to our school schedule or school protocols are necessary at this time. We will continue to monitor the situation, we will continue to collaborate with state and local officials, and we will continue to prioritize the health and safety of our students, staff, and families.

Parents/Guardians, if you are having trouble enrolling your student(s) it may be because you are using the student account. You must have a guardian account to complete enrollment. Please email the building contact person and they can get one set up for you. Please be patient, as this is a new system and we are doing our very best to make this process as painless as possible. It may take a few days for our staff to get back with everyone. This delay will in no way impact your student. Thank you.

Hey McLoud Team!

As families navigate school closings and remote learning, we wanted to do some special things during this season to help support families at home.

1. Daily Booster Story Time - A Booster Team Member will read a beloved children’s book aloud. 9 am EST on Booster’s Facebook Page.

2. Daily Boost Fit Fitness Breaks - A team member will lead fun exercises to keep families moving at home. Noon EST on Booster’s Facebook Page.

3. We’re also opening up our Character Video Library to ALL schools and families across the country for the rest of the school year—so families can now stream 75+ character and fitness-based videos at no cost. Families can register on BoosterthonCharacter.com using the access code: home

We hope these activities serve not only as helpful resources during this time but also as an opportunity for your families to engage in character-building conversations while also staying active at home.

AUGUST 29!!

Parents and Families—this year’s main fundraiser is the Redskin Fun Run! It’s a two-week program that kicks off with a Pep Rally on August 19. Families will then gather pledges for every lap your student runs (30-35 laps) at the Redskin Fun Run, which will happen on August 29. This year our goal is to raise $15,000 and we need your help! We’ve asked the experts at Booster to power our fundraiser to make it easier, more profitable, and more fun.

Students will also experience an amazing character theme, MINDSPARK: WILD WEST! Booster’s most exciting theme yet combines S.T.E.A.M. skills (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) with character-building. While they're teaming up with the MindSpark Kids to save Dr. Shock, our students will learn five character traits that will help strengthen themselves and our world.

So please help our school by getting pledges from family and friends and entering them on FUNRUN.COM. Also, all families are invited to come out and cheer on our students at the Redskin Fun Run. Thanks so much for your support!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1354376241380757&id=110086409143086,,0.0,"SAVE THE DATE!!!

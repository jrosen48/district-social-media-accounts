I am still hopeful that we are able to hold a graduation ceremony in the future. Unfortunately, I have no information at this time about when that might occur.

It is common practice that we hold the caps and gowns until rehearsal for seniors to ensure they all receive them and that they have been paid for. Since there is uncertainty about graduation, we want to be sure that you get your caps and gowns. After all, there are pictures and celebrations to have just the same!

BORN TO REBEL

POUND - Rockout. Workout.
January 16 at 10:00 AM ·

POUND was born out of a rebellious spirit. We’ve always believed in Doing It Different—fitting into a box was never the goal. And like any purpose-driven company, we were sparked from a problem we saw seeping from the gym environment.

In a world where experiences can be intimidating and exclusive, profit is often prioritized before people and calorie counting, “problem areas” and before + after pictures are the standard, POUND believed the fitness industry could do better.

Starting this journey as a company was, to say the least,
a rebellious act.

It shouldn’t be about the rules, approvals, and standards society places on us. It shouldn’t drain your soul.

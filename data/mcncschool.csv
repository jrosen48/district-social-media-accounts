With sports pictures coming up, we wanted to make sure you noted a change.

Keepsake Portraits will be using a new way of ordering sports pictures. Your student will bring home a card that explains how to get online, see your images, and order. Everyone will be photographed.

You may also select direct to home shipping if you would like! That way you won’t have lost pictures in duffel bags. You may go to www.KeepsakeClients.com to print and send a paper form, but we think you will like the new system better.

Do not hesitate to text/call Keepsake at 419-422-4121.

Again, you won’t preorder sports this year like the past with an envelope, so your student won’t be bringing one home.

Joey ‚ÄúI got this, Coach‚Äù Dube has been a part of WCHS T&F for the last 5 seasons. Every year he demonstrated continuous improvement in ability in both shot put and discus. His attitude for each of the seasons has shown that he has a great sense of dedication and competitive spirit. Joey also has a great sense of humor. This is what it takes to practice outside when the temperatures are in the teens with high winds for prolonged periods. Joey‚Äôs presence will be missed as he was a role model for his fellow student athletes.

Today (9/10/20), our district was notified that all MCR-II students who are currently enrolled “in seat”, will not have to pay for any breakfast or lunch, through December 22, 2020. Both of these meals must be a totally reimbursable meal, meaning that it must meet the USDA requirement of an entrée, fruit, vegetable, and milk. If your student chooses only an ala-carte item, or just a milk, their account will be charged for those items. The Department of Health and Senior Services (agency overseeing this food service program) is allowing districts to back date the start of this program to September 1. This means that student meal accounts will not show a charge from September 1 through December 22. However, families will still be required to pay for any meal debt accrued through August 31, 2020.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1691541670996410&id=167281646755761,,0.0,"Dear MCR-II Parents, the MCR-II School District has been working with state agencies so all our students could have free breakfasts and lunches.

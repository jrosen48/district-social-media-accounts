2019 HALLOWEEN TRICK OR TREATING HOURS:

Due to the weather....Trick or Treating hours will be on FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 1ST FROM 5PM TO 9PM.

Be Safe. Watch out for little goblins!! And...have fun!!

*** EDIT: For those who are upset by the change in trick or treating hours....the decision was made due to the safety of the children who will be out in the weather. They are calling for high winds, rain and possibly snow. As weather conditions forecast on Monday are not always accurate...we watched to see if anything would change. We understand that this is difficult for parents, but our priority is the safety of the children running around in wind and rain and snow who could possibly be hit by a car that cannot either see them because of the weather conditions or stop in time because of the slick conditions. We hope that you can take your kids out on Friday when the weather will be much better, but we stand by our decision to keep the event as safe as possible.",0.0,"City of Muncie

Beale Elementary’s annual Wax Museum continued virtually this year with PK through 6th grade students participating. PK-2 students chose a favorite book character and students in 3rd-6th gave a biographical portrayal of their chosen person. The staff at Beale was simply overwhelmed with the outcome, especially this year. Our Families worked with students to create videos of their presentations (When possible) and submitted them over the course of two days via the Beale PTO Facebook page. To say it was an emotional experience viewing the submissions and working with our Beale families on so many other activities throughout this time of distance cannot really capture our feelings. We have truly come to appreciate that Beale Elementary is not a building — it’s the culmination of the families & community we have the privilege to serve.

There was a business meeting held today at our career center. Board president Jared Billings & I were able to attend along with Superintendent Cullen. There were representatives from many of the major businesses in our area. The intent was to discuss how our school system & our businesses can work together to provide maximum employment opportunities for our students. We listened to an update on the coal/gas plant project. 🤞🏻 Jared & I were particularly interested in what Kathy D’Antoni from the state department had to say. Supposedly, there is money available to help expand programs at our career center!! We’ll be talking to her more about this!

Friends, colleagues, & family members gathered at New Haven School tonight to honor retired teacher, Louease Sayre. Superintendent Jack Cullen had Mrs. Sayre as his first & second grade teacher. Louease says she stays busy, but she misses teaching. I’ll never forget the time that I spent working alongside Louease, & I’ll never forget standing alongside her in the cold & rain on the picket lines during the teacher strikes. I wouldn’t be surprised to see her standing amidst her friends again, fighting for teachers’ benefits, should the need arise. We love you, Mrs. Sayre!

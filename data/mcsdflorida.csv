South Fork‚Äôs National Merit Semifinalists: Three South Fork High School seniors have been named Semifinalists in the 2021 National Merit Scholarship Program. The National Merit Scholarship Program is a renowned academic competition for recognition and scholarships that began in 1955.

This year‚Äôs competition began in October 2019 when more than 1.5 million juniors in approximately 21,000 high schools took the PSAT/NMSQT, which served as an initial screen of program entrants. The highest-scoring participants in each state, representing less than one percent of our nation‚Äôs high school seniors, were named Semifinalists on a state-representational basis. Finalists will be announced in the spring of 2021.

TCPalm - Students across the Martin County School District have returned to campus for the first time since March, when schools first closed because of the Coronavirus pandemic. It was a first day of school unlike anything anyone had ever seen before, said Superintendent Laurie J. Gaylord.

The first day went well despite challenges she said, thanking staff for working hard to prepare schools and classrooms for social distancing and education in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Masks were a non-issue among students and teachers on the first day. All but two students at the seven sites Mrs. Gaylord visited on Tuesday reported to school with a mask. Extra masks are always available for students who forget theirs, she shared.

""I kind of like (the mask),"" said Stuart Middle School student Sam McCullough. The 13-year-old said he was glad to be back in school.

Q: If I elect to have my child participate in the traditional, in-person school option, will they be able to ride the bus to and from school?

A: Yes. Students who are eligible for school bus transportation as defined in School Board Policy 8600 will continue to be eligible to ride the bus. To be eligible for transportation, students must live more than two (2) miles from their home-zoned school OR be eligible for transportation due to a documented hazardous walking condition (as defined in Chapter 1006.23, Florida Statutes). On February 18, 2020, the Martin County School Board voted to eliminate the seats available and grandfathering programs that previously allowed students who lived less than two (2) miles from their home-zoned school to be eligible for transportation.

Q: Will students, staff and visitors be required to wear masks? If so, will they wear them at all times?

A: Students will be required to wear masks on school buses and on campuses when it is not possible to keep the recommended 6 feet of social distance from others (changing classes, arriving/departing campus, in the hallways, and in classrooms where 6 feet of space is not available between students).

Social distancing cannot be guaranteed and is dependent on the number of students and staff in any location at a given time.

All designs and wording present on masks must adhere to the dress code regulations found in the District‚Äôs Code of Student Conduct. Staff and visitors will be required to wear masks when social distancing is not practical or possible.

Q: What‚Äôs the difference between quarantine and isolation? How do I know if I need to do one or the other?

A: Quarantine keeps someone who might have been exposed to the virus away from others. ‚ÄúQuarantine is for contacts.‚Äù

Isolation separates people who are infected with COVID-19 away from people who are not infected. ‚ÄúIsolation is for those who are infected/ill.‚Äù

Quarantine protocol: Anyone who has been in close contact (within 6 feet for longer than 15 minutes) with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 - whether one or both parties were wearing a mask or not - must quarantine themselves.

Isolation protocol: Anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19, anyone who has symptoms of COVID-19 and is able to recover at home, or anyone who has no symptoms (asymptomatic) but has tested positive for COVID-19- must isolate themselves.

Q: What‚Äôs the difference between quarantine and isolation? How do I know if I need to do one or the other?

A: Quarantine keeps someone who might have been exposed to the virus away from others. ‚ÄúQuarantine is for contacts.‚Äù

Isolation separates people who are infected with COVID-19 away from people who are not infected. ‚ÄúIsolation is for those who are infected/ill.‚Äù

Quarantine protocol: Anyone who has been in close contact (within 6 feet for longer than 15 minutes) with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 - whether one or both parties were wearing a mask or not - must quarantine themselves.

Isolation protocol: Anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19, anyone who has symptoms of COVID-19 and is able to recover at home, or anyone who has no symptoms (asymptomatic) but has tested positive for COVID-19- must isolate themselves.

A: The K-12 Pandemic Response Team has developed the pictured criteria, which was presented to the School Board on July 21, 2020.

Parents/guardians must be mindful that remote learning will be implemented for students attending school in person if a decision is made (in collaboration with local health officials) to close a classroom(s) or school(s).

Q: If I don't currently have a laptop or Chromebook for my child(ren), can I obtain one from the District? Will the District support my child's device if we choose to use one from home?

A: Yes. The District continues to support distance learning by distributing devices to students that do not have a previously issued District device to use outside the classroom.

These devices will be distributed to K-8 students from Aug 5- Aug 7 at their enrolled school site for the 2020-2021 school year. High school students will continue to use their District-issued Laptops for Learning (L4L) devices.

A device will be available for ALL enrolled students in the household.

We encourage students to obtain a District-issued device during the deployment from Aug 5 - Aug 7. Students may use personal devices, but District staff will not provide tech support (hardware and software) for personal devices.

Once student commitments have been made, staff will investigate this possibility for potential changes to make part-time remote learning and part-time in-person learning possible. #ALLINMartinüëä",2020-07-15 16:39:00,,

Q: If I choose the remote learning option, will my middle or high school student be able to participate in programs or academies such as International Baccalaureate, Cambridge AICE, Advanced Placement, Career & Technical Education (CTE) courses or AVID?

A: The remote learning option will allow students to livestream directly into their teachers‚Äô classrooms at school. While many aspects of lessons will translate seamlessly into the remote learning format, some courses include hands-on lessons and experiences that will not be available in the remote learning environment.

*Note: In-person attendance may be required in specialty programs when work-based learning and/or Industry Certification requires the demonstration of technical skills attainment. Please contact your child's site instructor with questions.

In order to maintain instructional continuity, students participating in the remote learning option will receive direct instruction from their classroom teacher(s) through the livestreaming of each class.

Students who choose this option will maintain their enrollment status at their assigned school and follow their assigned course schedule. Attendance will be taken each period.

Q: Why would the District choose to fully reopen schools when COVID-19 cases are rising in our community and state?

A: The decision to reopen schools at this time is in direct response to the Florida Department of Education‚Äôs Emergency Order 2020-EO-06, which was issued and signed by Education Commissioner Corcoran on July 6, 2020.

Within the Emergency Order, Commissioner Corcoran outlines that brick and mortar schools will need to reopen at least five days a week for all students beginning in August or risk the loss of funding. All school districts in Florida are required to submit their reopening plans to the DOE by July 31, 2020. We are working with our community partners to mitigate risk and protect the health and safety of staff and students. #ALLINMartinüëä",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3334260156641191&id=103204909746748,,0.0,"üçéYOU'VE ASKED, WE'VE ANSWEREDüçé

""This was a gift. Teaching was a gift to me, and it's real hard to walk away from your gift,"" said Bocken. ""I know I've touched my kids' lives, and I've hugged them before and I'm gonna have to accept that's enough for now and maybe in the future, I'll be able to see them again."" #ALLINMartinüëä

""She's also participated in the Martin County 4-H program for the past 7 years, showing various animals. Megan's pretty easy going (even after getting up well before school to drive 20 miles round trip to check on her fair project for 5 mths), with an infectious laugh and sense of humor her family loves. She's known for years she wants to be in culinary, preferably baking. She'll be pursuing a degree in Culinary Management at IRSC - Indian River State College, and one day would love to open her own bakery! We are so proud - and are especially thankful for Mr. Whittle, Mr. Thomas and Ms Valmyr, for being such great role models and teachers - you guys are awesome, and your dedication makes a big difference in these kids' lives!""

He plans to pursue a career in architecture. Shout out to all of Martin County faculty and staff for helping to guide our students to be their very best!

South Fork’s National Merit Semifinalists: Three South Fork High School seniors have been named Semifinalists in the 2021 National Merit Scholarship Program. The National Merit Scholarship Program is a renowned academic competition for recognition and scholarships that began in 1955.

This year’s competition began in October 2019 when more than 1.5 million juniors in approximately 21,000 high schools took the PSAT/NMSQT, which served as an initial screen of program entrants. The highest-scoring participants in each state, representing less than one percent of our nation’s high school seniors, were named Semifinalists on a state-representational basis. Finalists will be announced in the spring of 2021.

A: Yes. Students who are eligible for school bus transportation as defined in School Board Policy 8600 will continue to be eligible to ride the bus. To be eligible for transportation, students must live more than two (2) miles from their home-zoned school OR be eligible for transportation due to a documented hazardous walking condition (as defined in Chapter 1006.23, Florida Statutes).

Q: Will students, staff and visitors be required to wear masks? If so, will they wear them at all times?

A: Students will be required to wear masks on school buses and on campuses when it is not possible to keep the recommended 6 feet of social distance from others (changing classes, arriving/departing campus, in the hallways, and in classrooms where 6 feet of space is not available between students).

Social distancing cannot be guaranteed and is dependent on the number of students and staff in any location at a given time.

All designs and wording present on masks must adhere to the dress code regulations found in the District’s Code of Student Conduct. Staff and visitors will be required to wear masks when social distancing is not practical or possible.

Q: What’s the difference between quarantine and isolation? How do I know if I need to do one or the other?

A: Quarantine keeps someone who might have been exposed to the virus away from others. “Quarantine is for contacts.”

Isolation separates people who are infected with COVID-19 away from people who are not infected. “Isolation is for those who are infected/ill.”

Quarantine protocol: Anyone who has been in close contact (within 6 feet for longer than 15 minutes) with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 - whether one or both parties were wearing a mask or not - must quarantine themselves.

Isolation protocol: Anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19, anyone who has symptoms of COVID-19 and is able to recover at home, or anyone who has no symptoms (asymptomatic) but has tested positive for COVID-19- must isolate themselves.

Q: If I don't currently have a laptop or Chromebook for my child(ren), can I obtain one from the District? Will the District support my child's device if we choose to use one from home?

A: Yes. The District continues to support distance learning by distributing devices to students that do not have a previously issued District device to use outside the classroom.

These devices will be distributed to K-8 students from Aug 5- Aug 7 at their enrolled school site for the 2020-2021 school year. High school students will continue to use their District-issued Laptops for Learning (L4L) devices.

A device will be available for ALL enrolled students in the household.

We encourage students to obtain a District-issued device during the deployment from Aug 5 - Aug 7. Students may use personal devices, but District staff will not provide tech support (hardware and software) for personal devices.

Q: What is the protocol for school closure in the event a school receives notice that a student or staff member has tested positive for COVID-19? Will the District notify parents?

A: If a student or staff member tests positive for COVID-19, the District will work closely with DOH Martin to provide contact tracing to ensure that anyone who came in close contact with the Case+ person will be notified by DOH Martin to determine exposure, quarantine measures and testing, if necessary.

Decisions about the closure of schools will be made in partnership with local and state health officials.

A: If a student or staff member tests positive for COVID-19, the District will work closely with DOH Martin to provide contact tracing to ensure that anyone who came in close contact with the Case+ person will be notified by DOH Martin to determine exposure, quarantine measures and testing, if necessary.

Decisions about the closure of schools will be made in partnership with local and state health officials.

Q: How will the District enforce the rule that students must wear masks when social distancing is not possible? I do not want my child exposed to illness because another student(s) refuse(s) to follow the rules.

A: District staff hold the responsibility of ensuring students are wearing their masks at all appropriate times as outlined in the FAQs for School Reopening or specifically noted otherwise. Students will be reminded that masks are required while in school and continued refusal to comply with this requirement could result in disciplinary action.

Q: Will the remote learning option be identical to the distance learning we experienced during the final months of last school year?

A: The remote learning option for the 2020-2021 school year is not the same as the distance learning families participated in last school year.

In order to maintain instructional continuity, students participating in the remote learning option will receive direct instruction from their classroom teacher(s) through the livestreaming of each class.

Students who choose this option will maintain their enrollment status at their assigned school and follow their assigned course schedule. Attendance will be taken each period. Students/teachers will follow the same curriculum sequence as their peers in school and can easily transition to in-person attendance in school when they are ready. Services including mental health, counseling, and interventions will be made available. Parents should provide adult supervision and support for young children.

Q: If my child participates in traditional, in-person school, what will social distancing look like? Will desks be placed 6 feet apart? Will students have to wear masks in their classrooms if their desks are placed 6 feet apart?

A: Social distancing will be a primary objective and desks will be spaced 6 feet apart to the greatest extent possible based on class size and space.

Q: Why would the District choose to fully reopen schools when COVID-19 cases are rising in our community and state?

A: The decision to reopen schools at this time is in direct response to the Florida Department of Education’s Emergency Order 2020-EO-06, which was issued and signed by Education Commissioner Corcoran on July 6, 2020.

Within the Emergency Order, Commissioner Corcoran outlines that brick and mortar schools will need to reopen at least five days a week for all students beginning in August or risk the loss of funding. All school districts in Florida are required to submit their reopening plans to the DOE by July 31, 2020.

""She's also participated in the Martin County 4-H program for the past 7 years, showing various animals. Megan's pretty easy going (even after getting up well before school to drive 20 miles round trip to check on her fair project for 5 mths), with an infectious laugh and sense of humor her family loves. She's known for years she wants to be in culinary, preferably baking. She'll be pursuing a degree in Culinary Management at IRSC - Indian River State College, and one day would love to open her own bakery! We are so proud - and are especially thankful for Mr. Whittle, Mr. Thomas and Ms Valmyr, for being such great role models and teachers - you guys are awesome, and your dedication makes a big difference in these kids' lives!""

Megan's pretty easy going (even after getting up well before school to drive 20 miles round trip to check on her fair project for 5 mths), with an infectious laugh and sense of humor her family loves. She's known for years she wants to be in culinary, preferably baking. She'll be pursuing a degree in Culinary Management at IRSC - Indian River State College, and one day would love to open her own bakery! We are so proud - and are especially thankful for Mr. Whittle, Mr. Thomas and Ms Valmyr, for being such great role models and teachers - you guys are awesome, and your dedication makes a big difference in these kids' lives!""

Please join us in congratulating South Fork High School senior Gabriella Montoya!

""My favorite memories about high school are getting ready for the Martin Bowl (biggest football game of the year) or playing in volleyball games and looking up at the crowd knowing all those people were here for us,"" Gabriella shares. ""I also enjoyed walking the halls - making people laugh and smile - and knowing that these are my last moments of being a child and soon I will be an adult. After high school I plan on going to IRSC - Indian River State College and getting my ASN/BSN or going for EMT schooling and then to the Air Force to pursue my dream of being a flight medic! I want to say thank you to all of my teachers for helping me through the rough times and making me laugh and smile in my worst moods. I'll miss all of you!""

In just 24 hours after the launch of the #ThankATeacherMCSD campaign, more than 200 students, parents and community members have taken the time to write messages of gratitude to their favorite Martin County School District educators.

While our plan was to share these messages during national #ThankATeacher Week (May 4 - 8), we just can't keep these heartwarming messages to ourselves a minute longer!

Today's first message goes out to Ms. Forrester of Stuart Middle School/ Stuart Middle School PTSA from student Ella Hart.

""This is Aminé. He is a singer/rapper. I chose him to paint because when I’m sad or frustrated, I listen to his music and it brings up my mood. I chose these colors because when I listen to his music it calms me; green is a natural calming color. When I’m in my room and I’m listening to his music, my LED lights are set to green to keep myself calm. All green colors bring me a stimulating calm feeling and so does his music.""

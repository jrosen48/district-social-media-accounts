Follow Five Steps to Wash Your Hands the Right Way

Washing your hands is easy, and it‚Äôs one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of germs. Clean hands can stop germs from spreading from one person to another and throughout an entire community‚Äîfrom your home and workplace to childcare facilities and hospitals.

Follow these five steps every time.

1. Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap.
2. Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
3. Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù song from beginning to end twice.

We have learned a lot during our extended at-home learning period. We have further embraced technology, learned new platforms, experimented with delivery methods, and launched curbside tech support.

To our staff, students, and families...YOU ARE ROCKSTARS!

If you are interested in your student having a great e-Learning experience in the future contact us about transferring at inquiries@madison.k12.in.us. We would love to have you as part of the Madison family!

As we wrap up the last week of school, I can't help but be emotional. This isn't how it was supposed to be.

I cherish the time we spend together online but wow, I miss spending every day with them.

We wanted to share information regarding student devices.

Given the continued circumstances around the COVID-19 closures, Madison Consolidated Schools will collect student devices from our Class of 2020 seniors ONLY.

All other Madison students, finishing grades Kindergarten through Grade 11, will keep their devices over the summer. You will be using the same device when classes resume in the fall. PLEASE, please do everything you can to properly care for your device over the summer, keep track of the charger, and bring it back to school in proper working order.

SENIORS: We will be communicating more with you directly closer to the time, but device turn-in will be a part of the Senior Parade tentatively scheduled for July 18, and Graduation, tentatively planned for July 26. More details to come!

Thank you for your continued patience as we wrap up the school year.

We had community circle via video!! Each kid stayed muted until I called on them. They shared how they were, what they've been up to, and the most fun thing they've done since Friday.

We were ALL so glad to be together again, even if it wasn't in the way we are used to. We will get through this trying time... TOGETHER!! üí™

So, so proud of #CubCulinary Intro Culinary!! Our building is celebrating Read Across America Week and Dr. Seuss‚Äô birthday. Our librarian, Mrs. Jennifer Cornelius, is reading to students during lunches, so we decided to contribute by making some inspired cookies. First time for many of them to use royal icing. One student said, ‚ÄúThis is the best thing I‚Äôve made all year.‚Äù Couldn‚Äôt agree more! #CubPride #MadisonLEAD #MadisonCareerandTechnologyAcademy",2020-03-05 10:59:00,,

We worked with parents, teachers, administrators, and community partners to develop this very comprehensive plan, which will continue to guide our daily work.

We had a great first week back with our students, and looking forward to another fantastic week beginning tomorrow. Before the work week begins I wanted to share with you a few pieces of information.
First, beginning Monday any student arriving after 7:40 a.m. (as a car rider) will need to have a parent/guardian walk their child into the school building and sign him/her in at the main office. It's critical that students arrive on time each day which is before 7:40 a.m..
Our first house meeting for the second semester is Thursday of this week. We are asking students to wear their house colors or shirt if they own one.
Lastly, please note on your calendars that Monday, February 3rd is an all district e-learning day. Schools will be closed for students on this day, and all e-learning assignments will be posted before 7:30 a.m. Monday, February 3rd.

We were notified of a law enforcement situation in the area, and the building has been placed on a precautionary LOCKOUT.

Preschool pickup will go at the normal time - students will be escorted out of the building. We are working with law enforcement partners and as soon as the situation is resolved we will let you know.

RR families, be on the lookout for update calls from Mrs. Mires as the situation evolves.

It‚Äôs only Wednesday and it‚Äôs been a good week so far, practicing for our All-Sides Thanksgiving meal next Wednesday, November 20, and hand-writing personal invitations to building staff members.
Practice pies (oh, what a lovely concept!) today could not have come out any better. C2 baking students got in there and went to town rolling out crusts and filling them: pumpkin, pecan, sugar cream, and apple. We‚Äôll taste tomorrow, but if they‚Äôre half as good as they look, they‚Äôll be terrific. Sure made the hall smell amazing.
Also, gotta shout out to our boys for carrying the day. Weirdly, all girls but one were absent and the fellas jumped in and did it all. Huge pride!!

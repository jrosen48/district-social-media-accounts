ONLY cars with placards will be allowed onto campus. We ask that you do not park in front of the school as there is not enough room for all in that area.

""I am currently considering attending UNMLA to get my basic classes out of the way then move to a larger university such as UNM or CNM.

Some advice I would give to students would be to worry less and don’t be afraid to try new things. We spend so much of our time worrying if we will pass a test instead of studying for that test. Whether we should put ourselves out there and try joining a sport or a club and when we don’t, we often miss out on experiences and memories that have the potential to impact our life more than we could imagine. So forget what others think about you and do what makes you happy.

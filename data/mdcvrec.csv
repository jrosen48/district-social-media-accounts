0,0.0,,3.0,,525709754803953,Due to our current situation and the unknown of the next few months we have decided to return all of your softball/baseball money. They haven’t made a decision on whether to cancel the season or not but we as a recreation commission felt it was better to just return your money so we could get it to you easily when the students are picking up their things from the school this week. So if you have paid for ball season you will be getting your money back with your child’s belongings from school! I hope you understand our decision. If anything changes regarding ball season we will make it known on all our social media avenues. Stay safe and healthy Trojans!!! 💙💙,https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=525709754803953&id=239785460063052,,0.0,Due to our current situation and the unknown of the next few months we have decided to return all of your softball/baseball money.

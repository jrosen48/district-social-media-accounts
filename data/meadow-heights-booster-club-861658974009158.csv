A benefit for the Deck‚Äôs- Tonight
Meadow Heights will play Leopold in a high school basketball game, but this night will be about much more than a game, as we will be hosting a benefit for the family of a former player of mine Mason Deck, whose families house was lost to a fire at Christmas this year. We will have a 50/50 raffle, a silent auction for baked goods, and asking that you bring a household item that the family could use, or clothing for entry to the game. Sizes on clothes are listed below. This will be a great night of both family and basketball. If you would like to donate a baked good or have any questions contact myself or Candy Wilfong 573 275-7888. Hope to see you out on January 24th for a great cause, game starts at 6 pm, with jv followed by the varsity contest. #smalltownbighearts #forthedecks

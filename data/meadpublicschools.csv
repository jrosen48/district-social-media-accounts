Happy National Ag Day!

In honor of today, here is the first of many ag literacy activity videos I will be sharing. Given the current status of MPS, I’m sure there are some bored kiddos at home. These videos will include hands on activities, experiments, books and so much more!

Today’s topic introduces us to the importance of agriculture.

Materials:
-play dough and plastic knife

OR

-paper, drawing materials, and a circular object to trace (or can print and color the diagram attached below)

Enjoy, keep busy, and stay healthy!

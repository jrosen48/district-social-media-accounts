Additional resources will be made easily accessible to AP students and teachers through mobile phones and other devices. These include free online AP lessons and review sessions from some of the top AP teachers in the country.

The AP program is finalizing streamlined AP exam options that would allow students to test at home, depending on the situation in May.

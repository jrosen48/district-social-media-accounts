RE: Governor Northam notice to close schools

The following message just came from the Governor’s office. This takes effect beginning Monday. I sent out a message earlier today related to having teachers prepare some instructional materials to send home with students, but was expecting that we would have Monday’s teacher workday to complete this task. At this point teachers will need to send whatever they were able to put together today.

School meals must still be made available to students. We anticipate that this will be set up at each of the four elementary schools. I will get out more information on that as soon as possible.

Thank you.

Mecklenburg County Public Schools is pleased to announce that Mrs. Magie Wilkerson will be the new Principal at Bluestone High School beginning July 2. Mrs. Wilkerson is a native of Mecklenburg County and is a graduate of Bluestone High School. Her professional career has been in Halifax County. She has worked at the county middle school for 14 years serving the last three years as principal. During that time, she kept a close eye on her alma-mater as she continues to have family here. As a graduate of the school, she said she is “excited to lead BHS as the culture, climate and success are important to me.” Mrs. Wilkerson comes to us with exceptional experience and recommendations from her staff and the leadership in Halifax. We are looking forward to having her as Principal at Bluestone High School!",2019-06-21 08:35:27,,

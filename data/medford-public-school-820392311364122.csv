I have attached a link that shows our final weeks schedule. This of course is your students schedule. It can be subject to change, but it should be as close to what you will expect. If you have any questions please reach out to me. Also, there are some comments about graduation. I have a team that has been talking a lot and we will be summarizing our plans with you this week. Have a great week and tell your students what a great job they have been doing. I have been very impressed.

Thank you so much for the classroom set of the book PAX. The book fit perfectly with the theme of our second unit in Literature, “Animal Allies”. We read the book as a class and we all agree that it was an amazing read. Mrs. Feldhake (and a few of us) cried at the end. Your generosity and your support of our school experience is appreciated.

The 4th Grade would like to thank you for purchasing the Animation App. Creativity is flowing through 4th grade in a variety of ways with the use of this app! Students have created animated videos and raced a turkey through a maze they constructed in STEM. They are more able to apply their learning in projects and student engagement has increased when the app has been applied.

Sincerely,

The 4th Grade would like to thank you for purchasing the Animation App. Creativity is flowing through 4th grade in a variety of ways with the use of this app! Students have created animated videos and raced a turkey through a maze they constructed in STEM. They are more able to apply their learning in projects and student engagement has increased when the app has been applied.

Sincerely,

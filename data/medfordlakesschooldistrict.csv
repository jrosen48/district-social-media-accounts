Due to the grim forecast we are preparing for a parade in wet weather. 🌧☔ If it is raining at the scheduled time of our parade we will be having the parade in the front of the school along the sidewalk from the area of the library to the front entrance. We are asking for any parents who would be willing and able to bring and set up Easy-Up Tents in front of the school along the sidewalk areas so that the children can have their parade without getting their costumes wet. We believe we will need about 15 Easy-Up tents to be set up by 1pm from the entrance in front of the library to the front door.
We are asking parents and staff not to park in the front parking spaces to allow parents to line up and watch the parade.

Thank you so much in advance for your help and understanding! We look forward to seeing you all tomorrow to watch the witches, monsters, heroes, and all other Halloween Friends show off their costumes during the parade.

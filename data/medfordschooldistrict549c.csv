Medford School District Staff, Families, and Community,

As we mentioned in our communications yesterday, the COVID-19 situation is ever-changing. Late last night, Governor Kate Brown announced a statewide school closure for students in Oregon from Monday, March 16 through Tuesday, March 31.

Medford School District schools will be open today, March 13, and operating on regular schedules.

Another message will be coming soon about plans for this extended spring break. We are fully committed to doing as much as we possibly can for our students and families during the unexpected closure week, including providing meals.

Thank you for your patience and partnership as we work through this together. What does not change in this ever-evolving situation is our commitment to student, staff, and community wellness.

Sincerely,

Bret Champion
Superintendent

Cyberbullying is bullying that takes place using electronic technology, which includes devices and equipment such as cell phones, computers, and tablets as well as communication tools including social media sites, text messages, chat, and websites. Examples of cyberbullying include mean text messages or emails, rumors sent by email or posted on social networking sites, and embarrassing pictures, videos, websites, or fake profiles.

Social media sites can be used for positive activities, like connecting kids with friends and family, helping students with school, and for entertainment. But these tools can also be used to hurt other people. Whether done in person or through technology, the effects of bullying are similar.

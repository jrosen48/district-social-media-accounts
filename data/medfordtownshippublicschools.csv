Parents hear from school personnel including the principal, guidance counselor, nurse, and school librarian who share pertinent information about the school community and entrance into kindergarten. They get a look at what life is like in the kindergarten classroom via video presentations and photo montages, as well as hear from the kindergarten teachers themselves. While the parents take in information and interact through a Q&A time, the future kinders are treated to a stint in a kindergarten classroom. The highlight of the day is a ride on a school bus. For many, this is a first-time experience that brings excitement and smiles. Kindergarten Round-Up is a favorite day for all Medford staff.

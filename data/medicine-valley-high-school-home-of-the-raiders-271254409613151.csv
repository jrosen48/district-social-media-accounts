The highest honor that an FFA member can earn from their state association is the State FFA Degree.

It‚Äôs many hours of hard work, planning ahead and focusing on the end goal. It also includes learning to navigate a fairly unique (and sometimes challenging!) record-keeping system, completing an assessment and interview process, and participating in a wide variety of community service programming and FFA activities at the chapter, district, state and national levels.

Members who earn this degree receive a golden key to wear on their degree chain, and stay on track to earning the highest possible honor that the FFA organization can bestow, the American FFA Degree. Recipients also receive a free year‚Äôs membership to the Nebraska FFA Alumni group!

Look at what a teacher at Medicine Valley Elementary School In Curtis did for her six and seven-year old students today for May Day! So awesome. Mrs. Kristi Evans is one of our EVERYDAY HEROES today being featured on the news.

Kristi went 150 miles traveling around delivering the May Day baskets to her students. It‚Äôs a perfect holiday for social distancing (minus the kids if you get caught!!!) She said it‚Äôs the blessing she chooses to find - that she had time to remember the holiday!

Thank you Mrs. Evans! Your kids are lucky to have you!

I had seen the post about the bear hunt, but didnt think much about it until this morning. We took a ride around town because Lucy is a little stir crazy. When I saw the first bear, I almost ran off the road! I was so excited. The kids were thrilled!
For those who havent seen, it's based on the children's book ""going on a bear hunt"". The idea is to put a bear in your window, and parents can drive the children around on a bear hunt.

Congratulations to our Leaders of the Week- Ali Vocke and Caden Coombs!!

Ali Vocke is a 4th Grade student who is a quiet, but POWERFUL Leader. She doesn't boast or brag about herself. She is humble and kind and could easily get overlooked for how Great she truly is. She volunteers to help where help is needed. She comes in each morning to get the Fine Arts classroom ready. She makes sure everything is put in its right place. She does this because she loves to help others. She doesn't do stuff for the glory and accolades - she does it because she has a true servants heart. Serving others in need brings a sweet smile to her face showing that she truly enjoys her quiet role as a Leader at LCE!

Caden Coombs embodies what a leader should be. He is responsible and smart with the choices he makes. He reflects about how others feel and is kind at every turn. I strive to be like Caden Coombs.

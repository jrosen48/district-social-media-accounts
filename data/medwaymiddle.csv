April vacation is officially upon us. I wish you a restful and healthy week. I’m very proud of the students and families who have taken this incredible challenge placed on us all in stride. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the teachers who continue to work tirelessly to make the best of what is a terrible situation, the ed techs who work daily to provide additional support to students, the kitchen staff who are continuing to provide food and stability to our students, the bus drivers and ed techs for making those meal deliveries, and the custodians and office staff who are keeping the building going.

The coming weeks will continue to be difficult, but if we continue to support one another we will undoubtedly be successful! I will provide an update for our remote learning plan for the remainder of the year toward the end of the week.

Hoping your week is full of good health, sunshine, and fun!

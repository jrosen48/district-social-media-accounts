Dear Parents,

We are gearing up for the 2020-2021 school year! We are all very excited about this opportunity for a wonderful year at Melba Elementary School!

Reopening-
After gathering responses from the staff and community in regards to the Melba Reopening Framework, Dr. Adams will present the current version to the Melba Board of Trustees for final approval on August 3rd. The category in which the school will be opening (green, yellow, or red) will be determined at that time as well. With the information that we know right now, Dr. Adams will be presenting to the Board of Trustees to begin school in the “green” category. This information will be communicated with you as soon as the decisions have been finalized at the district level.

Please see the attached letter more additional information including, school start times, lunch and online learning.",2020-07-28 19:53:02,,

As we approach the end of the year we encourage you to make sure the information you have on file with us is correct. We frequently send emails to our parents via email. If you have not received any communication from us this year through this method, it is possible we don’t have the correct information. (check your junk and spam files first) We always ask parents to update information during registration in the Fall but want to be proactive as we can to help keep you informed of information as we proceed under these unprecedented times.

If you need to update your email please contact our schools at 208-495-2221.

As we near the end of the school year, I imagine that many students need or want to retrieve belongings that might be at the school. We are more than happy to help with that. Office staff are at the school Monday through Thursday from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm. Although students cannot enter the building, adults can so we can let you in and help you retrieve your students things. Or, your student can contact us and come to the door and we will go get their belongings for them.

Many of you are wondering about graduation. We have been communicating with senior parents but I wanted to let everyone know about graduation. This year we will have a graduation parade. All graduating seniors will be lining Broadway Avenue in front of the school and you can drive by and see them and help to celebrate their accomplishments. The parade will start at 7:00 pm on Friday, May 22nd.-more info to come-You may drop off cards or anything else that you would like to the seniors at that time.",,,0.0,"Melba Jr & Sr High-

Before the Covid-19 outbreak, students in Meghan Warner's Pre-AP Geometry class were assigned to build ""water towers"". The projects were due the week school was dismissed for the outbreak.

The instructions were to model the water tower after an existing water tower, calculate the volume of water the tower could hold, and compare it to an existing water tower. Students would also have received extra credit if the model they built could hold water as well.

Student Weston Edwards had successfully completed his project ahead of time.Using the conversion factor of 7.48 gallons per cubic foot, the real water tower holds around 281,500 gallons, and Weston's model water tower holds about 2.75 gallons and does not leak!

Attention parents of upcoming 7th and 8th grade students for the 2020-2021 school year, each of you were mailed a form to choose the elective your child would like to take, band, choir, basketball, or football, for the 2020-2021 school year.

It is very important to complete this form and return as soon as possible if you have not already done so. We are beginning to work on schedules for next year. Without this form our Counselors will have to place the students in an elective they may not want.

If you have any questions, please call Mrs. Yancey or Ms. Poole at 870 368-4345.

""Down at the Foot of the Mountain"" - Pam Setser

May 11 at 11:31 AM ·

Music Monday from Ms. Candi

Hello, students! Today I wanted to share with you some of the music I grew up listening to in my hometown of Mountain View, Ar. The first video is my friend Pam Setser playing the spoons. Her group is performing at the Ozark Folk Center. The second video is of one of my high school teachers, Steven Lance, and his son, Harry, playing dulcimers. Harry is playing a hammer dulcimer and Steven is playing a mountain dulcimer. I hope you enjoy! Have a great week!

This message pertains to all UNC Warrior Cross Country runners and any students 7th-12th grade interested in joining Cross Country. Cross Country practice will begin on Monday, August 17th. Practice will be from 7am-9am. Monday-Thursday practices will be at the track in Sebeka and Friday's will be in Menahga.

Menahga athletes will load the bus in front of the District office doors. The bus will leave from the District doors at 6:45am to head down to Sebeka. Please be on the bus 5-10 minutes early as we will have to do health checks. Cross Country is an outdoor sport and no mask will be required to wear when outside and/or during practice, but a mask will be needed when riding the bus and/or if we have to go inside.

We are very happy that the CC season is a go! We know it may look different with everything that is going on, but if we all work together we can make this yet again another successful Warriors Cross Country season!

Backpacks, headphones, supply boxes, clothing/gym shoes as well as high school class specific items are the responsibility of the family. All other supplies including pencils, erasers, markers, scissors, binders, glue, notebooks, wipes, Kleenex etc...will be provided for every student to start the year.

This decision has been made so we can be consistent for all students and give families a break in these challenging times. Please adjust your back to school shopping accordingly.

As a side note, The Menahga School Board fully intends and will financially support the return of students and staff to school to start the 2020-2021 school year and will provide reasonable accommodations for those students and staff exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 or have underlying conditions as defined by MDH and the CDC.

Ms. Rossbach teaches a class called the Art of the Unique Technique where students learn some of the more high-end arts and crafts and sometimes kitsch art processes (think painting on velvet!). Years ago, Ms. Rossbach consulted Mr. Lonnie Schmidt on what materials and tools were needed to start this only as a reference to get her dad started on stained glass. A few years later, after he mastered the art form, he taught it to Ms. Rossbach, who now, in turn, teaches her students not only how to do stained glass but design the patterns for it. That in itself is a tricky one! You just never know where or when you're going to learn something new, but we do and when the stories come full circle....well we just like to give credit where credit is due. Thanks, Mr. Schmidt for getting us started and Mr. Rossbach and Matthew John for their knowledge and wonderful donations of glass and more glass and even more glass!",0.0,"Menahga Public School added 6 new photos — in Menahga, Minnesota.

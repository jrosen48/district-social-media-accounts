The Yankee Candle Fundraiser will be ending soon. Catalog sales continue through October 21st. Quick reminder: there are two ways to order:

1. Catalog orders allow you to personally collect and deliver orders placed by family and friends. Catalog orders do NOT require a collection of sales tax, (since they are placed through the PTA,) and are delivered to school in a few weeks- in time for the holidays. For catalog sales, make checks payable to ""Menands School PTA"".

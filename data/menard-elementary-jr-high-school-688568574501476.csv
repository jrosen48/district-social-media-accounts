Menard ISD has released our official “Back to School Survey” on the school website at www.menardisd.net. We need it completed by August 5th so we can get the data together for both sets of students. Please make sure you understand that home based learning or in class instruction is your choice as a parent or guardian. Each six weeks you can reevaluate your choice prior to the new six weeks starting.
The virtual home learning will be different than last year’s packets. The Texas Education Agency has put rules and guidance in place for us to create a plan. Your child will have to check in, watch teaching, participate in lessons, and turn in work daily for each subject. If your child does not engage daily, then they will be counted absent for that day. They will be graded on the work that they are doing, and it will not be pass/fail. High school course credit is determined by daily attendance in each class.
Menard ISD at this time will only allow participation in extracurricular if your child is attending in class instruction.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=4403353819689581&id=688568574501476,"MENARDISD.NET

If you are an incoming 7th through 12th grader for the 2020-2021 school year and are interested in trying out for cheerleader or mascot (mascot is high school only), informational packets will be handed out in front of the elementary/JH building between 11:30-12:30 on Tuesday, April 21.

With the current situation, we will be unable to hold the mandatory parent/student informational meetings, so it is imperative that packets be picked up on Tuesday. Please read the packet in its entirety with a parent/guardian. The MISD Cheerleading By Laws and Rules have been updated and include changes from previous years, so please read carefully prior to making the decision to try out. The packet will include all information about changes to this year’s tryouts due to school closures and a permission form to complete and turn in at a later date.

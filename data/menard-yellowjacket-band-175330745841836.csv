I have a few students in band who have shown an interest in taking private lessons!

Private lessons are a big deal. Students progress quickly and have a greater chance of success. They learn new things about their instrument and all kinds of tricks! Greater success at an individual level means more success as a band.

If you would like more information leave a comment or message me. We have band directors close to the area who would teach and also faculty at ASU always support us. Price ranges vary depending on the person. When you get a full ride to college for playing music, I think it’s a win.

I absolutely love your kids. Summer band is off to a great start. Thank you for all the time you invest in getting them to and from practice. It’s going to be a tremendous year!

Congrats to
Roy brown for earning 1st chair for the 3rd consecutive year!
Aydan Wilson a second year player for earning 4th chair on trombone!
Zelia Halley for making 10th chair!
These students will perform with the allregion band in January.

A huge congratulations to jailah Payton, Mackenzie Wagner, Chloe Whitson, Korah mayfield, Nadia Garcia, and Tatum Ruiz for auditioning as well! Students did a great job representing menard!

Exciting things are happening with our band and I see nothing but continued success in their future. The past couple years we’ve only had 1 student competing. I was so happy to see more students involved and expect even more students to show off their talents next year.

Come see 5-12th grade menard bands put on their yearly winter concert December 6th at 6:30pm in the auditorium.

If you have questions or would like me to yay or nay a dress before they show up Thursday, shoot me a picture through Facebook or my school email. I will try and be accommodating. However if your child shows up in something I did not approve that is above the knee I will send them home.

Keep in mind this will be the first time some students perform and they have other things on their minds besides dress length and being on stage. I’m just trying to refrain from any student getting embarrassed.

I don’t have a schedule at this time. I’ll let you all know as soon as I know!

Here is what I presume we will do... (this may be completely different later in the week)

We will leave mid morning and eat lunch at ram jam. If there is a rehearsal that morning we may leave earlier to make it in time for that. I assume from there we will go to ram jam and eat.
From ram jam we will walk to the stadium for pregame. Kick off is at 2.
Once the game is over we will eat. Please bring money for dinner. I think we will go to raising canes.
I think the game will be over around 5-5:30. We should be back in town around 7:00.

If you need to leave earlier and your parents are there you may do so. This is just an extra event for experience and fun!!

I’m sorry I don’t have much Info at this time. Please make sure you have registered if you plan on attending.

Also! T-shirts are in! If you ordered a shirt and have a child in band I will be giving them the shirt. If you do not have a relative in band Send me a message and I can send it to a school office of your choice! Students that have not paid fees or for the extra shirts will not be receiving shirt.

Hey guys! I’ve been looking at our schedule. As some of you know I will be commuting from junction to menard this year as well as having a morning and afternoon route. That will not change much for summer band but may end up influencing a few time changes when the school year begins.

I ask that you just be open minded when it comes to some changes. I will try not to make it too complicated. If anything, times may be trimmed or moved up a few minutes. However, I will NOT do anything that would potentially hinder the outcome of this years success.

With that being said, I would like to make an adjustment to the marching band schedule. All students will need to be in attendance on August 2nd at 8am! Please DO NOT show up July 31st or Aug. 1!

Enjoy the extra time off. Remember that hard work, dedication, disciple and positivity all feed into success. I’ve never gained anything without the four words mentioned above!

I’ll be in the band hall this week. I could use some smiling faces in my life 😊

Much love!

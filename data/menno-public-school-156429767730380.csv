The Wellness Committee will be posting some regulations to follow while using the facilities and equipment. There will be a paper towel dispenser as well as bottles of cleaner to clean equipment before and after you use it.

Additionally, the Menno School Board would like you to know the following: Students may come to the gym and play basketball but will need to bring their own ball. If they play a pickup game, it will be their responsibility for that decision. People can come in and walk in the gym. Coaches can also schedule camps and there can be open gym time. The Board asks that parents make the decision on whether or not their children participate based on the own level of comfort.

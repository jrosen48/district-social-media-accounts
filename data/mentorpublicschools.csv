This update includes news of an adjustment to our remote learning plan: Flexible Fridays. Beginning next week (the week of April 20), for the remainder of remote learning, we have asked teachers to think of assignments in terms of a four-day work-week timeframe. Flexible Fridays will be for catching up on work if needed or, simply, enjoying family time.

At the elementary level, this means teachers will not give assignments on Fridays. At the middle and high school levels, teachers will give the entire week’s assignments on Mondays by 9:00 a.m. The work would be due on Fridays, but students have flexibility for when they complete it throughout the week.

Thank you for your continued support.

Some students even got a chance to have a mock interview with Mr. Porter, Superintendent of Mentor Public Schools. One of the leading interview prep techniques is to practice.

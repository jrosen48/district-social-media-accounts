Hello Everyone, this is my son John Michael Ortega. He is a 2020 Senior at Mercedes High School. John is a 2 time Regional Qualifier and a 2 time State Qualifier. He placed 1st in all six powerlifting meets he competed in this 2020 season. John is ranked #1 in State in his weight class. Johns goal was to bring a boys State title to MHS. Unfortunately this pandemic took that opportunity away from him. Nevertheless John will be attending Texas A&M University Kingsville this fall where he will pursue his career in Criminal Justice.🏋🏽👨🏽‍🎓",0.0,"Family and Community Engagement Mercedes-ACE is at Mercedes High School.

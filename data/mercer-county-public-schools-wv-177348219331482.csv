As school systems across the nation wrestle with the question of how best to meet the educational needs of their students in the midst of a pandemic, Mercer County is no exception.

What will the school day look like? What restrictions will be necessary to facilitate having students in classrooms? Questions that were inconceivable to West Virginians prior to March 16, 2020 are now at the top of the priority list.

As we look toward the new school year we would like to have your input on the options that MAY exist for your child. While all plans are subject to the approval of the WVDHHR, the WVDE and ultimately the governor, it is essential that we continue to craft a reopening plan that not only meets the needs of our students but their families as well.

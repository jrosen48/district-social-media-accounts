Wednesday Morning Update:

All the students are in their classrooms for the third day. Each morning has been smoother than the last. Your children are adapting to our new circumstances and tolerating the masks and social distancing well. Our plan is not perfect but I believe it is working as well as we could have hoped. I would like to take this opportunity to publicly thank all the teachers and staff at Apollo for all their hard work in preparing for this week and their ability to make lemonade out of lemons. I witnessed a lot of learning going on yesterday and it was happening in the classrooms, and in the woods and under the shade trees. Our staff has really risen to the occasion.

I would also like to thank all the parents for the patience, understanding, and grace they have shown us as we get this year under way.

It has been a whole community effort.

We have never done split attendance (some remote and some in person) so we may have some glitches to work through. Also, you don’t have to complete the symptom screener if you are remote, although, again, we’ve never done this so we aren’t positive how it all works!

Just a quick update ......
I am doing my best to get the rural routes finished up by noon tomorrow so if you haven't heard from me by 2pm tomorrow, please call me at (309)582-2922 to verify your pickup time and bus number. I appreciate your patience and support as we are transitioning into our new routine.

I'd also like to note that all of our buses will have monitors to kick off the new school year! They will be checking temps and guiding your students to the new seating arrangements. Please give your kids a heads up that things may be a little different but we are going to assist them through the changes we are implementing. Just a reminder .... masks are required on the bus and we ask that parents remain at the bus stop until your student is cleared to proceed onto the bus.

Thank you all and have a great evening!! Can't wait to see our buses on the road again and filled with our Eagles!!",5.0,"Johannes Bus Service - Aledo

Information Update:

Schedule: We will work through core class cohorts that will move classroom to classroom. I am looking to balance the issues with contact tracing and providing the best educational opportunity as possible with following guidelines. I feel this is our best option given the situation. Elective classes will not meet on a daily schedule but will have the ability to meet through the week during the time offset from lunch. The majority of elective classes will be through remote google classroom. Your student will receive an email with their first 3 week schedule by Friday.

I will post some videos about process and procedures for the Junior High Building as we close up the week as well.

Necessity Items needed for school: Chromebook Charged; pen/pencil.
We will provide the planner and binder on the first day of school.

Remote Learner Expectations: Log into TeacherEase each day for attendance. Complete Google Classroom assignments by their due dates. Contact the Junior High if you have internet access issues.

Prom update. Now that we have hit phase 4 and have guidance from the state, we had to make the hard decision to officially cancel our 2020 Prom. It is not possible for us to host an indoor event safely for the number of students who attend. It’s not what we want to do, but in order to continue keeping our students safe and healthy, it is what is best. We are sorry our seniors will miss out on the memories from their final prom night. As hard as this is, we hope that making sacrifices now will allow us to get back to normal sooner so we can get back to making memories with our students. We know our students will be disappointed by this decision, but we appreciate everyone’s understanding as we have all worked to do what is best for them in this unprecedented time. We are working on possible plans to still be able to have an in person graduation (outside) at the end of the month. More info on that to come soon. Be safe and stay healthy! #eaglepride",2.0,"Mercer County High School

Just like that 2020 IMEC ILMEA Festival has come and gone!

So very proud of all of our 6th grade students who participated today and for Zoe Nevels our senior who was selected in FMES (Future Music Educator Symposium) I can’t imagine working with better students than the ones that we are blessed with in Mercer county.
A huge Thank you to the parents, community and my fellow teachers who support the arts as fervently as you do. It is thanks to you we are successful to the scale we are.

Huge shout out to Rusty Ruggles and Kristen Reick!! Absolute rockstars in the classroom as educators but as an amazing help to me (Mr. Whan) both today and everyday. Thankful to have great colleagues that help unconditionally for our students.",0.0,"Mercer County Choirs

Place your order by next Tuesday 2/4 and I will deliver to your child’s school on the 12th. If you have a school preference, please note that in the “comments” box toward the end of the ordering process.

Merchantville School has a re-opening committee including representatives from the administration, board of education, teachers, nurses, parents, police and borough council. A survey will be sent out later this week to poll the community on re-opening school in September. The goal is to have a plan in place at the end of July that follows the state guidelines and ensures the best solutions for our students.

Please know that parents set the tone for children. When the plans are announced, read them in private and discuss with other adults in your house. Then come back and tell your children as cheerfully as possible how the Fall will go. Buy or make them a mask that they pick out and tell them how proud you are of them for wanting to keep others safe. Tell them to try their best. They are watching your reaction and will respond accordingly. Even if you are frustrated or upset, the best advice is to be a positive as possible with your child about the upcoming school year.

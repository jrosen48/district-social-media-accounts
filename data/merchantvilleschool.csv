Recently, you should have received an email regarding us having to cancel camp this summer. Camp Invention and Invention Project are offering different options with camp packages that you can refer to if you are interested in some fun hands on STEM activities at home. If you'd like to discuss refund options, call in to speak with a representative so they can verify where to return the funds to and get everything processed. Please call in at 800-968-4332. Due to call volume, there might be a 5-15 minute wait, but the best thing for you to do is just wait on the line because a rep will certainly be able to help you out once they get through. Voicemails and call-backs are okay, but again the easiest way to get through is just to wait. Right now they are super busy with calls to modify camp and customer needs. If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to Adrienne Browne at browne@merchantville.k12.nj.us .

Help U-Knight Merchantville!",12.0,"We hope you are staying safe and healthy during these unprecedented times. Although we are facing a crisis like never before, it is amazing to see the acts of generosity, support, and resilience happening throughout our communities. It is especially heartening to see how uKNIGHTed our Merchantville School community has been throughout the past month. The love and support felt during our school parade last week inspired our Merchantville School Student Council members to organize a fundraiser. We are hosting a fundraiser with a sale of ""uKNIGHTed"" apparel to show that we are a strong and unified community. All proceeds will be donated to various efforts throughout our community to aid Covid-19 relief.

The link to the online store can be found by clicking below. Our fundraiser will end on 5/5.

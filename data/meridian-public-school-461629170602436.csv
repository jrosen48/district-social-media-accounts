However, like many other events that take place in the 4th quarter, the elementary track meet was canceled due to COVID-19. Or so we thought.

This past week, elementary students were given the opportunity to participate in the elementary track meet, COVID-19 style. Students were given 3 challenges, with 3 events in each challenge. The ""1 minute challenge"" had students calculate how many exercises they could do in 1 minute. The ""endurance challenge"" had students see how long they could last when completing each exercise. Finally, if students had the equipment needed they were able to participate in the optional ""bonus challenge"".

All students that submitted their results gave an AMAZING effort. Below is the link for the track meet results. The top 3 students per class are listed for each event. Thank you to all that participated! We hope you had fun with this activity! Have a great summer!

So what exactly does ""flattening the curve"" mean?
‚Äì ""The phrase ‚Äúflattening the curve"" refers to the same potential number of cases appearing over a greater period of time. When a spike in cases occurs, health care resources can be overwhelmed. A flatter curve is slower, allowing people to recover and hospitals can continue to provide care to families, friends and neighbors who need it. Flattening the curve means everybody does their part to reduce spread for as long as possible.""

Spring is here.....

Severe storms are possible later today after noon.

This would be a good time to go over your plans with the family since a lot of people are home and/or kids are home with parents working just in case they need to find shelter.

This is from the Omaha NWS ....

Severe T-Storms will be possible today in eastern Nebraska and southwest Iowa. Some storms will be possible this morning, but these should be below severe limits. The highest chance for severe storms is Noon to 8 pm. Large hail, damaging winds & a tornado or two could occur.",0.0,"https://www.facebook.com/1639840626296543/posts/2580073045606625/

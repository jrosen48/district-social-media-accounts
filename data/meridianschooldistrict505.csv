Athletic Department Challenge!

With Spring Sports Suspended we want to encourage Meridian Students to stay active, while also following the Governor’s recommended stay at home and social distancing ordinance.

The Meridian School District Athletic Department is going to post 1 video a week, created by our high school coaches, to challenge Meridian students K-12. Each challenge will be sports specific but we do accept modified entries for students who may not have the necessary athletic equipment. Please respond to each post with your video of you accepting and beating each challenge.

Congratulations to Ms. Bryson-Chamley, the most recent recipient of the coveted MHS Culture Warrior Trojan Bobblehead!

Rosie does a wonderful job incorporating real world applications into the curriculum standards. Her students are learning how to be critical thinkers who can evaluate themselves and make changes to be better at everything they do. Her students continue to gain confidence as they problem solve together and with other students around school. She puts forth a lot of extra time and energy to ensure that her students consistently produce their best work and are prepared for life after high school. One of her students said it well: “Ms. BC helps a lot! She challenges me to work hard. She wants all of us to graduate. She cares for us and sometimes makes us stay after. She prepares us for our future. “ Well done, Ms. BC!

“Thank you for your thoughts and prayers for Jolee. As many of you know she had an awkward collision on the basketball court last night. She was rushed to St. Joe’s as she immediately had no feeling in her left leg and then shortly thereafter her right arm. It took almost 2 hours before she regained feeling in both extremities. Your prayers were powerful as the CT scan was negative. As you can imagine, she is very stiff and sore. She will have a follow up this week with her Primary Dr. where we should have more information about her injury and recovery.

Marisol Garcia and the International Club organized a ""Friendsgiving"" meal last week. Students and their families provided food popular in their cultures: tamales, papusas, spaghetti, rice, spring rolls, salad, flan and pumpkin pie! Approximately 30 students and adults attended, including MHS staff.

This was a wonderful celebration of cultural diversity represented at Meridian High School. This was also Marisol's personal leadership project in partnership with the International Club.

Every day in the United States, over 400,000 school buses transport approximately 25 million students between home and school. Collectively, school buses travel 4.3 billion miles each year. In Washington State, school buses provide over 700,000 student trips per day and travel over 100 million miles per year. When you consider field trips or activity trips, nearly every student rides a school bus at some point during the school year. Student transportation has the best safety record for any mode of ground-based, passenger transportation.

Last year, Meridian school buses safely transported 1600 students per day and drove over 500 extra-curricular trips for a total of 192,366 miles. Thanks for the great job our transportation staff does every day to keep our kids safe.

We had a fun and busy week at MMS!

We kicked off the week with a spirit assembly Monday morning. The assembly committee planned out a relay for a grade level competition. Some of the stations included stacking marshmallows, bubble gum blowing, and tossing a tennis ball into a pumpkin. It was a great way to start off the week and get the energy flowing.

We hosted a spirit week as well. The themes for each day were: Monday- Dress Up Day, Tuesday- Trojan Day, Wednesday- Anti Bullying t-shirt /Wear Orange, Thursday- Wacky day, and Friday- Comfy Day.

This all to lead up to the Fall dance on Friday evening. It was a lot of fun with a photo booth, Mr. D as our DJ and the boosters had the concessions open!~ Principal Jerry Sanderson",,,0.0,"MMS Goes Wacky!

CHRISTIANA🌟. October is National Principal’s Month and today we are highlighting Irene Reither Elementary Principal Mrs. Christiana.
Mrs. Christiana grew up as an Army Brat moving 19 times before she was 21 years old. She began her career teaching 2-5th grades. It was working as a teacher on special assignment when she realized she wanted to be able to make decisions for a school and also be part of a learning community that was fun and supported student growth. She attended the University of Washington for their Danforth Educational Leadership program to become a principal focused on equity and excellence. In her spare time she enjoys reading research, scrapbooking and country concerts. When asked what her favorite part about being a Meridian Trojan was she said, “I love that I get to be a part of a community where we can enjoy one another and also learn together to support our students”.

Trojans Athletes in the spotlight!

A few years ago our football team, along with our very supportive Football Team Moms and the MYS, started a program called ""Trojan Buddies."" This program pairs high school football players with a 4th, 5th or 6th grade tackle football player. The boys support each other throughout the year by attending games, writing letters or notes and sometimes bring gifts for each other. Last night, the high school players had the opportunity, after practice, to have dinner with their buddies. The weekly football team dinner was hosted by MYS parents and was a huge success. Thank you to all who were involved! It was a great night for all of all the boys. #trojanpower",0.0,"Bryant Michaelson‎Meridian School District 505 Athletic Department

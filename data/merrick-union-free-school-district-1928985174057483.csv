It has come to my attention that people are using the school playgrounds and fields in large numbers. I appreciate, the need to have children outside to burn off some energy and to play. However, the health authorities and the Governor have been very clear that everyone must practice social distancing and exercise caution to limit exposure to COVID-19.

FOR THE SAFETY OF YOUR CHILD, YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR COMMUNITY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE PLAYGROUNDS!

With appropriate caution as a community, we will help limit the impact of this pandemic.

Superintendent of Schools",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2624685287820798&id=1928985174057483,,0.0,"An Important Message from the Superintendent of Schools:

It has come to my attention that people are using the school playgrounds and fields in large numbers. I appreciate, the need to have children outside to burn off some energy and to play. However, the health authorities and the Governor have been very clear that everyone must practice social distancing and exercise caution to limit exposure to COVID-19.

FOR THE SAFETY OF YOUR CHILD, YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR COMMUNITY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE PLAYGROUNDS!

With appropriate caution as a community, we will help limit the impact of this pandemic.

I wish you health and happiness in these difficult times.

The theme for Birch PARP this year is “Birch Readers Are Laser-Focused.” During the two-week event, students are logging minutes that they have read, playing word games and visiting the Merrick Library with a partner from home.
Prismatic Magic’s Laser Reader show uses laser illustrations to show young readers how to use the mind’s eye to imagine places, characters and ideas. You can get a glimpse of the Birch show here: https://safeyoutube.net/w/wbFh",2019-01-29 12:00:49,,

Students accepted the challenge by working collaboratively in the school’s STEAM lab to design boats that can float and move with the wind.

Working in pairs, students were first asked to brainstorm ideas and develop their own list of materials, then create their boats using materials such as aluminum foil, popsicle sticks and plastic bottles. They learned that a good boat is watertight (with no holes), and possesses tall sides and a wide bottom with a sail tall enough and sturdy enough to catch the wind. Once completed, they set sail, testing their boats in water for buoyancy and experiencing much success!

Every Merrick second-grader will participate in this boatbuilding project, with Chatterton and Levy Lakeside schools scheduled for later this month.

The program incorporated multiple characters and explored four main topics: defining energy, the uses of energy, how energy is wasted and ways to conserve it. One of the main charcaters was Nikki Neutron, a junior superhero on a mission to stop energy from being wasted all over town. Throughout the show, Nikki taught students about various energy conservation methods and methods to cut down energy waste around their homes.

Following the presentations, teachers reinforced topics learned during the performance with classroom activities on energy. This cultural arts assembly was made possible thanks to the Chatterton PTA and PSEGLI. Chatterton students can now consider themselves part of the Energized Guys Team of superheroes that save resources and save the day!

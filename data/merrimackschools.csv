We expect to see continued light snow through the day. We anticipate up to 4 inches by the time of dismissal. At this time no ice, sleet or freezing rain is expected.

The DPW is working to maintain our roads. We are confident in their work and expect that their treatment of our roads will work to remove/melt most of the snow cover to ensure safe travels through Merrimack.

All evening activities will remain as previously scheduled.

As long as everyone takes their time and is mindful of traffic, we should have a great day.

However, winter chorus/band concert at the middle school is cancelled for this evening.

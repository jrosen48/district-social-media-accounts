The school is open for returning these items Monday-Thursday 9:00-12:00 this week. Additionally, there is a textbook drop off located in the front of our high school if you can not come during these office hours. You can use this drop box during office hours as well for your convenience.



We can not express enough how important it is to get these items back. To replace everything that is still not accounted for would cost us over $25,000 and that is just not feasible with the reduction in state aid that is looming down the road.



Thanks for your attention to this matter! Please call the school if you have any questions at (586)749-6000.",2020-06-22 10:46:36,,

Please fill out this survey as accurately as possible as some very important decision are going to be made off of the results of this.

We don't know what the CDC and MDE guidelines will be for next fall (That's what makes this so difficult to plan for), but we will have to follow these guidelines when announced. However, there are numerous other areas that we can preliminarily start planning for. There are many options that are being discussed at the state and local level.

I have been in the marching band and concert band for 2 years, and I started my junior year.

My favorite part of being in band was making so many fun memories, and laughing until I was crying at all the dorky stuff Mr. Kimsey would do with his students. It made me feel like I belonged, and it was my safe place away from the stress of my life.

My favorite memory is definitely meeting Mr Kimsey, as I remember being so terrified of what was to come, and he greeted me with open arms.

Being a part of the band has taught me perseverance and toughness through it all, as well as how to handle the things I struggle with on a daily basis. I also learned how to appreciate music and the people around me so much more.

My number one piece of advice is always trust Mr. K, and remember that he LOVES every single one of his students, and will always put aside time to help you no matter what.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10158324914149738&id=268613609737,,0.0,"Merritt Academy Bands

I have been in the Merritt Academy Band since my sophomore year.

I have been a part of the Imaginary Percussion Ensemble haha.

My favorite part of being in the band was I felt part of a community of like minded individuals who loved music and wanted to play it as well as they could. It was nice being good at something and being recognized for it.

My favorite band memory was going to Cedar point and loving the bus ride but being so scared at the park because at the time I HATED roller coasters.

Being a part of this amazing band showed me that when I put my mind to something I can get it done and this band showed me that this band is super special to me and I feel most what this band meant to me was just how to get along with people and know that everyone is trying their hardest to meet the same goal you are.

WE NEED YOU!!! We want this to be a special event for our seniors, who are missing out on the traditional walking parade on their last day of school. WE NEED YOU to help us line the parade route, make signs, make noise and cheer on these Mustangs.

The parade will be led by the New Haven Fire Department. (Thank you Mrs Lazaris for setting this up!)

ROUTE: the parade will stage in the Merritt HS Parking Lot and leave at 5pm, turning left out of the school driveway, going down Havenridge, turning RIGHT on Clark St, a hard LEFT onto New Haven Road, a LEFT onto Havenridge and back to school.

We are hoping our school family will spread out on the route and cheer on these seniors! Please contact a Merritt Administrator with any additional questions. We hope to see you out there on June 5th cheering on the parade :)",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10158272636444738&id=268613609737,,0.0,"Mark your calendars!

We have finalized the pick-up date for WEDNESDAY APRIL 22nd from 3:00-6:00pm... everyone who ordered will need to have a way to pick up on this date because we do not have freezer space to store orders that are not picked up.

Mr Girvin will take all the proper precautions to make sure the pick up is as safe as possible.

PICK UP TIME STARTS AT 3:00pm and ends at 6:00pm. If you need to request a later pickup time we can possibly arrange that but if we can get all orders picked up between 3-6 on April 22nd that would be fantastic.

Please contact Mr Girvin if there are any issues you need to work out. Order pickup will be OUTSIDE in the HS PARKING LOT....

Students in grades 6-12 with missing work may need to come and collect what is needed to complete passed due assignments. However, it is not necessary for students to come to school to gather textbooks for future assignments. If you have personal items at school that you will need in the next 3 weeks, you may come and get them until 2:00pm today. Thank you.",2020-03-13 12:25:26,,

Please take a minute to read below and click on the link to make your voice heard!

Just a few short months ago, Governor Whitmer vetoed $35M slated for charter students, using our kids as political leverage to achieve other budget goals. Together, we spoke up - 15,000+ teachers, parents, grandparents, school leaders and advocates alike - and our elected officials heard us loud and clear, restoring the funding after three long months.

Now, those same lawmakers are hard at work negotiating next year‚Äôs state budget, and they need to know that our students are a PRIORITY. Simply put, they need to hear that we won't settle for anything less than EQUALITY in this budget.

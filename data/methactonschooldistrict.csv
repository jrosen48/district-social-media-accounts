We are very disappointed to inform you, per the district email earlier this evening canceling all large gatherings and activities including outside groups, that the Methacton Dodgeball Tournament scheduled for March 21st, has been postponed.

This is an evolving situation and we appreciate your patience as we work to reschedule the Dodgeball Tournament. We will work closely with the District and follow the Health Department’s recommendations to ensure a safe and fun event.

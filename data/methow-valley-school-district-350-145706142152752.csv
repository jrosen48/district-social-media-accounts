It’s with a heavy heart that I’m reaching out to inform you that our schools will be closed for all in-person and remote learning today, Tuesday, September 8th.

As you’re likely aware, the fires in Mansfield and Bridgeport have resulted in power outages, limited internet services, down phone lines, and unhealthy outdoor air quality. These conditions are compounded by WA DOH and CDC guidelines calling for the opening of windows and time spent outdoors.

We will be reassessing the conditions throughout the day with the plan to reopen remotely on Wednesday, September 9th and return to in-person instruction with Cohort B returning to school on Thursday, September 10th.

Meals are available today at each of our three Drop Zones (Winthrop Red Barn, TwispWorks, and Carlton Fire Station) between 12-1 pm.

Meals will be delivered to each bus stop during our am routes and to our three Drop Zones every Wednesday beginning tomorrow.

The raccoon is Isaac’s spirit animal, “because they’re nocturnal. I prefer nighttime to daytime.” Isaac is thankful for the opportunities the ILC offered him during high school, and he’s glad to have played on the Liberty Bell tennis team. After graduation Isaac plans to take a gap year before attending HVAC school or enlisting in the military—he looks forward to living where there is more to offer a young, single adult. In 7 years Isaac sees himself living and working in either Washington or Northern Idaho. Congratulations, Isaac!

He’s thankful that sports, especially the football team, were a part of his high school experience. Congratulations, Jedidiah! We’re rooting for you!

The German Shepherd is Carter’s spirit animal—they’re never quiet, love to work, are always full of energy, and are very loyal. Carter is looking forward to going to Wenatchee Valley College and starting the automotive mechanic program in the fall. In 7 years, he hopes to have a house, a nice truck, a family, and a good paying job. Great work, Carter! Congratulations!

Bella’s thankful for the chance to participate in the Running Start program, and she plans to attend WSU in the fall to pursue a degree in the medical field. In the short term, Bella hopes to be able to spend one last summer lifeguarding at the pool, and in 7 years imagines she’ll be living out of state and paying off college debt. Great work, Bella!

In 7 years, Hailey hopes to have graduated with a degree of some sort and have a good job, and although she may not be back in the valley in 7 years, she plans on coming back eventually.

Hailey writes, “One part of my high school experience that I'm thankful for is being able to play sports. I feel like being a part of a team teaches you so much, and you also build extremely tight bonds with your teammates and coaches. I definitely wouldn't have many of the friendships I do, nor would I be the person I am today without them. Playing sports at Liberty Bell has taught me so many useful life lessons, and I can't wait to come back and watch in the seasons to come!” Congratulations, Hailey! We’re so proud of you.

After graduation Kristy (aka Alex) is looking forward to going out into the world and attending The Evergreen State College, which sounds like the perfect school for someone who identifies forest spirit as their spirit animal! In 7 years, Kristy imagines being an entrepreneur -- she plans to open a retail store that features original artwork and an herbal apothecary, along with textiles, jewelry, clothing, and sundry items from around the world, appealing to the bohemian. To help reach this goal Kristy plans to study art, business, and foreign languages.

Supt. Chris Reykdal Explains Student Learning & Grading Policy

Liberty Bell Jr./Sr. High School
April 23 at 4:57 PM ·

Greetings Liberty Bell Families,

If you haven’t already watched Superintendent Reykdal's message from earlier this week that explains OSPI's grading directive and guidance, I would encourage you to check out the link below.

I’ve been working with our Teacher Leaders and Administrative Team to develop our local equivalent that best meets the needs of our students, families, and staff. On Monday afternoon, I’ll be sharing Liberty Bell’s Remote Learning Assessment & Grading Guidelines with you. I believe these guidelines will provide students with clarity and flexibility while maintaining academic integrity and rigor.

In other news, I had the opportunity to virtually chat with a group of spirited Seniors earlier today. It was such a special gift to connect and laugh with them, answer questions, share stories, celebrations, and worries; and brainstorm ideas on how best to celebrate the Class of 2020. If you have any creative suggestions on how to honor the Class of 2020, I’d love to hear from you!

Be Well,
Crosby Carpenter

Supt. Chris Reykdal Explains Student Learning & Grading Policy

Greetings Liberty Bell Families,

If you haven’t already watched Superintendent Reykdal's message from earlier this week that explains OSPI's grading directive and guidance, I would encourage you to check out the link below.

I’ve been working with our Teacher Leaders and Administrative Team to develop our local equivalent that best meets the needs of our students, families, and staff. On Monday afternoon, I’ll be sharing Liberty Bell’s Remote Learning Assessment & Grading Guidelines with you. I believe these guidelines will provide students with clarity and flexibility while maintaining academic integrity and rigor.

In other news, I had the opportunity to virtually chat with a group of spirited Seniors earlier today. It was such a special gift to connect and laugh with them, answer questions, share stories, celebrations, and worries; and brainstorm ideas on how best to celebrate the Class of 2020. If you have any creative suggestions on how to honor the Class of 2020, I’d love to hear from you!

Be Well,
Crosby Carpenter

Dear Methow Valley Students and Parents,

Yesterday in my message sent out to families via School Messenger, I had estimated that our bus drivers and staff had prepared and delivered 400 meals... I was wrong. It was 566 to be exact!

When asked how it went, MVSD bus driver Vince Friggione stated, ""I love my students! I love their parents. I love this community... Seeing them at the bus stops and drop zone makes me smile. I'm inspired to be a part of the MVSD and to be of service to my community during this time of need.""

Looking Forward:

You can anticipate receiving updates regarding childcare and academic enrichment services in advance of Monday, March 23.

All Liberty Bell students, 7th-12th grade, were issued journals in 1st block this morning. The purpose of these journals, which also include a daily checklist, is to maintain consistency in learning and provide a common experience for all students. On Monday, March 23rd, we’ll be rolling out district wide academic enrichment opportunities. Students who were not able to attend school today can pick journals up this week in the main office or via our bus route delivery system. Stay tuned for more information.

Administered by Methow Arts and funded by a pilot grant from Icicle Fund, the Youth Arts Initiative is a three-year pilot grant that has a goal of increasing the dosage of professional arts education, with a focus on sequential art learning at the younger grade levels to establish a foundation in the arts for later years.

Youth Arts Initiative instructor Anne Aageson Venable, who is employed by Methow Arts to deliver the YAI program, provided students with an opportunity to make relief prints based on patterns observed in nature. They learned about thin and thick lines, textures, patterns, as well as some of the vocabulary of printmaking.

Art and biology intersected once again at the Methow Valley Elementary School annual 6th grade camp. Artist Judith Robertson worked with students to create clay mosaic tiles featuring salmon--which they had just observed during a snorkeling session in the Chewuch River with biologist John Crandall. The salmon watercolor paintings were led in a plein air session with teaching artist Kim Romain-Bondi. A storytelling session with Native American storyteller Dayton Edmonds rounded out the arts component of the camp.

6th graders do a long unit on salmon this year, and through clay sculpture, watercolor painting, and block printing they explore salmon through the lens of art.

It's estimated that the new greenhouse will add up to 14 weeks of educational programming and result in approximately 5,000 - 10,000 pounds of produce to be used in support of the school lunch program, providing all students with access to healthy, nutritious, locally-harvested meals.

On a related note, our students have been collecting pledges and raising funds in support of Agros International, a non-profit organization which provides opportunities for families in Central America to purchase land to provide sustainable agriculture practices for small villages and their families.

""And That's Who I Am!"" these collages proclaim.

Working with Methow Arts teaching artist Anne Aageson Venable, 5th graders at Methow Valley Elementary School explored their ""Who We Are"" International Baccalaureate unit through the lens of collage, creating display boards that feature photos, quotations, original poetry, and images that support their self-identity. First, they mixed paint to create appealing backdrops for their collage. Then, they spent several weeks writing poetry and collecting ""strata""--the layers of images and text they would use to lay out an appealing display on the background. Finally, they experimented with different layouts, considering balance, unity, shape, space, color, and emphasis. Then they glossed the whole collages over with ModPodge for longevity.

Good Afternoon, Students and Families,

We hope this message finds you safe and healthy. We wanted to provide you with a brief update for beginning school at Metro.

Earlier today, the Governor met with educational leaders, and the Arizona Department of Education also provided schools with an overview of guidelines. We are still expecting further guidance from the State as we finalize our plans.

Although we had planned on communicating full details today, we are incorporating today‚Äôs recent updates from the State into our plans.

We look forward to providing you with a full update tomorrow.

Thank you for your support.

Respectfully,

Cronkite news visited Metro Arts to interview students and teachers. Project Wayfinder is a year-long course that is taught to all Seniors at Metro Arts. It helps students cultivate a strong and intrinsic sense of purpose.

Purpose amongst teens has been shown to facilitate identity formation, increase positive attitudes towards diversity, attenuate antisocial behavior and bullying, decrease engagement in risky behaviors, and increase academic engagement. Furthermore, interventions to promote purposeful behavior have been found to lead to significant increases in grade point averages. https://www.projectwayfinder.com/why-purpose http://edl.io/n1144210",,,0.0,"Metro Arts in the News!

Start your Fall üçÅoff right and complete the FAFSA on Wednesday, October 2nd with your student!!!

It is really important for Everyone to complete the FAFSA. It is an assignment for Humanities class.

Do it even if you think your student won't qualify.

Do it even if your student is going to community college - there is financial aid for community college!

Do it even if your student is going to a vocational program - culinary school, etc. - they might have federal funding!

Do it even if your student is not applying to college/university - you never know!!!

There is limited funding, so do it on Wednesday!!!!

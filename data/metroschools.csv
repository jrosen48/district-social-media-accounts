We need equitable access for our students so everyone can learn in any setting. It is past time that our city and our school district provide a device for every student, and now we are moving much closer to reaching that goal. We will maintain our focus on equity by making sure that we prioritize areas of the city and students who have the greatest need during our deployment of devices ‚Äì and then work to fill the need for all students.

Mayor Cooper, thank you for working alongside Director of Schools Dr. Adrienne Battle to make our students, their learning and their growth a priority. Because when our students grow, our city grows, too. They are our future, and as we saw with the march that many of them led and participated in last Thursday, they are our present, too.",2020-06-08 10:54:42,,

Administration received requirements from the Governor's office yesterday and without any changes in our county's public health requirements, I am happy to announce that as of today, May 6, 2020, Mexia High School will be able to have their graduation on May 22 at Black Cat Field.

With the state's requirements our Class of 2020 High School Graduation will look very different than in previous years. More details will be coming soon from the High School as the Governor's requirements for social distancing are applied to our event.

Thank you for your patience as we work to make this graduation as memorable and safe as possible for all of our families.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=913815355699027&id=174521172961786,,0.0,"Mexia Seniors and Parents,

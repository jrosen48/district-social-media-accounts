Challenge #6
Today‚Äôs challenge is to build a car that operates using only the weight of a falling object to move forward. Materials will completely depend on what you have available, but things like straws, popsicle sticks, bottle caps, old cds, peanut butter jar lids, cardboard, tissue boxes, string, fishing weights are a few suggestions to get your creative juices running.

Novice: Build the device. If you‚Äôre stuck on what materials you could use a quick google search for gravity-powered vehicle and checking out some of the supplies people have used should kickstart things.

Intermediate: Use gear / pulley ratios to get the car to move forward VERY slowly, then reverse things to go VERY fast.

Advanced: Design your device to be multi-stage and be able to move forward to a set distance, trigger a mechanism and then move back toward your starting position.",0.0,"This looks like a fun one! Thanks for the daily challenges, Mr. Fellows!

Stuck inside in the rain
Challenge #3
Since the rain is keeping us inside, we might as well have a lengthier project for indoors. Taking inspiration from Tracey Reynolds it‚Äôs time to setup a Rube Goldberg machine that runs throughout your house.
Note: Kids (including grown-up kids like myself) you most definitely have to clean up your device so that you don‚Äôt feel the ire of the rest of the household.
Novice: Make it work using only one input (unless you make yourself part of the device).
Intermediate: Additionally, label all of the simple machines on your device. Include at least one inclined plane, 1st class lever, 2nd class lever, 3rd class lever, screw, wheel and axle, pulley, and wedge.
Advanced: Also, identify all of the sources of stored energy. Include at least one gravitational, elastic, chemical, and electrical.

Let your inner child run wild this weekend!

We welcome Mr. Pascoe and Ms. Teel back to the Board and are excited to welcome Mr. Yager for his first term. The newly elected members serve three-year terms and join other members: Heather DeMint, Nate Birt, Scott Nichols, and Nicole Nelson.

The vote count shows Lisa Ovaitt was not far behind, and we are blessed to have her in our school buildings often as she is a trusted and sought after substitute teacher who impacts students and staff with her passion for education and our Mexico community.

The election results will be certified at the monthly Board of Education meeting on June 16. The meeting will be broadcast live on the district YouTube channel accessible at mexicoschools.net.

Thank you to all the candidates who campaigned for teaching, learning, and caring at Mexico 59! #MEX59TLC

Never share personal information online.
Never send pictures or ask for pictures.

Mayor Shivers updated students, teachers, and community business leaders on the use tax, upcoming elections, and the city budget for the swimming pool. Parks & Rec Director Chad Shoemaker gave an update on pool construction and preliminary plans.The pool could be a 3.5 million project and would likely begin after July 5 of this year and hope to be completed by Memorial Weekend 2021. Shoemaker encouraged questions from the students and offered perks the kids and parents may be excited about with a new pool: climbing wall, low dive, drop slide, lounge chairs in the water, baby bungee, a depth charge, beach area, and other fun amenities.

The Mexico JAG program would like to thank Dagwood Jr's and Sonic for helping to make this event possible!

In an effort to get the devices in your hands as quickly as possible, we would like to highly encourage you to show up tomorrow Wednesday 3/25 if you are planning on picking up a device for your student. Pickup will start as before at 8a.m. - 12p.m. and again at 4p.m. - 6:30p.m. We will extend the evening time slot if there are parents still trying to pick up a device.

We are also going to open up the Secondary Student pick up at the Middle School tomorrow Wednesday 3/25 from 9a.m. - 12p.m. and again at 4p.m. - 6:30p.m. instead of Friday. This will give us the opportunity to open Friday back up if needed.

This is not mandatory. If you already have a device at home(Laptop, chromebook, desktop, ipad etc) you do not have to come pick one up. You should be able to access all content on your personal devices as well.

Again, if you are planning on picking up a device, please do you best to grab it sooner rather than later! Do not wait until Thursday!

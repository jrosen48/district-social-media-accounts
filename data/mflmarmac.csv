For the first time in school history, MFL MarMac has a Borlaug Scholar! Kira Rieck participated in the virtual Iowa Youth Institute today. She wrote a paper about the arising conflict within the heart of Uganda and defended her solution during a student roundtable discussion.

She also attended an Immersion Discussion hosted by ISU Associate Dean, Dr. David Acker. She learned about her future major, Global Resource Systems, and career of becoming a hunger fighter.

Kira received a $500 scholarship to the College of Agriculture at Iowa State, where she will attend in the fall. We are proud of her for being the first student to represent our school at this amazing event. Congratulations!",2020-04-27 16:34:58,,

Kelsey took 6th in girls discus. Skylar took 8th in girls discus and Nick took 8th in discus. Awesome job by all 4.

Tonight Kelsey broke the school shot put record (37‚Äô4‚Äù). Dethroning Jessie Baldridge of the spot. Also Brad set the school record for the seated shot put (22‚Äô5‚Äù). Congratulations to all of those above. Also had several personal records set these past couple of weeks from all of my throwers. #indianchop MGTF",0.0,"Brandon Strain

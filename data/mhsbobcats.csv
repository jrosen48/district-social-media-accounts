Students will work from home through Canvas and Buzz and will be able to contact teachers through emails and phone calls.

We have formulated a plan in the event that the entire district has to pivot to off-site learning. Friday’s remote learning will help us to discover any problems that might occur with that plan and give us a chance to solve those problems. Please be patient with us.

Tomorrow evening at 6:00pm the exchange students will be at the high school parking lot to say goodbye to one another and their friends. They will be practicing social distancing and we ask that those who are able to come to simply drive by and wave, share a sign or leave a note. As much as they’d all like to give hugs and high fives it is extremely important that none of them risk getting sick before they leave.
We really hope for a good turnout to let these kids know how much they will be missed.",0.0,"Sandi Pevehouse Hubbard is with GleeAnna Housley and 2 others.

MHHS Tiger Fans,

Wood River High School is not able to play us in soccer and football today. Volleyball will still be traveling to Wood River for tonight’s games. They can play us in volleyball because the NFHS deems volleyball as a low risk of spread sport. The 9th grade and varsity football games have been rescheduled for tomorrow, same start times 4PM and 7PM. Boys’ and girls’ soccer have been rescheduled for Oct. 3rd girls’ home at 11AM and boys at Wood River at 11AM. Obviously this situation is not ideal, but we are doing the best we can with it. We greatly appreciate your understanding.
If changes occur tomorrow morning (Friday) and we are not playing football I will once again send out a Blackboard message. Coaches will also be getting info out to players.

Thank you for your time,

Tiger Fans,

We wanted to thank you in advance for your help in upholding the covid regulation that we have had to put in place for this year. We realize that not all schools in our conference are requiring the same regulation that we have put in place. Please note that when attending games here at Mtn. Home Schools, masks and family group social distancing will be required at all venues, including outdoor games. We understand that these new protocols can be frustrating, but are necessary at this time. We greatly appreciate you working with us to follow these safeguard requirements which allow us to continue our sports/activities programs.

Did you know our district is working on creating a K-12 alignment for computer science through a partnership with the National Math and Science Institute? Our tech coaches Kristi and Sarah attended professional development this summer and last summer on incorporating computational thinking and coding into their curriculum. They shared what they learned and trained other K-2 teachers on incorporating computational thinking and Scratch Jr into their current curriculum recently. We don't let social distancing stop us from providing teacher PD! Social distancing, masks, and hand sanitizer make all things possible. #letstacobouttech #mhsd193 #cs4all #computationalthinking #scratchjr #teacherPD",0.0,"MHSD Technology Integration

This is 16-year-old Kylee Cook. She lives in Mountain Home, she’s a good student, and she loves to play softball. She hopes to play softball in college one day. Big dreams!

Kylee works in Twin Falls a couple of days a week, and that’s where this touching photo was taken.

Kylee says she saw this grandma on the sidewalk - with a grocery bag that had split open and spilled. People just drove right past her. Kylee stopped to help, and she used her hair scrunchie to tie her stuff back together. She says the older woman was so nice and appreciative! It made Kylee’s day just to help her. It’s the little things that mean so much.

Thank you, Kylee! People like you make Idaho a wonderful place to live. ❤️

Boise State’s Community Impact Programs signature programs were designed with community stakeholders based on their specific community needs, and the outcomes are owned by each community. The three signature programs are: Mountain Home -- Cyber-Entrepreneurship, Payette -- Community Health Systems, McCall -- Outdoor Recreation, Hospitality, and Wellness. Each program incorporates a deep connection between community, faculty, and students through a combination of off-campus experiences and accessible online education. All programs are developed with a built-in and enhanced student support system.

As we introduce these new programs, we are extremely excited and grateful for our partnership with these outstanding communities!

What I have witnessed is a community who has joined together for the betterment of students, schools, and each other. I know there are many questions and unknowns about next year. I will continue to keep you informed as we plan for next school year. I am hopeful we begin the school year with some sense of normalcy. We will plan for many different scenarios so we will be ready for school in August. In the coming months continue to support each other.

THANK YOU: On Friday we are teaming up with the Mountain Home Air Force Base Gunfighters to perform a flyover over 11 Idaho cities with two 124th Fighter Wing A-10 Thunderbolt IIs and two F-15Es in honor of Idaho's medical workers, first responders and all essential workers.

The flight path was selected to say thank you to a large number of the essential workers that have kept Idaho running during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mission provides the chance for active duty and National Guard pilots to fly together, demonstrating the close total force relationships the Idaho military community shares.

Residents should observe the flyover from the safety of their homes or worksite and should refrain from travelling to see the flyover. Social distancing should be practiced at all times.",3.0,"Idaho National Guard

Email from MHHS recognizing our spring sports senior athletes. Click link for names and photos.

The Mountain Home High School administration and coaching staff would like to take this opportunity to recognize our outstanding senior student athletes. Due to the current situation spring sports senior nights are another event, on the long list of events, that our senior students will not get to experience. To that end let us take a moment to celebrate these exceptional student athletes. These students have worked very hard to achieve at a high level in both academics and athletics. They have represented our school, our community, and their families at the highest level. Thank you, “Seniors”, for all you have done to uphold and further the traditions of Mountain Home High School. We are proud of you!!!!

With MHHS being closed for students to come to the greenhouse and the shop for class, I have spent hours in the greenhouse trying to keep our plants alive. There will be a plant sale this year! It will look a little different than planned. It will be a drive through pick up at the greenhouse May 6-9. I will post an online order form a week before the pick up date. All the donations will go back into the agriculture program to be used by the classes and FFA.

Dear MHHS Parents and Students,

We have been receiving some questions that would require people to come into the building at MHHS. Some of these questions are in regards to picking up caps and gowns, cleaning out lockers, picking up yearbooks, and turning in chrome books at the end of the semester. Along with graduation planning, we are currently working on plans that would allow small groups of people into the building to retrieve some of these items in the near future. We will have more information out as these plans are solidified. We truly appreciate everyone’s patience and understanding through this difficult time. Stay safe and Go Tigers!

❤️ Month of the Military Child is in April. We invite everyone to participate in decorating their driveway to celebrate Military kids! Please post pictures on this post or PM our page as I would like to include some in the yearbook!

❤️ If you would like to share any pictures of your children online learning/doing activities at home while schools are currently closed, please post or message those to us as well! I am planning on including that in our yearbook because it will definitely be something to look back on later on. Teachers, this includes you too!

❤️ Stephensen is providing school lunches to children from 11:30-12:30 every weekday.

❤️Month of the Military Child shirts are on track to be delivered today! Details about distribution of shirts will be available soon.

My favorite time of basketball season is senior dinner. It’s great to spend time with the family and enjoy the camaraderie. Lots of people judge the success of a season based on wins & losses. I have & will continue to base the seasons on the fun, experiences & life time relationships we build throughout the season. Very special to have athletes like Tyrus Hansen, Caden Ash, Westen Smith & Anthony Flores, who we’ve known most of their school life, be a part of our program. Kane Binkley, Noah Moseley & Anthony Mann joined us as freshman & sophomores & have made this program absolutely fantastic. Managers were amazing this year. We were lucky to have seniors Chloe Smith, Taylor Springer & Ryleigh Lemanna as managers along with the rest of the crew. Sports will always be bigger than wins & losses. We’ve been blessed with an amazing fan base, great student athletes, fantastic parents and the absolute best administration a program could ask for. A perfect, successful season in every way. #Tigerpride #Family #theykeepmelaughing",0.0,"Mountain Home Boys Basketball

We’ve been blessed with an amazing fan base, great student athletes, fantastic parents and the absolute best administration a program could ask for. A perfect, successful season in every way. #Tigerpride #Family #theykeepmelaughing",2020-02-12 10:19:22,,

Hello Parents,

This afternoon (@ 12:40), our staff and local police received an alert describing an emergency situation on our campus. Immediately the source of the report, a school staff member who inadvertently engaged the notification system, was contacted. It was determined that the report was a false alarm. Soon after, the police arrived and confirmed this account. Students were then escorted back to class and an announcement was made to the staff and students that we had received a false report and that we were clear to proceed with our regular classroom and school procedures.

Thanks,

In 1916, an icon was added to Red Hill to recognize the institution’s evolution from the Academy of Idaho. For nearly 100 years, the icon overlooked Idaho State University's campus, serving as a symbol of pride and tradition for thousands of alumni. The historic symbol was removed in 2014 due to safety concerns related to erosion. On Oct. 10, 2019, the Bengal community came together to celebrate the campus treasure’s restoration. At 71 feet long and 24 feet wide, the new Red Hill “I” is an exact replica of the old icon and retains the original coloring.

Our thoughts are with Aaliyah Shepard as she recovers. Aaliyah, a 8-year-old Mountain Home girl, has been seriously burned in an accident with a holiday candle. Aaliyah loves Christmas and has asked to be sent Christmas cards to decorate her hospital room. Cards can be sent to:

Stopped in today to see Mrs. Straw, principal, North Elementary. Her students wrote lots of cards and have a gift for Aaliyah, who is recovering in Utah. We have a person traveling to see Aaliyah, leaving Tuesday morning. If anyone has a card or something to get to her, I will make sure it gets there. PM me. Way to go, North Stars! Aaliyah will be so happy to receive your words of support! ""Nix""",0.0,"Mountain Home AFB School Liaison Officer

Following this afternoon's meeting with the Fayette County Health Department, a return in Plan A -Traditional Setting- is still being supported for students at Miami Trace. We appreciate the cooperation and partnership with our local health department.

Please understand, conditions change daily, so it is very important to check your email along with our district website and social media pages. Miami Trace adopted a Restart Plan Guidance Document on July 13, that includes multiple learning plans, and we must be ready to use any of them (Plan A- B- or C) at any point in the future should conditions change.

Just a reminder, please make sure you have completed the InfoSnap re-registration for your child(ren). This needs to be submitted before a student receives a technology device.

Good afternoon. On Thursday evening I verbally agreed to become the new superintendent of the Newark City School District. This is a bittersweet moment for me. I am excited for a new opportunity, yet sad to be leaving such a special place.

I will be forever grateful for the opportunity to serve as the superintendent of this district for the past seven years. Miami Trace will always hold a special place in my heart. I have made many memories and friends that will last a lifetime.

Over the past seven years I have attended many contests, activities, and events in this district. I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed in the way our students have conducted themselves. They always represent Miami Trace with class. This is a tribute to the families and staff that work with our students everyday.

The future for Miami Trace is bright, and I will remain one of the biggest fans. Thank you for making my family and I feel at home for the last seven years. Go Panthers!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1561731760643695&id=226179097532308,,0.0,"Message from Superintendent

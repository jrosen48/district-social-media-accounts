We are excited to inform you that educational packets will be available today. We will have academic work on each van during meal deliveries. Please check delivery times on the website or call Lori at 928-425-3271 x1363. We will also have packets available at Bejarano School between 10:30 and 12:30. We will continue to provide work in this manner each Tuesday. You can return the work the following Tuesday when you pick up the next packet. Should your child complete the work earlier, you can send it back with the van and we will get it to your child’s teacher.

Last week, Governor Ducey and Superintendent Hoffman extended school closures through April 10, 2020. I will continue to send updates as they become available to us. Please stay at home and healthy during this time. We care about the families we serve and hope you are all well.
Thank you for your continued understanding.

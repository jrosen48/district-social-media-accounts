I also want to remind you there is no school on Monday, September 7th, as we recognize Labor Day. I do not know if there has been a more welcoming time for a three day weekend, and I hope yours is safe, fun, and relaxing.

We appreciate your continued support! As always, please feel free to contact me at (918) 542-8455 or jhogan@miamips.net with any questions or concerns.

Please remember to continue to practice the three “W’s.”

Gob bless and have an excellent three day weekend!

Hopefully, this finds everyone safe and healthy. While planning for the 2020-21 school year continues, our team wanted to release the updated school calendar so that families can plan. The first day of school has been moved up one week to August 12th, and the updated calendar includes seven off-site virtual learning days. The purpose of the virtual days is two-fold: first, to provide a trial run for distance learning and second, to clean and sanitize school buildings. The last day of school remains the same. Start and release times for each school site will be released soon.

Thanks for the continued support as we diligently work to plan for the upcoming school year!

I hope this finds you safe and healthy. With the Memorial Day (May 25th) holiday rapidly approaching, I wanted to reach out and provide you with an update on summer meals. Miami Public Schools will provide meals one last time on Wednesday, May 27th, at our curbside pickup and delivery locations. These meals will be for the week of May 25th--29th. Beginning June 1st, Sodexo will start providing both breakfast and lunch as a dine-in or pickup option at the Boys & Girls Club of Ottawa County. The club is located at 830 D Street SE in Miami.

I want to thank our child nutrition staff, bus drivers, and all others who helped us provide over 100,000 meals to the children of our community over the last ten weeks. Their dedication and work to ensure children were feed during the pandemic is a prime example of The Wardog Way!

I continue to pray for the health, safety, and recovery of everyone in our community.

All the best,

The purpose of the survey is to ensure MPS has up to date contact information for all parents and guardians, and to allow parents who will have children in grades 1st-3rd for the 2020-21 school year to indicate which school they would like their child to attend.

The lights are a beacon to show the Senior Class we are thinking of them and to remind them there will be a time where we will be all together once again.

The “Be the Light” campaign has been spreading across the nation as schools look for a way to celebrate their graduating seniors who are having their final memories in high school stripped away due to the outbreak.

We have had numerous community members and others reach out on how they help the Douthit family during this difficult times. Angie has inspired many with her faith, fortitude, and positivity she has displayed in her battle with cancer. Earlier in the year a fundraiser was held to help the family pay off the mortgage on their home. So, please see below for information on how you could help the family in this area, if you desire to do so.

My parents do not wish for a go fund me to be set up. However, I do not want momma Angie to stress another day about leaving my dad with a house payment and medical bills.
So many of you helped out with that this summer in the Angies Race fundraiser. We want her at peace and some are asking how they can help.
The PayPal account that we set up for the race is still open and attached to her bank account.
I know its Christmas time, and money is tight for everyone, however These small donations add up and this is the least I can do for her at this time.

Thank you everyone for your love and prayer and please pray so hard for her to have this pain relieved, she is the toughest woman I know and is in great pain. Please also pray for my dad.

1 Corinthians 15:55 “O death, where is your victory? O death where is your sting?”
Today was a little rough. Scans showed results that were not good. The cancer had grown in the liver and in the brain. There is also some hemorrhaging in the brain. I will have two more doses of radiation and that will be the last treatment I will be given. I should be able to go home in the next few days. We have decided to have hospice come in when I go home for some extra care. I haven’t been able to open my eyes all day and my head has been hurting badly. Kaylee has had to help me write this post. I’m not sure what to say...other than how God told me early in my diagnosis that He would heal me but I would have a long dark journey to take: I’m starting to think this is what He meant by long dark journey. So please pray for me that I will be strong and be able to stop vomiting. Also, please pray that I will be a mighty warrior for Christ. I love every one of you.

I am writing to let you know the funeral service for Nichols Upper Elementary School student, Kayla Billings, will be held Monday, October 28th at 10:00 am at First Christian Church. Graveside service will follow at G.A.R. Cemetery in Miami. Nichols Upper ES will not be in session on this day so that our staff and students have the opportunity to attend Kayla’s services. While we have staff from other sites that will attend the service, we will have adequate supervision and do not need to cancel school district-wide. I apologize for any inconvenience the closing of Nichols may cause on this day, but I hope you understand the need to do so.

Also, I incorrectly listed the date for the fundraiser being held to help the family. The fundraiser is Sunday, October 27th from 1-5 pm at Rocket Park in Miami.

I am writing to deliver some unfortunate and tragic news. Last night we lost one of our students in what appears to be a senseless case of domestic violence. Out of respect for the family, we will not release the name of the student. I can share that the student attended Nichols Upper Elementary School. Our immediate plan is to meet with Nichols staff this morning to notify them of the situation and discuss putting support systems in place for when we return from Fall Break on Monday, October 21st.

If you would, please keep the family and the school in your thoughts and prayers as we grieve the loss of a precious child!

It also raises money for the Stand and Deliver Public Speaking Conference in January. Students will learn to overcome the nation’s number one fear of public speaking and develop a strong speech to present in the spring.

The meat sale also helps the FFA chapter raise money to compete in leadership development events, like speech contests, and career development events, like sporting clays and agricultural communications.

Every child has the ability within them to be creative, and this may manifest itself in many different ways. The role of the school and the teacher is crucial in providing a safe environment where a child feels as though they can express their creativity, explore it, and understand its significance. At MPS, we embrace and encourage creativity as it is an essential part of a child's development. However, creativity will not happen on its own accord; it has to be coaxed out and cultivated. This is demonstrated well in The Wardog Way, Episode 9 - Creativity.

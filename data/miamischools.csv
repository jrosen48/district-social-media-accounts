Our County’s move to Phase 2, announced by @GovRonDeSantis, lifts a roadblock that prevented us from taking steps to reopen schools. With guidance from medical experts & the School Board, we're optimistic that we'll be able to make an announcement prior to Sept. 30, as planned. Our schools will have additional health and safety protocols in place ahead of students returning. As we previously shared, there will be choice in our District for those parents who opted to continue remote learning during Phase 2. #MDCPSReopening",81.0,"Alberto Carvalho

We are ever-cognizant that many families have already begun planning for a return to schooling through their preferred model for Stage 2. However, in light of the viral surge in our community, we believe it is in the best interest of our students and employees to delay the return to the schoolhouse and commence the 2020-2021 school year from a distance. Beginning the week of August 24, we will engage families, students, and teachers in a week of learning and orientation.

Over the past several months, our nation and community have been responding to an unprecedented crisis as a result of #COVID19. With a high level of preparation and the foresight of the School Board and leadership team, we have been engaged in the challenging task of planning for the reopening of schools this fall. As we developed this plan, we established a workgroup comprised of leaders in our community and medical experts who provided guidance critical to informing our practices, as we face a virus associated with significant unknowns and ever‐changing circumstances. The workgroup gave unanimous support to the proposed #MDCPSReopening plan, which is comprehensive in nature and incorporates guidance from national, state and local experts. This plan hinges on conditions in the local community & whether or not Miami-Dade County Government is in Phase 2 of reopening according to The Plan for Florida’s Recovery.",135.0,"Alberto Carvalho

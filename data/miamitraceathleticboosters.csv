Wow. Frigid is an understatement for the match's weather today ⛄️ We played a strong Wilmington team, but we had a lot of promise in the beginning sets on all courts! We took another 1-4 loss, but with the mindset of seeing some SERIOUS improvements in all players, especially in some new positions! We're only 0-3 overall, and we're ready to keep grinding with 3 more matches this week.",0.0,"Miami Trace Boys' Tennis

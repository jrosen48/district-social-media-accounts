As we approached the 2019-2020 school year, I had a thought to do a memory video that captures what makes this school so unique. When the pandemic hit and schools closed early, many of the final events that were planned to close out the school had to be cancelled. Because of that, I really struggled with how to approach this video. I have every yearbook except for 3 or 4. So, I decided to take a look back starting in 1962 and work my way forward. Hopefully, you will see your friends, or yourself, and it will spark memories and conversations about the times shared inside the walls of Del Crest Junior High/Middle School.

This is a glimpse, a snapshot if you will, of time gone by. Part 1 focuses on the 60s and 70s. Part 2 will cover the 80s and 90s while part 3 will be from 2000 to 2020 and the end of the school as we know it.

Polls will be open from 7am-7pm. The bond projects were presented and approved by the Board of Education on January 28th. Due to COVID-19, the Board moved the election date to June 30.
All of our schools will receive improvements if the bond passes. Remember, in Oklahoma, schools must have a supermajority of 60% in order to pass a bond. This bond election will not raise taxes. Please remember to vote tomorrow. For more information, please visit us here: https://www.mid-del.net/june-30-2020-bond-election",2020-06-29 12:05:43,,

Included in the Bond Election, are improvements to all 15 Elementary School playgrounds! This would include new/updated playground equipment, increased accessibility, and increased shade coverage as needed!

The total bond amount is $8,840,000. Each school would receive improvements on this bond. The projects in the bond election include playground equipment, improved accessibility, band/orchestra uniforms, fine arts equipment, bathroom and classroom renovations, and security upgrades.

If the bond passes, millage rates will remain the same. This is NOT a property tax increase for our community.

Blessing comes in many forms, but for our SWAG recipient Savina and her mom Sabra, the blessings came directly from Troy McCollum. As many of you remember, Troy’s wife, Troyan, was our SWAG recipient in 2019. She lost her long battle with ALS in November, but they were so appreciative of everything our fund raising was able to provide for them in Troyan’s last months.
Now Troy is choosing to “pay it forward” and has donated his wheelchair accessible van to Savina’s family!!!!

Titan Families,

Because we have a difficult route to cover, it would be difficult for our teachers to parade through the neighborhoods to wave at our students.

However, we desperately miss your sweet faces and want to see you. Therefore we will be having a drive-thru parade. Our teachers will be parked in the CAHS parking lot in front of the main building for you drive through to wave at the CAHS staff!

In order to comply with social distancing regulations, it will be drive through only and Titans will not be permitted to be out of their vehicles. We are also requesting that our student drivers comply with all social distancing guidelines before, during and after the event. We know you miss each other, but we need you all to stay healthy and safe!

This is a difficult time for all of us, but we wanted to make a way to see our students! Bring your signs, smiles, waves, and air hugs on Tuesday, April 7 between 6-7 PM!

WE CAN’T WAIT TO SEE YOU, TITANS! WE LOVE AND MISS YOU!",5.0,"Carl Albert High School

Barnes Families,

Because we have a difficult route to cover, it would be difficult for our teachers to parade through the neighborhoods to wave at our kiddos.

However, we desperately miss your sweet faces and want to see you. Therefore we will be having a drive-thru parade. Our teachers will be parked in the Barnes parking lot for you to bring the kids and drive through to wave at the Barnes staff!

In order to comply with social distancing regulations, it will be drive through only and Bluejays will not be permitted to be out of their vehicles.

This is a difficult time for all of us, but we wanted to make a way to see our kiddos! Bring your signs, smiles, waves, and air hugs on Wednesday, April 1 between 5:30-6:30!

Last friday night our boys’ basketball team played the highly ranked Lawton Wolverines. They were able to bring home another victory! That win made us the Big 8 Conference Champs. This will be our 12th year hosting regionals this upcoming weekend. No other 6A basketball program has ever done this. We are twenty wins in the season with only three losses. When we asked Coach Bradley if he had anything else he would like to add he said, “I love my team and we work hard every day!”

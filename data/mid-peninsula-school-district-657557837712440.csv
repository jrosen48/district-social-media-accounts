Materials left at school: Once the stay at home order is lifted we will set up a few days and evenings that you can come to the school to gather belongings. If you have something at school that you must have sooner, please contact me and I will make an appointment for you to pick it up.

Packet return: We will be delivering food each Monday, and when we are delivering we will also pick up packets. Please leave them outside at the food drop off.

I am working with partners across state government to ensure educators, parents, and students have the support they need, and to ensure our children who rely on school for meals have access to food.

I know this will be a tough time, but we’re doing this to keep the most people we can safe. I urge everyone to make smart choices during this time and to do everything they can to protect themselves and their families.

As a senior, Camryn carries around her 3.94 gpa as if it’s just another thing to put in her backpack, no more impressive than any other book, badge. or honor she’s got stowed away in there. That’s because she expects excellence of herself; therefore when she reaches it, it’s nothing but normal. When preeminent students play three sports, she does four; while they accrue high scores, she sets high school records. For Camryn, it’s not enough to do four years of high school. She’s doing a fifth, through the EMC program with Bay College. And while others go on to study ultrasounds, she intends to pursue “sonography.” It’s even been told that while hunting with her father, she once shot two deer with a single bullet.

Chevy Koski has attended Mid Peninsula from before the time she could read or write. A natural leader, she is the president of both the National Honor Society and the student council. In addition to organizing and implementing all and sundry school events, she inexplicably finds the time and energy to be a stand-out athlete as well. And all this is over and above her current status as class salutatorian. Basically, Chevy is the Captain Marvel of Mid Pen – though whether she can destroy an entire starship with her bare hands has yet to be proven. This being Chevy’s senior year, she is busy planning her future. As an EMC student, she expects to attend Bay College before pursuing a math-related degree at a four year university and employing her super powers for the good of all womankind.

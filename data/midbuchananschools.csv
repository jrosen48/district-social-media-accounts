Dragon Fans,
Please note we are knee deep in our parking lot and asphalt project. The contractor was delayed in starting our project due to weather delays throughout July and early August. However, the goal is to still hopefully have this all done by next week.

With that being said, please note the contractor will have the eastern half of the main parking lot shut down tomorrow (Wednesday) and then the western half shut down on Thursday to do the seal coating. Even though we do have Open House for elementary tomorrow and Thursday, we feel that the open half of the lot will be sufficient to allow enough parking since the Open House event is on a rotation basis.

We ask that anyone parking in the main lot tomorrow and Thursday to please be patient and careful doing so. Again, we appreciate your patience and understanding as we keep chipping away at this project.

Thanks so much,

As we near the start of the new school year, most districts are dealing with a shortage of substitute teachers. One of my main concerns with keeping our doors open this year could be impacted by having enough subs available for us. In response to this concern, I am very happy to announce that the Mid-Buchanan School District has increased the substitute teacher pay.

1. Substitute teachers that have the 60 college hours to receive certification - $105 per day (this is up from $90 per day).

2. Substitute teachers that are certificated teachers or retired teachers that still have a valid certificate = $125 per day (this is up from $90 per day).

3. Long term subs will receive $140 per day starting on the 11th consecutive day. This rate is the same as last year.

WE NEED SUBS!!!
If you or someone you know may be interested in getting on our sub list please contact our HR Director, Stacey Rasco, as soon as possible by calling 816-238-1646 or by emailing her at srasco@midbuchanan.k12.mo.us

Hello Dragon Nation,

The link below will provide all parents and students updates to our 'Return to School' plan for 2020-21. I recognize that some of the updates may cause frustration for some but peace of mind for others. I ask that we all please set aside our political positions on these topics, as these new updates may very well allow us to keep our doors open longer once we start the year. I want to do everything we can to keep our doors open and our students safe while engaging in learning, activity programs, and athletics. Please support us by ensuring your child is ready to follow all of the requirements encompassed within the updated plan.

Thanks so much!!!
Jay

Precautionary means that we are not allowing students outside of the building unless accompanied by a legal guardian (i.e. parent checking their child out, etc.). As normal, all exterior doors are locked.

Again, this is just precautionary. I will send out more information as it becomes available.

On behalf of the Board of Education and the Mid-Buchanan School District, I wish you all a safe and Happy New Year!!!

I am truly excited about what 2020 will bring for the students, staff, and school community. As long as we all continue working together to accomplish our mission: ""To prepare all students to become successful, productive citizens through learning each day"", then there is no doubt that anything is possible.

The sky is not the limit at Mid-Buch. With high levels of commitment, dedication, and perseverance, I believe there are NO limits to what our students and staff can accomplish.

Let's take GREATNESS to a new level. GO DRAGONS!!!!

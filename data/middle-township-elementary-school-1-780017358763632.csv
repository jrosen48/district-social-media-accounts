Statement from Superintendent Dr. David Salvo:
On behalf of the Middle Township School District, we express our sincere condolences to the family of Mr. George Floyd. As a nation, we strive to seek justice in a peaceful manner. Martin Luther King Jr. once stated, “Violence brings only temporary victories; violence, by creating many more social problems than it solves, never brings permanent peace.”

We are committed to providing a safe and supportive school environment in which our students understand that their lives and voices are valued, regardless of race, ethnicity or gender. Above all, we respect and support each other.

We all need to have courageous conversations that promote and enhance equality in our community. As Winston Churchill said, “Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.”",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2902803683151645&id=780017358763632,,0.0,"IMPORTANT

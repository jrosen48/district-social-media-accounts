Signing Day-

You don’t get many perks being the Chairman of the School Committee but the best one is that my name is on each one of the diplomas representing all the School Committee members.

Brian Lynch, Paul Branagan and I made a pact to make sure we would sign each one. No signatures stamps from us! The three of us thought it was the least we could do for these young men and women, who worked so hard to get to this point.

As I signed each one, I got to think of many of these people that I have met or who in some way, shape or form have helped me to grow. Although this Graduation is not the one we all dreamed for these seniors, I appreciate who they are and how they came to get to this point. I am honored to do my small part to recognize each one of you!

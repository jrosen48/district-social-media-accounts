Because the Elementary School was unable to have its May concert, students were given the option of putting together a short solo video as a spring performance opportunity.

Many have been working hard at home and via Zoom lessons and submitted recordings. Music teacher Katherine Hudson-Sabens later compiled all recordings into one video.

👏👏👏Please give these students a ""round of applause"" in a post below! It’s tough not being able to meet as a band, and these musicians have done a great job keeping the music going at home (not to mention had the bravery to play a solo on camera)!

Although Middleburgh wasn’t able to hold its annual STEAM Night this year, organizers ---with the help of Mohawk Fine Paper (paper) and the district (supplies) --- found a way to bring “STEAM HOME” to kids.

Today, at all food pickup location, STEAM bags will be distributed, giving kids some fun STEAM activities to do at home! Each bag contains a challenge and all the supplies to complet the task!

Two different activities are available:

• Bird Beak: Using the materials provided, can you build a bird beak that can pick up the most food in one try?
And…
• Roller Coaster: Using one sheet of poster board, can you design a creative roller coaster that safely carries a marble from start to finish in the fastest time?

Take a look at the two instructional videos posted in the link below. Once you have the project finished, please download a short video or picture of your finished STEAM project right on the padlet link!
Have fun and be creative!

Did you know that movement is a critical part of our kids’ physical and mental development? At a time when kids are moving even less than they were a few months ago, we have to intentionally build movement breaks into the day. Movement helps kids connect thought to action and gain self-awareness. This translates to longer attention spans, increased focus and concentration, and boosted self-esteem – all of which reduce stress and anxiety.

Yoga is a great way to encourage movement and self-awareness. Cosmic Kids Yoga is a great YouTube Channel filled with kid-friendly, themed yoga videos. CHECK IT OUT!

1. Set aside some time every day.
2. Have a special “breathing space.”
3. Make it fun.
4. Practice it yourself.
5. Include some props.
6. Offer some positive incentives.
7. Have your kids measure their feelings before and after
breathing.
8. Use when anyone’s feelings are on “red” to calm down
back to “green.”
9. Give lots of encouragement.

Today’s example: Circle breathing"": Close your eyes and picture a big circle in your head. Start at the bottom of the circle and breathe in for three as you follow the circle up, breathe out for three as you follow the circle down.

Congratulations to the girls varsity cheerleading squad for an outstanding performance at its first ever sectional meet in Saratoga on Feb. 29!

Cheerleading is not divided like other Middleburgh sports (A,B,C,D) but rather split into Division 1 and 2. This means small class C and D schools compete against class A and B schools. There were 13 schools in Middleburgh’s division and the team finished in ninth place, beating two class B schools!!

“Not too shabby for our first trip to this event,” added Melinda Narzymski. “We know what to expect and hope to bring even more next year.”",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3019798754710524&id=325450610812032,,0.0,"💚💚💚AMAZING!

The summer fitness program has been running under the direction of physical education teacher Gregg Johns since July 1 from 9:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m. five days a week. The program provides a cardio and weight program for Middleburgh students over the summer months, when they may not be as active while not in school.

“This is a pivotal program for student-athletes during the summer,” said Mr. Johns. “To offer them something to get them stronger, more flexible, it helps with injury prevention.”

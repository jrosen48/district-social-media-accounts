1. The most popular sandwich in the USA is not PB&J actually, but surprisingly the plain ham sandwich, followed by a BLT.
2. John Montagu, the fourth Earl of Sandwich is credited with creating the first sandwich. Legend has it that he was unwilling to free up both hands during a 24 hour gambling event in order to eat. Instead, he asked his servant to put the meat from his meal between two slices of bread so he could hold it in one hand and continue gambling.
Sandwiches are a delicious way to incorporate a variety of food groups into one bite.

Breakfast is served at the beginning of each school day in the cafeteria. The best part is, it is so affordable! Breakfast is $1.45 or $0.30 for those who qualify for reduced meals. If breakfast is not possible in the morning at your household, don't let your child fall behind in school, make sure they start off the day by stopping by the cafeteria for a nutritious and delicious breakfast.",2016-08-25 13:23:24,,

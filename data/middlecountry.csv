While we wait for clarity from the Governor, we are continuing to plan for September. Our re-entry committees have been meeting regularly. We are developing plans based on various reopening scenarios that are educationally effective and at the same time safe for students and staff.

Parent surveys, created with our re-entry committees, will be sent out early next week, seeking your feedback and input.

Three MCCSD Middle School Students were selected by the Suffolk County Police Department to have their bookmark design printed to represent the Suffolk County Police Department’s initiative in School Bus Safety!

Ashleigh Raynoha from Selden Middle School and Christina Bacchi and Madeline Moceri from Dawnwood Middle School had their bookmarks selected to be displayed around Suffolk County to remind drivers - When the Red Light is Flashing, There’s No Passing! Two years ago, these students, along with 11 others won their building contest through the MCCSD Legislative Committee’s Operation School Bus Safety Bookmark Contest. Entries were then entered to the SCPD in this year’s contest. Congrats again to Ashleigh, Christina and Madeline – leading the way for School Bus Safety in Suffolk County!

Hello Middle Country, my name is Lilyann Luciano and I am a Junior Meteorologist in training. I am going to share the weather forecast for this weekend.

On Saturday, June 20th, it will be a high temperature of 80 degrees and low of 65 degrees and wind 11 mph with humidity of 71%.

On Sunday, June 21st it will rain and a high temperature of 78 degrees and a low of 65 degrees wind 10 mph with humidity of 72%.

This week, I practiced my song that I will sing on the last day of school for everyone.

I would like to thank all of our teachers for working hard and teaching us each and every single day.

Time for a weather joke…

Good Afternoon Middle Country! This is 3rd grader, Patrick Antonio Miller Ramirez. I am in training to be a Junior Meteorologist next year.

Here is the weekend weather forecast.

Saturday there will be a high of 76 degrees with a 10% chance of precipitation and a low of 59 degrees.

Sunday there will be a high of 73 degrees with a 40% chance of precipitation and a low of 60 degrees.

This week, I learned that it can take 3 days for a Monarch butterfly to make a hard case around itself, called a chrysalis.

I would like to thank Mrs. DePasquale for teaching us and for everything she has done for us.

Now for my joke:
What happens when 2 rain drops fall in love?

Today, I will be telling you your weekend forecast. On Saturday, it will be a high of 75 degrees and a low of 56 degrees. Well you may think it’s a perfect day to go and have a picnic but I hate to spoil your plans because it will also be a 60% chance of precipitation. On Sunday, it will be a high of 70 degrees and a low of 50 degrees. Even better there will only be a 10% chance of rain. I just want to thank Mrs. Leonard for letting us write these amazing forecasts and sharing them with the whole school and District.

Something I have learned through distance learning is how trees give out oxygen.

To wrap this Forecast up let me tell you a joke, What do you call it when it rains chickens and ducks?

Hello Middle Country! It’s Hawkins Path Chief Meteorologist, Max Bowers. I am going to tell you the weather for the weekend and more.

Let’s jump right in and talk about Saturday's weather. There is a high of 64 degrees and a low of 48 degrees. There is also going to be a 90% chance of rain. Sorry, Mrs.Leonard.

Now let’s talk about Sunday’s weather. There is a high of 66 degrees and a low of 48 degrees. There is also going to be a 10% chance of rain. It is Memorial day weekend, so let’s take some time out and say thank you to all the men and women who served in the military.

One new thing I learned this week is how to skateboard.

Before I sign off I want to tell you a weather joke.

Today's CD3 Hero Is Dina Phillips.

Dina has started two amazing programs for our Middle Country Schools class of 2020 seniors: Adopt a Cougar- Centereach High School Class of 2020, and Adopt a Wolverine- Newfield High School Class of 2020. These programs allow anyone to ""adopt"" a senior by sending positive messages, cards, gift baskets of support, etc. to remind them that they are not forgotten and certainly not alone. It also shows them that they are cared about not only by their families and friends, but also by their educators, peers, and this amazing community.

Thank you, Dina!

CD3 is full of everyday heroes who are providing essential services and carrying out amazing volunteer efforts during the spread of COVID-19.

This makes it even more important that your children are signing in everyday to Google Classroom or viewing eBoards and participating in instruction. Beginning on Monday, we will be following up on any student who hasn’t connected with her or his teacher to find out why – and how we might further assist. Our children need to be prepared, as best they can be, for a return to school.

Several members of the class of 2020 have asked to pick up their diplomas early due to leaving for the military and other life commitments. As a result, we have decided to go forth with a virtual graduation ceremony on our original date of May 19. Please know we will hold onto our July 9, 2020 date as long as we can, and go forth with a virtual ceremony now.

During this ceremony, we ask that graduates at home wear their caps and gowns, and participate in the tassel transfer from right to left, the cap throw, and the hollars and yells of jubilation with your quarantined family members.

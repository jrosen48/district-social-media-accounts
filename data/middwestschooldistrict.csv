As the choir director, Devin brings out the best creativity and passion from within his students. Together, he and his choir worked over 35 hours to create a virtual concert video that was posted on social media, that went viral. It had over 70,000 views! He really understands what choir means to his students, and he does his best to help everyone find their voice.
Thank you for helping to mold the future, Devin!

On-line ticket sales have begun for the HS production of Meredith Wilson‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Music Man‚Äù. A treasured piece of classic American theatre, the story is centered around conman Harrold Hill who has earned a bad reputation as a traveling salesman for convincing small towns they need a boys band and running off with the money before delivering on his promises. His plans are thwarted when he arrives in River City and finds himself falling in love with the town librarian, Marian Paroo. Can Harrold capture Marian‚Äôs heart? When Marian discovers the truth, will she expose him to the Mayor as a conman with zero musical training? Join us on April 11-13 at 7:00 or April 14 at 2:30 for this American masterpiece. Online tickets $7. At the door $10.

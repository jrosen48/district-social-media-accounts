Please allow us to commend you all on your quick response to our early dismissal on Thursday. Your ability to respond without delay or hesitation ensured the safety of all students and staff. It also allowed Oncor the opportunity to react to our power outage quickly and get MACS up and running again.

This unique situation also gave us a chance to explore what MACS @ home learning would look like for the entire campus. Please give yourself a pat on the back for helping that be successful with little to no problems. Your ability to adjust to the situation furthered our confidence in you, and for that, we thank you.

That being said, school will resume on Monday, August 24th. We are eager to get back to the new normal and see all our student‚Äôs smiling faces whether in person or virtual. Enjoy the rest of your weekend and we will see you Monday morning.

Happy Summer!

Just a quick note to let you know that report cards went out in the mail yesterday. Please be on the lookout for those.

For our returning students, you will also find some registration papers included with the report card. Those papers need to be filled out and returned by the dates listed on our attached flyer. Again, these are only for our returning students. Please follow the drop off instructions as we continue to social distance for everyone's safety.

Thank you for all of the support you have shown the teachers and staff this week. Also, for being flexible and understanding with all the information that has been coming your way.
Texas Governor Greg Abbot declared all schools in Texas will be closed through Friday, April 3, 2020, meaning Midland Academy‚Äôs school closure will last for one additional week. The Governor did state all school districts should continue to provide instruction for the students.
We will continue to have lessons assigned daily by the teachers for your children. Please stay in contact with your child‚Äôs teacher. We miss all of you dearly and hope to see you soon!
Please contact the office if you have any questions. 432-686-0003

These include singing, listening to the rain. Flying kites. Making mud pies. Making dandelion crowns. Drawing pictures on the sidewalk with chalk. Having a tea party. Taking walks or riding bikes. Playing games. Going to the movies. Reading. Simply being together!

Holding family meetings: Meetings bring the family together. Kindergarten-age children are capable of being part of a short and simple meeting. Starting early will establish the family meeting as a tradition. Plan meetings to discuss and write down family rules and the consequences of disobeying them.

Ways to promote good attendance:
-Try not to to schedule medical appointments during school hours. Enjoy vacations as a family when school is out on break, not when school is in session.
- Don't let your child stay home unless he/she is truly sick. Headaches and stomachaches may be a sign of stress. Talk to your child if this is a problem.
- Help your child maintain routines, such as waking up on time every morning, going to school, doing homework when he/she gets home and getting to bed early enough to get plenty of sleep.

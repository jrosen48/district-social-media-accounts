Dear Midland Families, These images show exercises for self- regulation and quick tips for de-escalation techniques you could utilize with your kiddos. The exercise image shows a quick 7 minute workout that your kiddos could do in the home (or outside). These exercises have descriptions explaining how to use them. This is used to help kids stay active and keep moving. The other image shows de-escalation techniques if you have a kiddo having a difficult time regulating, getting frustrated easily, expressing anxiety/worry or maybe just need to reset during this time. There is also a description to help guide you and your kiddo in use.

I wanted to inform our Midland families about Mr. Becker, one of our 5th grade teachers . Nathan was in a tree cutting accident on Sunday. He was airlifted to St. Luke‚Äôs and had surgery to remove a blood clot on the outside of his brain. He also had some fractures in his skull and a vertebra. He is in intensive care and is still sedated.

Many people have reached out to the school to help. We will be posting more specific information to help as we get things set up. If you want to post a message for Mr. Becker on here or send a card, please drop it off at the school and we will give it to the family. I know Mrs Becker is reading him the comments and appreciates your support.

Your outpouring of love and support for the Becker family has been overwhelming. This is what makes Midland the greatest community.

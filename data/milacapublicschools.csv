The Herb Claffy Stadium lights and scoreboard will be used to honor and recognize all our students - especially our 2020 Seniors and the great class and leaders they are!

With that in mind, we will also honor the “Stay at Home” order from Governor Walz and the social distancing guidelines established by the Minnesota Department of Health and the CDC. We ask if you drive to the school to see this event, you remain in your vehicle and remember social distancing guidelines.

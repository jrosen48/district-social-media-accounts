At this moment, the district has reached our current device capacity for virtual learners. For this reason, anyone wanting to begin virtual learning between now and Labor Day will not receive a device until the Thursday after Labor Day. If you have a device at home, you may use that device. For parents interested in enrolling in virtual enrollment between now and Labor Day you will need to contact the specific school.

MMS Parents and Students
This is an example of what teachers are doing to get ready for our online learners. Below is a screenshot of a Bitmoji Virtual Classroom. Once students are granted access they will be able to click on items in the room which will take them to important links, video clips, etc. For example, if they click on the LOVE, they will be taken to our MMS FaceBook page, if they click on the computer, they will be taken to the log-in page of a computer program we use. We are excited about working with parents and students on this new adventure and want to continue to maximize student learning whether our students are face-to-face or online.",7.0,"Milan Middle School

Even though we didn't get to celebrate like we hoped, we still wanted to show appreciation to our teachers at Milan Middle School!! Thanks to the generosity of Main Street Church of Christ, Northside Baptist and First Assembly, Carroll Bank and Trust, Dynamix, and Trimmers Autobody, our teachers get to enjoy a catered meal from Smokin Hot BBQ today!!
Also I wanted to thank all those of the community who had stepped up to help me plan out an entire week of goodies for the teachers, even though it didn't go as planned, which are Milan Mirror Exchange, Hometown Grocery, Clenny's, Cades Grocery, Walmart of Milan, Jeff Newbill/Corner Boutique, Southland Graphics, Subway, YMCA.
Thank you all for stepping up to help our teachers feel special, even in the uncertain times we are in.",0.0,"Milan Middle School

Parents must start the registration process at this link:

Also, a big ""thank you"" to Sports Plus and Sports Orthopedic and Spine for setting up free physicals for MHS athletes on Monday, May 13th. We will begin with current 8th graders at 1:00 p.m., so upperclassmen may have to stay after school to complete.",0.0,"Milan High School

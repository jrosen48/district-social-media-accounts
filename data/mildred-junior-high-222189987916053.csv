For those of you who are new to our Mildred family and a reminder to others.
Each year we sell Pink Out shirts to raise money for a local charity or as we did last year and will do again this year, provide gas vouchers for those individuals in Navarro County who are currently receiving treatments.
These vouchers are very much appreciated by those who receive them. We work with Mickey's Exxon and Texas Oncology plus we ask you if you know anyone who would benefit from these vouchers.

This year our Pink Out game for Football will be 9/25 and Volleyball 10/6 so this means, it's time to get those pink out shirts going!!
We have a bonus this year and we are offering Pink Out gaiters.
Please consider adding names to our shirts. Anyone you know who has faced any type of cancer!
We hope you will buy a shirt and a gaiter! Let's help others in our community!!",0.0,"Mildred Athletics

For those of you who are new to our Mildred family and a reminder to others.
Each year we sell Pink Out shirts to raise money for a local charity or as we did last year and will do again this year, provide gas vouchers for those individuals in Navarro County who are currently receiving treatments.
These vouchers are very much appreciated by those who receive them. We work with Mickey's Exxon and Texas Oncology plus we ask you if you know anyone who would benefit from these vouchers.

This year our Pink Out game for Football will be 9/25 and Volleyball 10/6 so this means, it's time to get those pink out shirts going!!
We have a bonus this year and we are offering Pink Out gaiters.
Please consider adding names to our shirts. Anyone you know who has faced any type of cancer!
We hope you will buy a shirt and a gaiter! Let's help others in our community!!",0.0,"Mildred Athletics

On November 2nd, our current parent portal system will transition to a new platform called Ascender.

Ascender ParentPortal is similar to that of TxConnect-Parent Portal. The parent's current sign-on and password will continue to work for the new system.

We are encouraging our parents/guardians to make sure ALL their students are linked to their account before November 2nd. This will help parents successfully login with immediate access to all their students without any delay. In addition, MISD is encouraging our parents to please verify the contact information for your child(ren). This is a great place to list people who can pick up your children from school for appointments or illness without the need to contact a parent/guardian. Please note, student data can ONLY be updated by the verified, enrolling parent.

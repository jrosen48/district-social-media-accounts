Anxious, aggravated, concerned, scared, and optimistic. New school year with a pandemic. Our family is sending our three children to three different buildings tomorrow. They will all ride the bus. I believe our district is prepared, as prepared as we can be. I have faith in our administration, our teachers, and our custodial staff. This is going to be a challenging first week. Please be patient, direct problems to the source, and understand that many adjustments will be made. And trust that this is a difficult plan that is not perfect. It is a risk balance scenario that we all have to face. Take notice, do your part, and communicate issues. Our best chance to keep this going is up to you. Wings up!",3.0,"Chris Hamm

During our 11 weeks of distance learning during the last part of the 2019/2020 school year due to the pandemic, Milford teachers created innovative and creative assignments and projects for their students. Distance learning looked a little different at each grade level: preschool through second graders generally worked through paper packets downloaded at home or mailed to them. In grades third through 12th, students worked on devices to access online learning programs, and they completed special projects on paper or online. Teachers across all grade levels used video chat rooms to touch base with students, answer questions, and provide lessons. This unconventional time of learning was unprecedented, but our Milford Eagles persevered and excelled. The flexibility and adaptability shown by our staff and families is commendable.

We will wait for further instruction from the Governor and follow his directives as they continue to change over the next few months. If Ohio’s orders on social gatherings are not lessened, then some camps may have to be modified or even cancelled.

Smith and Pattison Elementary Schools participated in a virtual Q&A session with local leaders. Students submitted questions ahead of time and their pre-recorded video was played during a live videoconference.

Milford City’s Mayor Amy Vilardo, City Manager Michael Doss, Police Chief Jamey Mills, and Fire Chief Mark Baird answered their questions, which varied from “what are your favorite and not so favorite parts about your job?” to “What do you do in your free time?” and they asked the Mayor if she worked with the President.

Thank you to the City of Milford, OH administration and leaders for participating in this project!

Last week, Clermont County Public Health asked for donations for personal protective equipment for medical personnel.

Our custodial department also donated extra stock of gloves. The health department will distribute the gloves to critical healthcare and first response agencies here in our county.

Today, our high school music department sent 13 piano keyboards to the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music - CCM. The college sent a plea requesting pianos to borrow, so their students who cannot travel home could continue with their practice.

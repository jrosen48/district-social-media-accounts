After learning about energy transfer in their PLTW - Project Lead The Way course, 4th-grade students from Milford, MA designed ways to quickly move food from a truck to a food pantry. Today, they teamed up with experts from The Greater Boston Food Bank and Vecna Robotics to refine their designs and see how The Greater Boston Food Bank operates to feed over 140,000 people in eastern MA each month.

Thank you to our host The Greater Boston Food Bank, to Vecna Robotics, and to event sponsor National Grid for making this experience possible for students!

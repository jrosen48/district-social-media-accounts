Mr. Myers will be most remembered for the following life lessons: People matter more than outcomes, life is 10% what happens to me and 90% of how I react to it, and laughter is always the best medicine!! Thank you Mr. Myers… Delta Middle School hasn’t been the same since you came, nor will it ever be the same when you leave. “Never die you good looking guy!!”. We love you!!!!",2020-05-19 09:55:47,,

Mrs. Carol Meinhardt has been teaching our Business and Accounting programs at the Technical Center for the past 24 years. She has been a great example to all of us for her incredible work ethics, love and concern for the students, her passion for FBLA (Future Business Leaders of America), and her willingness to help anyone. Many of us have joked with her about making her residence at the Tech. She can be seen dedicating much of her free time at school after hours, throughout the evenings, and during many weekends. She has always kept her door open after school to provide extra assistance to any student that may be struggling in her class. She has prepared and helped many students qualify on a state and national level at the FBLA competitions. We all consider Mrs. Meinhardt as a dear friend and have enjoyed the opportunity to have her at our school!

Millard School District’s Personalized Learning Initiative is off to a great start! We have 64 Chromebook labs in our schools with more on the way. These labs are being put to good use. Secondary teachers build their classes in Canvas to provide our students opportunities to learn anytime and anywhere. This also prepares our students for College as Canvas is the primary program used in Utah’s college campuses.

Elementary grades are using a wide range of tools to individualize learning for every student. Reading passages, math lessons, and writing prompts are being given out to meet the needs of each individual student in the class. The kids love to use technology!

The Millard School District has lost one of its greatest friends and advocates in the passing of our School Board President, Mr. Daniel Anderson. Daniel has always put the best interest of our students at the center of every discussion and every decision. His sincere expressions of gratitude for our staff, our students, and our communities will be sorely missed. He has always been first to recognize excellence, first to appreciate efforts, and first to acknowledge concerns. Those who have been recipients of his warmth and kindness have been lifted and made better as we watched his example of caring for the needs of others. We are all better people for having known and associated with Daniel Anderson. His leadership and devotion will be missed by our schools and our communities. While we mourn for our loss, we turn our love and our sympathy to Daniel’s beloved wife Sherilyn, and the Anderson family. Please include them in your thoughts and prayers.",,,0.0,"Wednesday, March 2, 2016

I started an a cappella group this year at Russell Middle School called ""Wolfgang"" (I'm very proud of the name 😉). We had been working on this song for several months and were getting ready to take it to an a cappella competition before school was cancelled for the year. The kids and I have continued to meet on Zoom after school hours and put in tons of time practicing and recording for this 'performance', and I got to exercise my music tech chops putting it all together (thanks Tom Larson!)

Millard North won its district to earn the No. 2 seed in the state tournament. Millard North plays Papillion La Vista South today at 7 p.m. at Pinnacle Bank Arena.

Coronavirus precautions will prevent the general public from watching him in action, but you can bet that his mother and family will be there to see him try to repeat history in Lincoln. You can listen or watch via streaming media for more.

Millard is offering 5 show choir camps this summer!!! Why Show Choir? Let me tell you! Show choir builds a strong sense of family. Through movement and music your child experiences joy, practices grit, gains true friendships, learns hard work, and simply has so much fun!!! In show choir, EVERYONE is important and no one is ever sitting on the bench! Why come to Millard??? The directors putting on these camps are certified teachers with years of experience showing children the love of music!!!! WE LOVE WHAT WE DO!!! We are so passionate about students and show choir!!! Check out the flyers below and email one of the directors to get registered!!! We can’t wait to make music with your child this summer! #Proud2bMPS

It's been a busy three days!

Thursday, we toured Not Just Popcorn, Hunter's Honey Farm, and Ozark Fisheries. Then, attended the Tenille Townes and Brett Young concert.

Friday we found out Ian recieved a Gold Rating and placed 4th in Division 3 Social Systems at the National Agriscience Fair and toured Fair Oaks Farms. That evening we attended the Jim Wand Hypnotist session and went Duckpin Bowling. We also celebrated Bryce and Laurynn's birthdays!

Today we woke up EARLY to attend the American Degree Ceremony where THREE of our members: Ethan Dunson, Austin Schaffner, and Sam Shilling received their degrees!

Congratulations everyone on an awesome convention! Thank you so much to Mr. King for chaperoning our trip! You've been a life saver!",0.0,"Millcreek-West Unity FFA

Dear MCA Families,

As you know the governor will make an announcement on Wednesday regarding moving forward in these COVID-19 impacted times. Whether we are under Plan A (minimal social distancing), B (moderate social distancing), or C (remote learning only), we will be ready for the fall. Regardless of which plan, MCA will provide remote education for those who prefer it. By the way, thank you for your responses to our survey. After the governor's announcement, we will be able to provide further details on our health-conscious, academic-focused, character-developing, classical-school reopening.

Until then, I hope you enjoy these beautiful, summer days with your family.

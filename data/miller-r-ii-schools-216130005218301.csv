Another fantastic year for MILLER Cardinal Archery at the Southwest Invitational Tournament in Billings. An announcement was made following the competition that this was one of the toughest events they have ever held.

Ethan McCracken shot a 282 to secure 1st place in the JH boys division and gain him his second win of the year. Several others improved considerably and had a great competition as well.

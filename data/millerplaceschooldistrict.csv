Re: Schools Remain Closed for the Rest of Academic Year

Good afternoon Miller Place Community,

Earlier today, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that school districts statewide will remain closed through the end of the 2019-2020 school year. While this is not the school year that we had hoped for, we will continue to find new ways to make memories that will last a lifetime.

More information regarding continuity of learning, food distribution, emergency childcare services, and additional resources for the remainder of the school year will be communicated at a later date.

Thank you for your continued patience. I wish you and your loved ones a happy weekend.

Stay Safe,

To parents/guardians of 2020-21 Kindergarteners:

I hope you and your families are well.

In order to facilitate a more streamlined process for Kindergarten registration, we have created an online pre-registration site for you to fill in some important information. This online form will help to get your child's information into the system much quicker and allows the school to begin the scheduling process.

Here is the link to the form: http://millerplacest.esboces.org/schooltoolweb/onlinepreregistration

Even though we have added this online tool, you will still need to come to the district to drop off your completed registration paperwork. When you click the link for the online pre-registration site, you will have access to the required forms.

Thank you in advance for completing this form and we look forward to meeting you during our in-person registration. You will be receiving a message from the Principal during the month of May with details regarding in-person registration and other points of interest.

In working with our students, parents, vendors, and the leadership at the Ned Smith Center for Nature and Art, we are pleased to announce that our 2020 Prom WILL occur on July 17, 2020, contingent upon Dauphin County remaining in the Green Phase.

Parents choosing to allow their child to participate will be required to sign a Prom Participation Acknowledgement Form indicating they understand the potential increased risk of exposure to COVID-19 as a result of attending this event.

While we are excited to see our students participate in Prom this year, the Prom Walk and Post Prom events will not be held.

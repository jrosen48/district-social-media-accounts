The terms of service are on the flyer, but here is the TL:DR (too long didn’t read)

- Family won’t qualify if they have had Ritter Internet in the past 90 days
- Pricing only good for the school year
- There is NO install fee

Mr. Poyner has served in building administration for nearly a decade. We are very pleased that he has accepted the role of Principal for Millington Middle School. He will expand upon the great work that Selina Sparkman started at Millington Middle. Selina is retiring at the end of this school year and is passing the baton to Brandon. Mr. Poyner has a heart for children and the patience of Job! This is why we believe that he is the person to continue Millington Middle down the right path.

An amazing celebration of Black History Month was on display today at MCHS. Students from the choir, the band, the theatre arts program, the A/V program, and others put themselves on stage to celebrate the contributions of African Americans to our country's history. We were also honored with a special guest: Mr. Trent McVay, MCHS's first African American principal. Kudos to everyone involved in this wonderful program, with special recognition to Candy Harris, Leah Thomas, Leigh Ann Evans, Kreston Smith, Joanne Zachery, and Marshonn Calvin for their hard work with the students!

In mid-March, homes across the country will begin receiving invitations to complete the 2020 Census. Once the invitation arrives, you should respond for your home in one of three ways: online, by phone, or by mail.

Please allow me to share one of the many reasons I love our school district in Millington!
Today we had pictures for girls basketball. I totally did not wash their uniforms on last night to be distributed, which I realized I failed to do this morning! With a scramble, I thought that I could just wash them at school! Well, they were washed, but I didn’t wash them! One of our awesome students who’s being taught life skills washed and folded our uniforms!! To watch this young man take on the task with much pride and joy blessed my soul completely! Our students rock!

You can certainly review but do not cram new information into your brain.

2. PACK YOUR BAG!
Have everything ready the night before so you can spend the next morning eating a healthy breakfast. Bring with you two No. 2 pencils, an eraser, a drink (water), and snacks.

4. SET YOUR ALARMS!
Make sure you arrive to school on time!

5. SLEEP AND EAT WELL!

The only time you do not have to stop is when there is at least 5 feet of unpaved space or any raised median or physical barrier on a divided highway.

*INCENTIVE PROGRAM*

Would your Business like to help out? The Millington Area Chamber of Commerce is on board!

Millington Elementary & E.A. Harrold Elementary Incentive Program for students who achieve academically and behaviorally. In years past, honor roll students were given a reward card that they could take to various local organizations and businesses to redeem for certain items. For example, the Fire Department gave fire safety coloring books, the police department gave a pencil and badge sticker, a local florist gave a chrysanthemum, McDonald's gave a kid's ice cream cone and Wendy's gave a frosty. Won't you help too?

We have some exciting news! We will be opening up this Tuesday, April 28th, for WINGS to go!

Seeing as we have not been open regularly, the full menu will not be available, just wings and sides.

You do have option of bone-in or boneless wings, but we will only be doing them by the dozen. Flavors are limited to the following: BBQ, Hooters, Garlic/Parm, Kickin' Bourbon, Mango/Habanero, and Mild. Celery and dressing available.

Sides available are: French fries, cheese curds, jalapeno cheese curds, and onion rings.

Orders will be taken from 4:45-8pm, or until supplies last.

**All proceeds from this evening will be donated to the Millville Area School District, to help provide families with meals during this time**

Also during this event, Millville Legion Aux will be collecting donations for the Millville Area School District. Specific items they are in need of/are having a hard time find are: cereal, p-nut butter, jelly/jam, ramen noodles, Beefaroni, ravioli. If you'd like to donate, we'd be happy to collect your items when we deliver your food. No need for you to get out.",0.0,"Millville Legion Canteen, Post 564

We discovered threatening messages on the office voicemail this morning. Police were immediately notified, the building was locked down, and an investigation was launched. The investigation resulted in the identification of the caller. As soon as the administration and police were positive that no threat existed, the lockdown was lifted. Privacy laws prevent further details from being shared, however I will share that at no time were students and staff in imminent danger.

The students will have access to their library books in the classroom and will follow the same routine of book return that the older students use. However, the pressure is off because the students will not be bringing the books home. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to call the school and ask to speak with me.

Today we were also invited to speak to the young men at Millwood Middle School during their career day. We were asked to come speak about becoming a barber, and developing a trade/career by means of the non traditional way of a four year college. We reached out to some of the best barbers in the state to share our time with us and encourage these young men about our wonderful profession! üíàüíàüíà Special thanks to Bruce Waight Sr. with Rooted Barber + Shop, Scissorhands with Fade N Up, and Jack Walker with Blessed Bladez!

I wanted to bring to your attention a fundraiser sponsored by our spring sports programs. Many of you have asked when are we going to sale some apparel, well that day has arrived. Please review the photo of items that we are offering. Remember all proceeds raised will help to support our spring sports. Athletes received their packets today and will be calling on you for support. It‚Äôs tough to sale items so our babies are putting themselves out there. Your support will be greatly appreciated. We hope to also see you at a game this season. The sale ends April 3rd , YOU CAN ALSO USE THE LINK,

Reminder that the football game vs. Lisbon on Saturday has a 1:00 PM kick-off at North Sargent, with the gates opening at 12:15 PM. The game will be on Thunder 106.1 FM, as well as on BEK Sports. As you can see by the picture, the perimeter of the field is quite saturated. We ask that no vehicles park around the football field for the game. The parking area by the bus barn is quite wet, too. There should be plenty of parking available in the Activity Center parking lot, staff parking, and the streets around the school and bus barn area. Thank you for your cooperation. Feel free to share this information. See you on Saturday.

Reminder that the football game vs. Lisbon on Saturday has a 1:00 PM kick-off at North Sargent, with the gates opening at 12:15 PM. The game will be on Thunder 106.1 FM, as well as on BEK Sports. As you can see by the picture, the perimeter of the field is quite saturated. We ask that no vehicles park around the football field for the game. The parking area by the bus barn is quite wet, too. There should be plenty of parking available in the Activity Center parking lot, staff parking, and the streets around the school and bus barn area. Thank you for your cooperation. Feel free to share this information. See you on Saturday.

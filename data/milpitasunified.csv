The executive order states: “It is hereby ordered that Education Code section 6064 (a), requiring that all pupils be administered academic assessments in mathematics, English language arts, and science, as provided for in Education Code section 60640, is waived for the 2019-20 school year for all schools in the state for which the United States Department of Education approves, based on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on students and school communities throughout California, a federal waiver of requirements to administer those academic assessments.”

This program has trained coaches (volunteers) that lead girls through lessons about standing up for yourself and others, managing emotions, setting goals, stopping gossip and bullying, and so much more.

Teachers say they see the positive effects of GOTR girls' performance in the classroom, too!

The City's 3rd annual Manufacturing Day 2019 was an event held by the Office of Economic Development in collaboration with employers Flex, TDK Headway Technologies Inc., and Onanon to connect young students to possible opportunities in the field of manufacturing and technology. This was a great opportunity for students to get hands-on experience by learning about the importance of this field and its role in the Silicon Valley.

We plan to have school in session tomorrow, and will follow our procedures for power outages to ensure the safety of our students and staff while maintaining a healthy learning environment for all.

Previously, during the October power outage, Curtner teachers noted that some students were brought flashlights, which made them feel a part of the solution. If you would like to send in a small flashlight for personal use your child is welcome to do so.

We will provide any further updates on Monday morning as we get them from PG&E.

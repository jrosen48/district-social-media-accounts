Good evening Bulldog families.
I want to take this moment to thank all of you for your support as we transition to at home instruction. This is a challenging time for all of us and it will take communication to make our journey successful. Students at the elementary will not be required to log in during normal school hours. Lessons are broken up by day. Students who will be using online tools and instruction may access them through a link labeled “Online Lesson Access” located on the front page of the Milton-Union Elementary website.
Households without the internet should have received a packet of work to keep your student progressing through the curriculum. Additional communication will be coming in the near future regarding work submission and obtaining new packets.
Teachers will be available through e-mail, Remind, Class Dojo, etc. to answer questions you may have. We will make every effort to respond as quickly as possible.
The MUES staff wish you all good health. Please let us know if you need anything.",0.0,"Milton-Union Elementary School

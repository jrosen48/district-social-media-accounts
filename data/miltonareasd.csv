Addison had the highest portfolio for Milton Middle School, with a total portfolio value of $110,247.85

Each student starts with $100,000 of imaginary funds and has ten weeks to grow it's value based on the real stock market results. This was by far the most challenging year with the last four weeks of the game being played at home and little interaction with the instructor.

And beside playing from home the market did not behave as usual due to Covid19 ... most strategies went out the window!

For Addison to net $10,247.85 in ten weeks is outstanding.

She placed 22nd out of 607 students that actually made trades in the game.

Based on how the Daily Item and PennCFL make the ranking, Addison put MMS in fourth place, qualifying her for a prize!

Again well done Addison!

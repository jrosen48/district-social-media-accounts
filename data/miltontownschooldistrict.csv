Hi families,
As a school district one of our school wide goals this year is to improve our practices by using a culturally and linguistically responsive lens.
One of the steps in meeting that goal is to use books that represent the children in our program.
Here is one of our preschoolers, who when presented with this book, said “That looks like me”. ❤️

Red Lights Flashing = No Passing | School Bus Safety Awareness Event

August 27th from 11:30 am to 1:30 pm

Minor’s Funeral Home in Milton. (237 Route 7 South Milton, VT)

The Chittenden/ Franklin SHARP Program and the Milton Police Department are once again hosting a BBQ to raise awareness about the dangers of passing a school bus when the red lights are flashing. With summer coming to an end, school buses will soon be transporting children to and from school and it is imperative that the motoring public drive carefully when near them. In addition, due to COVID-19, the motoring public may be seeing school buses transporting children on days and times that are outside of the traditional time frames. The public should be prepared that school buses may be transporting children at ANY time of the day.

Due to COVID-19, a table will be provided with masks and sanitizer and it is requested that all who attend abide by the Governor’s mandate and CDC rules on social distancing. Thank you and hope to see you at the BBQ!

Fact Check Friday: Will wearing a mask increase the amount of carbon dioxide I breathe and make me sick?

No. For many years, health care providers have worn masks for extended periods of time with no adverse health reactions. The @CDC recommends wearing cloth masks while in public, and this option is very breathable. In healthy adults, there is no risk of hypoxia (lower oxygen levels). Carbon dioxide will freely flow out of your mask as you breathe.

If you feel uncomfortable in your mask, try to limit talking and breathe through your nose. That will reduce the humidity level in your mask. Also, try to take mask breaks throughout the day when you are able to move away from others.

We know this isn’t always easy and we appreciate all Vermonters have done to keep each other safe.

Hi MHS Juniors,
Here is a great virtual resource to help you explore colleges next week!
Monday, April 20th - Thursday April 23rd participate in four full days of virtual presentations to explore college opportunities.
Go to https://www.strivescan.com/virtual/schedule/ to see all that they are offering!
Students should register for each panel that they want to attend. Once they register, they’ll receive a confirmation email with their unique link to join the Zoom webinar.
(Students will also receive a barcode, but the barcode is not necessary for this virtual event.) When students register, they are sharing their registration information only with colleges presenting on that particular panel. StriveScan does not sell or share personally identifiable student information with any other third parties.
Parents should register their students using their student’s information.

Dear Families,

Classroom teachers met with their grade level administrator after school yesterday to create a plan for remote learning. Each grade level team will be putting together remote learning materials for your child to work on from March 17th through April 6th. The learning packets for this week will be printed for each child. If your child did not attend school on Tuesday, you may pick the packet up in the office Wednesday through Friday from 8:00 - 3:00pm. Please contact your child’s classroom teacher if you need additional support getting these learning packets.

On Wednesday, teachers will be calling each family to talk about the remote learning packet and answer any questions you might have. Teachers will be creating remote learning opportunities for each week we are out of school and calling each family weekly to check on progress and answer any questions.

This is a new journey for all of us. We thank you for your patience as we navigate this new territory!",3.0,"Milton Elementary School

Dear Parent/Guardian,

In keeping with Mineola ISD's practices to respond to COVID-19, we are notifying all student families that a Staff Member at Mineola High School was recently lab-confirmed positive for COVID-19. Due to privacy requirements, we will not be releasing the name of the individual that may identify him or her. We are happy to report that they have very minor symptoms and are doing well.

We will continue to work closely with our local health department on this matter and all departments within our District. After a careful review, two other staff members are currently finishing the quarantine phase, as well as one student. To our knowledge, none of these individuals have experienced symptoms related to COVID-19. All of our campuses at Mineola ISD continue to be cleaned daily and operations at our High School Campus will continue as usual. As always, we will keep you apprised of any further updates.

This situation is continuously changing and we want to make sure we have the latest information before we release it to our community. Our parents/guardians will have an opportunity to choose between a traditional school setting or a virtual setting that best fits their personal health care needs.

We have many guidelines that we are in the process of working on to release later in the week. These guidelines will be focused on safety and the public health of our community.

We will also be filming a Virtual Graduation Ceremony in the event Governor Abbott does have to amend his Re-Opening Texas plan due to an increase in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, etc..

In the best interest of our public’s health and safety, Mineola ISD will extend Spring Break through Friday, March 20th.

Mr. Mize will be meeting with Campus Principals and Directors on Monday, March 16th at 9:00 a.m. to discuss issues related to food service for families in need of assistance and long range instructional planning in case of further delays from coming back to school.

I can’t stress to each of you enough the importance of being flexible as new information becomes available. This is an unprecedented situation that a script does not exist for, but with planning, clear communication, and cooperation, we will meet the educational needs of our students and come out better as a community in the end for having gone through this. I am available at any time for questions or comments at mizec@mineolaisd.net. I will also do my best to respond to questions or comments in this post that you may have.

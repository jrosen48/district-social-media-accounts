I wished you would fall and I sang when you glistened
Each time was different but we always closed school
You mean us no harm but it's time that you face it
We can't let you back any more
And I never dreamed that I'd ever get tired of you Snow.
But I'm Moving On
I'm moving on...at last I can see
The palm trees and oceans are waiting for me
And I know there's no guarantees but I hope you're gone
There comes a time in everyone's life where all that we wish for is snow and ice
And I, I've made up my mind that those days are gone
I closed up the school for the last time today
Hoping that spring comes and you'll go away
We thank you for five days of closing us down
But any more now would just add to the count
Maybe next year you can come back and see us again

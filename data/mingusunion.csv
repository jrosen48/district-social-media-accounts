We need your help! We are working on our Senior Honor’s recognition and need to know what your student’s final plans are for after graduation and any awards/scholarships/recognition that they have received at this point.

We need this information by Sunday, May 17th so that we can begin working on our brochure and certificates. Please have your student provide the most complete information in the Google Form attached to this e-mail so that they receive the recognition they so deserve.

https://forms.gle/WGqvSP8V7UW9WgLz7

You can submit the information you know at this point and then re-submit new information as pending scholarships are awarded

Reach out if you have any questions.

Congratulations to the Navy Narwhals for all you have accomplished!

Gretchen Wesbrock

Director of Student Support Services

The Drop Box is HERE!

The Grade Improvement Module Packet drop box has been installed and is ready for packets! The box is located in the small u-shaped parking lot off of Fir Street. It is located right behind the fence on the side of the parking lot near the marquee. You will need to reach through the fence to place the packet(s) in the box. The box looks like a large postal box and is labeled with a sign “Grade Improvement Module Packet Drop-Off HERE.”

Before dropping off your packet make sure to have your student write the following:

Student Name

Student ID#

Teacher Name

These three things are very important to make sure that your student gets credit for the work they have completed.

Makayla Brogdon
Although she missed a large part of her softball career, due to a shoulder injury and then surgery, Makayla has been a part of Mingus softball for the last four years.
As a pitcher primarily, she has made appearances at the varsity level, mostly at tournaments, but this was her first season as a full time varsity player.
She shined! In our first tournament she smashed multiple homeruns and played first base, accounting for many outs for us there.
Although a quiet and laid back kid, she has an inner fire that shows in her work ethics in and off the field. She can often be found working out, running or pitching at a field somewhere or hitting in her own back yard. Although the 2020 season came to an abrupt end, she’s not finished yet...
Makayla earned her varsity letter and will be missed in our program. Once this “quarantine” passes, we will celebrate her career at Mingus and watch her walk the bases with her family! But for now, a senior picture to celebrate a cool kid and a Mingus Senior!",0.0,"Mingus Softball

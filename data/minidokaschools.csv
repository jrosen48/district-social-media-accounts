They were on for 20 minutes as the students, parents, community and athletes were able to drive through our parking lots. They honked, they waved, they cheered and they smiled. I cried!! What a wonderful set of emotions to feel as we honored our students, athletes and Class of 2020. Thank you for coming..... I really needed to see you all. As hard as this is.... we are resilient, we will battle and we will get through this!!! I love my job, I love all of you and I love our Spartan family. We are in this together.

Middle school librarian Maggie Spicehandler, with help from her husband Matt, connects with her library students…..actually, every student… through her presentation of the West Africian folktale, “Abiyoyo.”

In this book based on a South African lullaby and folktale, a fearsome giant, Abiyoyo, suddenly appears in a small South African town, causing the people to run for their lives. Nothing can stop the giant except for the sound of a little boy's ukulele — a sound that enchants the giant, but a sound that up until now none of the boy's fellow townspeople could stand to hear.

The boy's father also has a special gift: He can wave a magic wand and make things disappear, a talent the townspeople have found equally annoying. But now, the previously banished boy and his father are suddenly heroes, as they work together to get rid of Abiyoyo for good.

In the video, Mrs. Fenfert shows the students how to play a bucket as a drum and teaches them six simple rhythms to be played. Then, Mr. Klein performs the piece in its entirety. The rhythms are displayed through the video to guide students and reinforce their music reading.

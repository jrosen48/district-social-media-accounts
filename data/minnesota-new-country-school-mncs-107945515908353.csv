Hi everyone! My family and I recently spent some time on the North Shore. This is an almost sunset shot in Duluth. We stayed on the point- the other side of the Aerial Lift Bridge. It was neat because you had to be in tune to when ships are entering the harbor so that you don't get stuck on one side and all night long we heard clanging ship noises..it was a maritime experience and adventure. Another part I love is driving up the coast and stopping at small rocky beaches and rock hunting. The lake was so cold it turns your feet numb! I love the color, intensity and vastness of Lake Superior. I've been going there since I was a kid, and when I get that first view of it coming into town my heart goes crazy. It was challenging traveling during a pandemic, but we Minnesotans are lucky that we have some gorgeous outdoors! So get out there!",,,0.0,"Danielle‚Äôs Trip to the great North Shore!

Carrie Rice is not new to MNCS. Her husband David taught here for fifteen years and she has worked as a paraprofessional at the elementary and the high school the last several years. Just prior to moving to Henderson three years ago, Carrie left a 20+ career in government relations in the telecommunications industry. She is so looking forward to her new career as an Advisor at the high school helping young people discover a passion for teaching themselves new things!

Carrie and David share their Henderson home with two dogs, two cats and a multitude of plants. She loves to cook and entertain friends and speaks French.

All of the above is true, but since New Countrians love a good round of Two Truths and a Lie, see if you can guess the falsehood:

Carrie has lived with a cat in her life since she was five.
At one point, Carrie had six dogs under her roof

A few interesting facts about DST:

- You lose an hour of sleep, but gain some extra sunshine in the evening.

- In addition to the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands and Guam, the states of Hawaii and Arizona do not observe DST.

- Some countries around the world observe DST, some do not, and some did for a while but don’t anymore.

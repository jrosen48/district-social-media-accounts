Late yesterday Governor Pritzker issued a new Executive Order that authorizes the Illinois State Board of a Education (ISBE) to create and implement Remote Instruction Days as a type of instructional day on the school calendar. We are still learning the details from ISBE, but for now we can say that beginning on Tuesday, March 31 we will be using Remote Instruction Days for the duration of this COVID-19 school closing period. These days will look much closer to our original eLearning plan. Teachers will be introducing new materials and content during these days and providing feedback to students.

Monday, March 30, 2020 is still an Act of God Day, so our staff will provide some type of eLearning activity but will spend most of their time planning for the Remote Instruction Days to follow. More detailed information on our implementation of Remote Instruction Days will be forthcoming prior to Tuesday as we gather more information from ISBE this weekend.

Until then, enjoy the rest of the weekend and keep staying safe everyone.

We will continue to offer free lunches to all of our students through the entire school closing period which currently runs through April 7, 2020. Like before, lunches will consist of a sandwich/entree, 1 side, 1 fruit/vegetable, and 1 milk. We are also adding a pickup location at Jones Elementary School (800 Barberry Way, Joliet, IL 60431) to make it easier for our families in the northern sections of our District. Pickup at both locations will run from 11 AM - 1 PM.

We are again asking our families to respond to this brief survey to indicate if you intend to take advantage of these free meals and provide numbers and pickup location so we can prepare appropriately. All families are asked to respond, even if only to indicate that you do not intend to participate.

Today Governor Pritzker announced that in order to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, all schools would be ordered closed effective March 17 through March 30, 2020. As of this correspondence, all Minooka 201 schools will be closed at the end of the school day on March 16, 2020.

We will plan for eLearning days to be used from Tuesday March 17th through Friday March 20th, as well as Monday March 30th. No instructional days will be planned over our scheduled Spring Break which runs from March 21-29, 2020.

As always, this situation remains fluid. We will send out additional information as it’s developed, and families should look for communications from their school and teachers for more specific details. Please stay safe and continue to your part to keep our communities healthy.

Sincerely,

Kris Monn",2020-03-14 12:41:34,,

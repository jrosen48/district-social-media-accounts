Finnegan has studied engineering at MIT Lincoln Lab, and is planning to attend the University of Massachusetts Lowell to pursue an engineering degree. At Minuteman, he was captain of the soccer and tennis teams, a member of the basketball team, and was a Student Ambassador in which he hosted school tours.

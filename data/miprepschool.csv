While I‚Äôm there, I often end up helping other students.

My mentor at the lab showed me how to work out the geometry equations...

...and I met with my friend to brainstorm ideas for her Social Studies paper.

When my brother‚Äôs band practices at our house, I go to the lab for peace and quiet.

Nobody could study with those guys shredding guitars and smashing drums.

Learning Labs at Michigan International Prep School engage students with each other and the community!

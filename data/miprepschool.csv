If it means staying late at school, then so be it.
­­
If it means calling them from home, then so be it.
­­
We take pride in what we represent.
­­­
Not with words. With actions.
­­
We realized a simple truth.
­­
If we want to be first on your school choice list, we have to do things differently.
­­
And do them well.

1. Drink hot cocoa with way too much whipped cream.

project took several days to complete but was well worth it to see all of the staff members wearing handmade masks to keep them safe! FCCLA made a total of 82 staff masks in all. We would like to thank Toni Steere from “A Wing and a Prayer Designs” for the generous fabric donation!

To continue to show our appreciation for teachers, FCCLA members came into the school right before school began to help them set up, decorate and organize their rooms so they would be ready for the first day!

As we are quickly approaching our first day of school, I wanted to make you aware of a couple changes to our elementary band program.

5th Grade
Instead of students choosing an instrument and sticking with it for the year, all 5th grade students will be given the opportunity to try different instruments through the year. To avoid having 30-40 students in one room at a time, students will rotate in small groups to band throughout the week so Mrs. Sperry can give more attention to our beginning learners.

6th grade
Band will be optional for 6th grade students. If students choose to participate, they will be put in small groups and rotate throughout the week to allow for more small group attention. All 6th grade students will still receive general music.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me (ajohnston@mv330.org) or Mrs. Sperry (ksperry@mv330.org). We are both excited for this change!

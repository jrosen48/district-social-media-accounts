The Recreation Department is moving ahead with fall sports.

Registration for Tackle football, Flag football Cheerleading, and Soccer all begins today and runs to August 28th.

In regards to Tackle Football there are 2 changes..1. The registration fee is $50.00 but this year pants will be provided. 2. We will be playing other agencies in the area so we will be traveling some. This will mean that games will be on Saturday morning.

We want to elevate our level of play and playing other agencies will do that.

Forms are at the Recreation Department and can also be found on the County website at:

http://www.mitchellcountyga.net/recreation.html

We are really looking forward to the upcoming season and can't wait to get the kids back playing.

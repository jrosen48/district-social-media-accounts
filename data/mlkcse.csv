For families that were not able to make it, packets were dropped off at the post office today. Please keep an eye out for them in the mail. While this work is not a substitute for in-school learning, we hope that it helps students maintain their learning routines. We recommend students working on their packet for 1-2 hours per day independently. This work will be collected back and graded by teachers. Teachers will be available through ClassDojo for support.

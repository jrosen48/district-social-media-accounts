Just look at some of the course details on the SeaPerch website to get a feel for the obstacles they had to overcome. Then, get this: they timed 29 seconds on the obstacles and 3:16 on the mission, earning the maximum points for doing it all under four minutes! THAT is science at work. Tomorrow, they present their engineering details notebook at noon. Rooting for OUR TEAM! We'll keep you posted.

Parents, have you checked your child's phone lately? Sometimes the littlest things can have an impact on how your child is perceived by others. Yesterday, a Mount Laurel Mom shared a screen shot of her child's phone open to the app House Party on the Mount Laurel Community Facebook Page. (So important to share such concerns.) It's apparently an app that allows users to chat online live, all at the same time. She said she reviewed the app and it seemed fine, but then she noticed that some of the students who were on the app had selected very inappropriate user names.

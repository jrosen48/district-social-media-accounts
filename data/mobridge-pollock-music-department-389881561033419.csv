Attention San Antonio music trip students and parents:

We are having problems with our Remind messaging account. Hopefully it will be resolved in a day or two. Until then, please ask your children for trip updates.

We also ran into an issue with the final payment amount. Again, we are working to resolve that tomorrow so we can give you the total amount of your final payment.

ESTIMATED amounts due are:
Students: $125
Adults: $215

Students/adults who are behind on payments will also have to turn in the late payments along with the final payment amount. Students who have a positive balance in their fundraiser account will owe less.

Attention Mobridge-Pollock 5th grade students:

It's time to clean your room and find your RECORDER! 5th grade music students will continue Recorder Karate this school year! Playing the recorder is a great way to learn to read music AND to help reinforce skills needed for band.

Please bring your recorder to school this week so we can get back in the swing of making awesome recorder music!

Make sure to write your name on the back side, near the bottom, with a permanent marker. You can bring it to Mrs. Zahn at the open house in the Upper Elementary on Monday night between 6:30 and 7:30 p.m., or bring it to school that week.

If you left your recorder in the music room in May, Mrs. Zahn already has it.

Can't find your recorder? Mrs. Zahn will have order forms to purchase a new one at a very small cost.

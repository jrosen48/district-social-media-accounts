Well, we made it! The school year has ended. Now what? I wish I had a better answer for you than “I am not sure,” but that is what I have. I know we will look different next year but overall the District will be striving for normalcy in these not normal times.

There will be multiple groups working on this throughout the summer. The plan is to have detailed information out by the end of July or early August. We have received guidance from the California Department of Education and the California Department of Public Health. We will be working with our local public health agency as well. All indications show a large reliance on local information and local decision making. That means our school year will look different than those in Surprise Valley, Susanville, or Fresno.

So stay tuned. We are hoping to see all of our students on August 19. One thing I can promise is that, as always, we will be doing everything we can to keep the students and staff of MJUSD safe.

In order to honor the guidance President Trump has issued regarding slowing the spread of COVID-19, we will be committing to the distance learning model through May 1.

We are hopeful to soon have Internet access devices for families that cannot access the Internet. Electronic devices, such as Chromebooks, are being loaned out to families by school site as needed.

We hope to be providing thermometers to families through a partnership with Kinsa. More details to come.

It is very important that your child checks their school email regularly. Also please maintain contact with school Facebook pages.

Please know we miss your kids and we are doing our best to supply what we do daily, but from a distance. Contact your child’s site if you have questions. Make sure to leave a message as the offices are not consistently occupied by staff.

Obviously, the Coronavirus is on everybody's mind. Here is a quick update from the District and there will be more information to follow in the coming days.

The District has had plans for a viral outbreak such as this for some time. We are also in contact with the County Public Health Department and will be in close collaboration with them as this situation progresses. At this time there are no cases in Modoc County.

Right now, our best bet is to continue to do what we always do:

-Wash hands often and for at least 20 seconds
-Keep your children home if they are sick
-If your child has a fever, do not send them to school until they are 24 hours fever-free without medication
-Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth
-Cover your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing

As mentioned above, we will have further guidance from Modoc County Public Health soon. Don't hesitate to contact your student's school if you have any questions or concerns.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2619068914996140&id=1483506595219050,,0.0,"Greetings,

Today at school a student was searching science fiction weaponry on the internet for a book the student is writing. Another student took a picture of the computer screen and posted the statement “don’t come to school tomorrow.” It was reported to the school by another student as a concern, when it was read on Snapchat. During the investigation with law enforcement, the student who posted the image admitted it was sent as a joke and they verified what was being searched on the internet as science fiction. There is no threat to the school or our students.

Message to our students: Consider what you post on social media. It may obviously cause concern for others and may create unintended consequences. If you do witness something that may be a threat, please notify a school employee so we can further investigate.

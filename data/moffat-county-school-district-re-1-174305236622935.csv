Due to weather conditions, specifically over Rabbit Ears Pass, the athletic directors in our league have reorganized the Middle School Girls District Basketball Tournament. Rangely will now be hosting A-D teams that are able to make it. With this change he is reworking the brackets and will have those ready by this afternoon. We have and will continue to be in close contact with all local authorities regarding road conditions throughout the day and into the morning to make sure the travel to Rangely is a safe choice.
As soon as the brackets are done I will have them sent out via email to families.

At least one of the Craig Middle School teams will play at 9am tomorrow.

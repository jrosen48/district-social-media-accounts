The middle and high school yearbooks are being merged into a single MALC yearbook (like we did for years until recently). The price will remain at the $45 high school yearbook price.

We recently announced that the upcoming high school graduation was being moved outdoors to The Battlefield at 10 am. However, in hope that the ""stay-at-home"" order will be lifted after April 30th and many in our community will be returning to the workplace, we are changing the date of the graduation to Saturday, May 9th.

We plan to mark off sections of the field for each family/small group to still provide some social distancing during the ceremony. We also realize that the community may not be ready for public gatherings yet at that time, so we are also working on a ""PLAN B"".

Again, this year's high school graduation is currently scheduled as follows:

MALC will be closed to all students beginning tomorrow. We will communicate with families as to the continuing education plan for their children in the near future. Students who receive free or reduced meals (grades K-12, including East Campus K-5) can come to the High School cafeteria (Main Campus) between 7:30 and 9:00 am tomorrow to pick up breakfast, and between 11:00 and 1:00 to pick up lunch. This includes the Little Pats program.

This evening, Governor Doug Ducey and State Superintendent Kathy Hoffman announced the closure of all Arizona schools from Monday March 16, 2020 through Friday March 27, 2020 due to COVID-19 (Coronavirus) precautions. MALC will be closed to all students beginning tomorrow. We will communicate with families as to the continuing education plan for their children in the near future. Students who receive free or reduced meals (grades K-12, including East Campus K-5) can come to the High School cafeteria (Main Campus) between 7:30 and 9:00 am tomorrow to pick up breakfast, and between 11:00 and 1:00 to pick up lunch. This includes the Little Pats program.
More detailed information to come soon.

Thank you,
MALC Administration

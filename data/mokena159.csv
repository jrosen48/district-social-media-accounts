We just refilled the bin with an awesome new Children's craft this morning. The craft is a Popsicle stick foam kite with googly eyes and a smile. All of the pieces are self-stick and the whole craft can be completed without glue or any other materials. Some parental assistance in tying the strings to the top and bottom of the craft may be needed for little ones. We hope you enjoy it!

These crafts are located in a pink bin outside the library's main entrance door. Please take only ONE (1) craft per child. These are free crafts for the community, so please think of your fellow community members before taking.

Again, please remember to practice safe social distancing and try to touch only the crafts you are going to take. All crafts have been individually packaged for sanitary purposes. A picture of what the craft looks like is provided below.

If interested, we will have these crafts out for the public until Saturday morning or until we run out of packages. Thank you! 😊",0.0,"Thank you, Mokena Library!

All of the pieces are self-stick and the whole craft can be completed without glue or any other materials. Some parental assistance in tying the strings to the top and bottom of the craft may be needed for little ones. We hope you enjoy it!

These crafts are located in a pink bin outside the library's main entrance door. Please take only ONE (1) craft per child. These are free crafts for the community, so please think of your fellow community members before taking.

Again, please remember to practice safe social distancing and try to touch only the crafts you are going to take. All crafts have been individually packaged for sanitary purposes. A picture of what the craft looks like is provided below.

If interested, we will have these crafts out for the public until Saturday morning or until we run out of packages. Thank you! 😊",2020-05-20 11:19:32,,

First stop, science to learn about Gizmos, online simulations that help power student inquiry and conceptual understanding. Gizmos also allows students to conduct virtual experiments.

MEF donated money that went towards the newly remodeled fitness center, complete with 30 Spivy bikes, rowers, and other functional fitness equipment. This room is unlike any junior high level fitness center!

Our last stop was the Resource Center to learn about the newly-implemented Rebecca Caudill Reading Program and see the flexible seating, which allows students and staff to re-configure the room to their needs.

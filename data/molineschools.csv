Alternate Graduation Plan for Moline High School:

The MHS commencement ceremony that was scheduled for May 24th cannot take place due to the Governor’s stay-at-home order, social distancing and health restrictions. MHS is planning an in-person event in July and we hope that family and friends can participate. Three contingency plans are in place for July, with details to follow. Our plans are dependent on the state and local health authorities’ recommendations for social distancing and gathering sizes. Please view the flyer on this post that outlines the three possibilities and other event info. (This flyer was distributed today with senior cap and gown.)

Seniors and parents, please watch for Principal Sander’s weekly newsletter via email for information about these and other senior events. Communication will also take place through the website and Skylert message.

Mona Shores Community,

I renew my apologies for the technical issues we had on Monday night that prevented many of you from joining our Board of Education meeting. Also, I thank so many of you who reached out with patience, understanding and kind words as we worked to resolve it and ultimately recessed the meeting to ensure that everyone who wants to participate can do so.

We can now accommodate up to 1,000 attendees for the resumed meeting, and we hope you will try again.

The meeting will resume at 7 p.m. Wednesday, Aug. 5, 2020, with Superintendent Bill O'Brien Jr.'s presentation of the draft back-to-school plan. This meeting will be only virtual.

As you may know, last night at 11:00 p.m., Governor Whitmer held a press conference. She announced a Statewide school closure beginning Monday, March 16 to April 6. For us that means April 13 is our return date to school as Spring Break falls April 6-13.

Today is a great opportunity for kids to grab personal items, stock up on books, and hear from their teachers regarding learning opportunities while they are away.

I want to reiterate that there are zero known cases of coronavirus in Muskegon County at this time. We support the Governor's decision as it will help slow the spread of the virus in our State and keep our kids and community safe.

Once again, this week's varsity football game will be in Kent County. Grand Rapids Public Schools has mandated early start times for evening outdoor athletic events consistent with the guidance of their local health department. As a result, the varsity football game against Grand Rapids Union this Friday, October 4th will kickoff at 5:00 PM.

Just like last week, this will present a challenge to working families trying to make it to the game on time. Your patience is appreciated as we work with GRPS to take whatever measures we can to minimize any potential health risk.

Sailor Nation,

Just over two hours ago, our football field was clear of snow. It was melting almost as soon as it hit the grass. Unfortunately, things have taken a bit of a turn for the worse. We now have a few inches of heavy, wet snow that can only be removed with snow shovels and blowers.

The good news is that we've been here before and we know what to do. From 3:30-5:00, anybody who is able and willing should report to Sailor Stadium with a shovel and/or backpack leaf blower to help clear the field. The snow should stop by 4:00 so by 5:00, the field should be completely cleared.

If you can help, please text the word ""IN"" to (231) 670-5053 so I know how much help to expect. The last time this happened, we ended up in Detroit on Thanksgiving weekend. Thanks in advance for any consideration. Go Shores!

I would like to share the following communication sent by the MAISD to alleviate rumors:

This morning multiple schools and Muskegon Community College (MCC) received phone calls with rumors of an active shooter at MCC. Schools in close proximity to MCC, MAISD offices, the Career Tech Center and Wesley School were immediately in lock-down mode as law enforcement and MCC staff investigated. Once we received confirmation from Muskegon City Police and Muskegon Township Police that there was no credible threat, and that these were false rumors, we resumed our normal operations.

Law enforcement will continue to monitor MCC, Baker, and Career Tech Center campuses throughout the day. Safety is a top priority for the MAISD and all of our education partners. We are thankful to law enforcement for their prompt response.

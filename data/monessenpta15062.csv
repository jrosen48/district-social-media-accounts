Please Spread the Word: Schools Can Donate Medical Supplies

Yesterday MCSD donated medical supplies to our local hospital. We could not think of someone in need or medical staff without or reusing a mask when there we some on a shelf in our empty buildings. While we could not give much, or deplete our supply, we could spare some to help. If a small district like ours can do it, any district can.

There are over 13,000 school districts and CTCs in the United States. Please spread the word for schools to consider helping by donating supplies (masks, gloves, swabs, etc.) to local hospitals and/or EMS if they haven’t already. I am sure it will be appreciated. Stay healthy!!!",0.0,"Monessen SD

Ok folks....before we know it it will be time to go back to school. This year I’m asking that my students get the following items. This will make it easier when getting things for class. I’m going with the color yellow. If your child is coming to 6th grade, they will need a yellow binder, 2 yellow folders, & a yellow notebook. If they prefer to use the loose paper & just put it in their binder that’s fine also. I chose the color yellow because my students are born to shine!!!! I attached a photo of the items I bought today at Walmart. Everything cost $3.88 for the yellow items. The material doesn’t have to be a certain brand as long as it’s the color. A☀️⭐️🌅

Also, Ms. Henry chose the color red. You will need a red binder, a red folder, & a red notebook. She chose red because it will go with her theme for the year!!!

Lastly, Ms. Guglielmi chose the color teal. You will need one teal binder, one teal folder, & one teal notebook. She chose teal because it will go with her theme for the year too!!!

For the second consecutive year, Monessen Middle School teacher Stephanie Kirkpatrick has combined her two passions to create memories with her students.
An English language arts teacher and the district’s student council sponsor, Kirkpatrick recently participated in the Pittsburgh Marathon 5K with a group of 46 students and parents.
“Every week after school, with the help of (teacher) Jen Cicchini, the students would stay after for an hour to train for the race,” Kirkpatrick said.
Last year, Kirkpatrick took 25 sixth-graders and their parents to run the 5K (3.1 miles), which is part of the Pittsburgh Marathon weekend. In addition to the 5k, events include a 1-mile run for kids, toddler trot, pet walk, half marathon (13.1 miles) and full marathon (26.2 miles).

Don't miss an announcement! Update your email & cell phone number!
Keep in mind the TylerSIS program works a lot with email! Make sure you have added @mr238.org to your safe senders / important / contacts list.

HELPFUL TIP: as some families are building support networks during Remote Learning you can put a babysitter, family member and caregiver phone numbers/email (depending on contact type) in Tyler. This may be helpful for communication.

Questions? Contact your student's teacher or school office for assistance in updating Tyler or understanding how to receive school messages.

Titan Families -
At Monmouth-Roseville School District, we want to ensure that all students have access to meals while we are doing a Remote Learning schedule.

Therefore, we will be offering a meal pickup option for enrolled students who are scheduled for remote learning.

The school district is still qualifies for free meals through the Community Eligibility Provision, so there is no cost to you.

For planning purposes, at this time we ask that you please fill out this survey Remote Meal Service to allow our department to get an estimate of how many remote learning families would be interested in the pick-up meal service option.

A future link will provide you with information to formally order meals.

If you have any questions you can leave your comment on the survey

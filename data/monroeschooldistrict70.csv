To celebrate the end of the school year, for the final chapter of our Quarantine Concert, members of the 6-8 Choir present ""You Will Be Found"" from the musical ""Dear Evan Hansen."" This powerful song was picked to be the last song on our Spring Concert to close out the year, and because of the last two months it seems even more powerful. Filmed from their own homes and learned completely on their own (we only had a chance to rehearse this song for ONE DAY prior to the closure), it's a poignant reminder to continue to be creative and expressive even when at home and that we will continue to find ways to rely on and support each other.",0.0,"Monroe Music

Recorded by the students individually in their own homes, the students use chromebooks, tablets, cell phones, or other devices to record themselves playing along with a track to stay together. Are these virtual performances perfect? No. Do they replicate the experience of making music together all in a room? Of course not.

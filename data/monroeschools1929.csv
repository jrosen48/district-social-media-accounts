In keeping with Senate Bill 367, which was signed into law in July, Georgia has eliminated half of the Georgia Milestones End-of-Course tests required of high school students.

Georgia has now seen the largest reduction in standardized testing in state history, going from 32 state-required assessments in 2015 to 19 beginning this school year. SB 367 also removed the fifth-grade social studies Georgia Milestones assessment, reducing Georgia elementary-school testing to the federal minimum.

We are seeking local businesses (and asking our former partners) if they had any work we could do. Stuffing envelopes, folding flyers, folding towels, stamping logos, sorting orders or items...... we LOVE to help and WORK! We would arrange pick up and drop off! And all of this is FREE OF CHARGE and done with love and enthusiasm while teaching valuable job/life skills.

Just a reminder this event takes place on Wednesday!

The Monroe County Sheriff's Office and Tommy Campbell's Collision Center are partnering with Rescue Mission to bring much needed food to our communities.

Food will be available at different locations around Monroe County for pick up every Wednesday from July 8th - August 5th. Each location will be a ""drive through, no-contact"" pick-up, and 500 boxes will be given out.

Please note only 1 (one) box will be given per vehicle. Each box contains enough food for 1 - 2 meals and a gallon of milk.

Monroe County's next food pick-up will be Wednesday, July 15th 11:30 to 1:30 pm at Ellis Field, 39 College Street, Culloden.

The Monroe County Fine Arts Center is missing its wonderful patrons and all the talented student and visiting performers. While we ""socially distance"" ourselves, let's revisit some of the fun we've had over the past three years.

Tonight's picture honors the theater and choral students of the MPHS Class of 2020. The Fine Arts Center has been the backdrop for many senior pictures during the past few weeks. Tonight, five Mary Persons High School seniors and three moms were having a photo shoot just before sundown -- a scene which made us at the same time happy and a little bit sad. One of the Moms said the girls (all chorus and/or theater students) had come to take pictures at the FAC which had become their ""second home"" during the past three years. Tomorrow night, they will be among the Class of 2020 Reverse Parade taking place between the MP building and the FAC. We will miss these girls -- and their talented classmates -- who have given us much joy as they have sung, danced and performed for us. Here's wishing each of you only the best that life has to give.",0.0,"Monroe County Fine Arts Center

At Home Learning Session 2 - Inset Animal Puzzle

Monroe County Parent Mentor
April 14 at 3:07 PM ·

This video is honestly one that is more difficult to share. This skill is one he has mastered again and again; however, as you can see, Zander is struggling more from and emotional/behavioral standpoint. As his mother/teacher, it is sometimes hard for me to remain patient, particularly when I know he is capable. I think you can see that on my face.

I think the key is quality learning time over quantity, patience, and being aware of your own head space as a teacher. I hope this is a helpful reminder that we all struggle, but can persevere!

The Monroe County Department of Instructional Student Supports is compiling resources to assist your child with Occupational and Speech therapy needs. A special Mentor Messages email has gone out with a list of links for Occupational Therapy. Parents, continue to watch your email and social media for more to come. I know all of these resources at once can be a little overwhelming. We will strive to keep it as streamlined and organized as possible. Additionally, a Learning Toolbox link has been set up on the Department of Instructional Student Support page.

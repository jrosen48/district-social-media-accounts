Without the passage of the PI levy the finances of the district would have been severely impacted. The PI money can only be used for purchases lasting more than 5yrs like busses and equipment. With the PI money the district would have to use General Fund Money to make up the difference.

Our district continues to make great strides in student academic achievement, creating new and exciting opportunities for our students, and in financial stability. None of this would be possible without the ongoing support of our community.

Q: Didn’t the Capital Projects Bond to renovate schools that was passed in 2015 include technology?

A: School district bonds approved by voters can ONLY be used to purchase property for schools, construct new schools, or modernize existing schools. Through funding from the 2015 bond, we were able to modernize Park Place Middle School, Salem Woods Elementary, Frank Wagner Elementary, and Hidden River Middle School. The modernization of these schools included technology such as electronic locks and programming, security systems and wireless network infrastructure. The bond did not pay for classroom presentation systems, student devices, or staff computing devices. Funding for those technologies came from the Technology Levy that was passed in 2014.

Shimabukuro performed songs, taught students about the ukelele and encouraged the students to find their passion in life, follow it and stay drug free.

You could see how excited Frank Wagner students were to practice all that they had learned on their ukeleles in music class. Thanks to a $6K Music Matters grant from Music Aid Northwest and Washington Music Educators Association (WMEA), more ukeleles are on the way to Frank Wagner!

To start, each student had a caterpillar at their desk to care for and observe. The caterpillars stayed on their desks until they were in the chrysalis stage. At that point, they moved into large nets where they would work hard to become butterflies.

The excited students practiced their patience during the entire process and were sure to write down their observations in great detail during each stage as the caterpillar transformed into a butterfly.

When release day arrived, the students carefully took the butterflies out to the field, gathered in a circle and waiting quietly for them to fly away. Giggles filled the circle when the butterflies were a little shy and needed a bit of encouragement to take flight. When they were finally ready, some butterflies took to the sky while others landed on nearby grass, and to much delight, on several students.

What an amazing opportunity for our students. Look to the skies, you may see some of their butterflies!

A group of 4th graders completed the Beecher's Handmade Cheese Pure Food Kids workshop last week where they learned to be food detectives!

The Pure Food Kids workshop is a standards-aligned, nutrition education and cooking lesson that sparks curiosity about what’s really in the foods kids might eat. The students learned how to read nutrition labels and ingredient lists and how food companies are marketing to kids. To end the day, they learned to be chefs, cooking and eating tasty, nourishing veggie chili right in their classroom, complete with a chili cheers to celebrate! There were a lot of excited kids hoping to replicate the chili recipe at home for their families. What a fun learning opportunity for our students!

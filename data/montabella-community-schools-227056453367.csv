RE: Calendar Change

The calendar for the 20-21 school year has a slight change since the original publication. Several early release dates have been eliminated. The orginal calendar had early release days that were scheduled back to back so that required teacher professional development could take place in the afternoons. The new calendar will reflect a full day of teacher professional development where students do not report to school and the following day will be a regular (full) day of school. The only early release days that remain on the calendar will be in December (end of semester), March (conferences) and May (last day of school). The updated calendar is attached for your reference. We apologize for the late change in schedule but hope that this more consistent release time will benefit families.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10159995306388368&id=227056453367,,0.0,"To: Montabella Families

This year, the MHSAA has waived the annual requirement of a sports physical, provided some things are completed and there was no significant change in health in the student-athlete.

Any student coming into 7th grade and didn't have a sports physical from last year, will still need to schedule a sports physical (please do it soon) prior to participating in any athletic activities. If the student completed a sports physical last year (2019-2020) and the form was turned into the school office, a questionnaire is all that is required. *Note - significant medical changes may require a new physical. Additionally, if a parent wants their student(s) to get a new sports physical, you can do that as well.

This includes practices, open gyms, fitness center use, or any team gatherings (team banquets, spring training trips, and team bonding activities).

As I receive more information from our Superintendent, surrounding schools, and the MHSAA, I will make the best decision to help mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus, and to keep our students, coaches/staff, parents and community remain safe.

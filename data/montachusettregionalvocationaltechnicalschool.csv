When Kira was in the fifth grade, she saw a child taking food out of a recycling bin at her school. This touched something deep in Kira, who was adopted from China by her American family when she was 17 months old and who, her parents believe, often went hungry during the early months of her life. She and her father did some research and learned that one in five children go to bed hungry. ""I wanted to do something to help children who are less fortunate than me,"" said Kira.

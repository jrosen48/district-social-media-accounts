1) This is in far western Montana.

2) The critter that left them was just a little guy, but if the critter were a gal it would be much bigger.

3) The tracks weren’t there in the evening when I went to bed but were there first thing in the morning.

With Montana's bow hunting, which opens Sept. 5, and upland game bird seasons, which opened Sept. 1, remember that slow moving, quiet or game-calling, scented and camouflaged hunters will soon be sharing the landscape with the state's even stealthier bears that may be stalking similar prey.

Given the uncertainty of where and when these dispersing bears might show up, hunters should:

- carry bear spray, be prepared and know how to use it
- hunt with a partner and let someone else know your plans
- get harvested big game out of the woods quickly
upon returning to a site where harvested game is left unattended, study the site at a distance for any movement or changes and signal your approach by making plenty of noise
- never attempt to frighten or haze a bear from a carcass
- contact FWP if a bear has consumed a carcass or covered it with debris rendering it unsalvageable

Still today, moose in this region are notably smaller compared to their largest relatives in Alaska, and are tracked separately in trophy records. However, FWP biologists recently joined other western states and provinces from Colorado to Alaska and used hunter-provided tissue samples to test if Shiras moose are genetically distinct.

The cubs will be placed at Bearizona Wildlife Park, located in Williams, AZ. This 158-acre facility is accredited by the Zoological Association of America and is home to 39 black bears and many other species of North American wildlife. The wildlife park receives more than 400,000 visitors annually and educates the public on the importance of conservation and wildlife management.

The cubs came from a female that was involved in a surprise encounter with a hiker near Dupuyer. The female was euthanized on April 9 by FWP staff after she was shot and injured by a hiker. At the time, it wasn’t clear how many cubs she had, though it was thought she had at least one.

Initial test results have identified a white-tailed buck deer in Gallatin County as being suspect for carrying chronic wasting disease.

The deer was euthanized earlier this month in the Springhill area of north Bozeman after displaying several classic symptoms of the disease.

This case is the first detection of CWD in Gallatin County. CWD was first detected in Montana in 2017 and is known to exist along the state’s southern and northern borders, as well as in neighboring states and provinces. The first detection of CWD in southwest Montana was in December near Sheridan.

CWD is a fatal disease affecting the nervous system of deer, elk and moose. Transmission most commonly occurs through direct contact between animals. Carcasses and bodily fluids of infected animals can also be sources of infection for other cervids that come into contact with them.

The online courses and mandatory field days have been available to adults for a tuition fee of $25 for hunter education and $30 for bowhunter education. The in-person courses have always been, and will remain, free. However, since the in-person options aren’t feasible under Phases 1 and 2 of Gov. Steve Bullock’s Reopening the Big Sky plan, FWP will cover the online tuition fees for all Montana residents until the state reaches Phase 3 of the plan and in-person hunter and bowhunter education courses are available once again.

The 2020 paddlefish seasons on the Yellowstone and Lower Missouri rivers (yellow tag) are canceled in response to Gov. Steve Bullock’s extension of the directives for social distancing and non-resident quarantine to help stop the spread of COVID-19.

As of now, paddlefish season on the Upper Missouri River from Fort Benton downstream to Fort Peck Dam (white tag) will remain in place and the drawing for these limited tags occurred April 6. The fishery opens May 1 and is conducted in a more dispersed manner. There are also no proposed changes to the archery paddlefish season (blue tag) in the Dredge Cuts below Fort Peck Dam. Both of these opportunities are subject to change if angler congestion becomes an issue.

Team Grayling absolutely dominated Rocky Mountain Sculpins in for their 1st tournament victory in Melrose, Montana, but Walleye fandom rejoiced as their team terrorized yet another salmonid in this tournament with dominating play propelled by otherworldly “6th -man” participation. Can Governor Steve Bullock’s pick (https://www.facebook.com/MontanaFWP/videos/830343827434402/) to cut down the nets in Ft. Benton, Artic Grayling, raise their magnificent dorsal fins to new heights or will Minnesota’s State Fish continue their toothy, vitreous play.

This information is useful when folks want to try and encourage beavers to settle in a new area where they can do a lot of good work!

The need for this basic dispersal and settlement information spurred my graduate research, where we radio-marked young beavers and followed them as they struck out on their own to establish a territory and get to being busy.

It has been approximately one year since I started doing Tuesdays with Torrey and I have truly enjoyed it. I think social media gets a bad rap these days and seeing people comment with photos and stories and snippets of their wildlife encounters has been a lot of fun and reminded me why I still like this platform.

To celebrate the approximately one-year anniversary I would now like to introduce you to my absolute tippy-top favorite animal… Castor canadensis. I am forced to use the Latin name here because no matter how much we all wish it weren’t so, the internet is the internet. The North American Beaver (Castor canadensis) is one of the most fascinating and important animals in the entire northern hemisphere, and over the coming weeks I want to take you on a brief (ha!) tour of the industrious beavers and all their workings. Along the way, I will sprinkle in many more examples of Montana’s wealth of nongame wildlife, but with a special focus on those species beavers can directly or indirectly benefit, which is a lot of species.

If you see the number 008 written on a data sheet, it’s from a biologist sampling fish in one of Montana’s 39 waterbodies that contain the elusive kokanee salmon. In MT, biologists use 156 unique species codes and abbreviations when enumerating fish. Kokanee (or “KOK”) are a landlocked form of sockeye salmon that primarily feed on zooplankton (tiny crustaceans) suspended in the water column. Anglers target kokanee in open water by trolling a variety of lures that look nothing like their food source, essentially antagonizing the fish to bite. KOK typically live 3-4 years before morphologically changing and donning the classic bright red colors in the fall, looking for a place to spawn. A smoked delicacy, kokanee are prized table fare for even the pickiest critic.

It wasn’t that long ago that Montana had one fishing regulation for the entire state: 10-pounds, plus 1 fish. Today there are 100’s of different regulations, but arguably one of the most consistent regulations, is for rainbow trout. Generally, a limit of 5 fish daily, 10 in possession (some, with varying length restrictions) apply to most waterbodies across the state.

There are four species of catfish (family Ictaluridae) found in Montana; two native species (Channel Catfish and Stonecat), and two nonnative species (Black Bullhead and Yellow Bullhead). Catfishes are notably distinct in having barbels (often called whiskers) and an adipose fin (the fleshy appendage also found on trout, salmon, and whitefish)…although, the adipose fin of a Stonecat isn’t very apparent, as it is fused with the caudal fin.

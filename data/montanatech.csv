Scientists from the Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology are drilling monitoring wells in the Gallatin Valley, to support data-driven evaluation of residential and commercial development effects on water availability and quality in the Upper Gallatin River Corridor. As a non-regulatory State agency, the MBMG provides information on the State’s geologic, mineral, energy, and water resources. Understanding groundwater availability and quality is important for stakeholders in the Big Sky area—including fisheries, local businesses, and area residents.

Here at Sibanye-Stillwater we have a total of eight interns working for the company this summer. In the first photo, we have pictured from left to right: Cody Lewman, Kerstin Sweet, Joyce Karaj, Kayla Hillig, Lindsey Wooley, and David Otto. Not pictured (Parker Jones and David Wuellner). Also a look into mine! These are a few pictures captured of underground, as well as other interns here this summer, a nice piece of work from a muck truck, and the mill processing center.

I know I mentioned the other day that I spend my days and nights either managing the MBMG Data Center (https://mbmg.mtech.edu/datacenter) or making sure I have enough content either recorded or posted online, emails and messages from students replied to, etc. So, this morning I thought I would highlight both my campus and home command centers. Diggers rise to meet and overcome challenges because it's who we are.

The move to completely online course delivery has been a challenge to be sure. My Technical Writing students are participating in a ""One Room Virtual Schoolhouse"" in a Facebook group since we are learning about how social media supports Technical Writing principles. My Database Designers are working on a Museum Information Management System. I'm excited to see what the finish line brings!

Having lots of fun in Advanced Technical Writing this morning. This semester's project is to research, propose, design, and test a game for use in an educational setting. Today, we had three groups present and test games that cover Geography, Anatomy & Physiology, and General Knowledge trivia. Very fun to watch the development of active-learning principles while using active-learning principles.

Our campus is deeply saddened with the passing of a great Oredigger, John “Jocko” Evans ‘65. Jocko had enjoyed a long career in industry before returning to Tech first as a faculty member and later becoming department head of Petroleum Engineering. During his time at Tech, Jocko taught and mentored hundreds of students, launching them on the pathway to their own extraordinary futures.

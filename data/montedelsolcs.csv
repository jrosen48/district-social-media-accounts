There is a really important bill in discussion right now that could impact Monte del Sol dramatically. Monte del Sol has a diverse population that is 16% English Language Learners, 23% Special Education students, and 68% economically disadvantaged. 70% of our student population are minorities. SB1 would severely inhibit Monte del Sol‚Äôs ability to function. Monte del Sol receives a budget adjustment due to its smaller size, but SB1 would take that away and reduce our budget by at least $350,000. With the sorts of constraints on Monte del Sol‚Äôs annual budget it would be very difficult to operate Monte del Sol and keep our doors open. Yazzie v. State of New Mexico ruling is meant to help disadvantaged populations in New Mexico, passing this bill would hurt that exact population at Monte del Sol, which is a vast majority of our kiddos. Please PLEASE consider writing to the Governor in regards to this bill. Encourage her to separate the small schools funding from teacher raises! Thank you for your help and support for our school!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3023147301044290&id=116499965042386,,0.0,"ACTION NEEDED!!!!

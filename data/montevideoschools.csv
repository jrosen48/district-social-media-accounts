Pets are part of many people’s everyday lives. They not only provide us with companionship but pets can give us emotional support, reduce our stress levels, help us to increase our social activities and they can add to a child's self-esteem and positive emotional development.

His intense yet honest message was very powerful. He reminded each Thunder Hawk that THEY mattered. Their story matters. They are not alone!

Mr. Greenwood inspired and motivated our students to make healthy and positive actions. He told us that we all have a story and our story matters. He empowered our youth to rise up with confidence and persevere through each of their own unique challenges. Our students left the gym with a renewed sense of self-worth. This experience was incredible.

Ask your student, “Do you remember that day in January when Cory Greenwood spoke to your school?” Or, ask them what they remembered about his presentation.

Mr. Greenwood made a short video for our Thunder Hawk Seniors.

Plans have been set in place for Montevideo High School’s 2020 Graduation Ceremony on Sunday, May 31 beginning at approximately 8:45 pm in the High School parking lot. This time was chosen to accomodate a movie screen that can be viewed after sunset.

A “drive-in” style ceremony is being planned for the graduate and their immediate family only in enclosed vehicles (sorry, no other vehicles or spectators will be allowed to attend the ceremony).

The Commencement ceremony will be live-streamed and it will be broadcasted over KDMA Radio.

There will be a Senior Parade prior to the ceremony - the route will be announced as soon as it is finalized.

Our FAAM staff has done such an awesome job creating fun activities for the FAAM students! For each chapter, Mrs. Crittenden (2nd grade) did something silly or fun and encouraged the kids to do it with her. In this session (that Olivia is watching) she told the kids to gather a bunch of stuffed animals. Mrs. Crittenden was surrounded by her stuffed Easter bunny collection.

We are able to meet this in two ways, our Sponsorship Drive each Spring and working Concessions at most of our Middle and High School Athletic Events.

The Athletic Boosters meet the first Wednesday of every month during the school year and the first Sunday in June, July and August at 7pm in the High School Library. Boosters are responsible for attending monthly meetings and working designated concession shifts each sporting season.

It doesn't cost anything to join and you, your spouse and school age children receive athletic passes for all regular season athletic events. Please contact this year's President Al Jacobs by phone 319-480-4016 or stop in any of our stands during any sporting event if you have any questions or are interested in joining.

Keep on trucking. It is okay if you don’t end up where you thought you were going. Take every “failure” as a way to learn and grow. Don’t let a set back get you down. Look at it as a reset and a chance to improve who you are. As my dad always taught me, “treat others as you want to be treated.”

Coach McDonald will set-up a Google Meet on Thursday May 28th to go over expectations, State guidelines, and what the season will look like. We are excited to get to play but the safety of everyone involved is our 1st priority. There will be guidelines put in place to ensure the safety of all the players and coaches involved. One thing that will help mitigate the risks with Covid 19 is for each player to have their own helmet. Todd Lambert and Kevin Hansen at Monticello Sports have team helmets available on the team apparel store that is posted on the Monticello Softball Facebook page. We encourage each player to purchase their own helmet. If this is a concern, please feel free to contact coach McDonald directly for options.

One thing that will help mitigate the risks with Covid 19 is for each player to have their own helmet. Todd Lambert and Kevin Hansen at Monticello Sports have team helmets available on the team apparel store that is posted on the Monticello Softball Facebook page. We encourage each player to purchase their own helmet. If this is a concern, please feel free to contact coach McDonald directly for options.

Thank you!

Any 8th-12th Graders going out for baseball this upcoming summer need to email Coach Harms (kolby.harms@monticello.k12.ia.us) and inform him they are going out by Tuesday, May 26th.

I will also have a rules meeting/expectations/info over facetime before the first practice. I am excited for the season and our coaching staff is ready to get started, but safety for our players is our number one priority. There are precautions and guidelines we will follow to ensure their safety. I will get more information on those guidelines out in the next week. After that, if you still have concerns please contact me. To help ensure player safety and due to the circumstances of COVID 19, we are recommending each player buy their own helmet. There are different options, but I prefer it to be black so everyone matches. Todd Lambert and Kevin Hansen at Monticello Sports will know what helmet you will need. Financially if that is not possible, please contact me and we can help solve that problem.

Thanks

Later today, Century House Gifts and Flowers, All American Lawn & Landscape, and the Presbyterian Pie Ladies are giving away a gift to a deserving nurse in honor of Nurse's Day.

Their generosity has inspired us to sponsor a gift giveaway as well. They've got the nurses covered, so we're going to focus on local teachers in honor of Teacher Appreciation Week.

I'm not sure about all of you, but our current ""home schooling"" situation has definitely given me a new appreciation for our teachers. So now until noon on Friday, May 8th, you can nominate a teacher you feel deserves recognition. On Friday, we'll draw the name of one lucky teacher to receive $50 in Chamber Bucks.

Simply comment with the teacher's name and a brief reason for your nomination and they'll automatically be entered into the drawing.",0.0,"Nominate a teacher you feel deserves some recognition!

Attention 2020-21 Kirkwood Academy Students (and parents). Your online orientation is due tonight at midnight. This is the first step to confirm your interest and demonstrates commitment and responsibility for college coursework in high school. During the past six weeks, I've sent several messages and reminders to access your emailed letter, sign up for Remind and complete orientation in Talon.

275 out of 375 have completed....and yes you need to do this if you attended 2019-20.....that has also been clear. :) I can't share this information with parents so please ask your kiddo. We don't want them to miss out on a great opportunity and we can't wait to have them at JREC this August! It's GO time!

If students are unsure where to find, start with my email sent 4/7. www.kirkwood.edu/studentemail This directs them to Remind setup and how to access orientation in www.kirkwood.edu/talon",7.0,"KIRKWOOD.EDU

At this time we have cancelled sports practices and Panther Academy immediately and will assess the situation in the morning and get out further information as soon as possible.

Tomorrow the state legislature will meet to discuss how the days will be handled. Once the state legislature has provided additional guidance we will send out more information tomorrow evening. They should help us understand this situation better and answer questions we all have.

Prom is a little over a month away!

Just a reminder, your $25 donation and $10 t-shirt fee is due March 18. Spring Break is next week and know you will all be busy, so get those in this week! The parent letter and t-shirt form is attached or they are available in the HS Office.

If your child plans on attending Post Prom, their t-shirt is their ticket to get into Post Prom. After March 18 they are not guaranteed a t-shirt and will have to pay the $10 entry fee. More details on Grand March and Post Prom coming soon!!

Thank you for your support!

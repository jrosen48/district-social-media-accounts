Although we were all probably a little nervous, things have gone even better than hoped.

Thank you for your patience and cooperation this morning. Even with temperature checks, almost every single student was in the building and ready to learn by 7:56. Awesome! Can we keep up that early arrival?! :)

Our teachers and students are amazing. We know there are some kinks to work out--especially for our distance learners (among other hitches, it sounds like there were Zoom failures nationwide as millions of students returned to school today)--but our plan is working! We have fewer students here on campus, they are learning safety protocols well, and I saw a lot of joy across campus. 💯

Distance learners, please hang in there. Our teachers are working to clarify everything for you. You also likely won't have as much of a load this week, as much of the learning is focused on classroom procedures.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3260318697408362&id=176805675759695,,0.0,"What a great first day so far!

End-of-the-School-Year Goodbye Parade!

Friday, May 29th

- Drive through the parking lot and carpool lane to say (or yell or wave) goodbye to the teachers and staff
- It's going to be a Hawaiian-style party for the staff, so feel free to join in the theme
- If it forecast to be 96 degrees and sunny on Friday!
- Hoses and water guns will be present! Each car will have the chance to signal if they are okay with being sprayed, so you may want to dress up the kids in bathing suits and throw some old towels on the car's floors and seats!
- Our lunch staff will be distributing free lunches for all kids 0-18 yrs as one stop on the parade, so come hungry! (Their lunches are amazing.)

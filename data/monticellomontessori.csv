Coronavirus By: Kamryn

Isolation quickly overwhelms me
Social distancing is six feet apart
Quarantined in our homes, no friends to see
No toilet paper to fill up the cart

A pandemic spreading across the globe
Can’t go outside, only see family
No social contact, I’m gonna explode
Panicking, we all lose our sanity

Losing jobs, no toilet paper what next?
People are dying, such a tragedy
What to do? This virus is too complex
This event will affect humanity

As it ends, it will still be inside us

Dear Monticello Families,
The State Board of Education and the Governor's Office, at this time, are NOT recommending statewide school closures. Monticello will be closed Monday (tomorrow) however, so staff can work out plans for remote schooling should the state recommendation for that change later on. School will resume on Tuesday, with Social Distancing in effect.

IMPORTANT: Please plan to use the carpool lane only to pick students up. If you are picking children up before school dismissal, please call the office to have your child sent out to you. The office will check students out for you. In order to do our part in limiting social contact, visitors, parents, transportation personnel, and delivery folks will not enter the school's buildings.

We appreciate your understanding, your cooperation, and your team work with us as we all do our part to limit Covid19 among our vulnerable community members. Remember to scrub hands often, cover coughs and sneezes, and do not shake hands.

Kind regards,

Erica Kemery, Ed.S.",0.0,"Nari Ann Mendenhall is at Monticello Montessori Public Charter School.

What do you say when Grandma says, ""A Montessori school? What is that?"" Who do you call when you really need to carpool because the car battery died overnight?

Learn the answers to these and other questions here Thursday, September 12th - TOMORROW NIGHT- from 6:30-7:30. At Parent Night, teachers reach out to parents to help them make new friends, find old ones, learn about Montessori, and find out ways to be involved with your child's education.

Please come for 1 hour to meet and make friends, and learn about Montessori education and our Monticello Community.

Miss Ashley will be here to watch little ones if any come with their parents.

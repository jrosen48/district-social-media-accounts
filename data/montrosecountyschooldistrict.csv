Earlier this week, school administrators and parents of the class of 2020 graduates, placed pictures of each graduate on the Montrose High School football field in tribute to this year’s graduates who had their senior year cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Graduation is tomorrow May 17, and instead of walking across a stage to receive their diplomas, graduates will be separated, and driven individually in cars in line to receive their diplomas.
Graduation weekend in Montrose has always been a big weekend for this community as we celebrate another year and another class of kids moving on from school. We are all proud of the class of 2020 and wish them luck in the future.

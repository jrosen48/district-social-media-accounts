It can be accessed directly at¬†www.ncmcs.org/transportationrequest.

Moore County Schools is recommending parents drive their children to school, if possible, as bus transportation will possibly require social distancing and be subject to delays due to temperature screening requirements as directed by the state.

The deadline to request bus transportation is Sunday, July 19. If you are unable to complete the online form, please contact the Transportation Department at 910-947-5481.

As announced last month, Moore County Schools will be offering a 100 percent virtual remote learning option for students for the fall 2020 semester. Once a student registers for this option, they will be required to remain in the remote learning option for the entire semester. Registration for this option will open early next week and will continue through Thursday, July 23. An announcement will be made once registration is open.",2020-07-07 18:02:30,,

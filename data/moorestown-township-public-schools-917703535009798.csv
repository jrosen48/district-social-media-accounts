The program provides opportunities for students with special needs to learn job related skills through supported volunteer employment within the community. Many of our students work in local businesses and with the Township in various roles throughout the school year. Students also shared dog biscuits with Moorestown residents in attendance that were baked in our very own Bow Wow Bakery!

In addition, MHS students and staff supported World Down Syndrome Day by presenting a $230 donation to the Town Council. Funds were raised through purchases from ""Common Grounds,"" our school’s new coffee cafe.

Meet Bette!

Parent Educator Bette Stieglitz is retiring after joining Moorhead Area Public Schools in 1988. She worked in Early Childhood Family Education throughout her entire career.

Bette was honored to be nominated by our staff at Probstfield for 2013 Teacher of the Year. “There have been so many endearing moments in my work with young families. I appreciate their gratitude for helping them do the most important job they will ever have, which is to be a strong and loving parent to their children,” she says.

In retirement, Bette will be gardening, traveling, spending time with family and keeping warm in Arizona during the winter.

Teacher Barb Stack is retiring after joining Moorhead Area Public Schools in 1989. “I'm leaving education knowing that teaching had the best years of me. I've put myself on the line for what I believe is best for learners and education. As I watch this chapter of life close,
I look back with no regrets,” she says.

Her most memorable ""time period"" in her career includes the years she taught at Robert Asp under the leadership of Dr. Betty Myers. “She created a school culture that was a mystical blend of high expectations, creativity and extended family. My skills as an educator and my growth as a human being grew under her mentorship more that I believed possible. Those years, and Robert Asp, will always hold a special place in my heart.”

In retirement, Barb looks forward to seeing all of the National Parks in the lower 48 states with her husband.

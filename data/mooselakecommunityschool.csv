Because of the large numbers of meals and assignments that we are delivering, it would be helpful if each family would place a weatherproof container at the end of their driveway with your child's name clearly labeled on the lid. This will create a more efficient way to deliver the meals and assignments. Many driveways are soft and this is creating problems for the drivers. In addition, this will give your family and our drivers another level of protection with social distancing.

If you need internet to access the online content, you may drive in the bus parking to connect with our guest wifi network from the warmth of your vehicle. Just park as close to building as you can without going on the sidewalk.

Late this afternoon, we were advised by the Governor’s office and the Department of Health that all concerts with attendance over 250 should be cancelled or postponed. In light of this unprecedented situation, it is with great regret that we must cancel the “Ring of Kerry” concert on Sunday, March 15. We have no idea when this ban will be lifted, so regrettably we are unable to say that the concert will be rescheduled. We were looking forward to sharing our next season with you. Please visit our website soon (www.agateencores.org) and you will be able to see the promotional video. Thank you for your understanding.

This week was a long and tough for the Lady Rebels but they persevered. Tuesday was a record night for the Rebels as Natalie Mikrot got her 1000th point and the girls set a team record with 16 '3 pointers' in an awesome game against Mesabi East only to lose by about 15. The Rebels had ME on the ropes most of the game but ran out of gas in the 4th quarter. Thursday they lost a tough game against Milaca but never gave up the fight only losing by 2 in the end, but it literally went down to the last second. Friday, the girls were able to get back on track with a 77-52 win against Mora. THESE GIRLS ARE FUN TO WATCH. Come join us on Thursday 12/12 against Barnum in ML. It's sure to be a night to remember!

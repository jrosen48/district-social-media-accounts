LP’s third grade teacher Lindsay Garrity wanted to be a teacher since she was a child. She believes in the “whole child” approach to education, providing support to kids emotionally, as well as academically. “There is nothing more satisfying than seeing the look on a child’s face when they understand something for the first time, or when they know I will support them and have their back,” she says. Mrs. Garrity is working hard to implement distance learning in her classroom, and she appreciates the community support: “While this has been one of the strangest and most challenging years of my teaching career, it has definitely shone a light on the amazing support of the Moraga community.“ Thank you, Mrs. Garrity, for Making Moraga Brighter!￼ #thankyoumoragateachers #moragaeducation #lookingforwardtogettingbacktoschool #makingmoragabrighter",0.0,"We love our teachers!

Comment below about how a librarian has impacted your or your child’s life!

The Rheem librarian, Mrs. Gillbanks, goes above and beyond to serve students, helping them find books at their level and with age-appropriate content (a task that can be challenging when the student’s reading level falls outside what is typical for their age). She loves finding the right books for kids, and often continues to give book recommendations to kids after they’ve graduated from Rheem! Mrs. Gillbanks also has requested to take her lunch break at a time that doesn’t coincide with the student lunch period so that she can be available to kids and keep the library open for students who want to spend their lunch break there. This unstructured time allows her to connect with students and provide them the support they need, both academically and socially.

Moravia FFA wants to thank you for your generous support of our FFA program. We had an overwhelming amount of support for our small greenhouse, and couldn't appreciate you more.

One thing our program has never had to worry about is not being supported by our community. In a town the size of Moravia sometimes teachers worry that they may not have the support, or monetary support to give kids opportunities that create experiences for them. As a teacher in Moravia, I can say that I have never worried about that.

We thank you so much for all your wonderful comments and support during these challenging times.

With that being said, we only have one more sale left. From now, until Tuesday at noon all plants in the greenhouse will be half off. Due to the heat and nature of things, some of the plants are less healthy, and of course variety has went down. However, there are still a few plants left that may be of interest.

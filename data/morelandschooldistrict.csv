Moreland Middle School’s 2nd mural design with a focus on positivity! I was hired to design 2 murals that would give the school a fresh new look that the students would enjoy while complimenting the new campus’s color palette. The students and staff enjoyed seeing the process and the end result. A big thank you to Principal Ann Doumanian for putting this together. Thank you. Paul J.

Thank you to Monika Rose for her graphic assistance and to Chis C. for his talented straight line work!

Thank you to the Moreland School District Board of Trustees for inviting my team and me to join you in celebrating the wonderful work Beautiful Day and other volunteers have done renovating Easterbrook Discovery School’s Moreland Woods. I recently visited the project to see its progress and was blown away by how much their community of volunteers had accomplished. This week I co-sponsored a budget item with Supervisor Ellenberg* which awarded over 250 thousand dollars to the district to finish this outdoor classroom. I am so excited to see how this money will improve the education of all the students in this district, and complete a space where a new type of learning can happen! Thank you to Beautiful Day and the Moreland District for dreaming big, delivering this amazing accomplishment to students, and allowing me to be a part of it.

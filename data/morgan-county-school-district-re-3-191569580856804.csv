Wellness Kit Wednesday
Columbine Elementary, Fort Morgan
The indoor recess season was off to a slow start in many parts of Colorado this year, but the cold and wet weather has finally arrived. In preparation, parents and staff at Columbine Elementary created four indoor recess wagons using the Classroom Physical Activity kit.

In previous years, students played board games or sat on a computer when the weather was bad. Now, they wheel the wagons around the school and use the fitness dice, yoga cards, activity spots, and juggling scarves to create their own self-guided movements. When the equipment is not in use for indoor recess, students have the option to check out a wagon to have an active birthday celebration.

Tomorrow's weather forecast is evidencing temperatures between 25 - 43 degrees with winds at 6-8 mph. With that forecast in mind, my plan is to have a regular school day for tomorrow.

I do understand that some roadways in Morgan County remain impassable due to blowing snow. I have spoken with Tim Musser and he has informed me that the county plans to begin clearing roadways early this morning with the significant reduction in the wind. Our buses will make every effort to pick-up students, but an inaccessible roadway is beyond the District's control.

Despite all efforts, we are still going to have some students who may be unable to come to school. If that is the case, obviously, they will not be penalized and they will be able to make up all of their missed work.

I know that this is a very difficult situation and that the weather has been extremely challenging. I thank you for your understanding.

Good morning Morgan Hill,

This is our first update for Saturday, August 22, 2020.

EVACUATION INFORMATION

The original evacuation warning remains in effect. Specifically, east of Hill Road remains under an evacuation warning. However, we are still encouraging Jackson Oaks and Holiday Lake Estates residents to self-evacuate now due to only one exit route from that area. Please view CALFIRE's interactive map at the following link for further details: www.tinyurl.com/scu-evacmap. We do not have an estimate of when the warning might turn into an order or how much longer we might remain in a warning status. Please be patient and understand that it is better to err on the side of safety.

REMINDER: Evacuation Warning = Residents are advised of a potential threat to life and property. There is a possibility for an Evacuation Order and residents should prepare to evacuate.

Hello Morgan Hill Community!

As you are aware, Morgan Hill's air quality is currently at an unhealthy level and will be poor for several days due to the fires in surrounding areas. Please visit the following link to learn more about the current air quality and the air quality forecast https://www.airnow.gov/

California’s firefighting resources are actively engaged with the many fires burning across the State. Locally, the Santa Cruz fires and the Lightning Complex fires are being closely monitored. While there is no immediate threat to Morgan Hill, we strongly recommend that residents remain aware and informed. It is also the perfect time to ensure that you know what to pack and where to go if an evacuation order is issued.

For information on preparing your home and family for wildfire preparedness, please visit: https://www.readyforwildfire.org/

Good Afternoon Morgan Hill Unified Families,

As the news changes daily regarding COVID-19, our approach to serving our students and the greater school community must shift in response to growing health and safety concerns and limiting the spread of the virus.

At this time, we would like to direct MHUSD families to our website where the district has set up a page specifically for COVID-19 information. (https://mhusdorg.finalsite.com/covid-19) An advisory and directives from Administration as well as any subsequent important updates will be posted on this web page. We ask that you read the message thoroughly and direct any questions to your specific school site.

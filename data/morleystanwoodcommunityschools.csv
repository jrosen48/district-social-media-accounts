The following is a letter that was sent to staff later in the evening last night. We would like to share this information with you to let you know that we are doing everything we can to keep your children safe and you informed.
A high school student came to us after school claiming he'd heard a student on the bus saying he was bringing a gun to school tomorrow. The police were called and came to school to interview the student about what he says he heard. The police interviewed the other student and several potential witnesses. The police are convinced there was a miscommunication and NO threat was made. With that said, it is very likely to have the liaison officer, and possibly several other police cars at school tomorrow morning.MSCS takes these threats very seriously. We feel that at this time there is NOT an active threat against the school so please go about business as usual.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2567322146721207&id=181897938596985,,0.0,"Community Members,

Morley Stanwood Community, please join us tonight, Thursday, March 14, 2019 @ 7:00 p.m. for the All-District Band Concert!!

See the progression of our musicians' learning as you listen to the 6th, 7th, 8th, and H.S. Concert Bands in the MSHS Gymnasium.

The 7th, 8th, and High School Bands all recently performed for the MSBOA DIstrict 1 Concert Band Festival and earned ratings of 4, 3, and 1 respectively, with the HS band earning the right to compete at the State Festival in May. Hear them play some of their Festival performance music tonight!

Additionally, see/hear the newly created High School Choir Class perform!! There is no entrance fee, although the band WILL be accepting donations, as they continue to fundraise for new marching band uniforms.

Please join us to show community support for the work these kids do when they're not marching on the football field and wearing Hawaiian shirts in the gym bleachers at basketball games, as there's much more to it! 😉
We hope to see you there!",0.0,"Morley Stanwood Bands

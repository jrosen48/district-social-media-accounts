A big thanks to the students from Black Rock High School for their hard work today cleaning up Section 33, one of our properties in Joshua Tree. The 19 students were helped along by AmeriCorps NCCC - and the results were amazing. A lot of trash got hauled away! Section 33 is a square mile property with beautiful views of the National Park, but it gets lots of windblown trash and littering. Black Rock is actually located close to this land, and we were thrilled that they wanted to take part in this volunteer opportunity.

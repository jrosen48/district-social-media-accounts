Gov. Edwards Will Extend Stay at Home Order Until May 15 to Continue Flattening the Curve and Slowing the Spread of COVID-19 | Office of Governor John Bel Edwards

Governor John Bel Edwards
April 27 at 5:10 PM ·

Today, I am announcing that I will extend Louisiana’s Stay at Home order until May 15 to continue to slow the spread of COVID-19. Louisiana does not currently meet the White House criteria for entering Phase One of reopening.

Thanks to the commitment of the people of Louisiana, our state has made progress in flattening the curve and reducing the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Unfortunately, we still have a little work to do before we meet the criteria to safely move to the next phase of reopening, so I will extend the state’s Stay at Home order until May 15, with a few minor changes.

While this is not the announcement I want to make, I am hopeful, and all of Louisiana should be hopeful, that we will enter into the next phase of reopening soon, in mid-May.

I am anxious to get all areas of our economy reopened, but if we accelerate too quickly, we may have to slam on the brakes. That will be bad for public health and for businesses, bad for our people and bad for our state. #lagov",0.0,"Stay home. Be good to others.

Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards issued a sweeping proclamation Thursday, waiving state standardized testing, state A through F letter grades and attendance requirements for the remainder of the school year as the state continues to see a rise in cases of the novel coronavirus.

The news came at a press conference where Edwards announced the healthcare system in New Orleans could be overwhelmed in seven to 10 days in a worst-case scenario.

The move comes three days after state education leaders requested the waivers. Something they said was needed to “allow educators to move forward and focus their attention on keeping students and teachers healthy and safe.”

Local school leaders said the changes would promote student mental health and well-being by easing the burden of grades, attendance and schoolwork and also allow schools to adapt their online learning as things change rapidly.

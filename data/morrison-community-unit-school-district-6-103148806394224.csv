We know that these last few weeks have been full of changes, challenges and some stressful situations. Now that you’ve gotten through your first week of remote learning, Mr. Geiger and I would like to provide some strategies that can help deal with stress and promote positive thinking. Mindfulness is taught to children and adults to recognize how our bodies are feeling and clear our minds so that we can relax and think about the positive things around us. Try the video with your family. The more you practice, the better you will feel! Please contact Mr. Geiger or Mrs. Gettes, School Counselors, if you have questions or concerns.

The FAFSA should be completed as soon as possible after Oct. 1 to ensure priority consideration for some types of financial aid. Students can prepare by gathering their information now. Since the 2018-19 FAFSA requires applicants to use 2016 tax information, they can use their 2016 return to complete the application at FAFSA.gov right away! There will be no need to wait.

Also, to complete and submit the FAFSA online, students and one of their parents/guardians will each need to create a FSA ID (Federal Student Aid ID) at FSAID.ed.gov. This username/password serves as a signature on the FAFSA and student loan applications, and allows them to access other federal aid websites. It’s beneficial for families to create their FSA IDs before starting the FAFSA form at FAFSA.gov to speed up the application process.

Hey Morton LadyPotters fans! Looks like Richwoods plans to bring a big crowd to Rock Island tomorrow with 2 fan buses. Hope we can get some Potter fans to make the Road Trip to Sectionals tomorrow as well! Expected travel time from Morton to Rock Island High School is 1 hour & 40 minutes and game time is 6:00PM.

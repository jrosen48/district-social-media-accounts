The Dragons tip-off at 6 p.m. against Towson in a nationally-televised game on the CBS Sports Network (3 p.m. on the west coast).
Drexel is now 9-7 overall and 2-1 in CAA play. The Dragons just completed a three-game homestand, where they defeated UNCW and Delaware after opening the stretch with a loss to Charleston. Zach Spiker's team has now won four of its last five games. Walton, a 6-6 senior, is averaging 12.2 points per game, shooting 41 percent from the field and 77 percent at the foul line. He scored a career-best 32 points earlier this season vs. Bryant.
Anyone interested can join a group of fans at the Moose Lodge in Morton to watch the game.

Mask Up MLSD!

We are not powerless in this crisis!

As we prepare for a back to school time for our community's youth like never before it may feel like things are beyond our control. But I wear a mask because it is something I can control -- to do my part to help the spread of this virus. Our kids need us as role models and to show them we can be strong, and we can get through this. If we think it is tough on us, imagine the impacts on young ones.

I invite everyone to join me in being proud to bring community awareness and this reminder. I never hoped that one day I would get to wear a mask, but this opportunity for impact is far greater than we may ever realize. Join me by updating your profile picture with the reasons why you Mask Up. We've got this!

While the construction is exciting and the future for our young Gators is even better there is so much more to this story. To be there today and get to turn dirt and launch this project alongside Vicki Groff is an honor. Vicki selflessly served the Moses Lake community for over 30 years as a school board member. She was one of the first people I ever met from Moses Lake in 2004 when we arrived on this new adventure. She has been a key player in every step of my career, especially my role as Superintendent. Not every day of that path has been perfect, but I have always had a champion in Vicki on my side. Nobody deserves a school named after them as much as this wonderful lady.

Ms. Harless, Teacher at Lakeview Elementary is being recognized as part of our Staff Appreciation Week for the amazing work she is doing.

One of her parents Samantha Doehne stated, ‚ÄúLast summer my family moved from the Portland Metro area. Our son was going into the 3rd grade and has always struggled in school due to his diagnosed ADHD. We prayed all summer long for his 3rd grade teacher and for his new school experience. When we met Ms. Harless we instantly loved her. She is deeply empathetic towards our son and we credit her for this being his most successful school year. She has brought tools to the table that have helped him but also is very patient and kind. Not only is he thriving academically but he now enjoys learning (reading specifically). We are so grateful for her!‚Äù

Gracie Smith you are a ROCK STAR!

‚ÄúThe time is always right to do the right thing.‚Äù - Martin Luther King Jr.

Moses Lake High School freshman Gracie Smith has started making homemade hand sanitizer to benefit others. Gracie, and her mother Candy, started the project to make hand sanitizer for health care workers on the front lines. Since that time their project has exploded and they are now including fire fighters, EMTs, Columbia Basin Herald employees, community members, and others that are high risk. Their generosity and giving spirit is admirable and touching.

Gracie - way to be a leader among your peers in using your talents to benefit others, and especially in this time of need. It is mind boggling to think that our world has gotten to a place where things we used to take for granted have now become rare finds, like hand sanitizer. But your care for others is amazing. Way to go!

Students, staff, parents, and our entire community are doing amazing things during these times. May these stories of our ROCK STARS brighten your day.

Ryan Hays you are a ROCK STAR!

‚ÄúTough times don‚Äôt last; Tough people do!‚Äù

Frontier Middle School 8th grader Ryan Hays began doing chalk art on her driveway to beat the isolation of staying home and staying healthy. Soon her artwork was noticed and featured by the Columbia Basin Herald including photographs of her awesome work. Recently McDougall Insurance hired her to paint their office windows, the City of Moses Lake wants to use her artwork on the city‚Äôs Facebook page, and now McDougall Insurance will be donating funds to local charity in Ryan‚Äôs name.

Ryan I am impressed by your artwork, but more impressed by your spirit! What a thoughtful way of brightening the world for us all to enjoy!

Students, staff, parents, and our entire community are doing amazing things during these times. May these stories of our ROCK STARS brighten your day.

I like to enter other contests as well, such as‚Ä¶metal art, agronomy, milk quality, and evaluation. I would do other contests but my schedule conflicts with baseball. My baseball team won the state championship last year and that was a highlight.

‚ÄúMy parents came from Nigeria. They won a visa to come to America, it was a lottery for a visa. America is where they had their kids and raised a family. So I have been here all my life. I joined FFA when I was in a class where there was an assignment to memorize the Creed. I memorized the whole thing for extra credit. My teacher said there was an FFA Creed competition and that I should enter. So that is how I joined FFA. There is a lot to learn in FFA and I really like it. I now enter in public speaking contests and other contests that have to do with knowledge.
I know these skills will help me in the future. We did live on a small farm in the past, but I don‚Äôt live on a farm now. You don‚Äôt have to live on a farm to join FFA there is so much more to learn. I would like to go to UCLA and hopefully study graphic design. I am only a sophomore so I have time to decide all that.‚Äù

Congratulations to Moses Lake High School Cheer Coaching staff for being selected as the WIAA Sportsmanship Winner as part of the WIAA State Championships. Several years ago, when I was the Principal at MLHS, Coach Mikey Carlile told me that she was going to create a ""Cheer Dynasty."" At the time I had no idea what that really meant, but I have been thrilled to watch it come to life. Mikey you have brought passion, care, and pride to our entire community. I am proud to work along side you and watch you do your work. It is clear that people across the state recognize your leadership and sportsmanship!",3.0,"Dr. Joshua Meek

We have gotten this question from many of you through our various social media sites, so this post is an attempt to clarify school being ""closed"".

The Governor has closed school BUILDINGS across the state of Texas. But the Texas Education Agency is requiring each school district to provide distance learning/school-at-home to finish the year. In order to certify that our students have met the requirements for 2019-2020, we must document that we've delivered instruction (online/packets) and that we have provided feedback to students (worked turned in).

MPISD will continue delivering instruction at www.mpisd.net, packet pick up on Mondays, and/or online platforms like Google Classroom, Blackboard, and Schoology to complete our 2019-2020 school year. We ask that you continue emailing completed work to teachers, turning it in online if that is the platform you're using, or dropping off completed packets on Mondays.

•We will do schoolwork pick up and drop off the same as last week. New work will be available at each campus from 11:00-1:00 and again from 5:00-6:00 on Monday. It will also be available at www.mpisd.net.

•We prefer that completed work be emailed directly to teachers, but you can also drop off completed work on Monday. If you need an email address, just ask!

•Meals will continue with 1 change: MPHS will no longer be a meal pick up site due to low numbers. Meals will be available Monday- Thursday from 11:00-1:00 at CDC, Brice, Corprew, Fowler, Sims, Wallace, Winfield School, and Miller's Cove Trailer Park. On Thursdays, students will be given meals for both Thursday and Friday. Meal sites will be closed Fridays so preparations can be made for the next week.

As always, if you need assistance with any of the above, call your student's campus. Phones are answered Monday-Friday from 9:00-3:00.

Here's a way to help bring cheer to others! If you want to participate, email your creations to Lkwhitakergroup@gmail.com.

It has really been bothering me that Dad and the other 60 residents at Focused Care in Mt. Pleasant will not be able to spend Easter with their families. And I wanted to do something for them. So I spoke with the activity director there. She said it is a difficult time because they really can't accept gift items from the outside. But she did give me a great idea. She said if I email or text her copies of homemade Easter cards or pictures, she can print them out and distribute them to the residents. (I am thinking that 1-sided pictures/cards would be best.)

So, I guess I am asking for help. If your children/grandchildren or even you would like to make one or more Easter pictures/cards, email them to me, and I will get them to the nursing home. I know it's a small thing, but it can be a blessing to those who need to know they haven't been forgotten.

There are 3 ways your student can return his/her work.
1. (Most preferred method) Students can email their work directly to the teacher(s). They can scan and email it, or even take a photo of completed pages and email those.

FOR OPTIONS 2 AND 3, BE SURE THE WORK IS LABELED WITH CHILD'S NAME, GRADE, AND CAMPUS!

2. Work can be dropped off at the campus on Monday from 11-1 during lunch pick up. New work will be available and completed work can be dropped off.

3. Work can be dropped off on Monday during after hours pick up.
CHANGE FOR WEEK TWO: After hours pick up and drop off will be at the individual campuses from 5:00-6:00 p.m. There will be no after hours at the Administration building on April 6th.

4. If none of those options will work for you, call your child's campus and they will make arrangements with you.

There are 3 ways your student can return his/her work.
1. (Most preferred method) Students can email their work directly to the teacher(s). They can scan and email it, or even take a photo of completed pages and email those.

FOR OPTIONS 2 AND 3, BE SURE THE WORK IS LABELED WITH CHILD'S NAME, GRADE, AND CAMPUS!

2. Work can be dropped off at the campus on Monday from 11-1 during lunch pick up. New work will be available and completed work can be dropped off.

3. Work can be dropped off on Monday during after hours pick up.
CHANGE FOR WEEK TWO: After hours pick up and drop off will be at the individual campuses from 5:00-6:00 p.m. There will be no after hours at the Administration building on April 6th.

4. If none of those options will work for you, call your child's campus and they will make arrangements with you.

Thank you to all of our AMAZING families. We are sorry for everything you are having to endure right now. We hope to see all of our Tigers very soon 🖤💛",2020-04-01 12:02:54,,

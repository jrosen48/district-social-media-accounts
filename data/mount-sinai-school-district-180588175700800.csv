I wanted to thank you and all of your students for taking the time out of your school day to write us these motivating letters. It is because of the support from the people back home that helps get the troops through these deployments. The letters from your students inspire the men and women who read them. Knowing that the children are aware of the world’s changing situations and the support our country gives to our allies overseas is important. The letters and the drawings we received were sincerely appreciated. Our men and women can accomplish the mission better every day knowing that we have the support of our families, friends and fellow community members.

Thank you again for your support.

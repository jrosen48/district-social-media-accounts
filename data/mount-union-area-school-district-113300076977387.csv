Samantha, hard to believe you are graduating high school. Even though this is far from what we all expected of your senior year, it is here! You've grown into such a beautiful, loving and caring young woman. You have done it in your own way. Always family focused and moving steadily and quietly ahead. You have many accomplishments to be proud of. Remember, this is only the beginning of many wonderful things to come for you. Your family will always be here to love and support you in whatever you do. We are all very proud of you and love you so much!!

Thank You

Derek,
What a journey this has been, it all started the day you were born. Sometimes, it has felt like a roller coaster. You always fight your way thru no matter the obstacle that comes your way, when you play soccer, for example, you might fall down (a lot), but you always jump back up and go even harder toward the goal. During school, extracurricular activities, and community service, you always give it your all. Your strong will is going to let you succeed in whatever you set your mind towards. Life is going to have detours, and even some, misdirection. Trust in God and remember we will always be here for you. We can't wait to see where this ride goes next through your journey at Juniata College.

Love you always,

There will be activities for Reading, Grammar, Writing, Science, Social Studies and Math.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Mrs. Brunner, Mrs. Johns or Mrs. Brightbill by email or through Remind.",2020-04-03 16:27:57,,

Dalton,

Wow!! You are the last of our children to graduate and I am not quite sure how I feel about that‚Ä¶. Happy, sad and excited, sometimes all at the same time. Happy that we are finally making it‚Ä¶ (there were times where I didn‚Äôt think we would ‚ò∫). Sad that there will be no more 4 H meetings, fundraisers, dances or last minute homework assignments, and lastly, excited for you to spread your wings and follow your dreams. The stars are the limit!

You have been through a lot these last few months, but challenges make us stronger!!! We are so proud of you and your decision to continue your education. We know that you will succeed at anything that YOU put your mind too. You can do great things and don‚Äôt ever let anyone tell you that you can‚Äôt. Please remember that we love you know matter what and will always be here if you need us. Take the wheel.. you are in control of your future.

Love Always,

He is almost there and we are beyond proud of him for wanting to follow in the family tradition of the military.

Meet Destinie Myers, better known as Des. During her years at Mount Union she has been a volleyball and softball player and also a member of National Honor Society as well as a Champ Captain in 2020. Des has committed to attend Coastal Carolina University after graduation to study political science with hopes of continuing on to law school. With her ability to argue, I believe this could be the perfect career for her. J Des has an amazing group of friends she has spent most of her years of high school with and I hope that when she looks back on her days at MU she remembers the good times and group get togethers. This is a tough time for all of the kids in the senior class and I wish for them to hold tight to the memories they have and look forward to the new adventures ahead.

Mount Union Area School District students will return to school on Thursday, April 9th (snow make-up day). Staff will return on Tuesday, April 7th. There will be no school on Friday, April 10th. Due to the extended closure we will be utilizing the remaining designated snow days on the school calendar. Students will be in session on Monday, April 13th.

The Department of Education (PDE) announced today all schools in the commonwealth will remain closed through at least April 6th as a result of the COVID-19 response efforts. The closure order could be extended beyond April 6th if necessary to save lives and stop the spread of COVID-19.

Under the new timeline, school buildings would reopen on April 7th for two days to allow school administrators, teachers and other staff time to prepare classrooms, set up cafeterias, schedule transportation and arrange other business operations. Students would return to school on April 9th, unless extending the closure is needed in response to the situation with the virus at that time.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=113454406961954&id=113300076977387,,0.0,"School Closure Update

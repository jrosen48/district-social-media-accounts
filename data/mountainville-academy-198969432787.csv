We're doing school spirit apparel different than we've done in the past—and we're pretty excited about it! This year, students will have two shirt designs to choose from and multiple colors for their Friday spirit shirts.

But that's not all. We're offering more swag . . . for the whole family!

Not Just Shirts - This year we're offering Mountainville cinch bags, hats, and lanyards to help build and show our great school spirit.

What if your student can't decide which shirt to get? No problem. Grab two different colors, and they'll have more options for Fridays.

Not Just for Students - Adult sizes are also available, and parents are encouraged to buy spirit apparel for themselves too. Hats, shirts, and lanyards are a great way to show your support and school spirit when attending a game/event or volunteering.

All online swag orders MUST BE placed BEFORE Wednesday the 21st in order to guarantee that you get the size/style you want.

Welcome back Lions, get ready to wear your Lion Pride!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10158124273637788&id=198969432787,,0.0,"New Mountainville Swag!

We're doing school spirit apparel different than we've done in the past—and we're pretty excited about it! This year, students will have two shirt designs to choose from and multiple colors for their Friday spirit shirts.

But that's not all. We're offering more swag . . . for the whole family!

Not Just Shirts - This year we're offering Mountainville cinch bags, hats, and lanyards to help build and show our great school spirit.

What if your student can't decide which shirt to get? No problem. Grab two different colors, and they'll have more options for Fridays.

Not Just for Students - Adult sizes are also available, and parents are encouraged to buy spirit apparel for themselves too. Hats, shirts, and lanyards are a great way to show your support and school spirit when attending a game/event or volunteering.

All online swag orders MUST BE placed BEFORE Wednesday the 21st in order to guarantee that you get the size/style you want.

Welcome back Lions, get ready to wear your Lion Pride!",2019-08-16 18:19:07,,

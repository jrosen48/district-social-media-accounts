The CDC and IDPH have recommended masks be worn when school resumes with face to face instruction. We are asking parents to acquire washable cloth masks for their students as we will be following this recommendation as part of our Return to Learn Plan. Five/5 Cloth masks would be ideal, one for each day and then washing them to re-use the following week. We wanted to make this adjustment right away so you could address this with your school supplies and perhaps find some 'trendy' styles before they are all gone. We will have extra masks at school, should your student need one. Those students or staff with medical exemptions will not be required to wear masks.

National Decision Day is a day for us to celebrate you, high school seniors, and the decisions that you are making after high school. Some of you are choosing to attend college, some are choosing apprenticeships, some are choosing trade schools, and others are joining the workforce, and we are so proud of you!

To celebrate you, we will be handing out doughnuts to Mt. Ayr Schools' graduating senior students on Decision Day, Friday, May 1st in the east (student) parking lot from 8 AM to 9 AM.

Wear your future college and decision gear to pick up your doughnut. Thanks to Ms. Klommhaus, Mrs. Neas, and TRIO for making this opportunity available to our students!

Also, to stay safe, please stay in your car, and we will deliver the doughnut to your window. Those delivering doughnuts will be wearing masks and gloves to keep you safe as well.

Happy Easter Everyone! This is what everyone has been waiting for...the initial Plant Sale variety and price list. Both plants and prices are subject to change as I first have to keep everything alive for the next month. : ) Although I appreciate your enthusiasm, I will not be taking pre-orders for our plants. Also....just a quick reminder that we will be open ONLINE starting on May 6th at 9 am. I have attached a short video that explains our Mt. Baker Online Plant Sale this year and a couple of recent pictures in the greenhouse. We look forward to serving our community's plant needs this year, and providing quality material for your containers, gardens and landscape.

Mt. Baker Plant Sale - April 5th Update
“Think Spring” everyone! The Mt. Baker plants are continuing to grow and fill out their containers in the greenhouse this week and several are finally getting their blooms. I appreciate everyone’s support and patience as I work out the details for our annual plant sale scheduled to start on Wednesday, May 6th at 9 am. More details will be made available in the coming weeks, so please continue to be patient. Also...although I truly appreciate everyone volunteering to help, now is the time to stay safe and comfortable at home and get your containers, landscape beds and gardens ready for the plants you wish to purchase. Plants from our greenhouse will be made available to all staff and community members on the same day (no pre-orders please), but I encourage you to check out the pictures I took this morning and start keeping a list at home of what you would like. Plant prices will also be made available next week. Many thanks to such a supportive community and stay tuned for upcoming information on our plant sale. ~Tamara Whitcomb",0.0,"Coming soon!! 🌷🌻🌱🥒🥕🌶🥬🍅🍓

#ThrowbackThursday to the Mount Baker Mountaineer Band performing in the Leavenworth Parade on September 28, 2019

Doug Sutton, the Mount Baker Jr/Sr High School band teacher, said of the trip: ""It was raining during our pre-parade waiting time, but the kids used their ponchos which kept them and their uniforms dry. Our uniform managers worked hard to help their band-mates with uniform problems. The band played and marched better than they had during rehearsal, and they earned 2nd place in the 2A division of the parade! The students enjoyed some time to wander the Bavarian-themed town; many had bratwurst and sauerkraut. The students were a joy to be around from start to finish.""",0.0,"Mount Baker School District added 9 new photos — in Leavenworth, Washington.

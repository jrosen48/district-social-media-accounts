The last paper packet for Mount Enterprise JH/HS will be on April 6, 2020. Packets picked up will have work for the final six weeks of the semester (mostly as a precaution and preparation for the possibility that school doesn’t resume before the end of the school year).

If you have the means and capacity to work online through Google classroom, we encourage that route. Also, we encourage you to email your teachers directly, as they are still working diligently to provide instruction, assistance, and will answer any questions you may have. Teachers can be emailed directly through our website under the faculty page at:

As always, we hope you are safe and we are available if you need anything. You are all in our thoughts and prayers.

Dear MEISD family,

During this week that we are closed, the administration and teachers are diligently working to prepare and plan to educate our students in the likely event MEISD is canceled past this week.

MEISD will give further details and instruction later this week once the decision is made whether to remain closed or resume school.

With all the information coming from the Governor, the Center for Disease Control and the president, I do not foresee a situation that we will open back up next week. Obviously, I could be wrong in my assessment but I wanted to share that information so you can make family plans in the event we do stay closed.

God bless, stay sanitized and keep your social distances. The scary thing about this virus is that many people can be infected without ever knowing it. Those folks could unknowingly spread the virus to people that are more susceptible to health issues. Be careful out there.

Dear parents, faculty and students,

After receiving a considerable amount of information about this dreaded virus and with schools all around us closing for a week or two, MEISD has made the call to extend spring break a week for most faculty and all students. Students and faculty are currently scheduled to return the following Monday, March 23rd.

Although, as of this writing, we have no confirmed cases of the virus in our county, Shelby County or Nacogdoches County, it is best to approach this unchartered territory with caution over pushing the limits of the unknown.

I, and other schools, are in contact with county health officials, county emergency management and the commissioner of the TEA as information flows in.

We are at a time in our nation that we’ve never seen before. As I said previously, don’t panic but be diligent and smart in your decision making. I want all of the MEISD family to be safe and avoid this virus. God bless each of you. I will keep you posted as pertinent news comes across my desk.

June 22nd we have a special guest coming to Mt Enterprise... One of the best college pitchers there is Samantha Clakley will be coming to do a softball camp. If you followed college softball this year you know Oklahoma State was one of the best programs in the nation and competed well in the World Series. We are blessed and honored to get to bring someone of this caliber for our kids. Any girls going into 4th-7th grade will be from 9 am - 12 pm/ any girls going into 8th-12th grade will be from 1 pm-4 pm... I encourage any girls who are wanting to be in softball to attend. My goal is to turn this program around and I think we have the talent here to do just that. Again I want to say thank you to Samantha and to all of my parents who have the same vision I do of making Mt Enterprise great again.

Cost of the camp will be 10 dollars per child

If you have any questions please call me 903-722-3460

Thank You

Parents and Students: Due to the high probability of thunderstorms on Saturday, we will NOT be attending the football game at SFA.

Our call time for our Friday game will be at 5:00pm. Eat dinner before you show up, or money for concessions, as we will not be providing a meal for this game.

Finally, hurricanes in the Atlantic have delayed our shipping of the new Sousaphones. They should be in next week now, sorry Tubas...

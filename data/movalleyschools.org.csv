Apparently the delivery company had it wrong and our new picnic tables arrived late this afternoon! While we apologize for the late notice, we are thrilled that we will get to expand our outdoor seating opportunities for our students.

Therefore, to make sure this round is ready for students next week, we will look to assemble them (14 tables) this Sunday at 12:00pm in the Middle School Circle. Any and all help would be appreciated!

Please bring tools (1/2 in socket, driller/driver, wrench, etc...) if you have them.

With school cancelled for the year, Missouri Valley Schools is looking to see what we can do to support our community during this time. We would like to know if we have essential workers in the community who are in need of daycare. If there is enough interest, school will consider re-opening the Wrap-Around services to help provide for these essential workers. These services would be available for students who attend Missouri Valley Schools, Preschool - 5th Grade.

If you are interested and need daycare during this time, and are interested in the school-provided services, please complete the survey below by Friday, April 24.

If the Wrap-Around reopens, it will do so at the High School so we are better able to stay in compliance with DHS COVID-19 guidelines and mitigation practices. More details are included within the survey and DHS guidance can be found here: https://dhs.iowa.gov/childcare-covid-19

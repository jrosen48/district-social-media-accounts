Anamosa played Mid Prairie in softball tonight winning 7-3. Before the game the Mid Prairie team presented Maggie with a graduation card and gift from the team and community. People really are thoughtful, generous and good! The genuine displays of caring from Maggie's competitive peers repeatedly validates that! And the card Maggie received from Coach DeShaw is outstanding! What a great statement! Trust the Process. Do the Work! ‚ù§üôèüí™",2020-07-09 21:57:55,,

To spread love and joy to our 2020 seniors, Open Road Driving School will be giving every Mid-Prairie High School senior a $25 Amazon gift card. They can safely shop online to buy a gift for themselves and have it delivered to their door! This is a great way to celebrate our seniors, bring a smile to their faces, and let them know that they are not alone! This is also a great opportunity for our organization to give back to our local community who has been so good to us.

Gift cards will be distributed at the Mid Prairie High School Parking lot on Saturday, May 2nd between the hours of 11am - 1pm. Simply drive to the parking lot and grab a gift card out of the trunk of a car (with safe social distancing, of course). If you do not have transportation, text your name and address to 319-671-2800 to get the card delivered at a later date.

Dear Mid-Prairie Families,

It was truly heart-warming to see so many students, parents and community members during the Mid-Prairie employee parade on Monday evening in Kalona, Richmond and Frytown. I am looking forward to seeing many more smiling faces during our parade tonight in Wellman and West Chester.

I appreciated seeing all the families that practiced safe social distancing procedures along the parade route Monday evening. As you know, the safety and health of your children is a high priority for Mid-Prairie teachers, support staff members and administrators. Let‚Äôs continue to protect everyone‚Äôs health by keeping a safe social distance from other families as we wait and watch the parade tonight as well as during any future activities.

I want to thank you again for your patience, cooperation and understanding as we face this situation together. This is a great community and even in this troubled time, we have much to be grateful for.

We got this!

Yours in service,

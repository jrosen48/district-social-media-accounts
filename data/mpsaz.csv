Many CTE programs from across the country have stepped up to help support the fight against COVID19. From donating PPE from healthcare programs to engineering masks for front line workers, #CTEStrong has never been so prevalent than in today's crisis.

Mesa Public Schools engineering teachers from Red Mountain and Westwood High Schools and CTE STEM specialist, Randall Kirby, have been 3D printing headbands for Banner Health hospitals. The headbands are being attached to face shields and are being utilized by healthcare workers in the hospitals. #weareCTE #iamCTE #stayhome #stayhealthy #stayconnected",2020-04-14 15:39:35,,

Meridian High School Baseball Class Of 2020

Head Coach Eddie Easley: Today our seniors faced the realization they will never play another game in a Wildcat uniform. There are no words I can say as their head coach to make the pain any easier. I can honor them and tell them how much I appreciate what they have done for our program. We finished the season 4-5 and had 24 players on our team and had 10 seniors that helped create a great culture at practice each and every day. I know these 10 young men will be successful in their futures whatever they decide to do. Thank you for being a TRUE WILDCAT on and off the baseball field.",4.0,"Meridian High School Wildcats Baseball

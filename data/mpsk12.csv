I wanted to reach out and assure you that Muskegon Public Schools will continue to work toward the absolute best educational outcomes for every child. Please encourage and aid your children in their virtual and other learning during this time. We are waiting until the official directive (expected in the next couple of days) by Governor Whitmer to finalize our educational plans with our staff, ISD and the State. I know many of you are anxious and nervous about the plans for the rest of the year, but I will not allow inaccurate and forecasted reports to dictate what we do.

In December, these students raised over $300 when they started their own small business at school, making and selling various items. As a part of their economics unit in social studies, students learned about small businesses in our community as well as local nonprofits and the role they play. As they earned a profit from their sales, they decided to donate to Pound Buddies! These students purchased five 50 pound bags of dog food, doggie treats, and even some kitty food too! Thank you to Pound Buddies for their visit and to our teachers, students, and their amazing efforts!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2680910991967512&id=254610807930888,,0.0,"Yesterday, Moon 2nd graders had a visit from a special friend named Journey who lives at Pound Buddies!

Exciting day at MPTCHS, the Student Council raised over $250 dollars for an orphanage in Dehli, India called One Life to Love.This orphanage focuses on caring for children who have been abandoned due to their physical/mental disabilities. Student council members met with board members Dr. Jodry and Jenn Lamundo to talk about OLTL and ways to help support!

The Student Council also supported The New Hope Baptist Church by collecting coats, hats and gloves to give to those in need! Our students have done an amazing job giving back and we wish you all a happy holiday season!

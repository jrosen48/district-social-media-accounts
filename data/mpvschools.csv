MPV Schools will begin the 2020-21 school year August 13th unless there are unforeseen guidelines or rules which are changed by the Department of Education before that date. Breakfast and lunch will resume at school sites beginning August 13th.
MPV Schools encourage parents to link with the Mulberry Community Food Pantry in order to check for food availability. The food pantry occasionally has drive through pick up for everyone. Families may also get in touch with the pantry in order to check on qualifications for regular food box distributions.
We love our kids and hopeful all are healthy and excited about the upcoming school year.",,,

Any athlete planning on attending practice starting June 1st must have a current physical (one completed in the last 12-15 months). If you need an updated physical, we will provide an opportunity for athletes to complete their physicals at school. The date and time of these physicals will be announced soon, which must be after June 1st because of the Dead Period.

Seniors,
There is an 80% of hard rain Saturday so I am canceling the ceremony for Saturday. Also, several seniors stated that they could not make it next Tuesday so that day is out. Hopefully, we will have more guidance from the Governor about when we can come together for a traditional ceremony within the next few weeks but I haven't gave up on this idea yet. We can not have it on May 23 because of conflicts and that is Memorial Day Weekend but maybe be thinking about May 30 depending on what the Governor tells us about traditional ceremonies. Thank you guys for hanging in there and continue to send me answers to the questions.

Seniors,
There is an 80% of hard rain Saturday so I am canceling the ceremony for Saturday. Also, several seniors stated that they could not make it next Tuesday so that day is out. Hopefully, we will have more guidance from the Governor about when we can come together for a traditional ceremony within the next few weeks but I haven't gave up on this idea yet. We can not have it on May 23 because of conflicts and that is Memorial Day Weekend but maybe be thinking about May 30 depending on what the Governor tells us about traditional ceremonies. Thank you guys for hanging in there and continue to send me answers to the questions.

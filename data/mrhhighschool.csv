Graduate Spotlight: Chris Tronicek

Chris is graduating with a BS in Mechanical Engineering. He shares his best advice and his favorite memories from SCE.

“The best advice I would give to students is to remain curious. Embrace being a lifelong learner as a personality trait. If you do this, then you will never fail. You will only learn.

My favorite SCE memory was getting the opportunity to travel to Panama with Engineers Without Boarders. I met amazing people, strengthened relationships, and got the chance to make a difference in the world.

I am going to miss getting to see the group of people I have spent the better part of the past 4 years with. We have overcome an extreme amount of adversity and hardship together. I am truly grateful for having met such extraordinary people.

I am ready to seize whatever opportunity comes my way!”

Congratulations Chris! We are so proud of you!

Winter weather will arrive in our area midday. The Maplewood Richmond Heights School District will therefore dismiss as if it were a scheduled early release day. That's 12:50 p.m. for MRH Elementary, and 1:25 p.m. for High School, Middle School, and Early Childhood Center. There will be NO p.m. Discover Club. All after-school activities are cancelled, including the ""away"" wrestling meet and boys basketball game.

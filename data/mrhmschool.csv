We are sorry we missed you yesterday! We have a lot of 8th-grade whiteboards that were not picked up!

Don't worry, you can still come to the gym TODAY (September 10th) OR FRIDAY (September 11th) from NOON to 4 pm to get your 8th grader's whiteboard!

Friday will be the last day to get your whiteboard!

WHERE?
We will have our pick up location at the gym lobby doors.

WHAT?
8th graders will be able to pick up their whiteboard!!

WHEN?
Thursday, Sept. 10th OR Friday, Sept. 11th from NOON - 4 pm.

WHO?
8th-grade students can come alone to get their whiteboards.

WHY?
The better question is, why not? Look forward to seeing everyone there. Please wear a mask and safely socially distance yourself while visiting the building.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3902192739796908&id=496505490365667,,0.0,"Families,

I have worked with a lot of great men and women who have worked in the background to make sure our spaces are clean for our students to learn in on a daily basis. I have had 4 years of late nights with Corey but excited to hear he was moved to days and a better situation for his family. Corey is one of the kindest and hardest working guys you could have the honor of sharing a building with. Thank you and congratulations on your last night as the official middle school custodian.

He's going places, quite literally.
A series of summer camps is offered throughout the United States by Barça academy to identify soccer talent. From those camps, the top 10% are selected to travel to Barcelona, Spain, to train with Barça coaches. MRH middle schooler Caleb Bircher made the cut! While there, Caleb experienced soccer training on the beaches of Spain, scoring seven out of twelve goals in four games on international soil against premier academy teams and experienced training with world-class coaches. When he wasn’t training or playing, he had the opportunity to explore the city. At the end of the training the top 1% of players from the Barcelona trainings is invited to participate in the Mediterranean International Cup. Caleb was honored to be in that top tier.

Scholars in Mr. Noud’s Technology Literacy class are currently immersed in their Drone Unit. As part of this unit, students have been exploring safety procedures for operating drones and possible hazards for both operators and spectators. Working in cooperative learning groups, students created anchor charts to help their classmates remember important information surrounding safety practices, illustrations of a drone’s axes of movement (including yaw, pitch, and roll), and labeling of the parts and operations of a drone. They then worked together to create code that would instruct the drone to fly in a square pattern using pitch and roll controls in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. By connecting to their Chromebook’s Bluetooth, they were then able to test the effectiveness of their coding and their understanding of safety procedures by actually flying the drone.

MRH has one important calendar change to announce right now, and another coming later this week.

In order to avoid a potential overcrowding situation at the Elementary School on the late afternoon and evening of March 10, 2020 -- presidential primary election day -- we are switching days for Parent/Teacher conferences. (ELEM is a polling place.)
The High School/Middle School conferences will now take place on March 10 and 12. The ELEM conferences will happen on March 9 and 11.
Go here to view the updated calendar: https://www.mrhschools.net/userfiles/files/2019-20CalendarRevised11-18-19.pdf
This switch has no impact on the Early Childhood Center, as their P/T conferences are scheduled for late January.

On a related note, we expect to have an announcement late Thursday night or first thing Friday about the significantly revised 2020-2021 MRH calendar.

MapleGOOD has adopted a new initiative with the start of the school year and we want to spread the word! Our Student and Family Support Project will be offering FREE community support to K-12 students in Maplewood and Richmond Heights. If a child in your care is living or receiving care in the 63143 or 63117 zip codes (regardless of which school they attend), please complete an intake form at maplegood.org/sfs to help us understand their needs. More info can be found below on our flyer.

These sessions are dynamic, online learning experiences aimed at providing an opportunity for parents/caregivers with different backgrounds (i.e. families of color, families with varied religious backgrounds, families with children with disabilities, families from disinvested communities, non-traditional families) to talk with and ask questions of an expert in family and community supports, and in home and school partnership. In this series, families from various backgrounds will engage in discussion with each other and a featured expert, who is also a parent/caregiver, with the aim of sharing ideas and resources related to supporting students and families during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Get set for your heartstrings to get tugged, after reading this note from ECC teacher Heather Bailey:

""I came across this flag in my basement. It's a symbol of a classroom community of first graders I had in 2008. That year, as we learned about government, the class decided we could form our own government. We started by designing this flag to represent ourselves. We moved onto creating a mission, laws, and consequences. (On the back of the flag, there's even a pocket containing our government handbook.)
Remembering the ideals of these young seven year olds, fills me with hope for our nation's future. I know these young adults will continue to care for others as they change the world. I'm sorry the world isn't as we thought it would be for your senior year, but I'm so thankful it's you who is graduating. Our world needs you, and we've been waiting a very long time. Congratulations on all of your hard work. I'm proud of you and who you've become.
Love,
Mrs. Bailey
P.S. I'd love to see pictures of you in the comments.",0.0,"Maplewood Richmond Heights High School

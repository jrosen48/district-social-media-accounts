Children, just like adults, benefit greatly from consistent and deliberate self-care activities.

We all need to learn how to take care of ourselves, and performing self-care activities with your children is an excellent way to model healthy lifestyle choices for your children. By making self-care a daily practice, parents provide opportunities to build rituals of connection and create a system of shared meaning.

Support your kids’ long-term well-being by making healthy and meaningful choices that encourage growth, connection, expression, and stability. Give these self-care activities a try or sit down with your child and invite them to brainstorm new ideas unique to their interests.

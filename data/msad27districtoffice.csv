2018 Graduation Speakers Announced

Congratulations to seniors Lea Pelletier, Michelle MacLaren-Toussaint and Jonny Blanchette who will present the Class of 2018’s commencement speeches. CHS developed a new process of selecting commencement speakers this year compared to the traditional method of choosing the top three scholars.

Any CHS senior in the high honor, or magna cum laude, range for cumulative four-year grades were encouraged to apply for the graduation speaking roles. Aspiring speakers presented their speeches in front of a panel who evaluated their oral presentation and application materials. Applications included their body of work from their high school career, such as their grades, school activities and community service.

Principal Kaleta feels that the healthy competition between classmates brought out the best in all speech writers. The quality of the speeches made it incredibly hard to choose among the 7 fine applicants. Thanks to all who challenged themselves through this process!",0.0,"Community High School/Valley Rivers Middle School

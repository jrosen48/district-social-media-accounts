Mulanax and his students at Monroe High School (Oregon) may have missed out on the FIRST Tech Challenge season because of this year's school closures, but not before they got to try out their new REV Expansion Hubs purchased with the grant.

As Mulanax explains it, ""The REV allowed the students to effectively design [a] robot to operate conventional motors, servo-motors and sensors at the same time. In the past, they did not have the capacity to do so. With these new units, the students eagerly learned how to program the robot to use sensors to evaluate distance, colors and polar position to effectively determine how far a servo should rotate to complete a strategic task.

The team wowed themselves ecstatically at their success in developing a strategy and actually designing and programing a robot to fruition.""",0.0,"Chintimini UniServ Council

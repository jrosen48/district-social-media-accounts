This year's graduation will be via social distancing and live-streaming. All speeches have been prerecorded to play before graduation and for families, friends and classmates to enjoy later.

Decatur Township Scholarship Association is hoping for another successful year with our goal of providing scholarships. Even if we cannot have our Celebration, we still want to honor our donors some way and of course, the graduates of 2020 and the Decatur grads earning renewals.

Since 1992, we have awarded $1,078,550 in scholarships to our deserving students! Last year we awarded 50 scholarships. In our first year we awarded 12 scholarships. In no way could we have ever imagined this degree of success! We firmly believe our students do so well because of the support of our entire community. This year we hope that you will join us in our mission.

Please send your tax-deductible gift payable to Decatur Township Scholarship Association Inc. or DTSA at 5251 Kentucky Ave, Indpls, IN 46221 by April 5th. All donations are 501(c)(3)-tax deductible EIN# 46-3387727. 100% of your donation goes toward scholarships.

We firmly believe it takes a community to raise our Youth, and your support is a testament to that end. Thank you for making our community great.

Hearing this for the first time, like many of you, we do not want to jump into a plan of action immediately today. We will plan, discuss and then share our situation and expectations to support our school community tomorrow, Friday, March 20th. That communication will be via phone, email, social media and our school websites. I want to thank all of Decatur Township for your strength and willingness to deal with this crisis head on.

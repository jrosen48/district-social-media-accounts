To recognize the National School Lunch Program, serving nearly 30 million children each day, MSD of Wabash County schools will celebrate National School Lunch Week from October 12-16, 2020. School lunches offer students fruits and vegetables, whole grains and milk, and meet federal nutrition standards limiting fat, calories and sodium. The federally-funded National School Lunch Program (NSLP) has been fueling students for success for more than 70 years. Students can enjoy the convenience of a healthy school lunch for just $2.45 elementary, $2.60 middle and high school. Some students may qualify for free or reduced priced meals. Just contact your local school for more details.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=964869253981777&id=222166738252036,,0.0,"MSD of Wabash County Schools Celebrate National School Lunch Week

MSDWC's Re-Entry Plan is now available online. This document details the health and safety measures our district/schools will take as we reopen our school buildings for the 2020-2021 school year. We encourage staff, students, and guardians to review this document carefully, as our plan is only as effective as the degree to which it is followed.

We are looking forward to once again serving our students in person. Please remain alert for any updates. The entire plan is subject to change based on the pandemic.

Choosing a school for your child is an important and sometimes challenging decision. Not only do you want the best for them in the present moment, but it's important to choose the best school for future stages too.

This summer, MSD wants to help parents in that process by providing them with a roadmap through the entire educational journey, and show some of the ways MSD schools standout in providing an excellent comprehensive education - from preschool, to graduation, and beyond!

For those of you participating in our Grab-n-Go meal program, be sure to have your refrigerator and/or freezer organized by this Wednesday, April 1. That day's pick-up will include meals for Spring Break and it would be helpful if you can bring a box, laundry basket, or something that we can put all of the food in when we deliver to your vehicle.

Don't forget - if you haven't signed up your child to receive these FREE MEALS you can do so at the link below. These are open to ANY CHILD ages 1-18 in our community.

What is National School Breakfast Week?
It’s a weeklong celebration of the National School Breakfast Program, permanently established in 1975 by an act of Congress. Schools across the country celebrate with special menu items, events and student activities. NSBW is the perfect time to bring attention to your breakfast program and set a goal to increase participation.

Studies show that children who eat school breakfast are more likely to:

Reach higher levels of achievement in reading and math
Score higher on standardized tests
Have better concentration and memory
Be more alert and maintain a healthy weight
The National School Breakfast Program also serves more than 14 million children every school day.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=791410384660999&id=222166738252036,,0.0,"National School Breakfast Week

Celebrate National School Lunch Week

The National School Lunch Program, serving 30 million children each day will celebrate National School Lunch Week from October 14-18, 2019. Today’s school cafeterias are serving up healthy menu items that kids want to eat, with increased choices and nutritional foods available daily.

School lunches offer students fruits and vegetables, whole grains and milk and meet federal nutrition standards limiting fat, calories and sodium. National School Lunch Week helps us educate students about all the benefits of our lunch program and the appealing variety of choices in the cafeteria.

The federally-funded National School Lunch Program (NSLP) has been fueling students for success for more than 70 years. Students can enjoy the convenience of a healthy school lunch for $2.45 Elementary and $2.60 Jr Sr High School. Some students may qualify for free or a reduced meal price of $.40. Contact your local school or food service department to learn more.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=686307981837907&id=222166738252036,,0.0,"MSD of Wabash County Schools

DID YOU KNOW….in the early years of life a child’s brain creates over 1 million synaptic connections PER SECOND?! Everything children see, hear, smell, and taste promotes new connections! After the first three years of life, synaptic “pruning” begins to prune back the connections they don’t need and creates “super” highways of communication between the ones they use regularly.

Our IMPACT Excel by Eight (E8) Steering Committee wants to help reinforce the growth of the right connections in our youngest residents! What can we do to help children create a healthy, developed brain?

1. Provide Nutrition
2. Free children from adverse experiences (abuse, neglect, violent environments, etc.)

Dear Parent/Guardian:

Today, Governor Holcomb announced all Indiana schools will be closed through May 1st, but did not grant additional waiver days. The MSD of Mount Vernon will continue with our plan to use eLearning days through April 3rd, with the exception of spring break. We will then utilize the 20 waiver days the Governor originally granted to take us through May 1st. The Governor also canceled all state testing, which means students will not take the ILEARN or ISTEP tests.

We will share information and guidance from the Governor’s office and the Indiana Department of Education as we receive it.

Sincerely,

Dr. Matt Thompson

Students learned how to navigate the app and watched a video on how ecosystems regenerate after a fire. This is a topic they are current studying.

February 9 at 9:00 PM ·

Hey everyone! I have now started a community project; The Denim Project! My love for fashion and clothes sparked an idea that not only uses clothes to help people, but the environment, too! The Denim Project aims to collect denim (jeans, jackets, shorts, skirts, shirts, etc—as long as it’s 90% cotton) and recycle them into home insulation. The Blue Jeans Go Green program has provided this awesome opportunity, and Habitat for Humanity has been involved!
♼
There are donation bins at several locations in the community: Alexandrian Public Library, McKim’s IGA, Bliss Artisan, and Mount Vernon High School! Each bin has the posters from this post. Feel free to donate denim anytime you please to one of these bins!
♼
More information is on the poster (the second picture), but if you have any other questions or concerns don’t hesitate to contact me through Messenger or the contact info on the poster.
♼
I hope to see the community help me recycle denim for a good cause! Instead of pitching an old pair of jeans, donate them to be recycled!!!",0.0,"The Denim Project

We are so thankful for the generous donation of materials from Image Inks given by Zach Grider who is seen in the picture below. Our wonderful educators Mrs. Burkett, Mrs. Bushard and Mrs. Jackson who made this possible are also pictured below.

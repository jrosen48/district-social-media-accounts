A huge THANK YOU goes out to 3M and their employees for the generous grant for supplies to our district!

For those 8th graders interested in taking part of the summer weight training program. There is a 2 week orientation beginning next Monday (5/13) and ending Thursday (5/23). This is very important to attend. If you do not attend this you will not be allowed to use weights this summer and will be doing body weight circuit training.

Orientation will be Monday/Wednesday/Thursday from 3:30 - 4:30PM in the HS Weight Room. Ride the bus from the MS to the HS after school and have your parents pick you up at the HS gym lobby.",0.0,"Riverdale Rams Football

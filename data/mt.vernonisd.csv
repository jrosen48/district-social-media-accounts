This short rhyming eBook helps children to learn the importance of washing their hands, covering their cough and sneeze, and practicing social distance. Parents are searching for ways to help their children make sense of what’s going on in the world, and this allows them to create that space. In addition, it is critical to help and support the mental well-being of children during this time!

If you are interested in purchasing 2020 Tiger Baseball Gear, our online store has opened today, and closes December 15th at 11:59 PM.

All orders will be delivered here at the school. Once they come in, I will send out an email to let you know.

To order follow the link below:

Sale Code is: MVNOHITTER19

I have also attached a flyer at the bottom with the different options on the store.

We appreciate all your help in supporting the MV Tigers Baseball Program.

When people arrive at the Element, they feel most themselves, most inspired, and achieve at their highest levels.” In this webinar, we'll learn why identifying, acknowledging, and nurturing your gifted child's passions can be the key to guiding them toward not just super achievement, but a more fulfilling and rewarding life in their ""element.""

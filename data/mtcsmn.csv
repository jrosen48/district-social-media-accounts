Banaadir North fourth grade teacher, Mariam Mohamed is a published author. Being both an author and a teacher was Ms. Mohamed’s childhood dream, and she made both those goals come to fruition.

In 2017, she wrote Ayeeyo’s Golden Rule because she wanted her East African students to read and see themselves in a book. Ayeeyo means grandmother in Somali and the book tells the story of a grandmother passing down her golden rule to her granddaughter, Yasmeen. A Somali girl who immigrated to the US, Yasmeen uses her grandmother’s inspirational words to work through bullying and make new friends. Ayeeyo’s Golden Rule is visually beautiful, and the story is universal for all students to read. It’s a reminder of the importance of being kind and humble.

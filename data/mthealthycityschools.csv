Over the past week we have been working with the staff and students of Mt Healthy City Schools to bring the community a collaborative show - Iconic Ladies of Motown. The school bells seem so much shorter when you are trying to pack rehearsals and cues into one hour! We can’t say enough about the students and staff at Mt Healthy. Collaboration is not easy. It takes listening, understanding, give and take. ArtsConnect is so grateful for this opportunity to work so closely with the Mt Healthy faculty and artist P.￼￼ Ann Everson- Price. They have given so much of themselves to this show. I encourage you to support them tonight. The show begins at 7pm. Tickets at the door, $15. Learn the history behind the music of some of Motown’s finest! Special thank you to Everett Moore, Josh Stubenvoll, Mike Kunz and Missy Knight for your time, care and expertise.

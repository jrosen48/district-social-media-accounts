The school closure implemented due to the COVID-19 virus created a significant disruption to our students’ education. To avoid a further disruption, I am revising the 2019-2020 school calendar in regards to Spring Break. We do not anticipate returning to school before April 14, 2020.

Spring Break was scheduled for April 8, 9, 10 & 13. These days will continue to be at home instructional days. Families who observe religious holidays should plan accordingly to ensure instruction is received and assignments are completed.

In addition, Governor Wolf further ordered schools to be closed for two more weeks. As of today, schools are closed through at least April 6, 2020. This does not impact our plan to begin Flexible Instructional Days starting Monday, March 30, 2020.

The Governor is only allowing life sustaining activities. As such, our breakfast/lunch distribution will continue from 11:00 a.m.- 1:00 p.m., Monday - Friday at the High School, Entrance C20 on Horsman Drive.

We will continue to update you during this very fluid situation.

Please stay calm, stay home, and stay safe.

Sincerely,

Timothy J. Steinhauer, Ed.D.

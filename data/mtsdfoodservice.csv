Alone together during this time. 👍 to the hardworking folks who get together each weekday to make sure our children receive a healthy breakfast and/or lunch. The chefs, cooks and help who make this terrific and nutritious food for our future. Plus 👍 to the bus drivers who bring the meals to our future. Proud of y'all!

1. Set regular meal and snack times
2. Be persistent, but not forceful. Continue to offer healthy foods, even if your children don't like them at first. Encourage your children to try new foods, but do not force them to eat.
3. Be a role model. Children often follow their parents' lead, so if you eat healthy, so will your kids.
4. Involve your kids. Let your kids help choose recipes, go shopping, and prepare meals.
5. Start with small portions. It is ok to have seconds if your child says they are still hungry, but start with small servings first.
6. Give positive rewards. Avoid using food as a reward. Instead, praise your child's good behavior with positive words, play time, or extra time with you

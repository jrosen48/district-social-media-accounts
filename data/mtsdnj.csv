With the guidance and planning skills of Mrs. Erica Parke and Mrs. Tracy Newton, last Thursday (April 18, 2019), students were busy donning gardening gloves, selecting hand tools, and opening microgreen seed packets to sow new plants in the MTES garden. Mrs. Parke explained that these nutritious, fast-growing greens are considered baby plants. Similar to baby lettuces, baby carrots, etc., these plants can grow quickly with very little tending. The microgreens were planted by gently turning over the earth, sprinkling some seeds, and letting Mother Nature take care of the rest. The anticipated weekend of rain was perfect timing to help these little seeds take root and grow. Even better, all grade levels at the school got to participate and to have their own planting area. Students planted peas, kale, radish, green lettuce, spinach, and arugula.

While a popular idea, Ms. Newton has extended this idea as an opportunity to collaborate with the local Mendham Township Library in building young people’s interest in reading. The school library was redecorated to resemble a charming restaurant, the ""Tiger Cafe,"" with the exception of having stacks of books on each round table. Each table featured a different literary genre, e.g., non-fiction, fantasy, realistic fiction, historical fiction. Students spent five minutes seated at each table and got to sample several books that were featured at a particular table and could be checked out at the local Mendham Township Library or at the MTES School Library. While browsing the menu students received gentle prompts to consider what they like about a book and what was surprising or interesting about a book.

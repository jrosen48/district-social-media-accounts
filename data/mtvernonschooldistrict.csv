In response to our stakeholders who would like to support our MV community during this unique season, the Mt. Vernon Education Foundation has created a Response and Impact Fund.

The foundation has identified the following categories of need and support;
1. Teacher and Student e-learning support
2. Support for our MV families
3. Community Support for Frontline Responders, Food Support, and Local Businesses

We know many of you will donate just by knowing the current critical needs- we thank you! Since the passing last week of the CARES Act there are some additional advantages to giving that you might find advantageous.

1.A new ""above the line"" charitable deduction of up to $300

2.For 2020, the income limit for cash contributions to charity rises to 100% of AGI(from the current 60$ AGI limit)

3.The repeal of the required minimum distributions (RMD) for 2020

Online donations can be made by going to www.MtVernonFoundation.org

Cooking together can be a fun (and delicious!) activity for families with young children. It is also an opportunity to explore math concepts. Whether counting the number of strawberries for a fruit smoothie or counting the number of pancakes on a plate, time spent cooking together can go a long way to promoting children’s learning. Have fun learning while making these yummy receipts!

There is nothing like a small town in the way it stirs our heart and soul as John Couger Mellencamp reminds us in his ""Small Town"" video.

One of the ways that MVEF is supporting our MV Small Towns is thru the #MVEFGenChallenge we are asking our MV students and families to use the pandemic crisis as a ""teachable moment"" in using the opportunity to perform an act of GENEROSITY, for someone else within the next 30 days and post it on our FB page. In doing so you will also be supporting our local business community!

MVEF will is giving away $1000 over the next thirty days in the form of gift cards, products, and services that we are purchasing from our local small-town businesses to be used as our prize giveaways. In addition, we want to support our small businesses by using our social media platform to promote their business and special promotions during this time!

A special thank you to our FES Student Council for spreading kindness and positivity throughout our building.

For the second time this year, they gave ALL students a special surprise. Today, each FES student received two “finger flashlights.” Student Council shared their goal is to make reading fun and get students excited about reading!🔦📚

Excellent leadership FES Student Council. We are proud of you! 💛🖤",0.0,"Fortville Elementary School

Dear Parents,

While the administration is in the planning stages for the fall semester and waiting on further directions from TEA and the governor's office, we would like to know your thoughts and concerns. Your child's health and safety are our first priority in ensuring the transition back to campus. It is important that we all do our part, not only for ourselves, but also for our most vulnerable classmates, faculty and staff. We can only accomplish this together, so your support is very much appreciated!

We ask that all Muenster ISD parents please fill out the following survey. We appreciate your feedback.

The S&S Elementary School & Muenster ISD Elementary proofs are available on the website. We are hoping to send proofs home through the schoolwork packets, but are still working out the logistics. The due date on the form says March 31st but we know that is not possible. We will keep these pictures available at the form prices and school delivery until April 20th. We will notify you via social media when the proofs are available from the school. Thank you for your patience as we navigate these historic times.

All ticket money received by this morning has been processed. Teachers will send home all tickets with students at dismissal. All tickets sold have been recorded by name...so if your student turned in monies - you will have a ticket coming to you.
Unfortunately NO TICKETS will be sold at the door, and we cannot maintain a wait list.
We are thankful for the support of our students and families. Due to our success - we will look to move this event to a larger venue in the future.

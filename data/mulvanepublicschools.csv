MMS came together today to kick off the annual Patriot League Food Drive. MMS STUCO sponsors the Food Drive so STUCO members, along with sponsors Ms. Mangas and Mrs. Grant, lead the school in an assembly of group chants and grade games. Last year, MMS placed 3rd, so this year, we're going for the gold! MMS can win the traveling trophy, and more importantly, MMS can help our friends at Care N Share, The Blessing Box, and the Mulvane PD (who will donate the food to families in need), so help us beat the perennial Food Drive winners, Ark City, this year! The Food Drive will start next week, November 11-15. STUCO will be collecting any nonperishable items and cash donations all next week. Help us help others. Go Cats!",0.0,"Mulvane Middle School

We are loving fall and the beautiful colors that come with the season! Preschoolers read stories all about leaves today and got to do a fun leaf-rubbing art project. Such a simple but beautiful craft.

Want to do this craft at home? Go on a walk with your child(ren) and have them collect a few different kinds of leaves. Talk about their shapes, sizes, color, texture, etc. Then give them some paper and crayons (without the wrapper), put the leaves under the paper, and let them color over them to discover the images that pop through. Enjoy this wonderful time together exploring the beauty of fall!",0.0,"Mulvane Public Library

It is with great disappointment that I inform you of an incident of a racial slur spoken by a student during our freshman orientation session Friday morning.
While the vast majority of our students were respectful, one student unmuted and spoke a racial slur toward African Americans and other profanity. It was appalling, unacceptable and goes against every core value at Mundelein High School. MHS is on a journey to deconstruct racial injustice so we can better educate our students for the future.
Our deans of students are investigating and will take appropriate action. Incidents of this nature are unsettling and we encourage students to speak with their teachers, counselors and/or other trusted adults.

English Teachers Mark Landuyt, Beth Willis, and Sarah Wilson created a short slide presentation for students to create and share as a representation of their memoir, called our Senior Capstone ""Yearsbook.” Their Honors English 4 classes spent much of the end of this semester writing their ""Senior Capstone Memoir,"" which in total is five chapters (one for each year of high school and an afterword) and includes narrative, expository, and argumentative writing throughout. Usually, students ""present"" the themes/messages as a sort of celebration of their memoirs during this final week. Naturally, that would not really be possible during Remote e-Learning. But it still felt wrong to leave their work without a way to celebrate it. Students wrote honestly and thoughtfully about their time at MHS, especially for many the frustration with how their senior year has ended.

Dear Mundelein District 75 Families:

We’ve just finished our first e-learning cycle for April. Cycle 2 begins on Monday. We understand that there are a few issues with Seesaw response mechanisms for our K-2 students. This will require some technical work on the back end of the platform. Please be patient as we work through these issues and know that all the staff at District 75 are here to support your child’s learning the best we can. Visit the Student Learning Hub for more information about e-learning and answers to frequently asked questions.

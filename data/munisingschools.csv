#MustangProud",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2792353154203161&id=773442476094249,,0.0,"Munising Public Schools has set Saturday, June 13 at noon as the graduation date and time to honor the Munising High School Class of 2020!

Depending on what is allowed under the Governor's MI Safe Start Plan, the first option is to do the ceremony at Mustang Stadium with appropriate safety precautions and social distancing, but if that is not allowed due to the continued large gathering restrictions, the ceremony will be conducted as a ""drive-in"" ceremony in the high school parking lot, where people would stay in their cars. We will follow up either ceremony with a parade through town, so community members can honor the seniors as well.

If weather prohibits the outdoor graduation from being conducted on Saturday, June 13, then Sunday, June 14 at 1:00pm would the back-up date and time.

Here is a quote from Kali Donnelly from Munising High School who is interning at Munising Memorial Hospital:

""My internship means so much to me, it has allowed me to experience a work environment that I can envision myself in. Giving me a jumpstart on what the job entails. Plus it has given me the ability to be a step above other in the application process. With this in mind, my internship has changed my perspective of the jobs I was certain I wanted to go into. It has opened my eyes to new fields that quite possibly could be a better job than the one I had in mind. I believe if you have the opportunity to get a first hand look at a job you are interested in, you should take it! It allows you to test drive a job before you go and spent thousands of dollars on it. Finally I think it is a tremendous opportunity that everyone should be offered! For me I am going to stay curious and be a sponge to the knowledge I am learning! Thank you to everyone who has given me the privilege to have the internship I currently hold.""",0.0,"A great quote from Munising Mustang senior Kali Donnelly regarding her internship at Munising Memorial Hospital!

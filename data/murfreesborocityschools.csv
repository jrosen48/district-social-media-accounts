This year's Literacy Day of Action will be dedicated to Dr. Linda Gilbert, who was Director of Murfreesboro City Schools and a tireless advocate for children's education. We commemorate her lifetime of service to students' well-being, and we are proud to have worked side by side with her for many years to help improve the lives of children and families in our community. She will be deeply missed.

Now through June 16, United Way is hosting a drive to collect new or gently used books and other educational resources that children need during the summer months to help prevent “summer slide” – especially since schools have been closed during the pandemic!

For more information, visit https://www.yourlocaluw.org/literacydayofaction.

The collected items will be distributed to neighbors in need via Murfreesboro City Schools’ Books on a Bus (BOB), Chow Bus and Rutherford County Schools YMCA after school program.

We would like to give a huge congratulations to our fabulous Teachers of the Year, Mrs. Hix and Mrs. Pozo. These ladies are so deserving of this honor!

Mrs. Hix has been teaching for five years. She has taught third grade for her entire career so far, and thoroughly enjoys the learning and growth that happens during a student’s third grade school year. Her favorite part about teaching is forming a community within her classroom to support and champion each student. She also enjoys collaborating with fellow educators to create engaging lessons.

Mrs. Pozo has been teaching for 20 years. She taught Kindergarten through 8th grade and 12th grade English in bilingual and ESL classes. She loves it when she sees her students come out of their silent period and begin communicating in English with their peers and participating class! She loves to see their eyes light up when English begins to make sense to them!",0.0,"Congratulations. We hate that our celebration was cancelled but so glad you are part of the MCS family.

A HUGE congratulations to MNS Leader, Cha’Miyah Webb!!! She was selected for the 2020 TN Treble Honor Choir- an all-state honor choir composed of the top 5th and 6th grade voices in the state of TN. She auditioned back in October and was notified in December that she was selected for this prestigious choir. Out of hundreds of auditions, 125 5th and 6th graders were selected for TN Treble Honor Choir. The TN Treble Honor Choir event was supposed to take place this Friday and Saturday, but it is part of the TN Music Educators Association Professional Development conference, and the conference, as well as all all-state ensembles were cancelled due to COVID-19.

From optional challenges to serving meals... MCS does not stop! Over 3,900 students have been on Lexia and iReady (iReady pass rate is 88%), there were over 330 participants in the K-2 Math Challenge, over 140 participants in the 3-5 reading challenge, roughly 5,000 meals served, and lots of school supplies and books given out. Thank YOU to everyone who has made this possible! If you have pictures of your students working, please share.
Have a great weekend, MCS families!

Today, Overall Creek hosted state legislators, guests from Tenn Dept of Education and Tenn STEM Innovation Network, School Board Members, City Council, TCAT and Rutherford Works for a walk through a STEM school in action.

The best part may have been that the students didn't really take notice to the group of adults walking through the halls, and in and out of classrooms. But those same students were certainly happy to talk about the projects they were working on if anyone stopped and had a question. All in a days work for Overall students.

Earlier this month Kayla Miller, a Siegel Elementary School student, wrote a letter to the Mayor, introducing herself and her desire to be the President of the United States. ""I want to be President because I have a passion to be the best I can be for my country,"" Kayla wrote the Mayor.

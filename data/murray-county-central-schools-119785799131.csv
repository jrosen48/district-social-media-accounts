Last night the school board decided to start the school year in the Hybrid Model which means all students will be in the school building each day with mandatory social distancing and face coverings. We can accomplish this due to the large square footage of our buildings and relatively small student population.

Registration starts today and will run from Tuesday August 11th through Sunday August 16th. All registration is online this year. Please log into your JMC parent portal to update your information.

Click on the link “register for 2020-2021” and fill out all forms (Free/Reduced, Health, and Residency) and questions for each child. Make sure to indicate if your child will be doing MCC Virtual Academy during the registration process.

According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 75% of our elderly poor are women. Despite advances, women remain less prepared to provide for their future financial security. Taking charge of your money is far easier than you can imagine and this course could be your first step. Learn about investing for your financial future and don’t wait for a crisis (divorce, illness, unemployment, or death) to spur you into action. From investment basics to evaluating your financial portfolio – we will talk about goal setting, risk and reward, and the tools to meet your goals.

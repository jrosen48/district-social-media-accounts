Jessica wants to go into nursing because she has a heart for helping others. She hopes to be the first in her family to earn a college degree. Jessica can‚Äôt pick just one staff member, so she wants to say THANK YOU to everyone who believed in her and motivated her to finish her coursework and earn her diploma. Her favorite quote is from Kim Taehyung of BTS: ‚ÄúWhen things get hard, stop and look back at how far you‚Äôve come. Don‚Äôt forget how rewarding it is. You are the most beautiful flower, more special than anyone in this world.‚Äù

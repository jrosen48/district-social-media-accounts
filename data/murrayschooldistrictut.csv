Please welcome Brenna Brown to the Murray City School District family!
Get to know Brenna...

👉 She is a Murray alum! She graduated from MHS in 2015.
👉 Her biggest influences were Mr. Bodily at Riverview, Mr. Wood and Mr. Wilson at MHS, along with her husband who is also a teacher – they all inspired her to chase her dreams.
👉 Brenna is proudest right now that she gets to work in the same district she grew up in.
👉 The best vacation ever, she says, was a trip to Shanghai Disney park. But her Disney traveling isn’t over as she plans to visit every Disney park around the world.
👉 And, finally, sandwich crusts have always been her favorite part.

Get to know Megan...

👉 Comes to Murray from Saint Sophia School where she worked as a kindergarten teacher.
👉 Always wanted to work in education with children, but particularly had a 2nd grade teacher who believed in her and that feeling stuck.
👉 Is always proud to see a former student that is excited to see her again.
👉 Every summer her family finds a new location – one of her favorites was a camping trip deep in the Idaho forest, completely off the grid.
👉 Has never been a crust-eater with sandwiches, even today.

More than 200,000 phone calls are placed to domestic violence hotlines every year. No one should experience abuse. So today is National Love is Kindness Day – a day recognize freedom from abuse. Along with sharing this post, here are things you can do today...

👉 Celebrate for all victims of domestic violence/domestic abuse their FREEDOM and INDEPENDENCE from their abuser.
👉 Recognize our right to be treated with KINDNESS. Because real love is kind, not terrorizing.
👉 Realize that kindness is the path to healthy and safer relationships, families, society, and world.
👉 Give voice for and hope and support to others who are still suffering, often in silence.
👉 Spread messages how we can be kind to one another, especially to those closest to us.
👉 Remember that love is not abusive, violent, demeaning or dehumanizing. If someone uses love as an excuse for their hurtful behavior, it’s not real love.

We love celebrating diversity 🥰 and things that make us all unique. For some that’s having eyes 👀 with different colors for each – this is called heterochromia.

For some, this condition has no impact and for others, there can be some complications. But as we love all people😍, we celebrate the uniqueness we each have to offer in life and this is certainly not something you see every day. A few celebrities are known to have two different colored eyes include David Bowie, Christopher Walken, Dan Aykroyd, Jane Seymour, and Mila Kunis.

Well, today has traditionally been 7/11 Day – a day to go get a free Slurpee 🥤, but with that cancelled here’s an alternative that is still pretty cool and definitely will make you feel good inside. Today is cheer up the lonely day! 🥰

There are LOTS of lonely people out there right now 😔 – and kids have the ability to lift the spirits of lonely people. So make a call, send an email, or mail a card to the lonely person you are thinking of. Let them know you care.

This is something we can all take five minutes ⌚️to do and great to explain to our kids we don’t always need a holiday or vacation to express love to someone who is lonely – it’s just a good thing to do!

Q: SHOULD WE RETURN MY STUDENT'S CHROMEBOOk?💻
A: It depends. Students in grades K-11 will keep their Chromebook and bring it with them when they return to school in the fall. This includes students moving from 6th grade to the junior high schools and 9th-grade students moving to Murray High School. If students are NOT returning to MCSD in the fall, their Chromebooks must be returned to the District Office between May 29 and June 4. Call 801-264-7411 to make an appointment for that return. Failure to do so will result in a fine and filed police report.

Q: What if I don’t want to keep the Chromebook over the Summer?🌞
A: Parents that don’t want to keep their student’s Chromebook over Summer can call 801-264-7411 to schedule a return appointment on or after May 29.

We made it through Wednesday! Today’s update is fairly short and sweet and all about CARE!

In life we care about lots of things, but too often we forget to care for ourselves. This moment in history is challenging in so many different ways and many of you are working so hard to give and serve one another - we see that reflected daily. Sometimes it’s heroic and other times just kindness. But please carve out a little bit of time to care for yourself each day so that you can go on being heroic and kind in other parts of the day.

Today’s Update:
- Chromebook Care
- Self Care and Resources Reminder
- Kindergarten Registration (including TBEK)

Take a deep breath, we have just concluded the school term. Tomorrow will be a teacher workday - no digital home learning. And next week is Spring Break at Murray City School District - also no digital learning. Digital home learning will resume on April 6. So take a well-deserved break. It’s very likely we will have further important announcements to share before we return on April 6 but we will try and keep those to a minimum and as necessary.

Here’s today’s update:
- No Digital Home Learning Between March 27 and April 5.
- Grades and Communication
- The District Office Schedule
- Reminder: Boys and Girls Club Spring Break Lunch

""Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.""

Why? Viruses can spread from person to person via respiratory droplets. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, close contacts can be infected. In addition, the virus can end up on doorknobs, elevator buttons and other surfaces. If you touch those surfaces and then touch your eyes, nose or mouth, you can become infected.

GETTING ON AND OFF THE BUS
• Warn children that if they drop something getting on and off the bus, they should never pick it up. Instead, they should tell the driver and follow the driver’s instructions.
• Remind children to look to the right before they step off the bus.
• If you meet your child at the bus stop after school, wait on the side where the child will be dropped off, not across the street. Children can be so excited to see you after school that

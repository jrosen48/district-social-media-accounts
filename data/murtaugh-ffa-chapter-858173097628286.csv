October 15, 1969 a male FFA member from California moved to strike out the word male from the FFA constitution at the 42nd National FFA Convention in front of 12,675 members. By only a two vote margin, the motion was carried. Despite the initial motion defeat in 1964, 1966, and 1968, women were finally permitted to join the organization.

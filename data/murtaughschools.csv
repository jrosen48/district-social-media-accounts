STOP FOR SCHOOL BUSES!!!

Please take a moment to watch the school bus violations that were filmed in Twin Falls County. Each of the videos are from school buses our patrol cars in our County including Murtaugh, Hansen, Kimberly, and Twin Falls. The Sheriff's Office is aggressively enforcing stop arm violations as we work together with our schools to keep children safe from the time they leave home, until the time they return again.

The fine for passing a stopped school bus is $200.00, and is a misdemeanor on your driving record. We would like to thank our partners at each school district in Twin Falls County for helping us with our advertising campaign as well as Town Square Media for airing the PSA on their stations. 98.3 the Snake, 1310 KLIX, 95.7 KEZJ, KOOL 96.5",0.0,"Ron Shala Hepworth shared a post to the group: Murtaugh, Idaho.

HUGE. NEWS!
Thanks to some very generous community members, MEEF is proud to introduce the Harvard Fellow Buntin Scholars. Named in honor of former MCSD Superintendent Jim Buntin, these Harvard Fellows Buntin Scholars come from high poverty schools with the mission of helping attack poverty in Muscogee County starting in the classroom. We are in awe of what our community can do when it sees a need - and how they rally to support these exceptional teachers!

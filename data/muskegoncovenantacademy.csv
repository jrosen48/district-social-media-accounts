Pop Quiz: When SHOULD someone ask for help?

When things get a little worse? When they just can't take it anymore? When the suffering has gone on long enough?

Cheat Sheet:
NOW is always the right time to ask for the help you need. Not after things get a little worse, not when you're barely hanging on, not when you've suffered long enough. This is true for both physical and emotional needs.

Our staff is standing by waiting for you to ask us for what you need. If you're feeling anxious, depressed, experiencing abuse or suffering from any other physical or emotional stress, YOU are in need of help now. Please do not suffer needlessly. Suffering does not make you strong and brave. Asking for what you need, makes you strong and brave.

We can and will help you.

Please text/call:

Pop Quiz: When SHOULD someone ask for help?

When things get a little worse? When they just can't take it anymore? When the suffering has gone on long enough?

Cheat Sheet:
NOW is always the right time to ask for the help you need. Not after things get a little worse, not when you're barely hanging on, not when you've suffered long enough. This is true for both physical and emotional needs.

Our staff is standing by waiting for you to ask us for what you need. If you're feeling anxious, depressed, experiencing abuse or suffering from any other physical or emotional stress, YOU are in need of help now. Please do not suffer needlessly. Suffering does not make you strong and brave. Asking for what you need, makes you strong and brave.

We can and will help you.

Please text/call:
Mr. Zach: (231) 330-6880
Ms. Shelly: (231) 733-6869

Or message any other staff member you feel comfortable with.

Always Here,

I am 22 years old, I dropped out of high school when I was 18. I have always been a bright kid, so I quickly found out after dropping out how important school is. Education is always the KEY. I use KEY as an acronym, Keep Educating Yourself.
Since a young age I‚Äôve always been on a mission to KEY.
I am thankful for Muskegon Covenant Academy and BGC for giving me the opportunity to complete my high school education.

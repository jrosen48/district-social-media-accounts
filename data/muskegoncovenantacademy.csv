Pop Quiz: When SHOULD someone ask for help?

When things get a little worse? When they just can't take it anymore? When the suffering has gone on long enough?

Cheat Sheet:
NOW is always the right time to ask for the help you need. Not after things get a little worse, not when you're barely hanging on, not when you've suffered long enough. This is true for both physical and emotional needs.

Our staff is standing by waiting for you to ask us for what you need. If you're feeling anxious, depressed, experiencing abuse or suffering from any other physical or emotional stress, YOU are in need of help now. Please do not suffer needlessly. Suffering does not make you strong and brave. Asking for what you need, makes you strong and brave.

We can and will help you.

When things get a little worse? When they just can't take it anymore? When the suffering has gone on long enough?

Cheat Sheet:
NOW is always the right time to ask for the help you need. Not after things get a little worse, not when you're barely hanging on, not when you've suffered long enough. This is true for both physical and emotional needs.

Our staff is standing by waiting for you to ask us for what you need. If you're feeling anxious, depressed, experiencing abuse or suffering from any other physical or emotional stress, YOU are in need of help now. Please do not suffer needlessly. Suffering does not make you strong and brave. Asking for what you need, makes you strong and brave.

We can and will help you.

In honor of Martin Luther King Jr., MCA will be observing this day as a holiday and therefore the school will be closed.

At the age of thirty-five, Martin Luther King, Jr., was the youngest man to have received the Nobel Peace Prize. When notified of his selection, he announced that he would turn over the prize money of $54,123 to the furtherance of the civil rights movement.

On the evening of April 4, 1968, while standing on the balcony of his motel room in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was to lead a protest march in sympathy with striking garbage workers of that city, he was assassinated.

CONGRATULATIONS DQ!
MCA TEEN ZONE YOUTH OF THE MONTH

“If you can think it, it can become your reality.”
Hello! My name is Devonqua R., or as my friends cal me, “DQ.”
I am 22 years old, I dropped out of high school when I was 18. I have always been a bright kid, so I quickly found out after dropping out how important school is. Education is always the KEY. I use KEY as an acronym, Keep Educating Yourself.
Since a young age I’ve always been on a mission to KEY.
I am thankful for Muskegon Covenant Academy and BGC for giving me the opportunity to complete my high school education.
I'm also very thankful for the great motivation that BGC gives to me.",0.0,"We are so Proud! Congratulations on your graduation!

CONGRATULATIONS CORYION!

Youth of the Month- Muskegon Covenant Academy!
Coryion has been a member at MCA since day one. He consistently attends programming, enjoys dinner, and loves to shoot some hoops! He attends The Club everyday, and we are proud to announce that he is getting his classwork accomplished while still having fun!

Coryion stays until we close, brings a positive atmosphere for everyone around him, and we're so happy to have him at The Club.
Coryion is originally from Dallas,TX and believes that, “BGCML keeps kids out of the streets, and on a good track.” He added,” I love being in The Club, and I can’t make this up, I feel safe in the love from Club staff, and I will keep attending until I cannot go anymore.”

Thank you for being a Club Member Coryion! We're lucky to have you!

Dr. Sam Joseph provides an update on Covenant Hall to our supporters. The Hall is providing housing to 19 of our Covenant Academy students and 5 graduates who are students at MCC or other training. These students, like many who are homeless, face other challenges that contribute to their homelessness and the services we provide have evolved to meet their needs, with more mental health support and mentoring, along with the same “family atmosphere” they experience at our school.

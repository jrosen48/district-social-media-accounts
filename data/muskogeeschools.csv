""As I have reflected on the events of this past week, I felt compelled to speak out. Like many of you, I was completely shocked and horrified by the actions that led to the death of George Floyd. My spirit has been troubled since watching the video and seeing this disgraceful event. My thoughts and prayers go out to the Floyd family.

I am dedicated to working harder to end the mistreatment of Black Americans. I don’t want to pretend to understand the fear, anxiety and the racial profiling that occurs daily, but I am committed to listening and learning. It is time for change across our country and it can start in each of our communities.

You have my commitment to standing up against racism. To ensure that all children in Muskogee Public Schools, regardless of their skin color, deserve to be treated fairly and without prejudice. I feel blessed to serve a diverse school district that provides opportunity for ALL students. Let’s begin that dialogue now – they are counting on us to lead!""",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157272144367963&id=49637222962,,0.0,"Statement from Superintendent Dr. Jarod Mendenhall:

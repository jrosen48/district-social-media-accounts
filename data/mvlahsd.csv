While we have no confirmed cases of the virus among students and staff, and the closure of our schools is an unprecedented action, it is going to be an important one in mitigating the spread of the virus in our community.

We will close schools effective Tuesday, March 17, for two weeks. We will evaluate the re-opening target of March 27, based on the status of the coronavirus situation. Our district is closed on Monday 3/16, and Tuesday 3/17 is a professional development day for staff, with no students in attendance.

Tuesday will be an important day for us as we work to complete the plans for flexible learning for our students. This is, as you know, uncharted territory for all of us, and we appreciate your support, patience, and flexibility.

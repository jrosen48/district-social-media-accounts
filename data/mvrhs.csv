Jaiden is 1 of over 5,600 candidates across each who were invited into the program based on his SAT score. He was then named one of 621 semi-finalists based on a number of criteria, including essays, self-assessments, school recommendations and academic performance in high school. He became one of 11 semi-finalists in the state of Massachusetts, and now is 1 of only 3 students in the state to receive the honor of being named a Presidential Scholar. Only 121 students across the country were chosen, and would normally be invited to attend the National Recognition Program held in Washington, DC, which unfortunately cannot occur due to the pandemic.

Hi, Mountain View staff, parents, and students!
I have created Zoom ""open office"" hours that you can join to check-in or to ask any questions that you may have. These meetings will be:

Mondays and Weds. 12-1pm https://zoom.us/j/596510978

Tuesday and Thursday 1-2pm https://zoom.us/j/596510978

I can also schedule 1:1 Zoom meetings or phone calls with any students or families who would like to speak to me privately. Please send me an email if you would like to set something up!

I hope you are all doing well and taking the personal distancing seriously, while still maintaining social contact through phone calls, online mediums and face time chats. Try to get outside EVERY day and get some fresh air! If there is anything I can help with, please let me know, I'm only an email away.

If anyone is feeling stressed or in crisis surrounding this very difficult time- please remember there is help out there 24/7 at the Maine Crisis Hotline 1-888-568-1112

I look forward to connecting with you all soon!

Riverside County Public Health officials have just notified the District that the individual employee under observation has tested negative for Covid-19.

Due to the lateness of this communication, MVHS will re-open on Wednesday March 11, 2020. Students and staff under self-quarantine will be notified by Riverside Public Health officially stating that they do not need to take this extra precaution at this time and may return to school on Wednesday with all other students.

The virus continues to be a public health concern. Preventative measures shared in earlier communications will remain in place. Public Health officials have warned that the conditions and circumstances of this virus are changing quickly and it is critical that all authorized preventative and precautionary steps be taken. #Negative

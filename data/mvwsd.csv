This pandemic can make people feel powerless or alone. While one person can spread the virus to hundreds of others, the reverse is also true. One person could stop transmission in its tracks by taking necessary precautions to prevent from spreading the virus. Multiply those actions by hundreds of thousands of people, and you’ll understand the power of what Santa Clara County residents achieved before. We have proven that working together towards the same goal does wonders for the entire community.

While we may feel powerless against this disease, this could not be further from the truth. Each of us has the power to help keep ourselves, our loved ones, and our whole community safe by wearing a mask and keeping our distance. Do not give up hope. We can make a difference, together.",0.0,"County of Santa Clara Public Health Department

Do you feel anxious or stressed about COVID-19?

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations like infectious disease outbreaks. Recognizing when you feel anxious, stressed, or worried and finding ways to cope will help make you, the people you care about, and your community stronger.

Here are some simple steps to managing your stress during the COVID-19 outbreak:

• Take care of your body

• Connect with others (as long as you are following social distancing!)

• Take breaks

Apologies for the confusion!

Superintendent of Schools Elsie Rodriguez, in her recent letter to families, announced that MWCSD is committed to providing all students, grades K-12, access to a district device, either a Chromebook or an iPad, to best prepare them for whatever the future holds – inside the classroom or out. Please check the website for all the details on scheduling a time to pick up computers for all students in your family. https://www.mw.k12.ny.us/district-initiates-1-to-1-computer-distribution-to-all-m-w-students/.",2020-07-06 15:16:58,,

Congratulations to Andrew on his appointment as professor of law at Harvard Law School!

Here's what Andrew has to say about M-W:

""I can picture each and every one of my teachers, principals, and coaches back at MW—from Pine Tree through Middle School and High School—and remember every one of them with such fondness and affection. I’ve been a student and now a teacher at Harvard for over a decade, but the teachers I had at MW are still some of the best educators I’ve met. I think of them, and all my great classmates and friends, each time I pull off at Exit 16 on the Thruway to visit home, and see the trio of schools I attended from 1995 to 2001 (we were the second class to graduate from the “new” High School). I feel fortunate to have had such a strong foundation for my education, and such a good model for how to educate others.""

We're so proud of you, Andrew! #mwinspiresuccess #mwfam #mwalumni",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2796082837087868&id=1115260648503437,"Andrew Manuel Crespo ’08 appointed professor of law at Harvard Law School - Harvard Law Today

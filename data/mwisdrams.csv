Thank you both for being God’s Earth Angels ! You have lifted my head and my spirit 🙌🏼",2020-08-26 08:56:51,,

In Mrs. Castillo's class this week students worked on getting their math journals ready. They created a self portrait and used two truths and a lie to introduce themselves to the class. Students read Wilfred Gordon McDonald Partridge by Mem Fox and brought something that was precious as gold, something warm, something that made them laugh, something that made them cry, and something from long ago. Friday they shared their memories. #mwisdmatters",0.0,"Houston Elementary - MWISD

And we know you’re all busy packing a nutritionally balanced Pinterest worthy bento box lunch 🍱, setting out ironed and perfectly coordinated outfits with matching masks 👕, and tucking your children into bed where they wait eagerly to wake up well rested before your alarm goes off when they will have their hair and teeth brushed dressed and ready for the full breakfast you will cook them 🥓🍳🥞....ok but seriously even if you have to tell them to wake up 637 times and throw a granola bar at them while pulling them out of the house in mismatched shoes you’re still awesome.

Regardless if you are joining us through online instruction or in person, Mineral Wells ISD knows how much preparation goes into that first day of school- school supplies, an outfit, a haircut, a backpack, the classroom, the lesson plans, and most importantly, the first day of school photo!

So why not show it off? Snapping that first day of school photo at home, on your front porch, at the bus stop, or in front of the school is a tradition for our students, parents, and staff.

Submit photos on your Facebook or Twitter page with the hashtag #mwisdmatters. It is a fun and easy way to celebrate our students, staff, and parents’ smiles on the first day of school.

MWISD Parents:

Please note that parent drop off lines are often longer the first weeks of school because many bus parents choose to bring their kids to school to get the year started. This year, we will have fewer kids riding buses due to Covid-19 concerns, so the drop off lines might be longer. This may be offset by the fact that many students are learning from home.

I write this to encourage you to arrive a good 10 minutes earlier than you normally would to allow time to get through the line. Also please know that things always settle in after the first two weeks and dropoff times decline sharply after people adjust arrival times and learn the routines.",0.0,"John Kuhn

Carla Purdue, Family Nurse Practitioner from PPGH presented Telehealth Connections, a new service for MWISD that is designed to connect schools, nurses, and healthcare providers by providing primary care access using technology to ensure that every child has a chance at good health and a good education.

Beginning in the fall of 2020, every MWISD nurses’ office will have a telehealth station that will offer on-demand access to care providers for things like a nagging cough, sniffle or infection that would otherwise necessitate a phone call and a family’s inconvenient trip to the doctor’s office.

Using the equipment, MWISD Lead Nurse, Wanda Voelcker demonstrated how a nurse would connect to a care provider. TeleHealth Connections Agent, Scott McCray was on-hand to answer the call.

June 4th Chromebook Return

Travis Parents,

The school year comes to a close on Wednesday, May 27th. This year we have a few other details to work out that are much different than other years. We are scheduling June 4th, from 2-6 pm to take care of Chromebook return. This will be in the front drive at Travis. We will accept Travis Chromebooks only and ask that you remain in your vehicle as always. During this time, we will also offer medicine pickup for those that were left with the nurse. If your child left personal belongings in their locker those can be picked up at this same time. I thank you for a wonderful and eventful school year that we will remember forever. We will all grow and be stronger people from the events of this year. I wish you a safe and happy summer break.

Thank you,

David Wells

Today we shine the spotlight on Senior Kaitlyn Chriestenson. Before Drill Team I did not know Kaitlyn. Boy did I miss out. She is beautiful, bright, funny, talented and a hard worker. Her eyes sparkle when she is happy and her smile can light up a room. She works at Chicken Express so you have probably seen her. This year I asked her to step out of her comfort zone and do a forward walk over at competition and a flip in her duet. Kaitlyn didn't argue about doing it, she just started practicing. She did wonderful in both. I am proud of her and all she does for her Family and friends. WE all will miss you sweet girl.",0.0,"MWHS Wranglerettes

This is my adopted Lady Ram Senior, Kristen Fairrel. She is a Senior at Mineral Wells High School ~ Class of 2020. She is 18 years old. She enjoys running 🏃🏼‍♀️, playing softball 🥎, hanging out with her friends and family, watching TV shows 📺 and painting 🎨! Kristen will be attending Weatherford College to pursue a degree in sonography. She likes “smell good” things like lotions, candles or perfume and collecting stuff to use to create paintings. When she is in the mood for a snack she reaches for a Root-Beer, Fruit Gushers and chips! Yum! I am super excited to have adopted Kristen and to be a part of the Adopt-A-Ram Senior project.

Deciding where you’re going to college is exciting. It’s a major step toward a person’s future, and it should feel like an epic occasion. Whether it is a community college, university, a certification program, the military, or any other education past high school, College Signing Day shows support for this future.

Mineral Wells High School scheduled the Class of 2020 College Signing Day for Friday, April 17th. Amidst the challenges COVID-19 has brought to our lives, we still want to recognize our seniors on this special day.

Fun. Love. Laughter. Dedication. Dress up days. Learning. Exploring. Making memories. Laying the foundation for years to come.

This is my family.
This is my home away from home.
These are my people, little and big.

It’s times like these that really remind you to have an attitude of gratitude.

I’m grateful for the laughter, memories, and all my students have achieved this year. Grateful for the dedication from my administration (shoutout to our incredible APs, Marshall & Dianna Leggett), they’re working tirelessly. Grateful for our SPED staff for working so hard to meet student needs. Grateful to be a part of a district, who sprang in to action to take care of all of our children in the community - even though they weren’t walking our halls each day.

As many of you know I am a first year teacher. I didn’t go the traditional route because it took me a little while to listen to what God had for me. I had given up on the idea of teaching because I hadn’t found a spot. God had different plans though. One day in October I got the call and interview that changed my life. Suddenly I had an entire new family through Mineral Wells ISD. Administrators who took a chance on hiring me and have been so patient with me. An entire staff who are so sweet and encouraging. A team of teachers who took me in and welcomed me with open arms. A mentor, Leslee, who has guided, loved, and taught me more than she knows. Last, but most definitely not least are my kids! All 10 of them hold a special place in my heart, and I love them like they were my own. I miss them terribly and I just hope they know that they were so worth the wait!

One of the reasons I “love my school” is for the time I get to spend rewarding students with field trips and extra-curricular activities outside of the classroom! The things we learn and memories we make are so special to me 😊

Today it has been 5 weeks since I have seen my students, and we didn't know it would come to this with distance education. My students are great, and I miss them dearly.

It has been amazing to see how our district has come together with the change. Our administration, teachers, staff, and students are all doing the best they can and it's been amazing to see.

I cannot wait to see my coworkers, which have become my family, and students again when this is all over! Stay strong and healthy!!

I made a Padlet for my high school students last week (it's a digital bulletin board) and asked them their favorite thing about no school/social distancing. I have loved reading every response! Almost all have said things like family time, rest, quality time with family, cleaning, reading, being creative.

Scavenger Hunts - Primary Playground

Lamar Elementary
April 1 at 9:33 AM ·

Hello Lamar Families!

With our district still adjusting to learning at home, we want to make sure you are taking time to
spend some time outdoors in your backyard or on your porch. There are many things your children can learn just by being outside. If you’re looking for a twist, try a scavenger hunt!

Scavenger hunts can be modified for indoors or out, and you can put an academic spin on them. Use sticky
notes to place letters, numbers, shapes or sight words around your house or outside.

Don’t have sticky notes? Regular squares of paper with tape work just as well.

Happy Learning!

Scavenger hunts can be modified for indoors or out, and you can put an academic spin on them. Use sticky
notes to place letters, numbers, shapes or sight words around your house or outside.

Don’t have sticky notes? Regular squares of paper with tape work just as well.

Happy Learning!

In this era of social distancing and quarantine, it would be difficult for photographers to take family portraits. So, on ""Feel Good Friday"", MWISD teamed up with Fryer Photography and set up a free “Curbside Family Photo Booth” for our students as they drove thru at Travis Elementary.

Fryer helped set up a photo shoot area, measured off 6 feet from the car to the sidewalk, and started taking photos to any family that was interested. The results were amazing! Some sweet, some hilarious, but all incredible memories for these families to share. It was a great opportunity to document this time in their lives. One day when these kids are grown up, they're going to be able to look back at this time and talk about it. Thank you to Fryer Photography for your help as we try to continue to send a message of positivity in our community. Also a special shout out to Jessie Ishmael for the Sonic drinks!",0.0,"Mineral Wells ISD added 299 new photos.

Just trying to find our groove in this new world of homeschooling. There’s been lots of ups and just as many downs. I’ve learned that bonding with my kids doesn’t only happen through the “ups.” There are bonding moments through the “downs” when we are all trying to figure out how to navigate and work through our frustrations together.

On another note, a big thanks to Charlie’s teacher for hosting their first Zoom meeting this morning! He was so happy to see and talk to everyone. The other 2 have zoom meetings scheduled for tomorrow.",0.0,"Melody McGraw

I have only heard glowing reports about your students today when they visited Bass Hall for a performance of the Nutcracker. Everyone was so impressed at how polite and attentive they were during the performance. We were so happy they got here for the pre-show experience. In fact, the ballet dancers were SO impressed with the questions your students asked and how respectful they were during the demonstrations. Thank you so much for your hard work in making the experience a good one for everyone.

It will be a short meeting followed by a small reception and celebration. Tarleton State University officials, including new TSU President Dr. James Hurley, plan to be in attendance.

The purpose of the meeting is for our board to vote on a proposed Memorandum of Understanding between MWISD and Tarleton State University that will benefit many MWHS graduates for years to come and will deepen the already strong relationship between our two institutions. Details to come.

A huge thank you to Weatherford Aerospace for their very generous donation and choosing Lamar as their charity project! Their employees even donated their raffle winnings over the donated amount raising the total to $2910. Wow what a giving corporation! Our special needs students are going to enjoy the new equipment! #mwisdmatters #LamarPride",0.0,"Lamar Elementary

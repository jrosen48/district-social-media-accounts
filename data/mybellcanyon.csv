Happy Labor Day! 💕

Labor Day is a result of the labor movement and was created to celebrate the social and economic achievements of American workers. Each year on this day we honor contributions workers have made to the strength, prosperity, and well-being of our country.

Today, we wanted to take some time to especially thank those essential workers who have worked so diligently for the rest of us during quarantine.

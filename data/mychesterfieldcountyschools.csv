With social distancing still in effect, Sandhill has partnered with the Chesterfield County School District to provide the schools a way to live stream each graduation service. Our crews have installed a fiber connection to each of the high school stadiums and assisted in setting up the live stream capabilities for each school.

You can tune into each of the following schools live Facebook stream by following the school pages below. Graduation is scheduled for 8:30 AM on Friday May 29, weather permitting. Live streams should begin around 8:00 AM. The schools will also be recording the services and will be re-aired on Sandhill Channel 2 at a later date.

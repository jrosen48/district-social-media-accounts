Most of our K-2 and Blue Team students/families coming to school on Monday and Tuesday have received their bus pickup times for tomorrow. Those coming to school on Thursday and Friday will receive bus pickup times on Wednesday.

If you did not receive bus pickup times, here are some ranges that will help our families. We apologize if we were not able to connect with you.

Families in the northern part of our district (example - Caneadea, Centerville, Rushford) the bus will be through between 7am - 7:35am.

Families in the southern part of our district (example - Cuba, West Clarksville, Black Creek) the bus will be through between 7:10am - 7:45am.

Bus pickup times will be affected by the fact that each student is having their temperature checked. Until we go through this cycle a couple of times, please expect some changes in time the first week.

We thank all of you for your patience and we learn and adjust.

As we start the year, we will still be sending out forms for income verification as we have done in the past. One of the big factors in receiving the grant is proving your district is above the 40% Free and Reduced level. We barely made it over, so we need your help in September to keep qualifying.

This week I was asked to clarify the difference between the two. See Below.

In homeschooling, parents act as full-time instructors. If choosing to homeschool, all school requirements are the full responsibility of the parent/guardian. Homeschooling can only take place once 'Homeschooling Plans' have been submitted to the superintendent for approval and the course of study/curriculum submitted is equivalent in nature to the instruction the student would otherwise receive in school. In online schooling — known at CR as Virtual Academy— online teachers manage the student's studies remotely within a structured curriculum provided by the school.

I want to thank those parents who reached out to me directly with the concerns of Cross Country not being offered for 1 year as a cost saving measure. I am always available and willing to be transparent with any decision or question asked.
One of our board members suggested we proceed with Cross Country sign-ups to gauge the level of participation and interest in the sport￼￼￼￼￼￼￼. We currently have 4 students for the 20-21 school year. I have asked Mr. Cappelletti to please put out signups for Cross Country.
The district will be forming an athletic committee in a couple of weeks once public school districts have a better understanding of what re-opening looks like. We want to make sure everyone has a voice.
Thank you for your patience and reaching out to me directly.

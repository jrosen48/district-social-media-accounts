""When we first were told to close schools in March, we had little time to transition our entire operation to a virtual setting and shifted to emergency distance learning. We know our teachers and staff made an incredible effort to transform the way they teach, connect and support students in Spring, but more will be needed to ensure students don’t fall further behind in the upcoming year. Although online learning can never take the place of in-person learning, based on what we learned in the Spring and feedback from teachers, parents, and students, we can and we will work to make our online instructional program more robust.""

We know the coronavirus has created challenges for AP students and teachers. Here’s how the College Board will support you during this time:

1️⃣ We’re providing free, live and on-demand AP courses

To support AP students affected by school closures due to COVID-19, students and schools will have access to live AP review lessons, delivered by AP teachers from across the country. Lessons will begin March 25.

2️⃣ We’re developing a new at-home testing option

Because of the challenges created by COVID-19, we’re developing a new at-home AP Exam option. Students will be able to test on a computer, tablet, or smartphone.

We will invest so that every AP student impacted by COVID-19 has the tools and connectivity they need to review AP content online and take the exam from home.

During this challenging time, we will work to give every AP student the opportunity to earn the college credit and placement they’ve been working toward all year while maintaining a focus on the health and safety of our AP community.

I have a big announcement ... and a favor.

For the first time in my broadcasting career, I have put together a 30-minute documentary.

It’s called Winter Wishes and airs Christmas Day at 6:30 pm on NBC Bay Area

It’s about the Winter Wishes program held at San Jose’s Branham High School each December.

I covered my first Winter Wishes rally in 2015 and have returned every year since. It is consistently one of the most uplifting and emotional experiences I get to witness.

In our documentary, we trace the history of the program, hear about the life-changing impact the wishes have, and go behind the scenes as students prepare to grant this year's wishes.

Here’s the favor part: if you could let others know about the show, I would greatly appreciate it. I really hope you enjoy it. #bayareaproud #goodnews",0.0,"Garvin Thomas NBC Bay Area is feeling excited.

This past weekend we honored the legacy of former Westmont High School basketball coach Gary Brinck by renaming the basketball tournament he started 53 years ago to now be called the Gary Brinck Invitational Basketball Tournament. He was also entered into as the inaugural inductee to the Westmont Sports Hall of Fame for his contributions as a teacher, coach, athletic director and mentor. Thank you, Coach Brinck!

Yesterday, as we were downloading student information to eSchool, a file became corrupted, which prevented students/staff from using Google as a part of the Schoology platform. That problem was addressed and corrected late last night.

Today, a different issue occurred as LRSD was attempting to provide greater access to YouTube videos for our teaching staff to use through Schoology. As the work was being done, our firewall was disabled and that caused the system to shut down. By 1 p.m. today, that issue had been corrected.

It finally has hit the big day for my baby girl!!!!🧡🧡🤍🤍I want to say I’m so proud of her and will continue to pray for success in her life. She made it with not all her credits but over her credits. Things came her way and she handled it all with dignity, pride and prayer. She already enrolled herself in Cosmetology and said she has so much more she wants to accomplish!!!! With that being said, just watching her grow up and watching her take everything that’s was thrown at her be made out of positivity keeps me uplifted!!!!! She lost things and gained strength through it all!!! She was determined to elevate for herself. Girl I’m so proud of you. Please Help me congratulate my #LRSD2020Grad. She did it!!!!!!! #1down2togo

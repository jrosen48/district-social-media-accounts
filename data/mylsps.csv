Yesterday was pretty awesome as Masonic Heights staff gathered for a Drive-By Celebration of our Kindergarten class, the future Lake Shore High School Class of 2032.

The weather was warm, sunny, and humid, but that didn't stop our families from showing up and showing off! Some kids rode in convertibles, some stood up through their sunroofs, and some waved from the back seat. Some decorated their cars, while some just enjoyed being cheered on and celebrated by their teachers and other school staff.

It was an amazing way to end the year, and to celebrate all that these young learners were able to accomplish this year.

Next stop: 1st grade!!

They come from as northwest as Shelby Township, as northeast as Marine City, as south as Grosse Pointe Park, and as west as Ferndale, with many of them living right here in St. Clair Shores. This group is known for their love of learning, their love of kids, and their dedication to the Masonic Heights community. We have always been proud of what they bring to the lives of our students, but even more so this year given the grace with which they transitioned (seamlessly) to distance learning.

Silas, a 4th grader, read for 3,160 minutes (more than 52.5 hours) during the month of March. When they say that March is Reading Month, SIlas took that to heart. He reads all year long, but gave an extra amount of effort last month.

Just to add a bit of perspective, last March, Silas read a total of 2,760 minutes - an addition of more than 6.5 hours worth of reading this year.

Congratulations Silas! We can wait to see how much you read in March 2021!

Today, we'd like to show off one of our shining stars. This is 5th grader, Aiden, who has spent a significant amount of time over the past couple of weeks making surgical masks with his mom and grandma.

They made a few different designs and ultimately decided on the one pictured here. They are even using a high grade furnace filter that protects against bacteria and viruses. These don‚Äôt offer the same protection as medical equipment, but it is definitely better than nothing.

Aiden has been a big help to his mom and grandma during this process. Their goal is to make at least 100 masks, but hopefully more. Aiden has helped to disassemble the furnace filters, he helped with a lot of the ironing, he learned how to rip seams out of already stitched material, and even did some of the pinning. His mom even gave him a crash course how to respool a bobbin on the sewing machine! He's constantly asking how he can help. He‚Äôs a very creative young man, and is living a life that shows he believes #OtherPeopleMatter.

Today, we salute you, Aiden.

Shout-out to 4th grader, Jack, from Ms. Waldman's class. A few weeks ago, as he was arriving to school, he found some money on the ground and brought it in to the office.

By turning the money in, he displayed The Positivity Project traits of: integrity, kindness, self-control, fairness, and leadership.

As an incentive for Jack's kindness and honesty, Ms. Waldman's class was able to earn a trip to 7-11. They earned the letters S-L-U-R-P-E-E, and today Mr. Barranca & Ms. Waldman took the kids to 7-11, and they got to enjoy a Slurpee on their snowy walk back to school.

""Leavin' on a jet plane..."" Three Palmer Pillans Middle School students from Mobile, AL, who participated in the Airbus Foundation Flying Challenge program this year left Mobile Regional Airport today to travel to Munich, Germany to participate in the Flying Experience Day in celebration of the Airbus Foundation’s 10th Anniversary. The students will represent their school among other Airbus Flying Challenge participants from five countries.

Nicole Goodwin, Al’Landria Jackson and Alexis Vander were selected by school administration based on their merit, performance and engagement in the Airbus Flying Challenge and in school. In preparation for the student’s trip, Airbus mentors helped the students obtain passports and organize travel itineraries.

Jeremy Smith, Manager of Services Engineering, said, “I am very pleased to have three of our students represent the Mobile program in Germany. Opportunities like this one are very important towards student success in scholastic activities because they help prepare and inspire students for tomorrow’s challenges. The mentors and I are very excited to see the future achievements of these bright students.”

Upon arriving in Germany, the students will have the opportunity to tour the city, network with other students, partake in a 10th Anniversary Cake celebration, and observe an Airbus airshow featuring parachute jumpers and vintage Airbus aircraft. They will also have an opportunity to participate in a “riddle rally” with the chance to win a special flight.

The goal of the Airbus Flying Challenge is enhancing the life options and academic success of Palmer Pillans students beyond high school. It’s a community effort which works in partnership with United Way of Southwest Alabama, the Gulf Coast Exploreum Science Center, Mobile Area Education Foundation, and Mobile County Public Schools. Together, these organizations provide a team-based mentoring platform from which they offer STEM-based learning and character development activities.

In the U.S., the Airbus Foundation supports a second Airbus Flying Challenge program in Wichita, Kansas. The Wichita division will be sending one student and his mentor to Germany for the celebration.

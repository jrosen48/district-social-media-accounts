It's a story, but much more than just a story. This story is inspiring, uplifting, and real. It's a story about a family overcoming adversity and lack, yet through those hardships, this family was able to instill hope and a true sense of giving back in their children.

You probably know this family. And that is the real reason I'm grateful today. Each and every one of us could tell a story of struggle and pain, and when I hear or read a story about someone I know who rises above difficulties, I am so grateful for their gift to the rest of us.

So whatever you're facing this holiday season, take heart. There are many amongst us who know what you're going through and have come out the other end with their human spirit intact. That is where our future lies.

There are two groups of riders — one group that is brand new to riding and will be on glide bikes and will need most all of Michele's attention. The other group is bikers who are riding without training wheels and will just have a simple course to ride, working on stopping, turning, and signaling. The hope is to do a couple riding sessions in the next few weeks that will be about 30 mins each, two classes so about an hour on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday afternoons. Dates will depend on volunteer availability. The first class will be from 1:45-2:15 and then 2:15-2:45. It will take about three weeks to get through all first graders this fall, and then in the spring we do a few hour-long sessions on the bikes. Those dates and times are yet to be decided.

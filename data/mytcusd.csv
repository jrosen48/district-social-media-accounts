Federico Hernandez does not want your sympathy. He does not want your pity. He simply wants to be treated like everyone else. Federico has been blind as long as he can remember. He was diagnosed with retinoblastoma, a rare form of eye cancer that nearly cost him his life.

“You learn to live with darkness that you live with every day,” Federico said. “You just have to live your life as normal as you can.”

No one can question the grit of Federico Hernandez. A two-time cancer survivor, Federico is determined to not be seen as someone with a disability, but as someone who is an equal.

“He’s been through quite a bit as a person. He’s gone through a lot of physical hardships and emotional hardships. And it inspires me because he bounces right back up literally and figuratively. And I hope to be like him when I grow up.” - Longden Elementary co-principal and former Temple City High School assistant principal

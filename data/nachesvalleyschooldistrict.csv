This emptiness doesn’t make for a very interesting yearbook layout...so the YB staff needs pics of how the RANGERS are coping with CV19 and the closure! Students can do things like check out my “new study place” or “the view from my Chromebook.” There will be themes and fun contests during the closure. Every grade level can participate. As you help your student stay busy - maybe this would be a creative activity and a chance for them to help tell this unprecedented story! Please encourage them to participate.

About Negotiations, Financial Issues and staffing

Do teachers deserve more pay? Absolutely. Naches Valley School District prides itself on the quality of its teachers. Nothing makes a bigger difference for students than providing them with world-class teachers. While our salaries are not the highest in the region, we have worked hard over the years to 'keep pace'. With the new inequitable funding formula from the state and each district negotiating their own salary schedules, we are struggling to 'keep pace' with districts in the state. This will affect our teachers now and may in the future, affect our families and students.
We understand this is a very stressful time for our staff, community and board members. There have been some good questions asked and limited good information available. With this in mind, we want to share answers and provide information about teacher salary negotiations and our financial position.

Here are answers to questions posed to the board or emailed to us: https://goo.gl/jXYppN",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1939791412742021&id=385750108146167,"DOCS.GOOGLE.COM

About Negotiations, Financial Issues and staffing

Do teachers deserve more pay? Absolutely. Naches Valley School District prides itself on the quality of its teachers. Nothing makes a bigger difference for students than providing them with world-class teachers. While our salaries are not the highest in the region, we have worked hard over the years to 'keep pace'. With the new inequitable funding formula from the state and each district negotiating their own salary schedules, we are struggling to 'keep pace' with districts in the state. This will affect our teachers now and may in the future, affect our families and students.
We understand this is a very stressful time for our staff, community and board members. There have been some good questions asked and limited good information available. With this in mind, we want to share answers and provide information about teacher salary negotiations and our financial position.

Here are answers to questions posed to the board or emailed to us: https://goo.gl/jXYppN

Do you want to improve success at school, in your job and in your life? What about improving success for your children at school? It turns out that there's a very simple nightly ritual that some of the world's most successful people employ. And best of all, it's completely free.

According to an article from Ladders, media magnate Oprah Winfrey, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, and others all count their blessings before fading off to sleep every night.

The most successful people, like Winfrey and Sandberg, keep a gratitude journal. Rather than thinking about what went wrong in a day, they think about what went right and what they're thankful for each night before going to bed. A 2011 study from Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being showed that students who took 15 minutes at night to write a gratitude journal slept better and longer. Improved sleep has been proven many times over to improve performance, especially academic performance.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1606847386036427&id=385750108146167,,0.0,"Improve Success by Spurring One Simple Habit

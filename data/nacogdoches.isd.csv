This will be a “living document” and will be updated routinely as we move closer to the start of classes.
Parents of students enrolled in NISD want accurate and timely information. We agree and want to share information with them. Part of the reluctance to provide plans is related to rapidly changing guidance received from state officials. Please understand that the plans and Frequently Asked Questions highlighted in the document will likely change, perhaps numerous times, before the start of school.

Three members of the Nacogdoches ISD Board of Trustees were sworn into office during a special meeting held Thursday, May 7. The meeting took place via Zoom, an online meeting app, because of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.

Board members sworn into office included James Montoya, the incumbent District III trustee; Farshid Niroumand, incumbent at-large trustee; and Leabeth Abt, the newly elected trustee representing District II. Abt was unopposed on the ballot and replaced G.W. Neal, who chose not to seek re-election.

Trustees also re-organized the board during Thursday’s meeting.

Have you and your household been counted in the 2020 Census yet?

Census results shape the future of communities, as census data informs how billions of dollars in federal funds are distributed for health clinics, school lunch programs, disaster recovery initiatives, and other critical programs and services for the next 10 years.

So it wasn’t the free lunch turnout we were expecting at our E State Blvd location today, only 32/75 free meals today were taken advantage of by those children & families in need. Don’t worry though, we didn’t put any to waste & decided it was best to take the 43 extra meals the The Rescue Mission!

We realize life isn’t all about work and selling vehicles at Preferred Auto. Now is the time our community needs to come together stronger than ever! Together through love, support, and positivity all our small local businesses will get through these strange times together! #PreferredToBePositive

We are still set for tomorrow at noon for a FREE LUNCH at our E State Blvd location! Hope to see more of you tomorrow 😄

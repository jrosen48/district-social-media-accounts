The joy on the faces of the kids at Nadaburg Elementary School today said it all. Our AFMA Firefighters Charities and the generous donations from all of our communities made this possible. Everyone came together and brightened the season for over 400 children today. Thank you! Happy Holidays! Special thank you to Native Air 20 and Nadaburg Elementary School. #afmafirefighterscharities #azfiremedical",2018-12-20 07:47:01,https://video-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/49156439_1860569437374320_4764553078542172160_n.mp4?_nc_cat=107&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6InN2ZV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=4RYbnIL87YQAX-j6HEO&_nc_ht=video-atl3-1.xx&oh=075e153d22195fbea51870a1c0854e0e&oe=5F5EA6AC,

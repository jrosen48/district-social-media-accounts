Shoe Drive 2020 We had a great time dropping off all of the shoes and supplies we collected for the Shoe Drive. The total amount of shoes we were able to give to the Nampa School District came out to... 351! 🎉 Our best year yet! Thank you to everyone at the Nampa Association of Realtors who continue to support us each year. And a BIG thank you to each and every one of you who donated shoes, socks, tissues, dish soap, laundry soap, ziploc bags and even some snacks. You are truly making a difference in our community especially in these unprecedented times. We are humbled by your generosity and can't wait until next year!

It's Operation Safe Driver Week! Remind young drivers and student drivers to minimize distractions and stay safe on the road! Also, remind young drivers of the three key safety challenges that large trucks and buses face:

1. Longer Stopping Distances

Trucks and buses need more stopping time and distance than smaller vehicles, and stopping distance increases with heavier loads or challenging road conditions.

2. Huge Blind Spots

Commercial motor vehicles have large blind spots around all four sides, so it’s important to take extra care when passing or being passed by large trucks and buses.

3. Wider Turning Radius

Trucks and buses don’t maneuver like cars and we need to give them extra space to turn.

Meet Riley Brown, Nampa High 2016 Graduate. He was part of the last Class for me as the NHS SRO. Riley played basketball and baseball for the Bulldogs. Though he was not one of my DARE students I remember umpiring his games from Little League.

Riley just graduated from Boise State last month and this week started as the new Program Director at the Nampa Boys and Girls Club. He also coaches Basketball at Columbia High School with one of my other former NHS students Trevor Morris.

It was great to see Riley today and to know we will be work neighbors.

Keep up the good work Riley. Another example of a NHS Bulldog doing great things in our community.

This week, third graders across Idaho get to learn from the one and only Kiersten Rood from Endeavor Elementary in the Nampa School District during #ClassroomIdaho on Idaho Public Television! Be sure to tune in during the final week, or catch it on YouTube.

Kiersten Rood is a 4th grade teacher at Endeavor Elementary School in Nampa, Idaho. She graduated from Utah State University in Elementary Education with an English as a Second Language Endorsement. She taught 3rd grade in Las Vegas, Nevada for two years before moving to Boise, Idaho and joining the Endeavor team. She has since taught 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade. Her favorite things to do outside of teaching are playing video games, going for walks, baking bread, and gardening.

Reagan third graders woke up to some great news. After working hard to raise money to build wells and send kids to school in Cambodia, they learned that the first well has already been installed and is ready to use!

Even with cutting the Water for a Well fundraiser short, our third graders raised enough money to build TWO wells and pay for an annual tuition fee for a local village child.

The Khatt family's daily income is $1-$2. Before CCDO provided the family their own water well, they used to get water from their neighbors well. To fetch the water, they had to walk between 10-20 minutes.

It puts our current struggles into perspective. We are so proud of these kids, their hearts, their ability to empathize, and their desire to serve!

Today in 5th grade we are kicking off our space unit!! Students came into the LC wearing NASA all access badges, they went on a Google Expedition to the Moon, they crawled into StarLab and experienced constellations throughout our galaxy, and lastly they worked with AR (Augmented Reality) using a Merge Cube to gain more knowledge about our planets!
Don’t worry...we aren’t leaving the other grades out! Grades 3 and 4 will also get to experience StarLab throughout the week so be sure to ask your child how they liked it!

“What should I read next?” Is a big question the kids ask in the LC! So we created different sections of books based on popular check-outs, for “If you liked this, then you should read this next”! We’ve also started doing Book Reviews by older students to help others pick amazing reads! It’s always fun to curl up with a good book when it’s so cold outside!

Our study of STEM careers continues this week in first grade! Thank you Dr Hansra-Godfrey for speaking to students about what your job as a pulmonologist entails! Kids got to place lung stickers on their chest, listen to their breathing with a stethoscope, and view healthy vs diseased lungs. Lots of amazing information!!

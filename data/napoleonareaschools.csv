While this just happened, this action is something that we have expected and have been planning for. You will receive more directions on what education will look like for your child in the next few days as this specific information will be coming from your child‚Äôs building administration and staff. I have been amazed at how the Napoleon family has stepped up together in these difficult times and I fully expect we will do this again in the upcoming weeks. Your cooperation and engagement in your child‚Äôs education is greatly appreciated. Stay Safe. Stay Healthy and Stay Engaged.

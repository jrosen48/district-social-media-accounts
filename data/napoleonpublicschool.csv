First ever State FFA LDE (leadership development events) were held yesterday at the state Capitol and ND heritage center. Events included were parliamentary procedure, creed speaking, Extemp. Speaking, prepared public speaking, demonstration, and employment skills/job interview. These members and/or teams were already the cream of the crop, as only the top two from each of the 8 districts are eligible to participate. So proud of our members who had an amazing day, results were as follows:

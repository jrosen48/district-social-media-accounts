As most of you know, Football has been suspended this Fall. This suspension could impact the start and end dates for other sports, and other seasons. As of yesterday, those dates have not been set.

At this time, all other Fall sports are scheduled to continue as planned. We should get information from the MHSAA this week on when indoor activities may resume. That update should also provide more clarity on what sports will look like in 20-21. After we have that information, we will share it with the community.

Please make sure you are in contact with varsity coaches, and keep an eye out for any information they share regarding specific program details.

Senior Awards/Certificates, National Honor Society stoles, & honor cords may be picked up from the HS office this week between 9AM-2PM for those that would like them now. Please remember the NHS stoles must be returned as they are expensive. As always, diplomas will be held until they are returned.
Those that do not want to pick those items up this week, they will be distributed prior to whatever Graduation ceremony our committee determines. This is just an option.

Thank you.",2020-06-08 11:08:13,,

Over the break, during regularly scheduled cleaning, a disc floor polisher damaged one of the units causing the sensor to initiate. At that time, that particular box in a restroom was manually turned off. Before the unit could be repaired, someone inadvertently turned that unit back on at some point. It may have been bumped with regular traffic causing the system sensor to initiate lockdown.

That box has been manually turned off and is slated for repair services soon.

We apologize for the concern this may have caused anyone. Our staff and students did a fantastic job of going into lockdown and being patient as the situation was dealt with. Again, everyone was safe and there was no emergency situation.

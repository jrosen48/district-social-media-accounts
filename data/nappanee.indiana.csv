July 14 at 1:36 PM ¬∑

It is with a heavy heart that the Nappanee Apple Festival Core Committee announces that the 2020 festival will be canceled due to health concerns surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Nappanee Apple Festival Core Committee, in partnership with the City of Nappanee, feels this decision is in the best interest of our sponsorship partners, vendors, volunteers, visitors‚Äô health and safety. After months of brainstorming, we concluded that the safest option was to cancel this year‚Äôs festival. The well being and safety of our community is the Apple Festival Committee‚Äôs top priority.

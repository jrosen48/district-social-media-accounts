Practice tonight 6-8! Around the last 10 min we will be wrapping up and handing out ribbons from the meet this past Sunday if you would like to come in and watch.

This Thursday is Youth Wrestling Night for the High School! We won't be practicing but we are invited to come cheer on the High School team and the kids will have their name called out on the mat. Have them wear their singlets and wrestling shoes. Kids are free to attend but adults will have to pay. Please attend if you are able and let me know for sure by so I can have a roster of names. This won't be like a typical drop off practice, if your child is coming they will need a parent or guardian to sit with them while watching the meet. Thanks everyone!",0.0,"Blazer Youth Wrestling

Very good first wrestling meet for us today! Alot of tough competition and we held our own for sure. The hard work being put fourth by the kids definitely was shown.

We had 35 wins and 21 losses as a whole. 9 first place finishes ( awesome considering we only had 19 kids wrestling) , 3 second place finishes, 4 third place finishes, and 3 fourth place finishes.

Proud of all the wrestler's in our club and if they didn't do so well, tell them to keep their heads up, we do pay attention to what they need improvement on and will begin working on it. That being said this week's 1st place finishers are: Jeffrey Ricketts Jr, Mason Cordle, Andrew Hamm, Dylan Smith, Grady Ott, Henry Toschlog, Grayson Reynolds, Zack Creager, and Tyler Hoover!

I would like to challenge all the high school football players and coaches to come out Saturday at Tri-Village to watch the Pee-Wee football players in action. These boys sit in the stands (sometimes driving me crazy) supporting you on Friday nights!! We cannot continue to build high school football team without these kids continuing to play and if we don't support each other then they likely won't. We have to get them excited that the high school coaches and players are watching them and foster that difficult decision from 8th grade to high school whether they will play or not.

BLAZER PRIDE!!

The Varsity Blazer Youth Football team finished the regular season undefeated at 6-0!! These boys play with determination, passion, confidence and heart like I've never seen. I can't say enough about the boys and their drive to do their best and get better every day! It shows on the scoreboard!

Once again, we're counting off those points! The Blazers gave the Tri-Village Patriots a good old fashioned 46-20 beat down!

I also want to give a shout out to the JV team who plays with just as much passion and conviction as the Varsity boys. They finished their regular season at 5-1 today against a team that, without going into details, had an unfair advantage. Hold your heads high boys and let's get ready for the play-offs!

We (both JV and Varsity teams) return next Saturday to the Patriots' field again for the first play-off game. Come on out and support these boys as they will be sure to put on a show you won't forget! JV at 2 pm and Varsity at 4 pm.",0.0,"CONGRATULATIONS BLAZER YFL! GOOD LUCK IN THE POSTSEASON!

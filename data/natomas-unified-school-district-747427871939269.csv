In facing these unprecedented times, Natomas Unified School District CSEA Chapter 745 leaders and District leadership came together in the span of about 12-15 hours, and were able to come to two MOU agreements. The first provides classified Nutrition Service workers with time and a half for their efforts during this closure. We are so grateful they are continuing to feed our students! The second MOU provides time and half-hourly wages where appropriate and provides the framework for re-opening schools through distance learning as soon as possible.

We are appreciative that district leadership and CSEA labor partners are able to have honest conversations, take care of our employees, and to keep moving the district closer to a temporary model of distance learning. This collaboration is a model for how labor/management partnerships work.

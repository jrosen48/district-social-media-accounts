The Pandemic Debit Card (P-EBT) is a program by the CT Department of Social Services, not the town or the school system. They tell us that if students do not attend our schools but receive SNAP, participate in HUSKY A, or are eligible for free lunch in another school, they will also receive the P-EBT benefit. The program is designed to help address food insecurity issues during the current COVID crisis.

Our Early Childhood Center at Central Ave School program would like to ask each family to put a stuffed animal or drawing/picture of a bear in their window or door so when families go for a walk the kids can go on a “Bear Hunt.”

This idea is based on the beloved children’s book ""We are going on a Bear Hunt"" by Michael Rosen and Helen Oxenbury. It’s also a song we love to sing with our students at school. Share the idea with others so they can start this in their neighborhood too!!

If you are participating, please post a photo of your bear in the comments, or your street address, if you're comfortable with that so the kids know where to look!

Last year, 7th-grade science students studied the effects of energy drinks on adolescents, then presented their findings to State Rep. Liz Linehan. She was so impressed with their work that she drafted a bill with students' input. The students testified on behalf of their bill and lobbied legislators, but it got stuck in committee last year. This year, the bill was brought back up and a new crop of 7th graders had the chance to testify on their research before the state Committee on Children this week.

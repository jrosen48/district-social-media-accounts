There are numerous reports that, in an effort to avoid adult detection, the ""Momo Challenge"" appears in the middle of child programs in social media and video games, such as Facebook, Kids YouTube, WhatsApp, Peppa Pig, Fortnight, and Minecraft encouraging children to commit dangerous and potentially violent acts.

Momo is a ghoulish-looking avatar that has threatened and cyberbullied children across the world. If children refuse to do the ""challenge"", Momo threatens to leak personal information, leaves disturbing messages, and sends violent images to the child.

Some of the information above may not be accurate, or it may be exaggerated, but I want parents to be aware of the possibility, so that you can protect your children.

The Surgeon General of the United States has published an important
message about teenage use of electronic cigarettes. In an effort to discourage students from engaging in an unhealthy and potentially dangerous practice, we have elevated the consequence for using, giving, possessing or selling e-cigarettes. A student who engages in this activity at school or at a school related activity, may be placed
in the Disciplinary Alternative School. (See the Student Code of Conduct
on the campus website). The most common device, and the easiest to hide,
is the JUUL. Parents, please be aware that many young people are engaging
in ""Juuling,"" believing that it is relatively harmless.

KNOW THE RISKS. TAKE ACTION. PROTECT OUR KIDS.

You Can Take Action
We must take aggressive steps to protect our children from these highly potent products that risk exposing a new generation of young people to nicotine. The bad news is that e-cigarette use has become an epidemic among our nation’s young people. However, the good news is that we know what works to effectively protect our kids from all forms of tobacco product use, including e-cigarettes. We must now apply these strategies to e-cigarettes, including USB flash drive shaped products such as JUUL. To achieve success, we must work together, aligning and coordinating efforts across both old and new partners at the national, state, and local levels. Everyone can play an important role in protecting our nation’s young people from the risks of e-cigarettes.

At the beginning of November 455 FFA members across the state of Texas competed at their respective District level contests. Mid-November the top 2 from each District competed in their respective Area level contests. Yesterday the top 2 from each of Texas FFA’s 12 Areas competed in the Preliminary Round of the Texas FFA State Contest. Today the top 10 from the preliminary round competed in the Finals Round of the Texas FFA State Contest.

In FFA our levels of competition are broken up by geographical location, not school size. Which means our Navarro FFA students compete against schools that range from the smallest 1A to the largest 6A.

And, after all was said and done for this year’s round of Leadership Development Events (LDEs), Aschlen finished 8th out of the Top 10 FFA Job Interview contestants in Texas!!!

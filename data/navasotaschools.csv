Navasota High School and Navasota ISD would like to announce that, unless prohibited by further developments in the COVID-19 pandemic, we have rescheduled the May 29th graduation ceremony to July 24, 2020, at 8:00 p.m. at Rattler Stadium. It is our hope that we are able to come together to celebrate the accomplishments of the class of 2020 with a traditional graduation ceremony if at all possible. If the pandemic restrictions are not lifted by that time, then we will plan for a non-traditional celebration to do what we can to make it special for our graduating Seniors and their families.

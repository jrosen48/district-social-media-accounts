The boys, who have been fundraising for months, had a date with an electric razor earlier in the month. When the event was cancelled due to COVID-19, the team decided to fulfill their commitment and participated in virtual shaves. One of these virtual events took place on Saturday and can be viewed at

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeKCvMq-IhU

Team members includes Shabonee students Thomas R., Jacob C., Isaac M., Caleb K., Simon F., Jack I., Brody M., Paul S., Tyler K., Lucas P., and Ryan P.

With all of the impacts of COVID 19 this year on health, activities and the economy St. Baldrick's fundraising in 2020 is down about 33%. Through the efforts of the Shabonee Shavers, however, the Wheeling Firefighter event they were scheduled to participate in will raise about the same amount as last year.

Carl Wilkens, a humanitarian aid worker who was the only American to remain in Rwanda during the genocide of 1994, brought his personal story to Wood Oaks Jr. High on Tuesday.

He spoke to the eighth graders who had watched his 40-minute documentary, ""I’m Not Leaving"", as part of the social studies curriculum.

During his presentation, the students asked questions about his work saving hundreds of lives in Rwanda, his interaction with leaders, and his feelings upon his return to the U.S. He shared photos right from his phone and weaved lessons in forgiveness, empathy, and the value of vulnerability into the stories he told.

He also urged the students to stop one thing thinking. “When we define people by one thing, we are making that thing stronger and diminishing all other qualities,” Wilkens said.

A small group of students had the opportunity to talk in depth with Wilkens over lunch.

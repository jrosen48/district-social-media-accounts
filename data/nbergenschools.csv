The North Bergen School District held 8th grade graduation ceremonies yesterday at Bruins Stadium. These unique ceremonies mirrored the North Bergen High School graduations, by having each student walk in and sit with their parents and be at least 6 feet away from their fellow classmates and their families.

I thought it was crucial to hold an in-person ceremony for our graduating classes. Our children deserved a proper recognition for excelling during very difficult circumstances and what better way to celebrate with their classmates and parents in person. I congratulate each and everyone of them for a truly remarkable job.",3.0,"This was an extremely difficult school year for our students, especially our seniors and 8th graders.

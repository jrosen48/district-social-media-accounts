Our boys team placed 5th in the state in 2018 and missed 4th by two points. Our team won a district championship in 2018 and we were the runner up in 2017.

I played basketball through high school and college at the Division II level. I have coached at every level from middle school to varsity. Most recently I have been coaching through my business where I have worked with many local athletes helping to develop their basketball skills.

Based on the latest guidance from Governor Reynolds, we have made the following decisions regarding April/May events that had been postponed until June.

Regarding Prom - due to the continued limits on group size and social distancing requirements, we have made the difficult decision to cancel Prom. We had high hopes that by postponing until late June we would be able to host this event. Unfortunately, the concerns about COVID-19 have continued longer than originally expected. I know this is a big disappointment to students, but I hope everyone can understand this decision was made in the best interest of everyone's health and safety.

Regarding Graduation - we will hold the ceremony on June 28 @ 2:00 p.m. in the school gymnasium. We will be following all the safety guidelines including 50% capacity, limits on family group size, and 6 feet social distancing between groups.

Over the past month, our team completed our annual Shoot-a-thon. Each player was tasked with shooting 100 free throws and family/businesses pledged money per shots made. We use this money to help support our team with new equipment, new clothing, travel/entry accommodations for summer leagues, & for the opportunity to travel to an Iowa Hawkeyes basketball game.

Our team did a fantastic job fundraising as we raised $2,377.25!!! We want to thank all the families and businesses for their contributions and time to help support our program! Thank you all so much!!!

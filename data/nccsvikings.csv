After many years of service to the city of North Canton,

In the 1960s, North Canton doubled in size and was
considered the best place in the county to live. Murray and
Elaine Revoldt moved the family from Perry Township to
North Canton in 1964 as Daryl was entering the 8th grade.
He began his relationship with North Canton at the old
Middle School on Charlotte. He remembers many of his
teachers ‚Äì Mr. Stoica, Mrs. Kidder, Mr. Martz, Mr. Viscounte,

Miss Young will teach you how to make Homemade Playdoh.

Recipe:
Put 3/4 cup of water into a bowl with 4 drops of your favorite food coloring and 1/2 tablespoon of oil. In a separate bowl put 1 cup of flour and 1/2 a cup of salt. Mix together. Pour the bowl with flour and salt into the bowl with water, food coloring and oil. Mix super well. Then, put a little flour onto a board (to make sure the Playdoh does not stick to the board). Pour the Playdoh onto the board and kneed until the Playdoh is no longer sticky. Add more flour if it is too sticky and add more water if too dry.

Calling all Crafters:
The owner of North Canton‚Äôs own Poggio Amorelli Bed and Breakfast is a former NICU nurse, and she has consulted with the appropriate people at Mercy and Aultman about fabric masks. Both facilities are willing to accept fabric mask donations.

Any masks you make can be dropped off at Poggio Amorelli in the bin at the north door near the bed and breakfast sign.

It is recommended that you follow these instructions (from a hospital in Indiana). EDITED TO ADD: We are hearing elastic can be difficult to find. Alternatively, fabric strings that tie behind the wearer's head can be made and will work just as well.

North Canton Cares Pantry
March 13 at 9:15 PM ¬∑

North Canton Cares Pantry will be partnering with the Akron Canton Regional Foodbank providing emergency boxes of food weekly for families struggling with food costs during the time that students will be out of school. We will offer these emergency boxes next week and will have our regularly scheduled pantry the following week. During this time, receiving pantry food will be as easy as driving through the Summit Church parking lot (1300 Pittsburg Ave. NW).
There will be no need to get out of your vehicle. We will be careful to pack the boxes with items specific to a family's needs and load your vehicle for you. We want you to be able to get in, out and on your way home as quickly as possible.
As soon as the date and times are available we will post them on our Pantry Facebook Page as well as the Summit Church's Facebook Page. Please stay tuned!",2020-03-16 10:23:19,,

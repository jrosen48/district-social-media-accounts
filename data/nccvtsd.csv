To see test site locations and dates, visit: https://www.nccde.org/2011/COVID-19-Resources

The tests are free, easy, open to the public, and painless. You do not have to register ahead, but if you do it will cut down on the time spent in line. The tests are self-administered oral swabs, provided by Curative. Participants swab the inside of their mouth, drop the swab into the tube, and drop off the package on their way out of the parking lot. The whole process takes less than 10 minutes, and even less if subjects are pre-registered. Participants do not need to have symptoms to receive the test. Test results are expected back to participants in 24-48 hours via email.

To see test site locations and dates, visit: https://www.nccde.org/2011/COVID-19-Resources

The tests are free, easy, open to the public, and painless. You do not have to register ahead, but if you do it will cut down on the time spent in line. The tests are self-administered oral swabs, provided by Curative. Participants swab the inside of their mouth, drop the swab into the tube, and drop off the package on their way out of the parking lot. The whole process takes less than 10 minutes, and even less if subjects are pre-registered. Participants do not need to have symptoms to receive the test. Test results are expected back to participants in 24-48 hours via email.

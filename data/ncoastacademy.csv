Hello parents!

I wanted to let you know that I am finally able to hold the weekday web ""meetings"" starting next week, and that my web link is up and running. I am keeping it fun, light, and social. You can find the link
HERE
and students can get all that they need once they get there. Please share this with all Northcoast families if you'd like. I'd love to see the students again!

Also, please know that while this is a scary time, the thing that the kids are missing most is the routine and predictability that they get in school. It's all about balance and moderation and their mental health is more important at this time than academics. Please help us help them by constructing a schedule and do your best to hold them to it. This will help all of you! (sample above).

Thank you, and please have your kids write me an email to say hello - link in the Padlet site above - so that I can see that they got this!

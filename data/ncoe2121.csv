In this week's conversation we sat down with Calistoga Junior-Senior High college and career counselor, Carla Surber to explore how she is supporting students with making decisions around their post-secondary plans. In the wake of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, students’ lives have been turned upside down. They are increasingly concerned about their futures and are considering alternative education paths that can provide them with the training and support they need to expedite their entry into the workforce or to give them a leg up as they pursue college.

Session Description
Recent years have seen an explosion of scientific evidence showing that there is a different way to learn, lead and live. When people take a limitless approach to learning, different pathways open up. Mindset messages are important but they do not take root unless they are accompanied by a different approach to content and life. In this session we will consider what this different approach is. We will think together about ways to learn, lead and live without barriers.

Sheriff David W. Hill is excited to announce the expansion of his partnership with Nelson County Public Schools with the addition of two School Resource Officers (SRO). As of April 8, 2019, Tye River and Rockfish River Elementary will have some new faces in the buildings to provide for the safety and security of students and faculty.

This initiative would not have been possible without the foresight and support of the Nelson County Board of Supervisors and the backing of our citizens. Though the search for SRO’s has taken some time, it was the intent to find experienced individuals that will provide a good fit for the school environment and help serve as mentors for the county’s youth. While their primary mission will be safety and security, Sheriff Hill is seeking to cultivate positive relationships with the students and ultimately benefit the Nelson County community as a whole.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1870696659701330&id=107595186011495,,0.0,"WELCOME ABOARD!!!

Sheriff David W. Hill is excited to announce the expansion of his partnership with Nelson County Public Schools with the addition of two School Resource Officers (SRO). As of April 8, 2019, Tye River and Rockfish River Elementary will have some new faces in the buildings to provide for the safety and security of students and faculty.

This initiative would not have been possible without the foresight and support of the Nelson County Board of Supervisors and the backing of our citizens. Though the search for SRO’s has taken some time, it was the intent to find experienced individuals that will provide a good fit for the school environment and help serve as mentors for the county’s youth. While their primary mission will be safety and security, Sheriff Hill is seeking to cultivate positive relationships with the students and ultimately benefit the Nelson County community as a whole.",2019-04-07 19:21:55,,

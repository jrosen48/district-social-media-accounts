After careful consideration, the Board of Education and Administration made a change to the yellow phase of the Re-Entry Plan. As we have shared before, COVID-19 is a fluid situation, and we will need to make changes throughout the school year.

Here are the changes.

Bus:
All students will be required to wear masks on the bus.

As recommended by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education and State Health Officials, we are strongly encouraging parents to drive their students to school.

On campus:
All staff and students are strongly encouraged to wear masks on campus.

We are also aware that St. Francois County is discussing a mask mandate. If this were to go into place, the ordinance would require school districts to participate.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2697375227184851&id=1645578822364502,,0.0,"Hello

These numbers signify that Kenslee Brandon was entering 9th grade this year and Bobby Donathan was entering 7th grade. We will keep the lights on for 26 minutes as Kenslee was 14 years old and Bobby was 12 years old.

Parents,
We are in the height of cold/flu season. Please remember to keep your child home from school if they are sick. They should not return to school until they are fever free without the use of medication for 24 hours. Also, if your child is vomiting or has diarrhea, he/she should not be at school. Flu symptoms are another reason to keep your child home. These symptoms include fever, chills, cough, sore throat, headache and muscle aches.

Please remind your child that the best way to prevent the spread of illness/germs is:
🧼🚰 Handwashing (warm water and soap)
🧴Use of hand sanitizer when unable to wash hands
🤧 Covering cough/sneeze with either a tissue or into their arm (at the bend of the elbow)
😷 Avoid close contact with people who are sick",0.0,"Newcomerstown West Elementary School

School attendance is of the upmost importance, but keeping students healthy and engaged in learning is equally as important. In order to do this we are asking for your help:

1. If your child is sick, please keep them home. Do not try and send them back to school when they are ill, fevered or clearly sick. This includes extracurricular activities.
2. If your child is fevered, please do not send them back to school until they are fever free for 24 hours without the use of over-the-counter medications.
3. Please talk to your child about the importance of hand washing and cough/sneeze etiquette (coughing into their arms instead of their hand or not covering at all).

Thank you to River View High School and Mr. Rinkes for allowing 24 of our students the opportunity to spend the day with your students. NHS students were paired with a student from River View and got to go through their day with them. NHS students got to see the different clubs that are offered at RVHS, and most importantly they were able to make connections with several students at RVHS.

RVHS will be sending the same 24 students to NHS in January and they will get to spend time in our building making connections with students and getting a different High School experience!

What a great experience for students from both schools!

""I am one of the original NEAAAT students that helped found the school, year one.I am an Eagle Scout, and I am graduating COA with an Associate's Degree in Science in two weeks, but graduation isn't until July because of the pandemic. I have been accepted to Virginia Wesleyan University as a Merit Scholarship recipient, as of today, and plan to graduate with my BS in Earth and Environmental Science/Biology and certify to teach middle grades and high school science. I plan to be the first graduate of NEAAAT to return to NEAAAT and carry on the traditions of PBL and Pi Day that we established since the beginning. I hope to return to mentor the FRC team and support the program I have been part of these past 2 1/2 years.

Friends and family,

While dealing with loss is always challenging, it is especially difficult to do so during a time in which we cannot be together. With this in mind, please tune in to Dixie 105.7 this Saturday, April 4th at 10:30 AM. A special tribute is going to be paid to Damari. Let's all blast the song and sing along to remember his amazingness, and let he and his family know how loved they are during this time. I plan to be parked in my car (somewhere downtown) with my windows down and singing along. I hope you will join me to line the streets of the city that he loved to ride around to pay him tribute. Please comment below if you can tune in and ""share"" to spread the word.

It is with great pleasure that we share plans to celebrate the Class of 2020 through a virtual graduation ceremony to be held on June 6, 2020, beginning at 10:00 AM at Lake Bonin.

As a result of Covid-19 and restrictions placed upon us. Our graduation ceremony is limited to only those family members who have a parking pass. For those of you who are not able to attend this year's ceremony. We are providing a live-stream option.

If you are a Beaver Valley Cable customer, you will be able to watch the live-stream on Channel 6.

Even though we have tested it out, there are variables that are out of our control that might prevent a successful live-stream. Our hope is that if the live-stream is unsuccessful that a recording of the graduation will be provided.

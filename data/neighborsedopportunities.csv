Loie-Palooza
July 1, 2019 at 7:55 AM ·

These two people - Walt and Lois Reiner. Fifty years ago they set out to make Valpo a more welcoming place. And with the help of family, friends and colleagues they have transformed our community in ways that might have seemed unimaginable back then.

Help us celebrate their vision, Loie's 90th and 50 years of building a better community through the great work of Project Neighbors.

July 13, 5-10pm. Central Park Plaza, Valparaiso.

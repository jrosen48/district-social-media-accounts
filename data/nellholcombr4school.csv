Today after 5 long months, we welcomed our students and staff back to Nell Holcomb. The morning was filled with some nervous anticipation as most first days of school are. However, the students were welcomed back by some super excited and smiling teachers and staff members. We have been preparing for August 24th for weeks and now that this day is almost over, it is nice to take a few moments to reflect on what this daily truly meant for our students and the Nell Holcomb Community. Day 1 is in the books and was a huge success. There is no doubt that the 2020-2021 school year will have bumps and turns along the road. However, I am confident that with our team, anything is possible! I am so proud of our teachers and staff and the hard work they have put in to make Day One a great one!

NHS families, hope everyone is safe and well ! It’s been a weird couple of weeks to say the least. I’m sure the gamers are having the time of their life ! But as I sometimes tell the students, “Life is not a video game, if you don’t get out there you’re going to miss out”. Besides the homework packets I hope the kids are staying busy and active. I sent a few things home for fitness and there’s ton of ideas online. For the b ballers you can always work on your ball handling and dribbling in the garage or if you have a driveway/carport. Shooting baskets can get boring quickly so get creative. Shoot from different spots, work on shooting off your dribble, use a dribble move then shoot. Work on your free throws !!! Use your imagination and pretend you are playing another person or team and create a game within your shooting practice.
Go on a hike, walk the dog, find a short work out video....wear those helmets and protective gear when on your dirt bike or four wheeler knuckle heads !! Hope to see the kids soon ! Stay safe, stay awesome.

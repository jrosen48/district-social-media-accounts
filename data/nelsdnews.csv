January 19 at 10:05 PM ¬∑

Tuesday January 14, 2020, the Exchange Club of Springfield welcomed the first four of twelve high school Students of the Month.

Those proudly representing their schools were, from Global Impact STEM Academy, Isaiah Stickley, from Greenon, Makenna Young, from Northeastern, Caitlin Haack, and from Northwestern, Hannah Swenson. All Exchangites who attended were amazed at the extent of their involvement with the community and school activities!

The students each received a stipend of $100 as Youth of the Month, and have promised to participate in the essay contest and the chance to earn Youth of the Year honors and the $1,000 scholarship for First place. Additional scholarships are in the amount of $500 for Second, and $250 for placing Third, and will also be awarded at the annual Youth of the Year Banquet on March 24, 2020 at the Wittenberg University Benham-Pence Student Center.

We are also hoping for an A.C.E. Award candidate, who will also receive a $ 1,000 college scholarship.

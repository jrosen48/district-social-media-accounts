from The Biography of Harriet Beecher Stowe
by Charles Edward Stowe:

Catherine was the oldest child of Lyman Beecher and Roxanna Foote, his wife.
In a little battered journal found among her papers is a short sketch of her life. It
was written when she was seventy-six years of age. In a shaking hand she begins:
""I was born at East Hampton, L. I., September 5, 1800, at 5 P.M., in the large
parlor opposite father's study. Don't remember much about it myself."" The
sparkle of wit in this brief notice of the circumstances of her birth is very
characteristic. All through her life, little ripples of fun were continually playing
on the surface of that current of intense thought and feeling in which her deep,
earnest nature flowed.

The United States Department of Education has informed us that all student breakfasts and lunches will be provided free of charge from September 1 through December 31. In the coming days, those students who were charged for breakfast and/or lunch on September 1 or 2 will have their meal account credited. Please remember that a la carte items, like extra milk, will still be charged to the student's meal account.

Dear Parents and Community Members:

I hope this message finds you and your families safe and well. Today, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker announced that remote learning in Illinois will be extended through April 30 in order to slow down the spread of COVID-19.

During this time, on-site learning will remain suspended but our schools’ commitment to learning and education will remain open and learning will continue for all students - just through a different format.

While it is not ideal, we want to assure you that at Neoga CUSD #3, our teachers and staff are fully engaged and willing to take on this new challenge and push forward with remote learning, engaging with students and continuing with our food distribution program.

I know this is not the school year that any of us imagined, but I want to thank you for your patience and understanding as we have dealt with this unprecedented situation together.

It’s important we continue to work together and support our students. Thanks again.

Sincerely,

Bill Fritcher",0.0,"Neoga CUSD #3

I hope this message finds you and your families safe and well. Today, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker announced that remote learning in Illinois will be extended through April 30 in order to slow down the spread of COVID-19.

During this time, on-site learning will remain suspended but our schools’ commitment to learning and education will remain open and learning will continue for all students - just through a different format.

While it is not ideal, we want to assure you that at Neoga CUSD #3, our teachers and staff are fully engaged and willing to take on this new challenge and push forward with remote learning, engaging with students and continuing with our food distribution program.

I know this is not the school year that any of us imagined, but I want to thank you for your patience and understanding as we have dealt with this unprecedented situation together.

It’s important we continue to work together and support our students. Thanks again.

Sincerely,

Bill Fritcher",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1639444272861004&id=560005054138270,,0.0,"Dear Parents and Community Members:

Hey, Neoga students. We miss you. So, we are going to have a parade on Monday, March 30 through the streets of Neoga so you can wave to us and say hi. Unfortunately, you won’t be able to hug us or give a high-five. Remember, you can’t gather together in large groups.

We will be leaving the NES parking lot at 12:15 on March 30 and follow the path shown on this map. We will not be throwing out candy or stopping to visit, but we want to see you. Please feel free to line the streets while keeping social distancing recommendations in mind. Come out on your porches or stand in your yards to say hello. If you don’t live in town, have someone bring you to town and park on one of the wider streets in town, on the road east of Jennings Park, or the parking lot across from the American Legion.

There are over forty staff members signed up to participate. So step outside, so your teachers can see you and say hello.",3.0,"Get out of the house on Monday if you are able to wave to some familiar friends😁

Dear Parents and Community Members:

I hope this message finds you and your families safe and well. Today, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker announced that remote learning in Illinois will be extended through April 30 in order to slow down the spread of COVID-19.

During this time, on-site learning will remain suspended but our schools’ commitment to learning and education will remain open and learning will continue for all students - just through a different format.

While it is not ideal, we want to assure you that at Neoga CUSD #3, our teachers and staff are fully engaged and willing to take on this new challenge and push forward with remote learning, engaging with students and continuing with our food distribution program.

I know this is not the school year that any of us imagined, but I want to thank you for your patience and understanding as we have dealt with this unprecedented situation together.

It’s important we continue to work together and support our students. Thanks again.

Sincerely,

""I have a chance to build positive relationships with not only a single student, but their whole family as I often have brothers, sisters, and cousins. I see their parents and grandparents at the student drop off line each morning. I see students transition from elementary to jr. high and I am a familiar face as they make that jump. It creates a much clearer picture for me as a teacher that I can use to help understand where the students are coming from and help them where they are at. Teaching becomes much more individualized and for me it is more meaningful and impactful."" - Jordan Bear of Neoga School District, Central Illinois

Hello, this is Bill Fritcher, Superintendent of Neoga CUSD #3. Governor Pritzker announced today that schools will remain closed through April 7. This means that the tentative return to school date is April 8.

I want to take this opportunity to thank Angie Eden, Cheryl Croy, and Barb Weir along with a host of volunteers who have worked tirelessly to provide meals this week. We will continue to run the school meal program as it operated this week. Look for some changes to the delivery schedule beginning March 30. More information is forthcoming.

Please pay attention for more School Messenger calls from this number and, if possible, pay attention to the district’s social media accounts and the district’s website (use the E-Learning tab). Also, direct any questions regarding the school closure to covid19@neogacusd3.net. Students, we miss you and hope to see your smiling faces on April 8.

Remember, this is the time to make individual sacrifices for the good of the whole. We will get through this together.",0.0,"Neoga CUSD #3

As you likely already know, Governor Pritzker has canceled all schools in Illinois until Tuesday, March 31. So, beginning on Tuesday, March 17 there will be no students allowed in the school and all activities are canceled. At this time, the high school play and high school prom will be postponed to later dates.

The schools will be open on Monday, March 16 from 8:00-4:00 for students and parents to retrieve personal items and learning materials. You are strongly encouraged to take textbooks and learning materials home for students to use. School staff will report to work on Tuesday, March 17 to prepare learning activities for students. These learning activities will be delivered electronically and in paper format for those without adequate internet access. More information will be provided in later communication.

This is a rapidly evolving situation with information changing often. Please be prepared for more phone calls and social media posts as information becomes available.

We hope that you, as a member of the community, were able to come and take part in one (or all!) of those events! We also hope that perhaps you found yourself wondering how you could get involved in what NPP is doing, whether that means being a part of these existing programs or perhaps building up something new!

That’s why we’re going to be at the Villa on 45 at 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday, March 3, for an informal meeting at which you can come to ask questions and pitch ideas about how you can fit into our organization. We’re always looking for ways to grow, but we can’t do it without you!

Thank you Neoga Partnership for Progress (NPP) for continuing to involve us in the community. It was another great year for Sooeyfest!

Friends of Lake Mattoon took charge of the cornhole tournament and it was a great turnout for our first year. Congrats to Brad Westendorf for his first place finish and Mike Cook for second. Both guys walked away with a custom made bag set from Brighton Cabinetry in Neoga.

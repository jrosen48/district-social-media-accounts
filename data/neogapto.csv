After more than 30 years teaching in Neoga CUSD #3, Melinda White is calling it a career!

Mrs. White's family knows she has positively impacted the lives of countless third- and fourth-graders over the years (not to mention past and present colleagues) and how much of her time and energy she has dedicated to them over the years. That's why we wanted to provide them a space to tell her what she meant to them, especially since the current COVID-19 situation has made it difficult to plan any sort of formal open house celebration.

So feel free to share a note of congratulations here or perhaps a good memory from your time together, and also make sure to let us know if you need an address to send her a card or note ... we'll make sure she gets it and know she'd love to hear from you!",4.0,"Head on over to the virtual retirement party and leave a note for Mrs. White.

I hope this message finds you and your families safe and well. Today, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker announced that remote learning in Illinois will be extended through April 30 in order to slow down the spread of COVID-19.

During this time, on-site learning will remain suspended but our schools’ commitment to learning and education will remain open and learning will continue for all students - just through a different format.

While it is not ideal, we want to assure you that at Neoga CUSD #3, our teachers and staff are fully engaged and willing to take on this new challenge and push forward with remote learning, engaging with students and continuing with our food distribution program.

I know this is not the school year that any of us imagined, but I want to thank you for your patience and understanding as we have dealt with this unprecedented situation together.

It’s important we continue to work together and support our students. Thanks again.

Sincerely,

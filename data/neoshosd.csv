Dr. Roy Shaver, NSD superintendent at that time, has been so kind to me during my educational career. He recently reminded me of some significant events having anniversaries this month, so I dug into a binder of ‚Äúgoodies‚Äù he gave me some months back.

We've also broken ground for the relocation of the baseball field out at the athletic complex! The field will be located across from the existing softball field and will have a synthetic turf infield and outfield, allowing all weather play and a back up location for softball.

Anyone who did not fill out the original form but needs meals for age 18 and under Neosho residents, is welcome to attend a pick up time and location. There is no need to call ahead or fill out a form. We do ask that those wanting to pick up meals be as consistent as possible with their chosen pick up location. The consistency will help us prepare meal counts each day.

Additionally, for students who regularly receive bags from the Bright Futures Weekend Backpack Program - those bags will be delivered on Thursday this week instead of Friday.

We know that prom is one of many exciting end-of-year events, specifically for our seniors. We are hopeful that if there is interest from our seniors, we may be able to host a prom later in the year when the COVID-19 threat has subsided and large group gatherings are safe.

As we work on developing ways to honor the NHS Class of 2020 during this strange time, we value the thoughts, opinions, and ideas from our senior class and their families. Please see the attached survey for 2020 senior class families. Please only complete the survey if you have a senior attending Neosho High School.

Vaping was once believed to be a healthy alternative to smoking but has quickly become a nationwide epidemic due its dangerous chemicals and availability to teens.

Thank you Dr. McDonald and Freeman Neosho for helping us educate Neosho youth on the dangers of these products!

For NJH parents who would like to learn more about vaping, there will be an opportunity during parent-teacher conferences on October 28th!

(The good news is that Dr. McDonald brought a spare shirt! üòâ)

Due to flooding in the area, some adjustments will be made to afternoon transportation for the safety of students and drivers.

Students with pick up locations that are in or near low lying areas will need to be picked up from the bus at higher area locations. Please choose a location near your the normal stop that is safe and away from water. Drivers will be on the lookout for parents waiting at alternate intersections and parking lots.

If the drivers cannot get to the normal stop and no one arrives at an alternate location to pick up the student, they will be taken back to their school location to be picked up there.

We also please for your patience this afternoon as we will be re-routing along roads and highways where high water and debris are located.

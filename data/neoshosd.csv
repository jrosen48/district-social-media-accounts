Today is the 25th anniversary of the Neosho Middle School Dedication!

Dr. Roy Shaver, NSD superintendent at that time, has been so kind to me during my educational career. He recently reminded me of some significant events having anniversaries this month, so I dug into a binder of “goodies” he gave me some months back. In my treasure trove was the Middle School dedication program! Please enjoy, reminisce, and tell someone thank you for the work they did to make Neosho a great place to be. There will be another treat next week!

We have finished slabs at Field Early Childhood and Central Elementary! Next step, shelters! We are expecting both shelters to be completed by the end of September.

We've also broken ground for the relocation of the baseball field out at the athletic complex! The field will be located across from the existing softball field and will have a synthetic turf infield and outfield, allowing all weather play and a back up location for softball. The baseball field will share accommodations with the soccer and softball field and we will be repurposing the lights from the existing baseball field.

Anyone who did not fill out the original form but needs meals for age 18 and under Neosho residents, is welcome to attend a pick up time and location. There is no need to call ahead or fill out a form. We do ask that those wanting to pick up meals be as consistent as possible with their chosen pick up location. The consistency will help us prepare meal counts each day.

Additionally, for students who regularly receive bags from the Bright Futures Weekend Backpack Program - those bags will be delivered on Thursday this week instead of Friday.

We are hopeful that if there is interest from our seniors, we may be able to host a prom later in the year when the COVID-19 threat has subsided and large group gatherings are safe.

Thank you Dr. McDonald and Freeman Neosho for helping us educate Neosho youth on the dangers of these products!

For NJH parents who would like to learn more about vaping, there will be an opportunity during parent-teacher conferences on October 28th!

(The good news is that Dr. McDonald brought a spare shirt! 😉)

Vaping was once believed to be a healthy alternative to smoking but has quickly become a nationwide epidemic due its dangerous chemicals and availability to teens.

Thank you Dr. McDonald and Freeman Neosho for helping us educate Neosho youth on the dangers of these products!

Please check out the route descriptions so you are aware of any changes. If your students rode bus #11 or bus #28 last year, please make sure to check out the changes.

Goodman students: Busing will now be back at the Goodman campus for older students to now include MS, JH, and HS.

Due to increased safety concerns that arose along city streets in Goodman, all students living along and off of Janice and Garner areas or the Whitmore area will need to be picked up and dropped off at the Goodman campus. Thank you for understanding.

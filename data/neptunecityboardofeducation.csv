With school restarted now, we would like to announce a couple changes starting tomorrow 09/10/2020.

In an effort to improve the safety of our students and their parents walking to and from school, we have decided to add a new crossing post to the intersection of W. Sylvania Ave and Pond Road. While doing so we have also eliminated the crossing guard post at Highway 35 and 3rd Ave, as the intersection is controlled by a traffic light, has a pedestrian crossing sign, and has shown a considerable decrease of pedestrian traffic every year.

We wanted to take the time to also THANK our amazing Crossing Guards for their tireless efforts, no matter the weather, and their concerns for the safety of our children over the years.",0.0,"Thank you!!!!!!

I can’t wait to watch your gardens flourish over the summer and for the program to start up again in September!

The student from Asbury Park and Colts Neck came to Neptune City to help them transplant their plants into their garden and to celebrate the Woodrow Wilson School’s first garden! I am so proud of these students for all that they have accomplished and learned this year! I can’t wait to watch your gardens flourish over the summer and for the program to start up again in September! Thank you Sean from the Allaire Community Farm for all you do, without you this program would not be possible. Also a special thank you to Officer Mike Campanella for your dedication to this program and the Neptune City community. #monmouthcounty #allairecommunityfarm #asburypark #neptunecity #coltsneck",2019-06-04 17:51:08,,

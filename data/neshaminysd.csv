We may not be able to be together in person this summer, but we can still celebrate and create together.

We are also using our gala as a means of raising money to support our stock family members in need. We anticipate that there will be long lasting financial issues for many of our families due to the COVID-19 Pandemic and therefore we are beginning a fund to cover costs of registrations. This money will be put into an account through our Boosters. The funds will be directly used for our performers who have been hit the hardest during these difficult times to help cover registration costs in our future seasons.

Congratulations to our students and staff on an outstanding first week of school!

Car Rider Line- We know the line is very long at this time. In an attempt to possibly alleviate congestion, if you have an NCMS and NCHS student to drop off, please take St. Francis Dr. from the hospital to enter the middle/high school line if at all possible.

Outstanding job by our staff and students on our new safety protocols! Let's stay healthy!

Reminder- If you are under quarantine, awaiting Covid test results, or have tested positive, please contact the school to let them know. DO NOT COME TO SCHOOL if you or your family is under quarantine. Please remember, if you come to school under these circumstances you will be sent to alternative school or possibly expelled. The safety and health of our staff and students is paramount.

On Monday, August 10, a technology survey will be sent home to each student. These should be returned by Wednesday, August 12.

To say the least, our first two days of off campus instruction have been an adventure. We are incredibly pleased to see that our communication efforts have been successful as evidenced by our high attendance rates!

Nearly 100% of our elementary students submitted their daily attendance forms yesterday and today, and only a very small percentage of junior-senior high students were absent. Students still have until 11:59pm to submit today’s attendance.

Whether you’re looking to our website, social media pages, all-calls, or teacher emails for guidance and support, we cannot express enough gratitude to our community of learners – students, parents, and caregivers – for responding to our communication efforts.

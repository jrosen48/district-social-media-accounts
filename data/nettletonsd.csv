The point is for individuals to stay at home with only a few exceptions. Beginning Monday, April 6, the Nettleton School District has, after very serious consideration, decided to suspend its Feeding Program at least through the duration of the Shelter In Place order. This will help protect our staff and hopefully help keep them safe during this time. All school buildings will be closed. Staff will be available through email.

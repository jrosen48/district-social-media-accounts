The activities below will not take the place of regular classroom instruction but will supplement student learning at home. These activities are not required or graded. There are both online and offline options - you do not need a computer or the internet to do many of them. Additionally, there is information under the Parent Resources tab for ways to talk with your children about the current COVID-19 situation.

These activities are meant to provide optional opportunities for student learning and enrichment while they are away from school. Like any other time throughout the year, we encourage families to continue student learning at home.

New Academy Charter School has offered summer school options to students for more than a decade. With the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, our staff and faculty made a commitment to adjust as needed to maintain this valuable opportunity.

This summer, we replaced traditional summer school education with a virtual option via Google Classroom. Students in grades 7-12 were able to earn one credit per session in English, Biology, Civics, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Algebra, US History, Heath and Phys Ed or Earth Science. 88 students took advantage of this exceptional opportunity. In addition to daily instruction and communication maintained by our teachers via email, phone, facetime and zoom, we also provided over 3600 lunches to our families.

Look forward to an exciting start to the 2020-2021 school year in a few weeks.
If you would like information about enrolling in New Academy Charter Schools, please visit our us on the web or send a PM via Facebook.

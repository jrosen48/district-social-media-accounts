The Northeast Region Executive Committee of the Missouri State Teachers Association would like to acknowledge and congratulate Matt Wells for being nominated as a ""Friend of Education"" for the New Franklin R-1 School District. Matt was nominated by the district CTA chapter that is made up of New Franklin faculty and staff. Matt Wells was nominated for his positive attitude and relationship with students. He goes above and beyond to build a relationship with each student while still being able to complete his daily job. The Executive Committee of the Northeast M.S.T.A. is proud to present grateful recognition to this nominee for their dedication and commitment to academic excellence and continued efforts to enhance public education for the students of schools in our area. Without this type of support and dedication for our school systems, a well-rounded education would be much more difficult to achieve.

Yesterday the Indiana Department of Education announced that all Indiana school facilities must remain closed through June 30th. As a result, the Graduation Commencement ceremony for our seniors will take place on July 19th, or the weekend of July 19th if COVID-19 guidelines require us to conduct a modified event. A detailed letter with specific information about a July 19th Graduation event will be sent to Senior families for planning purposes in mid to late May.

Also, due to yesterday’s announcement Driver’s Education programming will be cancelled for this summer. Refunds will be mailed in May. The May 4th date for picking up Driver Education forms is also cancelled.

New Prairie will provide follow up communications for any summer programming that occurs either online or in July as information and plans are developed, thank you for your continued support of our students.

Due to loss of water pressure and circulation at our water well recently we are placing all water usage from our system at our middle and high school, as a precaution, on a boil order while we have our water tested. This process takes 48 hours. While the testing is occurring NPUSC will be providing bottled water to students and staff throughout the day and clean drinking water options in the cafeteria at lunch time. Again, this is a precaution as our well was down for only one hour before the issue was restored.

This situation was created by a power surge that impacted our power to the well. This was not caused by on-site construction related to the NPUSC renovation projects. This situation does not impact NPUSC Elementary schools, only New Prairie Middle and High School.

Please feel free to contact my office if you have any questions 574-654-7273 or 219-778-2814.

We hope to see a big turnout for our first two Forums 10/19 at the NPHS Library 6 pm CST & 10/20 at Olive Elem 5:30 CST. A few things to clarify from the WSBT TV story:

1. What we are considering proposing to the community will be $10 a month or less in a property tax increase for the average homeowner in our district.

2. The construction cost range we are looking at is 25 million to 36 million, depending on community input.

3. The damaged ceiling in the story is not mold, but a damaged acoustics ceiling in our band/choir area in a practice room. Due to the damage we only use the practice room for storage.

I look forward to working with our school community at our Community Forums to share all of the information
about our possible project.

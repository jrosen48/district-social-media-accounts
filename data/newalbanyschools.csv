üî∏Shawn, what trends are you seeing in substance abuse during the pandemic?
The pandemic has created an increased level of anxiety and isolation. As a result, substance abuse sales and overdoses have increased dramatically.

üî∏ How does someone know when it‚Äôs time to get help?
Typically, most individuals know when they need to seek help. For example, they are no longer able to sustain employment or relationships. They suffer from depression and use drugs and alcohol as a coping mechanism just to make it through the day.

It is with great sadness that we make this announcement. Because of the risks of spreading COVID to both our performers and our audience, the fall production of Frozen, Jr. is cancelled. We want to acknowledge all the hours of rehearsals these students have spent creating the magic that would have been on stage. We would like to share with you our FROZEN family singing ‚ÄúFor the First Time in Forever‚Äù.

If you purchased tickets through CAPA, you can request a refund through them. We thank the community for their support and look forward to the time when we can perform for you again.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Plain Township Fire Department activated a substation, Station 122, to be housed at the NAPLS Bus Garage. With schools closed, the New Albany Plain Local School District has provided access to the facility that will staff a crew 24 hours a day.

The substation was planned based on emergency pandemic response protocols that advise the separation of emergency response teams so that the entire crew is not exposed in the event that one first responder contracts COVID-19. This step will help to ensure continuity of emergency services throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

Station 121 remains the primary location of the Plain Township Fire Department. Substation 122 at the NAPLS Bus Garage will house a three or four person crew including a lieutenant and firefighter-paramedics cross staffing an engine and medic.

NMHRP thanks Anne Frank House trainers who came to Albuquerque from Amsterdam, Costa Rica, South Carolina, and California this past weekend!

They trained students from the The New America School- Las Cruces, Bosque School, Sandia High School, La Cueva High School, East Mountain High School and Menaul School to be tour guides in their respective schools for the exhibit, Anne Frank: A History For Today.

After their intense training, our NM student guides are fully prepared to give impressive tours to not only their peers but to the general public on their community night.

Hello Newark Families! We hope you are all safe and well. Mrs. Smith and I put a short YouTube video to explain the following items: Opening school this Fall; Traditional Graduation; Fall Sports; schedule adjustment due to Covid-19.

We will also be sending out a back to school survey for our parents and our staff very soon. Please take a moment to fill it out to give us help with the Fall.

We are excited to open our doors back up and have students and staff back inside our newly renovated building. Even if it is different than before, it is better to be together at NCHS than apart and remote learning. We hope you all have a safe and fun filled summer with your families.

AP Studio Art was a year-long art course for students interested in a rigorous and focused study in two-dimensional visual art. At the end of the year, students submit 14 works of art for evaluation by the AP College Board for college credit. Each portfolio includes a concentration, an in-depth exploration of a particular topic of the student's choosing.

An art opening celebrating completion of the portfolio is typically held at the Charles B. Phillips Library in Newark. This year, due to restrictions on public gatherings, the art show will be held online, below.

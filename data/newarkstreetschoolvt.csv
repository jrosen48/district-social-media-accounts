Due to low staff numbers, including those in key site leadership roles, the Afterschool Program will be offering remote programming for Session 1 for students in grades K-8. Starting in late September, KEAP opportunities will include online enrichment classes, take-home enrichment kits, and phone/online homework help. There will be no in-person KEAP programs at the schools in September or October.

Good morning Kingdom East Families!
A note today about registration for the Fall semester 2020

You should be receiving documents from your school asking for enrollment information. We collect this information at the Pre School and Elementary School level in order to plan for class size and to give teachers an idea about what their duties will be for the fall. We are planners!

At the High School level we collect residency information so that when we receive money from the state to pay for high school tuition it can be dispersed accurately for the students who live in our towns.

Take note this week. Check your snail mail and your email. Lets get all this paperwork done early!!!!! Thank you for your help!",0.0,"Kingdom East School District

Do you have friends or neighbors that don't have internet services with students at home that need access?
You can be a good neighbor and let them know about this survey and information.
Or if you have service and you know they'd like to have it too, you could open the survey yourself and with a phone call to your neighbor fill out the survey for them.
Let's let the state know what we need out here in the NEK.

Allura is our newest addition to the Newark Afterschool program staff. It is not easy to come into a program when it has already been established, but Allura filled an empty spot perfectly. She picked up on the routines quickly and jumped in immediately in places that she was needed. She has fun with the students and they with her. Allura offered her talents and interest in art by offering an enrichment where students got to express themselves in painting and drawing. Her approach to this was refreshing. Have you ever attempted to draw in the dark? What would you draw if you were surrounded by the scent of pine needles? These are just two examples of her creativity. Allura has grown a lot in her abilities to work with our program, and we benefit highly having her on board. Allura is an exceptional afterschool professional!

Allura is our newest addition to the Newark Afterschool program staff. It is not easy to come into a program when it has already been established, but Allura filled an empty spot perfectly. She picked up on the routines quickly and jumped in immediately in places that she was needed. She has fun with the students and they with her. Allura offered her talents and interest in art by offering an enrichment where students got to express themselves in painting and drawing. Her approach to this was refreshing. Have you ever attempted to draw in the dark? What would you draw if you were surrounded by the scent of pine needles? These are just two examples of her creativity. Allura has grown a lot in her abilities to work with our program, and we benefit highly having her on board. Allura is an exceptional afterschool professional!

Good Morning KESD families.
Here is a clarification on our providing meals for you at this time of school closures.

We at KESD do hope that you have contacted your school and gotten on the list for meals for your children. If something changes for you we are here to help you.

Please be aware that we can only provide meals to children ages 1 - 18. Babies have a different set of nutrition need and we cannot meet that need as an organization.

We thank you for your patience during this first week of meal delivery. We are learning as quickly as we can what the community needs are and meeting them with wonderful volunteerism and positive attitude.

You are our neighbors and we hope that you will continue to reach out to us with concerns or questions. Have a wonderful Wednesday.",0.0,"Kingdom East School District

Gratitude from Kingdom East, for all you do. Thank you.
KATHERINE HANDY - I would like to recognize Katherine Handy for all the work that she does and being so helpful. The K-2 teachers at Burke are all new to the district, two of us are new to teaching, and Katie has worked tirelessly to make sure we are fully supported. Katie has helped us with so many things since the beginning of the year. She has helped us plan, input data, prep materials, coached us to improve our instruction, subbed, etc. She also has a ton of other responsibilities within our school and the district, yet she makes sure we have everything we need! She is MUCH appreciated and deserves to be recognized!

Thank you,

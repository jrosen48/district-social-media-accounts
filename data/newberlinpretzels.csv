I hope this message finds you and your families safe and well. Today, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker announced that remote learning in Illinois will be extended through April 30th in order to slow down the spread of COVID-19.

During this time, on-site learning will remain suspended but our schools’ commitment to learning and education will remain open and learning will continue for all students - just through a different format.

While it is not ideal, we want to assure you that at New Berlin CUSD #16, our administrators, teachers, and support staff are fully engaged and willing to take on this new challenge as we push forward with remote learning, engaging with students and continuing with our food distribution program.

I know this is not the school year that any of us imagined, but I want to thank you for your patience and understanding as we deal with this unprecedented situation together.

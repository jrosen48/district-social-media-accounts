The New Braunfels Independent SchoolDistrict (NBISD) Facebook page is provided for two-way communication between NBISD and the community it serves. NBISD will update its social media page as often as possible to share information on the achievements of the students and staff as well as other relevant information.


All posting of comments on these pages is at the discretion of the page administrators. The intent of these guidelines is not to keep any negative or critical information from being posted, but to protect the privacy and rights of NBISD staff and students. Naming specific employees or students in a negative way will not be allowed. The page administrators will review all postings to make sure they do not run afoul of the rules and follow the district’s guidelines.


NBISD welcomes your thoughts and comments and look forward to what you have to say. NBISD, however, will not leave comments that:


· Break the law or encourage others to do so. This includes respecting copyright and fair use laws. If you are talking about somebody else’s work, reference this or the person, and where possible include a link.
·  Contain abusive or inappropriate language or statements. This includes remarks that are racist, homophobic, and sexist as well as those containing obscenities or are sexually explicit.
·  Easily identify students and/or staff in defamatory,abusive, or generally negative terms.
·  Do not show proper consideration for other’s privacy or are considered likely to offend or provoke others – for example – pick fights or goading others into inflammatory debates. BULLYING will NOT be tolerated!
·  Are spam or unsolicited advertisements (i.e., reportedly posting the same comment or comments that are simply advertising/promoting a service or product).


The page administrators reserve the right to not post or to remove any comments at any time, for any reason. We hope that this will not be necessary.

High Honors scholars are those who earned a grade point average above a 89.5. We have more than 150 scholars in this category, which is more than 20% of our graduating class.

These scholars are smart, dedicated, and very talented. Our scholars don’t achieve High Honors by working hard in a single class or in a single year. Our scholars achieve High Honors by being focused, persistent, and courageous in their pursuit of knowledge throughout their entire academic career.

The district's main data center has been impacted by a power outage in the area. Back up batteries have run out. This issue may impact the ability for scholars and educators to log into their Chromebook, VPN, Infinite Campus, and Classlink.

Due to everyone’s generosity, we were able to make a very nice contribution to Montefiore St. Luke’s Cornwall Hospital, the City of Newburgh Police Department, the New Windsor Police Department and the New Windsor Volunteer Ambulance Corp.

The hospital received eight Elite Keurig machines. They will now have one for each floor, and one for the emergency room as well.

Each of those locations also received 200 K-cup pods, coffee cups with lids, tea bags, sweetener, a box of Coffee Mate Creamers, Cheez Itz, Twizzlers, York Peppermint Patties and Nutrigrain Bars.

Untitled Project",5.0,"Mr. Guy Du Quesnay, video production teacher at NFA and advisor of the award winning Goldback Television (GBTV), collected videos from faculty and students to learn how they were transitioning to the school buildings being closed. Take a few moments to watch, spot some of your friends, and maybe learn a thing or two from some teachers!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7QoIBDMcdc

Don't forget to follow GBTV on YouTube to see what they've been up to and to learn some video production skills! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxG8AstvUYTef9TOuJIhhTw/videos

(Please note, these videos were filmed over two weeks ago, so any mention of ""hanging out with friends"" was occurring prior to updated Executive Orders by the NYS Governor.)

School Gives Students Chromebooks For Duration of School Closure",61.0,"Wi-Fi HOTSPOT UPDATE: Please read this full message.

This week, our Technology Department distributed hundreds of Chromebooks for scholars who didn't receive one last week. We are so thankful for their dedication and commitment to ensuring our scholars have opportunities to learn and connect with their teachers while at home.

Please note, information distributed about Wi-Fi Hotspot distribution is NOT CORRECT. This afternoon, we received notification that the hotspots are backordered. We will call our families and post information on our website and social media sites when the hotspots have arrived.

Students made custom posters that highlight their appreciation for their bus drivers. Each driver was able to take some back with them.

Part of the breakfast also included a kickoff of the Balmville School “Safe Bus Behavior” campaign where drivers will report unsafe behavior daily to Balmville staff, and entire buses will be rewarded each month if they exhibit the safest behavior. Thank you to West Point Tours, Mid-State, and Gallagher busing companies for joining us for breakfast.

Students had the opportunity to take pictures with Santa and his elf, and were treated to a very special ballet Pointe performance by 3 dancers from the Newburgh Performing Arts Academy.

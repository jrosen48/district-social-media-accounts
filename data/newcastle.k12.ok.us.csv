You have shown to this community, to your parents, to your teachers, and to each other that you are capable, bright, beautiful, and compassionate young leaders who will enter the next phase of your life ready to serve and eager to build a better future.

On behalf of all of us at Newcastle Public Schools, I wish you only joy on your journey to becoming more of yourself. You have proven you can meet challenges head on and remain focused on your dreams. Racer spirit goes with you wherever you go, and we will always be proud to see you when you come home.

Thank you for your support of Newcastle Public Schools this school year. Distance learning in April and May required a monumental team effort between our teachers, staff, and families. We are proud of what we accomplished by working together.

Like educators across the nation, we are hopeful and optimistic students will be able to safely return to classrooms in the fall. It is important, however, for us to evaluate our distance learning services to make improvements, in case it is necessary for school buildings to close again in the future.

Please take time to complete the survey located on the district web page. We value and appreciate your input. Thank you for your assistance.

Shyanne Hunt, 9th grade, was recognized today for being an excellent leader and upperclassman student on the bus (route 9). The bus driver, Mrs. Dale, said, “She takes the initiative to help me with the ECC students almost every day by assisting them in finding seats. She is very attentive with the little ones when they have disputes and remind them to stay seated and facing forward when I am driving and cannot remind them myself. I appreciate the fact that she helps without me asking and that she takes care of the students on the bus by resolving small arguments and comforting the younger students if they become upset. She is an asset to the route, and I thank her daily!”

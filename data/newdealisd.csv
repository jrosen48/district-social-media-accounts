New Deal Elementary has been the recipient of two donations last week and this week. We had a local church donate supplies and we also recieved a donation from Southern Bush’s foundation, Mrs. Bush’s Locker. We are so thankful for the supplies and the donation!

Southern Bush was a great educator, mentor and friend! She left a legacy for her family and fellow educators.

As I read the comments concerning the postponement of graduation please understand that as a district this was a very difficult decision. We had over 260 chairs set up on the football field ready to go for the audience. We had large poster size pictures attached to the fence of every graduate. We had everything set up to live stream the graduation ceremony. The diplomas are stacked and ready to be distributed to the graduates. The flowers for the graduates had been purchased. We have put more time and effort into this years graduation because we want to honor the class of 2020 in the most appropriate way possible. I am available to visit with any parent that would like to visit. Please call me at (806) 746-5833. Also please understand that due to FERPA laws we are not able to disclose all information.

Due to icy roads the Jr High will NOT play their first games today in Sundown. We are still planing on playing the 2nd set of games today as long as the roads clear up. We will make a final call around 10:15 if we will be able to go or not. As of right now the players will need to be at the school by 10:45.

As of right now here is the schedule for today:
7th grade will play at 4:30

8th grade will play at 12:45

Please share the updates so everyone will be informed.",2020-01-11 09:04:34,,

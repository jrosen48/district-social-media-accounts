Hello, Newfield Elementary School gardeners! I hope you are all staying safe and healthy. I started planning our garden in early March and purchased some seeds at that time. I am going to show you some of those as I start them indoors, but we are also being creative at our house and using kitchen scraps to start plants. Pictured here are seeds that I scooped out of a squash purchased from the supermarket! I did not know if they would sprout, but stuck them in some dirt anyway! You can see almost ALL of them are growing in just under a week!

What scraps from your kitchen can be planted or put in water to encourage roots? I have carrots and scallions thriving in my kitchen. Try an avocado pit or celery! What other ideas do you have? share your pics.

We put a tiny amount of dirt in old egg cartons and created a greenhouse from an old salad container. What can you recycle in your house to start seeds?

Pictured here are seeds that I scooped out of a squash purchased from the supermarket! I did not know if they would sprout, but stuck them in some dirt anyway! You can see almost ALL of them are growing in just under a week!

What scraps from your kitchen can be planted or put in water to encourage roots? I have carrots and scallions thriving in my kitchen. Try an avocado pit or celery! What other ideas do you have? share your pics.

We put a tiny amount of dirt in old egg cartons and created a greenhouse from an old salad container. What can you recycle in your house to start seeds?

Hello, Newfield Elementary School gardeners! I hope you are all staying safe and healthy. I started planning our garden in early March and purchased some seeds at that time. I am going to show you some of those as I start them indoors, but we are also being creative at our house and using kitchen scraps to start plants. Pictured here are seeds that I scooped out of a squash purchased from the supermarket! I did not know if they would sprout, but stuck them in some dirt anyway!

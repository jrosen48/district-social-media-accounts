Parents and Students:

This closure has been tough on parents, students, teachers, and staff. Let’s find a positive way to support each other! The week of May 4th-May 8th is teacher appreciation week. We are not going to be able to see our teachers to thank them for all they do for us due to the physical school being closed. Let’s create a shower of appreciation to our teachers thanking them for all they do through emails, notes, videos, pictures, or other ways. You can add comments on Facebook or send responses to Mr. Manson m_manson@new-hampton.k12.ia.us and I will post on Facebook for everyone to see our community support of our teachers!

It's someone that we have talked about before. His name is Tom Rinaldi and he is a reporter for ESPN. He is the man that put together The Man in the Red Bandana. 7th graders- This is the guy we were going to interview in the fall but it didn't work out. 8th graders- We have watched this in class and Tom is a master researcher.

Our focus will be on primary source research, with his work on the ESPN piece being the case study.

Hey there 8th graders! I sent an email with some instructions for what you might do while we are apart. Using my website that we have always used, I have put out a few more things to do specific to our class. I have also included a page that has some virtual tours and Facebook Live opportunities if you are looking for something interesting to do during the day (turn off the Playstation and XBox, turn on the virtual tours). I will periodically update both pages with new lesson opportunities and new virtual opportunities. If I come across cool contests and other stuff, I'll throw those up too. Good luck, and see you as soon as we can!

I see a lot of posts related to our notification of the verbal threat incident at the high school this morning. We elected to use social media as we felt that was the quickest way to get the word out on the incident to our parents and community members. Some posts that have been shared since are simply inaccurate information and some posts appear to only have the purpose of trying to incite others. If someone makes a threat and the police are notified, it’s highly unlikely that the student will simply be “sent home”. If this was your child, you would want the district to preserve and protect his or her privacy as we do for every student. As soon as the district learned of the threat, we responded appropriately and fully addressed it with the assistance of law enforcement to make sure it is properly handled and all students and staff remain safe.",0.0,"New Hampton Community Schools

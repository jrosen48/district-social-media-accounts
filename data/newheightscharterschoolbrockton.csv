I just wanted to take a moment to thank all of the staff, students, and families that made last night's Multi-Cultural event happen. I have been an educator in some form or fashion for the past 19 years. While I have moments that I can classify as special that have taken place with such an individual group, never have I eaten, danced, and laughed with staff, students, and families at the same time as much as I have at our two Multi-Cultural Events. It had the feel of a large family gathering, and I just wanted to take a moment to thank all of you for making this place special!

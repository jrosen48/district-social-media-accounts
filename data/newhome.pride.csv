Shane Fiedler",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2736320613083920&id=107681969281144,,0.0,"To the parents of New Home ISD:

By now I am sure you are aware of the closings of multiple schools in our area. I want to take a moment to let you know that our administration team has been in constant contact with multiple districts in our area, state school officials, and members of our medical community in order to provide the best education possible in a safe and secure setting. We have called for an emergency board meeting this Thursday evening to address some of the issues that we are currently facing. I ask that you please be patient as we work through these un-chartered waters. You can expect an announcement regarding our plans for Monday at the conclusion of our board meeting.

Thank you,

Shane Fiedler",2020-03-18 12:23:55,,

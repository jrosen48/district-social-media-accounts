that helps students, parents, and community members
know what is happening on campus, right from their
phones. We know that families are using smartphones
as a primary means to communicate. That’s why we’ve
created an app that is custom-built for mobile. On the app,
you can find cafeteria menus, real-time sports scores,
contact information for staff, and event information. You
can download the app for free from the Apple App Store or
Google Play.

Three Main Benefits:
1) Know what’s going on at school.
Ex: Find real-time updates from the website’s live feed
about stories happening inside the classroom, on the
football field, or in the art studio.

2) Connect with teachers and administrators.
Ex: Learn about parent-teacher conferences, access staff
contact information, and quickly find out about district news.

3) Stay up-to-date with school information.
Ex: Receive updates about events occurring on campus,
the daily cafeteria menu, required forms, and even
emergency notifications.

Dear Newkirk,
My name is Scott Kempenich and I am excited to serve Newkirk Public School as the new Superintendent. I grew up in Wagoner and attended the University of Oklahoma where I was blessed enough to be a part of the 2000 National Championship. I have been married for twenty-two years to Christa and we have two children, Jaxon and Gracie. I have served as an educator for a total of nineteen years, the last twelve years I have served as a school administrator. I have been a teacher, coach, assistant principal, principal and superintendent in my professional career. I am an educational leader that strives to provide the best education possible to all students. I know there are many questions about what the school year will look like in this new era of Covid-19. In the next several weeks we will be working diligently to create safe schooling options for all employees and students in the 2020-2021 school year. I look forward to meeting all school employees, students, parents and community members.",0.0,"Newkirk Public Schools

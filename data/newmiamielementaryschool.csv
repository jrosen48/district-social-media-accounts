SHUTTLE TO THE GAME! As a convenience to our fans and community and in an effort to alleviate some of the parking concerns we may experience we will be operating a shuttle bus to and from the game on Saturday night.

The shuttle will run from 5 pm to 7 pm before the game and from the end of the game until one hour after the game ends.

The shuttle pickup and drop off points will be along Rt. 127 at the corners of Fox, Elliott, Cain, Morris, and Whitaker, on Augspurger near Roselea, and on Seven Mile Ave. at Whitaker, Morris, Cain, Elliott, and Fox. Fans will be dropped off at the first entrance to our campus on Seven Mile Ave. before the game and will be picked up near the same location following the end of the game.

We hope you will consider using this service rather than driving to the game if at all possible, as we are expecting a large crowd and parking is extremely limited.

Please check your child’s head frequently for the presence of lice and/or nits. Head lice have no season, do not jump or fly, and require prolonged head to head contact to spread.

They will die within 24 hours once they are off the head.

Studies have shown that spread is rare within schools, and more commonly occur at camps, sleepovers, household or family contact, and after school activities where head to
head contact is common.

Often the infestations become obvious only after 1 -2 months.

Unless you know of someone with lice, the source can be hard to pinpoint.

WHAT YOU CAN DO
• Check your child’s head at least twice a week, especially if your child complains
of an itchy scalp.
• Keep long hair pulled back.
• Teach your child about personal space and how to avoid situations where his or
her hair makes contact with others.
• Avoid sharing of hats, helmets, or brushes.
• If you have any questions, feel free to contact your school nurse.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2623378481048342&id=1022647264454813,,0.0,"Head Lice Home Check Reminder for Parents and Guardians:

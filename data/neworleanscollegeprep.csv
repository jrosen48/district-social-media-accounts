Don't forget! June 2nd is Give Nola Day.

What is GiveNOLA Day?

GiveNOLA Day, an initiative of the Greater New Orleans Foundation, is a one day online giving event. For 24 hours, everyone who loves our region can support their favorite local causes by donating to one or more of 700+ participating nonprofit organizations. Last year's event raised nearly $5.9 million from over 50,000 donations across the nation and around the world. This year, we hope to do even more!

Tuesday- (National Teacher Day)- Tag your child/children‚Äôs teacher in a post and let them know how much you appreciate them.

Wednesday- Ask your child/children‚Äôs teacher: ‚ÄúWhat can I do to help?‚Äù

Thursday- Post a #TBT that brings back memories of your child/children‚Äôs teacher.

As you know, Governor Edwards has now issued an order closing all Louisiana schools buildings for the remainder of the school year. While our school building may be closed for now, please know that online school WILL CONTINUE and our teachers will be teaching students in April and May until further notice.

Our Crocker employees are also working to establish final grading and promotion guidelines. Please know that in no way will your child be penalized for the school closure period. We will continue online instruction in April and May and do everything possible to cover any educational gaps for your child.

I will be back in contact with you soon as we receive updates from the state. Please take care and know that all of us at the school miss our students and stand ready to ensure that they remain on track for their educational needs.

Walter L. Cohen College Prep High School
December 12, 2018 at 2:42 PM ¬∑

It's #WaLoCoWednesday and this extra special feature is for Jakiara S. who takes advantage of allllll Cohen has to offer. She's a self-proclaimed social butterfly, but her social life never stands in the way of her academic pursuits. She is on the Principal's Honor Roll (All A's) and is preparing herself to become a criminal defense attorney. When asked what she enjoys most about Cohen, she responded, ""That the adults here know I have the ability to do more and they push me to go above and beyond above my capabilities.""
She comes from a long-line of Green Hornets and we're proud to have Jakiara continue our tradition of greatness! #iAmCohen #ChooseCohen #ThisIsCohen",2018-12-12 13:45:49,,

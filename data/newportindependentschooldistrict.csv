Newport Independent Schools Superintendent Kelly Middleton said his district believes relationships trump everything. To enhance the relationships between teachers and their students and parents, Newport began its Home Visit Program in 2012.

All 2,000 Newport students receive a visit from their teacher prior to the new school year. All staff also participate. The program has helped the district build relationships and connections among the community, and has resulted in an increase in parent/guardian and community involvement, and fewer discipline referrals for students. The efforts have also earned the district KSBA’s Public Education Achieves in Kentucky (PEAK) Award.

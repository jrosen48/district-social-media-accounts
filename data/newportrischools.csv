Happy Wednesday Newport Parents and Families!

Week Three of Distance Learning is complete! We miss all of our students and know that everyone is working hard to make Distance Learning successful. Your feedback is very valuable and appreciated as we navigate this process together and hope that you are all finding daily routines that work for your family.

As Thursday, April 9 and Friday, April 10 are vacation days for all school districts in Rhode Island, we hope you will take this time to recharge and enjoy your families.

If you know anyone that is still in need of technology assistance, please contact the Help Desk at 1-800-253-7122 or helpdesk@npsri.net. A Spanish Help Desk is now available and can be reached by calling 1-800-735-1775.

As we prepare for Week 4, we will reconnect with an update this Sunday, April 12. In the meantime, please continue to take care of yourself and your family and practice social distancing.

Thompson Middle School in Newport hosted Middletown last night in basketball. Many of these kids have played together as teammates even in the last two years, so it was an interesting matchup as they went head to head. This is just the beginning for them becoming local rivals rather than teammates. Check out the images of this friendly but fierce competition. TMS did suffer a tough loss in the end 61 to 33 but all ended in a friendly group photo that parents from both Middletown and Newport pulled together. We can't wait to see how these kids compete over the next few years.",0.0,"Newport This Week is with Helen Ames.

It was great day here in Westchester County today. After all, it was officially Michael Hilderbrand Day.
The Principal of Trinity Elementary School was celebrated on the marquee outside the Westchester County Center.
Indeed, this was just the final of four fantastic days. Over the past week or so, there were also days named for three other elementary school principals -- Michael Galland of Columbus, Anthony Bambrola of George M. Davis Jr. and Franco Miele of William B. Ward.
The four were honored as ""Great Educators"" at the Boys and Girls Club of New Rochelle's ""Be Great"" gala, held virtually recently. That was enough for the The Westchester County Board of Legislators to declare four days in their honor.

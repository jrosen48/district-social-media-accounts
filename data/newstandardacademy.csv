In honor of #PrideMonth, we're celebrating the creative contributions of LGBTQIA+ artists in the DIA's collection.

Kehinde Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, is one of the most celebrated painters of his generation. Wiley is known for his vibrant, highly naturalistic paintings of contemporary African-American men and women. His subjects are depicted in heroic poses taken from old master paintings whose sitters were typically white men. His work challenges the history of Western art, which has largely overlooked or intentionally made invisible black subjects from portraits like this.

Wiley's work is found in public and private collections around the world. You can see his painting ""Officer of the Hussars,"" a visitor favorite, at the DIA.

Charter Day at the Capitol is May 13, 2020, and we're counting on you to help us take a stand for Michigan charter students. While we know that there are AMAZING things happening in charter classrooms, many of our lawmakers do not. We need charter parents, educators and advocates (like you) to help share these amazing stories - and what better time to do so than alongside hundreds of fellow charter supporters!

Students are assessed on their progress monthly, placing their academic capabilities into different ""Tiers"". Students who were placed into Tier 1, the highest tier, were recognized and celebrated!!

At this point, North Carolina is severely undercounted in the 2020 Census. We are on track to lose $74 billion in federal funding over the next decade. This funding is critical. The only way to access that money is to be fully counted.

Here's what it will affect:
- Roads and transportation
- Early education
- Senior services
- Veterans services
- Infrastructure that supports local businesses
- Rural development
- Emergency services

The hotspots will be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis, so please complete your yearly online registration for your child ASAP. If you did not receive your snapcode by email, contact your child’s school to set up an appointment to pick up your code. We want the students of Newton-Conover to be able to connect at home.

Video by William Slavinsky.",,,0.0,"New Trier Robotics Club hosted an indoor drone race on Saturday, February 22 where 10 teams competed. The Trevians came in 2nd for JV and 1st and 3rd for Varsity.

Much like a relay race, drone races are 8-minutes long, and the goal is to make as many laps as possible within the time limit. Each team is comprised of two pilots and must allow each pilot to fly a minimum of 40 percent of the total laps to avoid a penalty. Critical thinking, working as a team, technical skills, and flight skills are all apart of this competition.

Interested? Come watch the next race ‚Ä™on March 14‚Ä¨ or join the club (Mondays and Wednesdays from 3:30-5 in W041)!

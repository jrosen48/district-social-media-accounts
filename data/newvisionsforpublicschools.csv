Last year, Advanced Math & Science II's dean, Dashawn Wilson, was featured on PBS' First Person, a video series that explores gender identity, sexuality, and LGBTQ issues through first-person narratives. The episode (see below) highlights Ms. Wilson's courage, activism, and passion for equality for the LGBTQ community. She shares her experience of homophobia within her family and how her past continues to fuel her desire to create safe, celebratory spaces at AMS II.

Ms. Wilson's First Person episode was recently nominated for a New York Emmy award, under the education category!

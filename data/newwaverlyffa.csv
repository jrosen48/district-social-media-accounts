Hey y’all! I am currently serving as your 2020-2021 New Waverly FFA President. I am also a New Waverly High School Varsity Cheerleader. This will be my fourth year in FFA, my tenth year as an involved 4-H member and my tenth year to show market steers. In the past three years as an FFA member I have participated in radio broadcasting, public relations, job interview and I advanced to state with my record book for the past three years. Agriculture has always been so close to my heart and I love to share my passion for it with everyone around me. FFA has completely changed me as a person; if you knew me as a freshman you would know how shy I was, in the past three years I have broken out of my shell and become a confident leader and example to my peers. I am so excited for the year ahead with my officer team that has quickly become a small family to me. Never be afraid to reach out to me if you need anything or just need to see a smiling face!

There are only 4 things I love dearly in my heart and that's poultry, traveling, aviation, and this great FFA organization.

Hello everyone! My name is Mia Gibson and I’m extremely excited to serve my second year on the JRA Board. I grew on a beef operation in Northeast Iowa where we breed for efficient females with carcass quality. This fall I started college at Des Moines Area Community College in Ankeny, Iowa where I’m studying Agribusiness. This year I’m looking forward to interacting with juniors and learning more about the Red Angus breed and the beef industry.",0.0,"Congratulations to first-year DMACC Agribusiness student Mia Gibson of Elgin, a 2020 graduate of North Fayette Valley Community Schools, on serving as a member of the 2020-21 Junior Red Angus Association of America (JRA) Board of Directors!

Congratulations! Your school district has been selected to receive a $15,000.00 grant for Skid Steer Operation/Safety Career Prep Unit through America’s Farmers Grow Rural Education, sponsored by Bayer Fund. Growing the next generation is very important to farmers, and they realize that you are an integral part of that process. To show their appreciation, farmers in your area nominated you to receive this grant. After your application was submitted, it was reviewed first by STEM teachers, then by the America’s Farmers Grow Rural Education Farmer Advisory Council, a group of 24 prominent farmers from across the country. The Advisory Council was impressed with your dedication to your students and your innovative ideas for improving their educational experiences.",0.0,"North Fayette Valley High School

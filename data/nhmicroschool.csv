Fiscal Committee Squelches Debate & Rejects $46 million in Federal Funding for Public Schools

Watch as the Fiscal Committee Squelches Debate & Rejects $46 million in Federal Funding for Public Schools

Dear Charter school teachers, students, parents and supporters,

On Tuesday, February 18, the Senate Finance Committee will hold a public hearing on Senate Bill SB747-FN (SB747-FN). If passed, this bill would allow the New Hampshire Department of Education to accept the first installment of over $46 million dollars in federal grant funds destined for New Hampshire public schools.

To date, acceptance of these federal funds have been blocked because of partisan politics. SB747 can remedy this and help thousands of New Hampshire's neediest students.

Please contact your State Senator ASAP and tell them to support SB747! https://p2a.co/XSWN2IN

Our online form makes it easy. The form will identify your State Senator and allow you to send them a message quickly and easily.

Thank you

This means he remains one of the best trumpet players in the entire country!

This is a rare opportunity for any student at any school, but for a student to be accepted in both the Concert Band and Orchestra as a top chair is an extremely rare occurrence!

The only way one can audition for this group is if one is accepted into County Band, Region Band, and All State Band or Orchestra, which Ryan was. Ryan will perform with the #NationalConcertBand in Orlando, Florida.

Northern Highlands HS students collect letters to help cheer up isolated senior citizens",2.0,"Simran and Serena Dhupar have learned firsthand about the importance of socialization for seniors. Unable to continue their volunteer work at the Promenade at Chestnut Ridge senior living facility due to the coronavirus restrictions, the sisters joined a national effort to provide isolated residents some cheer via letters from #LoveForTheElderly. We thank Simran and Serena for encouraging other Northern Highlands HS students to write letters to cheer up isolated senior citizens. If you would like to contribute, our letter box is just outside our front entrance. #PromenadeSeniorLiving #HighlandsStrong #OneHighlands

The audience for the conference included CEOs, investors, and members of the financial press.

Twice a year, Piper surveys thousands of teens across the country to understand their buying habits, interests, and fashion trends. As you probably know, teens represent a powerful marketing segment, and what they do/like/play/eat/watch can influence a company's stock price and business strategy.

This week, Piper Sanders released its Spring 2020 Teen Spending Report, and our NH panel served to inform the survey. Highlands has been the only school to participate in this annual panel, and this is the first time it is being done via a Zoom conference rather than at Piper Sanders' annual investors conference.

Good evening. Mr. Kiely and I are pleased to announce our 2019-2020 season of social commentary. We are excited that both shows offer larger casts and lots of opportunities both on and off the stage for those interested in crew/leadership positions.

Our fall play will be the blistering comedy The Government Inspector, adapted from Nikolai Gogol by contemporary playwright, Jeffrey Hatcher. Show dates, Nov. 14, 15, 16.

Our spring musical will be How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, the Pulitzer Prize winner for its incisive depiction of the corporate world, by Frank Loesser, Abe Burrows, Jack Weinstock, and Willie Gilbert. Show dates, March 5, 6, 7, 8, 2020.

Dear Citizens of the City of Niagara Falls,

Last night (February 25, 2020), the Niagara Falls City School District maintenance barn behind the High School was destroyed by fire. All of its contents are a total loss. As sad as this event is for our District, we are grateful that no one was injured in the fire. The Niagara Falls Police and Fire Departments were amazing. The City is lucky to have such brave men and women. Initial damages are in the $5 million range.

Trucks and equipment can be replaced. No one was hurt, making this a very somber event, but one we will soon recover from - we are Niagara Falls City School District strong. Thank you for your support.

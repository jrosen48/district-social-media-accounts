Students watched a presentation describing the five available career opportunities within the oral health field. They were able to ask questions regarding those careers after the presentation. Students then participated in five hands-on sessions where they learned how to place a filling in a tooth, place a dental sealant on a tooth, take vital signs on one another, tour a mobile dental facility, and finally visit with a dental lab technician.

Today's the day, seniors! We are hopeful that all of you have finished your classes so this can truly be your last day of high school. Check with your teachers if you have any semester incomplete grades in PowerSchool--but also know that grades aren't due to be finalized until Friday. Continue to check here for more announcements about the returns of books and devices. Honor cords are almost ready--just waiting on one cord so once we have it, you will know.

Musical bingo for RING LARDNER and EASTSIDE!

With the upcoming time off, musical bingo is an incentive for practice! Here's how it works:

Score 5 in a row by completing the tasks in the corresponding spots and provide proof to Mr. Cramer via email (nicholas.cramer@nilesschools.org). Make sure you put your/your student's name in the subject line! Proof will be either a recorded video of student practice, or a screenshot of the completed task on a phone/computer.

Please note that participation is NOT required for a grade, but a fun activity during our time out of class. Any student who gets a bingo will receive a full size candy bar upon return to school! Send any questions to nicholas.cramer@nilesschools.org.

Although things are crazy right now we will be having a meeting at the high school for any boys who are currently in grades 4 through 11 who are interested in playing summer travel basketball. The meeting will take place once things get back to normal.

The current high school/grade school coaching staff and additional volunteers will be coaching the teams. There will be no cost to play in the tourneys.

It is not possible to create a winning program without a robust feeder system. We do not want money to be an obstacle for any family or player who wants to play but cannot afford it.

Announcement for the date of the meeting will come shortly.

We will build a winning program together. We need our community and future Vikings to accomplish our goal. You have a coaching staff that will work relentlessly and tirelessly to help our kids become better players and people.

Go Vikings!!!! Be part of our programs turn around!!!!

Mr. Bechtel 2nd grade class at Ballard is leveraging a new program called Beast Academy. Beast Academy is a challenging and fun way to learn math. The program keeps students engaged and excited about learning while providing the depth and rigor needed to ensure they master the foundation of mathematics. Engaging, comic-book style illustrations keep kids coming back for more.

On April 19th at 12:15pm the Stevens Co. fire department will be staging a mock car crash in order to address the consequences of drunk driving and distracted driving before prom on the 21st. The event will be for Juniors and Seniors. We will start in the gym with a keynote speaker by the name of Darren Mattozzi, who will talk about losing his brother in a DUI accident. Students will then move to the track where a 2-car crash will be staged with student actors. Students will be extricated from cars, taken away in an ambulance, some will be pronounced dead and covered with a blanket, the drunk driver will be arrested and taken away in a police car, and as long as they are available Life flight will land and a student will be loaded. The event should end at 1:35pm.Counselors will be available afterwards for students that may experience distress due to watching the event. We hope that this is a great reminder of some of the life altering consequences that come with driving impaired.",0.0,"Lakeside High School

This regional show and competition includes 16 area high schools and is juried by professional artists in the community. The festival usually consists of an exhibit in the high school's gallery and a film screening in the auditorium.

Due to the pandemic, the event was canceled this year. Still, Niskayuna media arts teacher Stephanie Palazeke volunteered to create a website showcasing all of the work submitted for the show.

Be sure to check out the awards section to view our Nisky students from film, photo, and design classes announce the awards via video from their rooms at home. 🙌

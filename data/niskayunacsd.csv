On Friday, Sept. 27, eight-graders at Iroquois Middle School participated in community service day by volunteering in various community service agencies in the Niskayuna/Schenectady area.

Teachers and parents chaperoned groups of students that were assigned to one community service organization and spent approximately 2 1/2 hours performing volunteer services to assist that agency.

Some of the agencies and volunteer work the students assisted with were:

Van Corlaer Elementary School - Students worked with elementary school children in their classroom studies of science, math,
reading, etc. and utilized the STEAM bus to enhance their learning.

The Regional Food Bank - Students stocked shelves and reorganized the pantry or food supplies for those in need.

Roots and Wisdom - Harvested food to be donated to those in need and cleared the gardens the winter.

Ingersoll Place - Interacted with senior residents and participated in an exercise class and played some games.",0.0,"Niskayuna Central School District added 52 new photos.

As you are probably aware, the COVID-19 situation has continued to evolve. New cases have been identified in and around our area. With this in mind, Nixon-Smiley CISD has made the difficult decision to extend the closure of our campuses and facilities until further notice. However, meal delivery and remote instruction will continue. See our web page at www.nixonsmiley.net for information on those activities.

This decision will be re-evaluated as more information becomes available. A formal update will be posted during the week of April 20th. If it appears possible at that time, we will begin announcing procedures and a date for a return to normal operations. If we are unable to plan for a return, we will instead provide information on year-end events like graduation.

Thank you for your support and cooperation as we ensure that all members of the community in Nixon-Smiley CISD stay safe and healthy.

Good afternoon everyone. Today we were asked by a citizen why we were at the Elementary Campus and if there was something going on parents needed to know about. After being asked that question we thought maybe we would explain our presence on campus. Periodically you may see a patrol unit parked in front of the school and a deputy walking the halls. This is something we began at the beginning of school last year when we increased our campus presence only to ensure the continued safety of students and staff.

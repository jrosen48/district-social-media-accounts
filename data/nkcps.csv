Monday mornings from 9-12 we will have curbside pick up for your requests. Books will be delivered to your car out in front of the school. We will also be accepting library books for return. These will be stored for two weeks for everyone's safety before being available for circulation.

The Google Form also allows you to request books by subject, author, or reading level, so you don't have to have a specific title to request. A Google Form must be filled out in order to pick up books. You will get an email response if any books requested are not available that week. Below are the two links to the schools' Google Forms:

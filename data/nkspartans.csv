Thank you to the more than 130,000 families who took the time to complete our Fall Planning Survey. We heard your stories of challenging times and the hardship that distance learning placed on you and your loved ones. We also heard your gratitude for keeping our communities safe and spending more time with families.
Your experiences are invaluable as we plan for the 2020-21 school year during these times of uncertainty. It is our shared goal to lift up our students through education, while keeping them safe. Your voices will undoubtedly help us do that.

WE ARE THE SPARTANS AND WE COULDN’T BE PROUDER!!!

Boys, we are all so very proud of you. You guys play with your whole heart in every game. You have grown so so much. It has been so much fun watching you play. The memories made and the bonds you have built growing up and playing together will never be replaced. To persevere and persist to keep getting better really shows great character and watching you guys grow and develop into something so extravagant is breathtaking and we all stand proud for you guys. You have given Nashwauk something that we’ve been waiting years for; small towns can make dreams come true too. Thank you for giving our community a good run at the taste of what it feels like to work hard and earn something amazing. We love you!

Seniors, although this was your last run you fall nothing short of amazing. You are huge role models to your community, younger class men, and teammates. You have so much to be proud of you have accomplished so so much though your Journey ￼in basketball. So congratulations on ￼ accomplishing your endeavors.

This Saturday the local FFA Chapters will be putting on a Knockout Hunger Itasca County Event! We have raised over $10,000 to put this event on and are so excited about what it could bring for the community!

The day will start with a panel talking about the hunger issue in Itasca County at 11am. A meal will follow the panel with a meal packaging event starting around 1pm. The event will be taking place right here at Greenway High School in the gym and multipurpose room! We will be packaging a tomato basil hotdish and an oatmeal that will be packaged and given to area food shelves.

This is a great opportunity for students to get some community involvement and volunteer hours. It will also be an awesome time for families to get together and help out the community! If you have a sports team or youth group, it would be an awesome time for some team bonding!

If you are interested in coming to the event check out more information on Greenway FFA's Facebook page or send me an email! There is a link below to the google form to RSVP! https://forms.gle/2y2GL5aHb9zGSfWG7",0.0,"Greenway High School

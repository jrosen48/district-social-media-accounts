**Please share this information**

Good afternoon,
We received approval of a revised graduation plan yesterday that will allow us to give speeches live, as well as, be out of our vehicles more during our graduation ceremony. I have attached the plan approved by the Huron County Health Department. This plan meets the three priorities set by our senior class officers:

#1 We graduate together
#2 We walk the stage
#3 We graduate at the school

This plan also meets the goal to maintain as many aspects of a traditional commencement ceremony as possible. Emails have been sent to student accounts and parents. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me directly.

Our community has once again stepped up to provide assistance as we face this COVID-19 pandemic. In just a week‚Äôs time, several area schools, businesses, and individuals used their 3D printing resources to make around 800 plastic headbands for face shields for our front line staff. The face shield used in addition to a mask protects our front line workers. This allows the actual face mask to be used longer, preserving personal protective equipment (PPE). Since the headbands are plastic, they can be sterilized and reused without fear of contamination. You can see them in this picture as two of our respiratory therapists participate in COVID-19 education with a manikin.

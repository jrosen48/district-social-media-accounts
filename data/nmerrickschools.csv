The NM family friendly enrichment challenge project entitled, Let's Look at Those Three Little Pigs is ready!!

Although the challenge stems from the original Three Little Pigs fairy tale, different projects have been suggested for different grade-levels. Students may work within their own grade-level, select from a different grade-level, create their own challenge, and/or work with siblings.

The North Merrick Enrichment Challenge Captains will provide personalized feedback, via Flipgrid for each submission. As we will post another challenge on or about 4/29/20, try to complete this one by then. Our Captains will monitor work as it submitted.

Should you have any questions, you may e-mail e-learningsupport@nmerrick.org.

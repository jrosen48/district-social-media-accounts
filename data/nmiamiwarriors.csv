1. Graduation Requirements have been adjusted, including the Graduation Qualifying Exam and Graduation Pathways. The expectation is for you to finish each of your enrolled courses. Not finishing a course would lead to an “incomplete” on the final transcript and may prohibit you from meeting graduation requirements. Final GPA’s and Class Rank will be based on the first 7 semesters.

2. Jostens orders can be picked up Thursday, April 16th, in front of MS/HS from 3:00-6:00. Also, please prepare a short video (30 seconds or less) of a message for your classmates. Graduation and other significant events will be rescheduled with guidance and approval from the state.

1. Graduation Requirements have been adjusted, including the Graduation Qualifying Exam and Graduation Pathways. The expectation is for you to finish each of your enrolled courses. Not finishing a course would lead to an “incomplete” on the final transcript and may prohibit you from meeting graduation requirements. Final GPA’s and Class Rank will be based on the first 7 semesters.

2. Jostens orders can be picked up Thursday, April 16th, in front of MS/HS from 3:00-6:00. Also, please prepare a short video (30 seconds or less) of a message for your classmates. Graduation and other significant events will be rescheduled with guidance and approval from the state.

During this game, the NM Music program will be holding a silent auction of some old full band picture frames from a variety of years, selling Marching Shako's (hats WITHOUT PLUMES) for a $5 donation, and just having a wonderful Music Family Time together reliving old memories.

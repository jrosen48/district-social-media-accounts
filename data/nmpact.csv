We are unable to have our physical bookfair this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we are excited to be able to offer an ONLINE option! At this time, when many of us are at home, we can all use a good book. Scholastic has books at all price ranges, many being very affordable. All profits will go directly toward free books for our school and back to support our students in the classroom.

All orders will ship directly to your home. It was my understanding that book orders over $25 will ship free. You may also order kits and resources, however, shipping will be charged for those items. If you would like to place a second order for those items, it will be cheaper to only pay shipping for those items and get free shipping for your book order if it is over $25. Please let us know if you have any questions!

We ask if you can, please give us your order the day before, (or earlier would be great). That way we can have more of an idea what we need, have enough sub bread baked that morning, etc. Then we can have it ready for you. You can even pay ahead of time, grab and go. (Don't forget drinks). If you are ordering fryer food. Same thing. We can have it ready for you. Friday is our small loin special. (Small loin and French fries for $5.00).
Thank you so much. With your help this year it should be alot smoother ;)",0.0,"If you would like to bring lunch from East Market Grocery and Deli, give them a call ahead of time and place your order!!

We hope you will think of NMSA and our students on this year's international day of giving tomorrow! In anticipation of this momentous occasion we are delighted to share with you our next student story from the heART of NMSA.

""One of the ways that my arts discipline, which was dance, has contributed to my academic career after NMSA is that it has given me the tools and the skills of discipline, passion and determination for the things i have chosen to pursue afterwards."" ‚Äì Isabella Aldana, NMSA Dancer (Creative Writing Minor) '15

Isabella is a first-generation college student who recently graduated from Smith College. She moved to the Rio Grande Valley to begin her career as a middle school math teacher.

Gerald is performing this evening at SITE Santa Fe, presented by Santa Fe Music Collective and John Trentacosta.

The name Gerald Clayton has almost become a household name in jazz today. Following in the footsteps of his famous father, bassist John Clayton, and uncle, saxophonist Jeff Clayton, Gerald learned his music lessons well at an early age, and forged ahead to establish an amazing career for himself as a pianist, composer and bandleader. Appearing in a Quartet setting with Logan Richardson - alto saxophone, Joe Sanders iNfinity - bass, and Kendrick Scott - drums, the ""Gerald Clayton Quartet"" brings the perfect blend of tradition with a younger modern approach.

This master class was presented by Santa Fe Music Collective in partnership with National Endowment for the Arts and Western Jazz Presenters Network

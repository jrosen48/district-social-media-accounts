Gerald is performing this evening at SITE Santa Fe, presented by Santa Fe Music Collective and John Trentacosta.

The name Gerald Clayton has almost become a household name in jazz today. Following in the footsteps of his famous father, bassist John Clayton, and uncle, saxophonist Jeff Clayton, Gerald learned his music lessons well at an early age, and forged ahead to establish an amazing career for himself as a pianist, composer and bandleader. Appearing in a Quartet setting with Logan Richardson - alto saxophone, Joe Sanders iNfinity - bass, and Kendrick Scott - drums, the ""Gerald Clayton Quartet"" brings the perfect blend of tradition with a younger modern approach.

This master class was presented by Santa Fe Music Collective in partnership with National Endowment for the Arts and Western Jazz Presenters Network

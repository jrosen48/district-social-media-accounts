One of our NHS Resource Room volunteers, met with the North Marion School District counselors today! They heard great things about our Newberg Public Schools Resource Rooms movement and wanted to learn how to start the project to help support their 2,000 students. North Marion School District has students from Aurora, Broadacres, Butteville, Donald, Hubbard and some of the Woodburn rural area.
We were excited to share information about the NPS Resource Room project. How to start it, how to keep it sustainable, and MOST importantly - how to ensure kids feel supported & cared about while at school. We believe students having instant access to basic need items while they are at school is a foundational piece in making kids feel cared about.
We were excited to meet 5 incredible counselors that have huge ❤️’s for their students! We have found that the sun ☀️ shines a little brighter when you are working to show kids how loved they are by their school & parent community!

NHS Resource Room
October 17, 2018 at 10:57 AM ·

One of our NHS Resource Room volunteers, met with the North Marion School District counselors today! They heard great things about our Newberg Public Schools Resource Rooms movement and wanted to learn how to start the project to help support their 2,000 students. North Marion School District has students from Aurora, Broadacres, Butteville, Donald, Hubbard and some of the Woodburn rural area.
We were excited to share information about the NPS Resource Room project. How to start it, how to keep it sustainable, and MOST importantly - how to ensure kids feel supported & cared about while at school. We believe students having instant access to basic need items while they are at school is a foundational piece in making kids feel cared about.
We were excited to meet 5 incredible counselors that have huge ❤️’s for their students! We have found that the sun ☀️ shines a little brighter when you are working to show kids how loved they are by their school & parent community!

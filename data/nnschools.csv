Superintendent of Public Instruction James Lane announced today that he is using his authority under Governor Ralph Northam’s Executive Order 51 to ensure that high school seniors who were on track to earn a diploma later this spring are able to graduate, despite the closure of schools for the remainder of the year as a means of slowing the spread of COVID-19.

“The governor and I agree that every student who was on a trajectory toward earning a diploma should be able to graduate on time and move on to the next stage of his or her life,” Lane said. “I hope the flexibility that I am announcing today will help students and teachers as they cope with the deep disappointment of having their time together unexpectedly cut short and of not being able to enjoy the recognitions and celebrations that should be a part of every student’s graduation experience.”

Teams of four students from each middle and high school worked together to build wind turbines that would generate the fastest blade tip speed in the first engineering design challenge to feature both middle and high school students. The challenge, Generating the Future, was held in partnership with Dominion Energy, who is developing the first offshore wind initiative in the mid-Atlantic.

The teams used their knowledge of science, engineering and math to build a wind turbine that could harness the wind by converting kinetic energy into mechanical energy. Each team's turbine had to have blades of equal length, rotate for at least 20 seconds and stay intact during operation. Students simulated a fast-paced real-world working environment by digitally submitting blueprints and data to meet deadlines throughout the challenge.

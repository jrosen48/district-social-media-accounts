As we prepare for this unconventional beginning of our 2020 - 2021 school year, we would love to invite you to our Meet the Teacher Drive Thru Event!

Event is for all scholars and families (K-8) and will take place Tuesday, August 25th from 3pm-5pm. Parents will enter our Parent Drop Off Lot off of St. Clair (there will be no entry off of 200th Street).

Teachers will be lining the lot with signs eager to meet new scholars and see old scholars! Families are encouraged -but not required- to decorate their cars or create signs with the names and grades of their scholars.

All scholars and families will remain inside their vehicles as they drive through. The building will not be accessible to families and scholars at this event.

Please contact Ms.Tate or Mrs.Tondola (Ms.Groh) with any questions (tate@noblecleveland.org or tondola@noblecleveland.org)

Some highlights:

Talk to Your Child about the Current Situation
- Have age-appropriate conversations with your child and be sure all adults in the household are using the same language to describe what is happening. Be sure you understand the correct facts from medical and government resources.

Limit Exposure
-Be mindful of adult conversations or media coverage about what is happening. Limit your child’s exposure to these as they could cause an increase in anxiety or distress in your child.

Set Expectations
- Set expectations for your child to complete a set amount of academic work daily. This helps with structure but also will help avoid the pressures of feeling behind when he or she returns to school.

Focus on the Positive
- Point out the “helpers” in the world and the good things they are doing. Stay simple and limit detail about anything frightening, but emphasize the good work being done.

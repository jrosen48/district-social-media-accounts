💥UPDATE💥 The Noble Community is simply amazing - WE ARE ONLY $790 AWAY from delivering $10,000 of much needed assistance for supplies to help faculty, staff, and students during the ongoing Covid-19 crisis.

💙GIVE WHAT YOU CAN TODAY!!!! 💙

For every tax-deductible dollar you donate for this effort, the NPS Foundation will match your collective giving amount, up to $5000. This will help us provide an additional $10,000 of supplemental emergency support for our students and faculty/staff during this pandemic. 100% of donations will go directly to Noble Public Schools for immediate use to fund needs such as (but not limited to) personal protective equipment, schools supplies, and sanitary supplies. If you are searching for a way to tangibly help our school community, this is a great way to ""pay it forward"" to NPS during this time of uncertainty and financial strain.

As this year changed quickly to distance learning, KID began to consider how to handle Kindergarten graduation. After careful consideration, the decision has been made to cancel this year’s graduation. I know that many of you would like graduation pictures. I have found that there are many companies online that sell caps, gowns, and tassels for those precious pictures. Thank you for your understanding as we face the many challenges of this school year. Stay safe and healthy!

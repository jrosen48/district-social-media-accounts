Paradise will be live streaming our football game on Facebook. It will be on the Paradise Athletic Booster Club page. Fans need not become followers of the Booster Club page to watch the video. They can just search for it in Facebook and go to the page.

It will also be accessible using a web address - www.pisd.net . Paradise will put a link to the game on our school's website that will be very prominent at the top and center. This link will take them to the Facebook page. If they do not have a Facebook account, they can still view the video (at least that is what I have been told from others who have done this)

We'd like to thank everyone for the rush of NEW subscribers to our NHS Digital Media youtube channel. Subscribing is a great way to keep up with ALL things video at NHS. However, there is some confusion out there about our ability to livestream the home football games without 1,000 subscribers. We can and will livestream those games to youtube because we are doing that from computer just like we did NHS Graduation 2020.

Youtube only requires 1,000 subscribers to livestream through a mobile device like an iPad or iPhone like we plan to use for Varsity Volleyball home games.

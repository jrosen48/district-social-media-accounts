Our top priority is the health and safety of our school community. We want our students and families to feel confident that they are returning to a safe and healthy environment that is conducive to learning.

As part of the planning process we have put together a Parent Feedback Survey. This survey is designed to get your feedback on the Online/eLearning that took place this year as well as get your thoughts about the 2020-2021 school year.

We encourage all families to complete ONE survey for their family. The deadline to complete the survey will be Friday, June 5, 2020. (Note: An Arabic and Spanish translation of the survey will be posted in the coming days.)

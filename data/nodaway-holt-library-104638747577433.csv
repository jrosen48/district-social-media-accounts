Please bring the kiddos in to checkout books.
~Each child will receive a goody bag when visiting the library.
~Also, I have some exciting gift baskets to give away! To be put in the drawing for the gift basket giveaway you’ll need to do a mini book review about each book you read. (This will be SUPER EASY!) The more book reviews you do, the more times you’ll be entered in the drawing!!
I can’t wait to see you at the library!!

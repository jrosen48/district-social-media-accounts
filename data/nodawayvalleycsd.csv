Summerset No. 3 country school, two miles north of Fontanelle, with the Baudler cow/calf farm in the background, became the signing site for Nodaway Valley's senior Joshua Baudler.

Joshua signed his letter of intent to run both cross country and track and field at Southwestern Community College located in Creston.

Joshua was this past year's IHSAA Class 1-A Individual State Champion in Cross Country.

In the 2018-19 school year Josh was the Class 1-A State Runner-up in cross country, and finished second in the 3200 and third in the 1600 at the State Track Meet as a Junior.

He will major in Ag Business and Livestock Production.

Congratulations, Joshua!

Friday, March 6 - Nearly half of the NVHS student body participated in our first annual National Day of Unplugging! Great Job, students!
52% Sophomores
51% Juniors
46% Seniors
40% Freshmen
Students turned their phones in at 8:25 and were able to pick them up at 3:25.

Be sure to watch NVTV on Monday to see how students survived the day without their cell phones!

From Mr. Miller...
Studies have shown that 8/10 students who participate in a digital detox will continue to ""detox"" from their phones following this event.

Stress and anxiety levels decrease following a digital detox. This includes not just teenagers but also ADULTS!

A UCLA study found that pre-teens who were deprived of screens for 5 days through a digital detox were much better at reading people’s emotions (non-verbal skills) than children who continued using screens.

HAPPY (UNPLUGGED) FRIDAY!

Well, we did it! Tonight’s home win versus Lenox 66-31 locks up at least a share of first place in the POI!! Overall we’re at 18-2 and 12-1 in the conference. We’re hosting a really solid AHSTW team, currently ranked # 12 in 2A on Monday at 6pm which is also senior night!! Fingers crossed and prayers for Naomi who suffered a knee injury tonight.

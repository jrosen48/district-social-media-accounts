Students DO NOT need to be present to receive meals. Parents or caregivers may pick up meals on behalf of the students within their household.

Child nutrition resources are available to those under 18 years of age and those who currently attend a public school.

Students who are over 18 years of age and are currently enrolled in public schools will also be allowed to access the community feeding programming. Schools will be contacting those families directly to ensure they are aware of the services available to them.

I am also thankful that she has a genuine love for this music. This is from today's virtual Spring Recital for Opera Theatre of St. Louis Artists In Training Program. This year's Spring Recital is adjudicated by soprano Harolyn Blackwell. To access the digital program for this recital, please visit https://bit.ly/2CqhKS7.

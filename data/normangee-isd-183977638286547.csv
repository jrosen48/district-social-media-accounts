6-12 grade schedules can now be viewed through Parent Portal. If you have a question about your schedule, please email Mrs. Tesch at ktesch@normangeeisd.org.

9-12 grade students: The number one goal is to make sure your child is taking the required classes to meet graduation requirements. With so many students choosing different courses, it's very common to have conflicts with preferred electives. If your child was placed in an elective they do not want to take, please email Mrs. Tesch requesting to change it. She will be able to accommodate as much as the schedule allows.

The last day of school has been changed. Instead of ending school on May 22nd, the last day of school will be May 12th. We have unused days available in our school calendar that will allow us to meet all requirements by the State of Texas and end school on May 12th. We understand that the last few weeks have been stressful and have provided challenges. Our hope is that this decision allows students and families the opportunity to begin their summer and further minimize any stress associated with these trying times we have been facing.

This means that May 6th will be the last day that meals are provided. This does not affect or impact any other plans regarding the end of the school year. No other dates or plans have been changed.

You will hear plans soon about the last week of school and how we will collect student work and close out the school year.

Effective tomorrow, January 23rd, ALL VISITORS entering the campus MUST HAVE A GOVERNMENT ISSUED ID. To further ensure the safety and security of our students, Normangee ISD has installed the RAPTOR, visitor management system.

This system will allow us to do the following:
1 - Accurately keep a log of who is on campus and why
2 - Instantly screens visitors for previous offenses that would prohibit them from being admitted to campus
3 - Instantly screens for other issues such as custodial conflicts

Please watch the following video that explains a little more how the RAPTOR system works: https://safeYouTube.net/w/CExh",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2659913504026269&id=183977638286547,"SAFEYOUTUBE.NET

With school starting in North Attleboro next week we wanted to send out a reminder about the rules for stopping for school busses.
Failing to stop or illegally passing a stopped school bus with flashing lights can result in a $250 fine in Massachusetts, at minimum. A second offense by a fine of not less than $500. That fine can go up to $2,000 and a suspended license of up to a year for subsequent offenses (MGL 90-14).
Please stop for school bus stop signs- it’s the law and it will save lives. Thank you!

Good afternoon, this is Assistant Superintendent Lori McEwen with a message regarding student safety.

I have been in contact with the NAPD regarding some recent incidents in which a man in his 50s, with a gray or white beard and hair, asked a child if he needed a ride home.

The man is reported to be driving a blue or gray truck or van, and the license may contain the numbers 32. Police in Wrentham have received similar reports, according to NAPD and an article in the Sun Chronicle.

As a result, the NAPD is posting police officers at all elementary schools this afternoon. In addition, school staff are reiterating safe walking procedures with students.

Please stress walking safety with your children and report any suspicious activity to the police at 508-695-1212.

As always, your children's safety is our primary concern.

What a wonderful meeting with Mr. James Flanagan and his daughter, Ms. Linda Sheme. Mr. Flanagan came up from Florida to present the North Attleborough School Department with a $25,000 check to establish a scholarship for North Attleborough High School graduates who are going to major in the field of technology/electronics. For the next five years, 2 graduates will each receive a check for $2,500.

This scholarship is being established in the name of Mr. Flanagan’s late wife, Ms. Nola Priestley Flanagan. Ms. Nola Priestly Flanagan was a 1946 graduate of North Attleborough High School and worked as the Administrative Assistant to North Attleborough Superintendent, Mr. Mott. Ms. Flanagan passed away this past June and wanted to give back to the community she loved and always held near and dear to her heart.

We thank the family for their generosity and look forward to giving the scholarship out for years to come.

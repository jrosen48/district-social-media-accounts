Schedules are on Skyward!

A few things to remember -- there are still some changes to be made as we balance classes, find mistakes, etc. This MAY NOT be the FINAL schedule for you. Make sure to check Skyward again before classes start on Tuesday, September 8.

Due to the current circumstances, we will be allowing very few schedule changes unless there is an error (i.e. missing a period, incorrect class for graduation requirements, etc.).

IF you have any change requests or don't have enough classes scheduled, use this Google Form to make any requests. We will not be accepting requests via phone, email, paper note or any other method. Not all change requests will be granted and all changes are subject to availability. Counselors will communicate with you via email.

Our CHS teachers have been working harder than ever during this new distance learning experience. While we appreciate them all the time, our appreciation runs much deeper this year! Our Eagle teachers have dug deep, learned new skills, reached out to students, worried about students, and celebrated small victories over the past 7 weeks. There are not enough words to say thank you, but the CHS ASB & Student Body want to share this small token of gratitude.

The survey needs to be completed only once by each family, even if you have multiple students at CHS.
We are asking that it is completed by Monday morning.

This link was also sent in an email to all CHS students, asking them to spend a few minutes with you this weekend to complete the survey. :)

We have some ideas to help you explore the world while you stay home and stop the spread during Spring Break! How about a virtual visit to the San Diego Zoo? Or a tour of the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History?

You could also challenge friends, family members, or classmates to complete all the tasks on the NFSD Service Scavenger Hunt! Or you could play Eagle Bingo (thank you to senior Kennedy Syrie for creating the bingo card!).

What about catching up on the CharacterStrong 30 Days of Kindness Journal? All the challenges and the journal prompts are on the grade level Google Classrooms.

It's going to be beautiful outside this week! Get outside - go for a (socially distanced, of course) walk, a run, or bike ride. Enjoy the warm temps, get some Vitamin D, and breathe in the fresh air.

“I joined FFA three years ago and started showing rabbits. I also compete in competitions in food science, livestock judging and showing. I think kids should think about joining FFA because it gets you involved in your community. FFA inspires people to grow and learn. There are so many programs available through FFA. I am going to college and learn about running a business. I would like to direct my studies to the medical field. My skills that I am learning now will help me in college.”

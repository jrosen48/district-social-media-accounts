Last week, Governor Holcomb gave an executive order mandating masks for the entire state of Indiana. His guidelines were for people 8 years and older.
In light of the Governor’s order and age guidelines, the Starke County Health Department has amended the Face Covering Mandate for our County. The entire amendment can be found at http://www.co.starke.in.us/health/MASK%20MANDATE%207-27-20.pdf. Section A. 1 speaks specifically to K-12 Educational Institutions. We are grateful for this amendment, as it offers a realistic attempt in having students wear masks.
Our stance on this is: Grades K-2 are strongly encouraged to wear face coverings, but not mandated. Grades 3-12 remain in the category of “settled and spaced” as previously stated in our NJ-SP stance on masks. We appreciate the Starke County Health Department working with the schools on being better able to comply with orders.

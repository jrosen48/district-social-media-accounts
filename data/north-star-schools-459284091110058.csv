We want all students and staff to find a ball to dribble, a basketball works the best and is the easiest to control, but if you do not have one, use any ball that you have at your house. Every day we would like you to go outside and dribble. Make sure to count the number of times you dribble the ball.

Even though summer is almost over, it’s not too late to help your child become a better reader before the new school year begins. Summer is an important time for students to keep reading and improve their language skills. If your child hasn’t been reading regularly this summer, they may be in danger of the “summer slide”—a decline in their reading ability.

Numerous studies indicate that students who don’t read during their summer vacation see their reading abilities decline significantly. This effect becomes more pronounced as students get older and advance through the grade levels. If students don’t read over the summer, they are much more likely to fall behind their peers, widening the “achievement gap” each year.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=614280352277097&id=459284091110058,,0.0,"Attention parents:

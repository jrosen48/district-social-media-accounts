Happy Opening Day North Hills! Today is the first day back for the teachers and the kickoff of the 2020-2021 school year. Opening Day looks a little different this year, however, instead of focusing on what is different, I wanted to take a moment to talk about a few things that remain the same. We all want what is in the best interest of kids. We care about education and are committed to providing a high-quality equitable education to students. We are a strong, resilient community. We are North Hills.

August 13 at 6:39 AM ·

Happy Opening Day North Hills! Today is the first day back for the teachers and the kickoff of the 2020-2021 school year. Opening Day looks a little different this year, however, instead of focusing on what is different, I wanted to take a moment to talk about a few things that remain the same. We all want what is in the best interest of kids. We care about education and are committed to providing a high-quality equitable education to students. We are a strong, resilient community. We are North Hills.

We will overcome whatever challenges come our way. Everyone in this district plays an important role in this year’s success. We can do this if everyone does it together. Welcome back teachers and welcome to the school year! #nhproud #letsdothis",2020-08-13 07:14:47,,

Since we couldn't have an in-person banquet to recognize our 32 senior choir members, a video tribute has been created. It includes remarks and a summary of the last 4 years in the choral program by Mr. Cloonan. Following is individual recognition of each senior, with a baby and senior photo, listing of all ensembles they've participated in going back to children's choir, future plans, and if they chose to share, a favorite memory, quote, or personal message. Music in the background comes from past performances, including Disney Springs 2018, IUP Fall Choral Collage Concert in October 2018, Arrows of Caring 2019, Arts Alive 2019, Messiah College 2019, and September 2019 School Board meeting.

""He really likes his job at Giant Eagle and has been a huge help delivering groceries to his grandparents,” his mom writes.
In high school, Jonah played football all four years and volunteered in the life skills room. Jonah is scheduled to leave for boot camp at Fort Sill in Oklahoma in June. After boot camp, he will participate in artillery training.

These are incredibly challenging times. We have been challenged in ways we never expected, as students, as parents, as teachers, as administrators, as global citizens, as a community, and as a school district.

And, wherever you are on your journey today, I just want you to know, you are doing a great job!

Tomorrow, we are embarking on a new phase as we start to roll out virtual learning, and parents, I will be right there with you! Please remember that this is going to be imperfect, this is not ideal, but we are going to make the best of it.

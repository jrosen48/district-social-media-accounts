By 100PM today, all customers affected by the water main break in Saunderstown should be returned to service. There is however, still a potential for discolored and aerated (cloudy) water. If this is occurring at your home, the most effective strategy for solving the problem is to flush your water service line through all outside spigots first, and then after the water begins to run clear, begin flushing your inside faucets until they clear up as well. By doing it in this manner, you can minimize the impacts of discolored water inside your home.

What an amazing story! Randy Hart, a retired NA teacher, stopped by Marshall Middle School today and made a $10,000 donation to purchase a CNC Router. This is more than Mr. Hart's first teaching contract with NA in 1974.

Mr. Hart joins NexTier Bank and UPMC Health Plan in supporting CNC Routers for all three middle school Tech Ed programs. These change NA's curriculum to one that includes prototype and manufacturing design.

Ellen Green, Technology and Engineering Education Department Chair was a student of Mr. Hart as was MMS Tech Ed teacher Nick Vorrasi (both pictured). Accepting the donation is Abigayle Tobia, Executive Director of NA Foundation; Matthew Buchak, MMS Assistant Principal, Nick Vorrasi, Ellen Green and Mat Kohler.

What an amazing story! Randy Hart, a retired NA teacher, stopped by Marshall Middle School today and made a $10,000 donation to purchase a CNC Router. This is more than Mr. Hart's first teaching contract with NA in 1974.

Mr. Hart joins NexTier Bank and UPMC Health Plan in supporting CNC Routers for all three middle school Tech Ed programs. These change NA's curriculum to one that includes prototype and manufacturing design.

Ellen Green, Technology and Engineering Education Department Chair was a student of Mr. Hart as was MMS Tech Ed teacher Nick Vorrasi (both pictured). Accepting the donation is Abigayle Tobia, Executive Director of NA Foundation; Matthew Buchak, MMS Assistant Principal, Nick Vorrasi, Ellen Green and Mat Kohler.

#Thankyou to Mr. Hart and all of our retired NA Teachers that continue to support NA Students! #NASDLearns",2020-02-14 15:13:05,,

-97% percent of our students have access to the internet. Those that do not at this time are due to location and we have made accommodations for them.

I am excited to announce an additional alternative for families in Northampton County coming in 2020-2021. We have researched a variety of options to address the needs of our community. In response, we are working towards a virtual academy/program option for an initially limited number of students. Criteria for acceptance will be established in the coming weeks, a virtual interest session will be held and applications made available by mid to late June.

Stay tuned to Northampton County Schools as we work to develop our own beacons of light and hope aimed at attracting our students back to our district and maintaining our current students.

We have the power to transform education in Northampton County. We know that we must, we know that we desire to and we know that together we CAN!

In an effort to support families and teachers, the resources linked below have been created to provide weekly learning activities that do not require technology and are aligned to NC standards. Resources are organized by age and grade level. Knowing that children develop and learn at different rates please don't hesitate to look at resources outside of your child's age or grade level.

Weekly resources will continue to be added each Friday.

Our crews have been hard at work upgrading the old, original window blinds in the building and sealing/repairing the windows themselves from leaking! All of the original pink Formica windowsills in the building are in the process of being replaced with tough, Hyak black windowsills!

These may look like small upgrades but they are HUGE in terms of what a difference they make to the learning environments for when we can welcome our scholars back safely to the campus!! #NorthBeachNation #HyakStrong",0.0,"So thankful for our NB Facilities, Custodial and Maintenance team who is continuing to work hard to create an amazing environment for our kids!

Some students seem to struggle with motivation when doing their school work. Even seasoned teachers have trouble with motivating students from time to time. It is a big conversation in my head when I have students who are not progressing as I know what they are capable of. I wonder why they are having such a struggle. Are they bored? Are they being defiant? Is the lesson too difficult? Are they unsure of the directions? Ask yourself these same questions, and ask their teacher for suggestions of what to do. Include your student in the conversation as well, and you might consider asking him/her what they suggest. I am often surprised at what they say.

Such a good reminder for each of us parents who are struggling to support our kids in this unusual time!

Families,

Several have inquired about ""sending kids home early."" Once we have our scholars at school we typically would NOT send them home early. Parents make assumptions about their kids being at school for the day and frequently leave home based on that assumption. Many parents work during school and don't have adequate supervision plans should the buses return kids home at a ""non-typical"" time. We also know that in our region the conditions can vary wildly within 2-4 hours. By 3:00pm we could have sunshine and clear skies.

So.....school will be dismissed at normal time today. Our yellow limousine drivers will take extra care to deliver each of our scholars home, safely, at that time.

Parents should always feel empowered, individually, to make the decision that you believe is in the best interest of your child.

Safety is always our first and most important consideration. Thank you for your partnership as we work together for the good of our kids!

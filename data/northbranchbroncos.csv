So we did a thing...
•Long post alert•

Once again the class of 2020 has lived through tragic change and shown how resilient they can be.

They all came into the world either right before or in the recent wake of the horrible 9/11/01 and they complete their high school careers during a world wide pandemic.

This tell me these kids will not let anything stop them!

To commemorate their hard work, dedication, endurance, and down right tenacity, we couldn’t let it just “be done.” They deserved more and we DELIVERED (literally😝).

Today, Mr. Ehardt delivered their senior medals and serenaded them with their fight song. The boosters gifted them with a little basket of goodies to help them remember some of our times we’ve had and to help them a little with whatever life will bring them all in homemade/hometown parade style.

All pics gathered are posted (and some were poached from other parents 😉).

It was fun to see smiles for once and happy tears flowed free!

Some kids weren’t home but we hit all that were, and one mom got the surprise instead of the senior.

ENJOY!

Presenting the 16th graduating class from Quest High School!

Thank you to Quest High School Principal Mr. Hiltunen for honoring our students with their very own yard sign!

1. Yard signs will be displayed until Friday. You may pick up your yard sign between 4:00-5:30pm on Friday. After Friday, Mr. Rosser will store them at Quest, and you may email him to set up a time to pick them up.

2. Place them in your yard to show your Quest High School pride!

3. Please keep them in the best condition possible, as you will bring them back during graduation rehearsal, and we will display them outside on graduation day. After that, they are yours to keep!

4. Just a reminder, we will be adding a special video honoring our seniors on Thursday night at 7pm!

**We continue to work on setting a graduation day. Our graduation will likely be on either August 6th or 10th. We will decide on a definite day in June, and will post it here on our facebook page.",2.0,"Congratulations to our Quest Graduates!

Mrs. Sieradzki's class worked so hard last week researching endangered animals. They were introduced to all the species on the endangered species list during class, then were assigned a research project! Students took time researching about an animal of their choice. They studied the habitat, prey, physical characteristics, and conservation status of their animal. They wrote up a report,and then were asked to either create a digital project or poster representing what they learned. They did a phenomenal job, and the projects look amazing! Monday, they used their class time to present their projects to their class. Awesome job boys and girls!",2.0,"#NBStrong #ALLIN

During our first week of official online classes, I assigned the ""Happy Mail"" project to my students. The idea behind the project was to make small cartoons of everyday objects, and then create speech bubbles that show feelings about social distancing and staying home. Students could then send them in the mail, text a pic, or post on social media to someone they miss. I loved seeing the ideas my students came up with, and wanted to share a few with you here.
The students' pieces follow this order: Regan Healy, Bryce Barkowska, Isabel Allen, Jessica Peters, Kinsey Cook, Rheagan Bower, Riley Younge, Tessa Meier, Tracy Ludescher, and Taea Stockwell.

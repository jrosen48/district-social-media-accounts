List of assignments, meetings and due dates for the week from each class/teacher. 2. At least two online teaching sessions per week/per core class (either a virtual live classroom or a pre-recorded video of the lesson). 3. A live weekly check-in session (i.e. office hours) with each teacher so students can ask questions, or get more information and guidance.

The goal for this phase of the closure (through the last day) is to ensure that students are learning the critical standards necessary to help them successfully enter the next grade level with a strong foundation.

If you have any questions or concerns about anything during this last phase, please don't hesitate to reach out to your child's teacher(s), the building administrators or me. We are all here to help you and your children work through this crazy time in all of our lives. Be well!

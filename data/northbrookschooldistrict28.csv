Fourth- and fifth-grade students at Greenbriar School experienced the sport of fencing as part of a new unit in physical education designed by Mr. Norris and Mr. Zinanni. With the help and expertise of 12 fencers from the Glenbrook Fencing Team, the students were shown form and technique for what is considered a ‘conversation’ sport.
“Fencing is a sport about discipline, precision and respect,” said Dr. RJ Gravel, District 225 assistant superintendent of business services, who coaches the team. “It is grounded first and foremost in sportsmanship. There’s lots of eye contact, even though the protective mask, and in each move, you are talking to your opponent with your eyes, then out of nowhere you lunge in for a touch.”

Congratulations to all of the 52 students who participated in the Science Fair on Saturday, Jan. 25. The science fair is the culmination of semester-long projects created by students enrolled in the Independent Science Research Class. With support from Mr. Frye, Mrs. Mendelson and Mrs. Paull, the students select their own experiment and follow the scientific process to reach a conclusion. Each student presents his or her project and outlines the process and evidence used in their project to a panel of three judges during the science fair.
This year, 34 students received a gold award, qualifying them for the Illinois Junior Academy of Science regional competition, which will be held March 7 at Niles North High School. Students will be judged again for a chance to advance to the state competition.

After learning about the devastating fires in Australia, the students wanted to do a fundraiser to raise money to support the wildlife rescues there.

They created posters, a class letter and made presentations in each classroom to share their cause with students all over the school. Students and families are encouraged to donate their loose change over the next two weeks.

The money will be donated to the Australian Wildlife Information, Rescue and Education Service, Inc., (WIRES), which is Australia’s largest wildlife rescue organization.

This morning Governor Reynolds has given us new guidance on returning to school. Please be advised, as we have said all along, that this is a very fluid situation.



On Monday, July 20th we have a webinar with the Iowa Department of Education to get clarification on what this means to North Butler Schools.



As soon as we have a clear idea of what this means for us as we move forward we will release a statement to the staff and public of where we go from here.



I cannot tell you how much we appreciate your patience as we move forward.

Thank you for your understanding,

You can watch the northern lights tonight via live stream! The live cam is located at the Churchill Northern Studies Center in Manitoba, Canada. Since the cam is situated directly under the aurora oval, you’ll see amazing views of emerald green curtains of lights dancing in the arctic sky. Although the northern lights occur year-round, according to Explore.org, late winter and early spring are the best seasons to see the lights. So now’s the perfect time to watch the live stream.

The live cam is located at the Churchill Northern Studies Center in Manitoba, Canada. Since the cam is situated directly under the aurora oval, you’ll see amazing views of emerald green curtains of lights dancing in the arctic sky. Although the northern lights occur year-round, according to Explore.org, late winter and early spring are the best seasons to see the lights. So now’s the perfect time to watch the live stream. Tune in during the darkest hours of the night, which are generally from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. EDT. Visit Explore.org to tune in.",,,

In accordance with the recommendation from Governor Reynolds, North Butler Community Schools will close through Sunday April 12th at this time. All classes, activities, and practices are either cancelled or postponed during the closure. According to information that we have received, this closure could be extended prior to that date.

The administrative team is meeting regularly to discuss how we address the educational needs of our students, and the board will be meeting later in the week to make decisions for moving forward based upon the information that we have.

We are also working on making a meal program available at both sites. The details will be released soon.

We wanted to update you as we continue to monitor the Covid-19 situation. At this time, the Centers for Disease Control is advising school districts, like ours, located in areas where the outbreak is not currently significant to hold off on short-term closures as that may only exacerbate the spread to vulnerable/older adults the children would then be around. At the point where the outbreak may be more pervasive locally, we will consider alternative plans.

At this time we have decided to cancel any non-instructional/non-essential athletics and activities scheduled beginning Saturday, March 14 through Sunday, March 22 to help decrease the number of contacts for students and adults. This includes after school clubs, after school activities, all games/meets, practices, open weight rooms/gyms, any off-site practices or gatherings and any fine arts concerts, plays practices, and/or programs during that time period.

Title of Artwork: Love the Sun

Artist Statement: I was getting tired of winter, so I wanted to do something about spring. The work is a couple of birds watching the sun rise make a rainbow effect. I got the idea from a friend for the rainbow. I figured the birds could be in love, and they could love the sun. I had never done a piece working with more than one canvas. It was a little challenging but fun.

Artist Statement: I drew an ice cream cone from a photo I took this summer. I wanted to draw this because it reminds me of one of my favorite memories with my best friends.

North Butler's January Student Artist of the Month

Artist: Justine Hussey

Grade: 12

Title of Artwork: Tree of Memories

Artist Statement: I chose to title this artwork Tree of Memories because the original idea for the tree was that you would be able to hang meaningful things off the branches. I wanted to create something that could have special meaning. The tree with the swing is supposed to symbolize childhood. Then the things hanging off the tree could be in memory of someone or it could symbolize an event that meant a lot to you. Working with clay in a sculptural sense was new to me and a bit challenging. I’m not used to working with clay, so trying to get it to do what I wanted to was tough. The branches didn’t want to stay in place and things kept breaking. I like how it turned out, though. I so have a few ideas inspired by this artwork, but I’m not sure if I want to pursue them.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2984213701597957&id=499262443426441,,0.0,"JUSTINE

Title of Artwork: Anatomical Dummy No. 1 (Little Man)

Artist Statement: I used clay, glaze, and tempera paint, to create my Little Man. I was inspired by my own interests in art, as well as the anatomical models made around the 1600-1800s. It was challenging to sculpt and fit his organs correctly in his belly. After making my anatomical model, I was inspired to make more model figures following separate themes. I wouldn’t mind trying out different faces and color combinations.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2971116642907663&id=499262443426441,,0.0,"GRACE

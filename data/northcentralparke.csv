The Booster Tent at the Parke County Fair is needing workers during the Fair to be held July 13-16. The Fair will be a lot different this year with just having livestock shows where the animals arrive on the day they show and then go home. There will be no breakfast and all shifts will begin at 10:00. Some days will be shorter than others because of the shows that will be occurring on that day.

To All Future Sixth Grade Parents:
Sixth grade students have the two exciting elective choices next school year at Parke Heritage Middle School, band and choir. If school were in session, your child will be testing out a band instrument with representatives from Paige’s Music with the hope of finding an instrument they love and continue studying in band, or if singing is what they love, students will be encouraged to sign up for choir.
Click on the video link to see students with their instruments and to get more information about signing up for sixth grade band.

She was able to participate in the Area 5 livestock judging contest that was done virtually online. she has 15 minutes to judge each class of market hogs, breeding gilts, breeding heifers, market steers, breeding ewes, market lambs, and breeding does. Then 10 minutes to answer questions over a few classes. This was all done by videos. Mandy placed 1st over all in breeding does (goats) and then went on to place 4th over all.

With the recent announcement by the Governor and State Superintendent of Education, all schools are now required to complete 160 days of instruction to count 2019-2020 as a full school year. Subsequently, we are considering some options regarding the best way to complete the year for North Central Parke Community School families and students. If we alter our current Tuesday through Thursday eLearning, we would be able to complete the required 160 day directive earlier than our current three day a week model will allow.

NCP students and staff have many unique talents with a wide range of interests. There are many that enjoy the outdoors, fishing, painting, cooking and music. One staff member has a hidden talent of being a circus performer! Another staff member has the hobby of beekeeping.

April Fools Day is a good day to get a little wacky. Students and staff showed off their wacky sides with wacky socks, hair and more. Also included are some photos from “Miss you Monday” and “Tales Tuesday”.
The theme for Thursday is “Talent Thursday”- take a photo of you doing something you enjoy. This can include artwork, creating things, baking, singing, etc.

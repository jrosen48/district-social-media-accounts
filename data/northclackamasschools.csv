Hello Rowe Community:

We hope that you are all safe, secure, healthy, and well at this time. We've missed you greatly, and we've been thinking a lot about you over the last couple of weeks.

Today, Rowe Middle School officially begins online supplemental education. That means for the next week, Rowe teachers will have assignments posted on their websites and Google Classrooms that students can complete. These supplemental assignments are optional.

However, on Monday, April 13th, we will be moving towards online schooling until Governor Brown decides it is safe for us to return to school. Starting Monday, April 13th, your assignments will be graded and assessed, so let's take this week to learn how to navigate an online education platform.

This is going to be a new experience for most people involved, but we're confident that our community will be successful navigating this experience together.

Much love to all of you.
Peace.

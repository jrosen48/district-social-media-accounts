May 14 at 4:04 PM · Latham, NY ·

Colonie EMS and Colonie PD found out Tuesday evening that there was a need to stock the pantry for the North Colonie Central School District Back Pack Program.

The BackPack Program helps alleviate child hunger by discreetly providing hungry children with backpacks full of nutritious and easy-to-prepare food on Friday afternoons so they have food to eat throughout the weekend. During the closure of schools, the program has been providing food more than ever.

In just over 24 hours the members of Colonie EMS donated enough food to fill the back of an ambulance! Partnering with Colonie PD the food pantry got quite the stock up today!

It is nothing short of amazing the dedication to the community the members of Colonie Public Safety have - we are truly proud to be part of such an amazing team!

Each year, the Ogden Standard Examiner, awards a few teachers, ‚ÄúThe Apple for the Teacher‚Äù award. Depending on the number of nominations and votes, they select winners. NDPA has always been well represented in the list of those teachers nominated. However, this year, ANGELA ELLSWORTH, our new kindergarten teacher, received so many nominations that she is in the running for the top prize.

We were contacted earlier today by the Standard examiner to let us know that she is one of the finalists; if she receives enough ‚Äúvotes‚Äù she could win. This is where we need your help. Please follow the link: http://cares.standard.net/apple-for-teacher-2019/ and vote for our wonderful teacher. Pass it along or share with as many as your friends and family as you can. This is a great way to recognize the hard work ALL our teachers put into teaching. It would be awesome to have Angela recognized in this way.

You can vote once each day! Get in and vote for this phenomenal teacher.

Apple for the Teacher 2019 - SE Cares",8.0,"Dear NDPA folks,

Each year, the Ogden Standard Examiner, awards a few teachers, ‚ÄúThe Apple for the Teacher‚Äù award. Depending on the number of nominations and votes, they select winners. NDPA has always been well represented in the list of those teachers nominated. However, this year, ANGELA ELLSWORTH, our new kindergarten teacher, received so many nominations that she is in the running for the top prize.

We were contacted earlier today by the Standard examiner to let us know that she is one of the finalists; if she receives enough ‚Äúvotes‚Äù she could win. This is where we need your help. Please follow the link: http://cares.standard.net/apple-for-teacher-2019/ and vote for our wonderful teacher. Pass it along or share with as many as your friends and family as you can. This is a great way to recognize the hard work ALL our teachers put into teaching. It would be awesome to have Angela recognized in this way.

You can vote once each day! Get in and vote for this phenomenal teacher.

Every year, during graduation, I make a point of acknowledging any students who are entering military service. It was brought to my attention that during my remarks at this year's ceremonies while recognizing our students who were going to military schools or enlisting, while I mentioned all of the students' names and where they were going. I forgot to mention that two of the students that were joining the United States Marine Corps. I read their names and they stood, but I lost my place and left out their branch of service.

Our students deserve praise for making this choice and I have always felt strongly about recognizing them at our graduation each year.

I sincerely apologize to our two students and their families for this oversight, and I wish them all the best as they move on to their career in the Marine Corps.

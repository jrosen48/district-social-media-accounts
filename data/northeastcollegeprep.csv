Among the high schools were: Avalon, Cristo Rey, Edison, Exploration, Fridley, Hiawatha Collegiate, Park Center, Patrick Henry and St. Anthony High School.

Aemun chose Cristo Rey as the high school she would like to attend. Just this week, she found out she had been accepted.

When asked about why she chose Cristo Rey Aemun, pictured here with her acceptance letter, said, ""I am mostly excited about meeting new friends and teachers and going to my job.

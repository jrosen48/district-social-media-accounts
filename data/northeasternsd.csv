REMINDER: Free Breakfast & Lunch for ALL STUDENTS - through Dec.

Absolutely ALL STUDENTS can receive free lunch and breakfast through Dec. 31, 2020. You don't need to do anything (no applications, etc.). If/when your child goes through the lunch line, his/her order will simply come up as $0.00.

If you typically receive free or reduced lunch and you have not completed the application, please complete the application so that your child continues to receive this service throughout the rest of the school year (so it doesn't end in December). Free and reduced lunch count also impacts other programming, so we still want to have that count recorded accurately for the district.

This program is exclusively available to students entering their senior year of high school. AIM is a one-week summer program where selected applicants interested in getting a taste of cadet life are immersed in the USCGA experience. AIM is considered to be the most realistic service academy summer orientation program. Having been selected from a highly competitive pool of exceptional applicants. Emily will work directly with Coast Guard officers, cadets, and faculty members who take great pride in having the opportunity to show prospective cadets what being a member of the Coast Guard is all about. AIM will help Emily discover whether the Academy experience is truly what she wants from college vs. a more traditional college route. This summer's AIM program will be held virtually due to COVID-19. Way to go Emily! #bobcatproud🐾",2020-07-07 08:00:40,,

When their nation called, they answered. When their state asked “Who will go”, they said “Send me!”. I couldn’t be more proud of these young adults. Their patriotism and dedication to this great country and commonwealth are what we as Americans and Pennsylvanians should all strive for every day.

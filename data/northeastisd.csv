Natalie Watts takes great pride in introducing new books to her students at Huebner Elementary School. One of her favorites is Creepy Carrots by Aaron Reynolds. The acclaimed children‚Äôs author has visited many North East ISD elementary campuses over the years, including several stops at Huebner. Reynolds and Watts bonded over their love of literature and remain friends to this day.

When Watts opened her copy of his latest book, Rescuing Mrs. Birdley, she was shocked to find her name in the dedication section.

Regan Sanchez calls the Bradley Middle School library home. She‚Äôs beloved on campus for her love of books, commitment to her students, and creative, interactive activities. This all contributed to a special recognition. On Thursday, May 28, Sanchez was surprised with the Whatateacher Award after submitting a lesson plan that caught Whataburger attention.

Sanchez created a lesson called ‚ÄúWhat-a-Me,‚Äô that led students in an interactive experience helping them identify their negative thinking and ‚Äúsplatting‚Äù it away so they could focus on positive character traits. They also used an interactive sketching app to create a positive visualization of their best traits.

As part of her prize, Sanchez received Whataburger for a year, as well as a basket full of Whataburger swag. Sanchez is also proud to be Bradley‚Äôs Trinity Prize campus nominee. Congratulations Regan! #RootEdBradley",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3199801933405258&id=574359215949556,,0.0,"#theNEISDway --Bradley librarian honored with Whatateacher Award

Regan Sanchez calls the Bradley Middle School library home. She‚Äôs beloved on campus for her love of books, commitment to her students, and creative, interactive activities. This all contributed to a special recognition. On Thursday, May 28, Sanchez was surprised with the Whatateacher Award after submitting a lesson plan that caught Whataburger attention.

Sanchez created a lesson called ‚ÄúWhat-a-Me,‚Äô that led students in an interactive experience helping them identify their negative thinking and ‚Äúsplatting‚Äù it away so they could focus on positive character traits. They also used an interactive sketching app to create a positive visualization of their best traits.

As part of her prize, Sanchez received Whataburger for a year, as well as a basket full of Whataburger swag. Sanchez is also proud to be Bradley‚Äôs Trinity Prize campus nominee. Congratulations Regan! #RootEdBradley",2020-05-30 17:26:29,,

Madison High School junior Sabrina Sanchez is as busy as ever. Between completing her schoolwork online and everything else that life has thrown at her over the past month, she‚Äôs still making time to give back. Sanchez started sewing facemasks complete with pockets for filters and adjustable nose pieces. So far, she‚Äôs stitched together more than 80 masks, and she has no plans to slow down. Twenty-six of the facemasks have been gifted to people in need, including those who couldn't afford one, as well as cancer and dialysis patients.

KSAT had three teams qualify to compete at the state level. The ""Insta-Investigators"" team won 3rd place in the Middle School division. All three teams from Krueger/KSAT presented a problem/solution that they felt needed to be addressed in the community. The ideas were well received by the judges, and the students look forward to implementing their ideas in the coming weeks.

In addition to participating in the State Civics Fair, the students met with staff members from Senator Jose Menendez' office. They shared their project ideas with his staff and enjoyed finding out how they can make a difference in their community.

Speak Out! 2020 State Civics Fair sponsored by UT Moody College of Communication at the Texas Capitol.

KSAT had three teams qualify to compete at the state level. The ""Insta-Investigators"" team won 3rd place in the Middle School division. All three teams from Krueger/KSAT presented a problem/solution that they felt needed to be addressed in the community. The ideas were well received by the judges, and the students look forward to implementing their ideas in the coming weeks.

Social Emotional Learning (SEL) plays a vital role in maintaining and nurturing healthy habits. SEL is an ongoing effort across NEISD and these initiatives would be impossible without our amazing counselors who address the emotional health of our students and teachers every day.

Anthony Cisneros left the International School of the Americas (ISA) behind when he graduated in 2015, but his support system on campus remains intact. Cisneros received his commission as an Army officer during a special ceremony at Texas State University, and two key members of the LEE High School JROTC program took part in the ceremony. Former Senior Army Instructor Troy Ramirez read the commissioning oath aloud, while current Army Instructor Hector Reyes shared a ‚Äòfirst salute‚Äô with Cisneros. Traditionally, the soldier who salutes the newly-pinned officer is given a decorative unit coin in appreciation.

Cisneros earned a four-year Army ROTC scholarship to Texas State University. He graduated in December of 2019 with a degree in Electrical Engineering.

Community service is something every JROTC cadet embraces once they commit to joining the program. Cadets at LEE High School are encouraging service during the holiday season with their most successful food drive yet. The student-organized project collected 1,436 items that will be donated to North East ISD‚Äôs McKinney-Vento Homeless Project, which includes a food pantry for students and families in need.

‚ÄúParticipating in the food drive was a great experience knowing that we contributed to our community and people in need,‚Äù said cadet Veronica Perez.

The McKinney-Vento Homelessness Project is committed to ensuring that all NEISD children and youth in homeless situations have the opportunity to attend, enroll in and succeed in school. Through this holiday food drive, cadets channeled their energy and passion into an organization that benefits their peers and community members.

Community service is something every JROTC cadet embraces once they commit to joining the program. Cadets at LEE High School are encouraging service during the holiday season with their most successful food drive yet. The student-organized project collected 1,436 items that will be donated to North East ISD‚Äôs McKinney-Vento Homeless Project, which includes a food pantry for students and families in need.

‚ÄúParticipating in the food drive was a great experience knowing that we contributed to our community and people in need,‚Äù said cadet Veronica Perez.

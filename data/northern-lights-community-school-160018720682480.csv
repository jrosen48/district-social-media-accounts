Done! Now you will be entered to win a NEW target face, and by following MN NASP on Facebook you will get to see what important information is posted to our page throughout the year!

The five lucky winners of this drawing will be announced at the MN NASP State Tournament Awards Ceremony on March 30, 2019. You, your coach, or a member of your team must be present at the ceremony to win. You do not have to participate at the state tournament to be eligible for this drawing.

We would also like to thank Arrowmat for the generous donation of the target faces. This wouldn't be possible without them.",2019-03-30 09:25:06,,

A different panel of judges will be evaluating winners from the 5 regions and selecting the 2017-18 Statewide Winner to the YES competition, good luck.

A few additional perks for being the winner in the NE Region. 1) I will be awarding your team a $300 prize sometime before the end of the school year.

Community Service yesterday and today offering FREE reusable bags with our school logo to invite people to enroll at NLCS in addition to inviting people in the community to attend our upcoming Climate Change Convening on May 11, 2018 at the Eagles 5-8pm. Thank you to the following businesses for allowing us to hand them out to your customers...(both Super One stores, Home depot, Goodwill, Ace, Cole’s Hardware, and Glen’s Army Navy...we discovered many businesses will
Not allow you to do this as corporate policies prohibit it.). It was a beautiful couple days and it was amazing to students how hard it is to give away a FREE bag, and also saddened us as an environmental school to see so many people refusing a bag, and using plastic instead.",0.0,"Donna Hanson-Kaasa

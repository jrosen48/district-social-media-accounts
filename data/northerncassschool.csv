We are currently working on device assignments for the 2020-2021 school year. If your Learner has opted for the Virtual Academy you can disregard this message and I'll be reaching out to you separately.

For those returning to the building you will be assigned a school device. However, some Learners have opted to utilize their own device in the past rather than use the school's device. We are perfectly onboard with that and will work to make sure you have everything you need on your own device. There is one change with that. Beginning this year we are requiring those using their own device to also pay the Technology Fee. The reason behind this is there are many other things in the Tech Departments this helps to pay for, WiFi, apps, software, etc...

If your Learner(s) plans to use a device from home this year will you please send me an email, darin.eller@northerncassschool.com, as soon as you can so we can account for that when assigning devices.

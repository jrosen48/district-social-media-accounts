I hope you and your family are enjoying the nice weather!

I would like to share the most current Preliminary Guidance from the Pennsylvania Department of Education on returning to school. Northern Potter is required to use this guidance to complete a Reopening Health and Safety Plan. It is our intention to have students and staff return to school as “normal” as possible on August 26, 2020. In the Green and Yellow Phase, all students will be in school everyday according to the adopted 2020-2021 school calendar. If the governor places us in the Red Phase, students and staff will be required to teach and learn remotely.

Due to the stay home order and the lack of safety involved in receiving cardboard boxes and making door-to-door deliveries, the Gertrude Hawk order has been canceled. Refunds will be processed. Mrs. Pomeroy will be calling each family who participated within the next few days to discuss the refund process.

Note: Those people who ordered online and shipped to their home have already received their products. Students will receive the profit from those sales.

We are very sorry about this situation. It was beyond our control. We tried alternate solutions, but safety is our number one concern right now. This was the best action to fit that concern.

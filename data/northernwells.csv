Due to recent promotions/departures on the ABC21 Weather Team, we are down a couple of meteorologists. But never fear! We always have you covered :)

Please welcome Norwell High School grad and current Ball State meteorology student Gabe Prough back to ABC21 as a part-time meteorologist!

His live debut will be Friday evening with me on the 5:00 newscast, but you'll primarily be seeing him helping out on weekends, and occasionally mornings. Please give his page a like (https://www.facebook.com/ProughWX) and follow along!

Finally, stay tuned for future announcements regarding our team/weather products as we have some exciting things in store!",4.0,"Awesome!!

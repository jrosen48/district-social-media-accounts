Attention Parents and Guardians:
Two important items that went home with students on Friday were Chrome book Agreements and Chrome book Insurance forms. Chrome book Agreements give students an idea of what they should and shouldn’t do with the Chrome book. Parents & Guardians are encouraged to look this over with their student and then sign and return the form to PCMS.
Chrome book insurance is optional, but offers a great value as well as peace of mind. The least expensive repair for Chrome books is very similar to the total cost of the insurance for the year. The serial number needed for the form can be found on the bottom of the device where it says “Service Tag”. An example picture can be seen below. Insurance payments can be returned with your student or mailed to PCMS (Attn: Treasurer) at 1106 N. Embree Street, 47670.",2.0,"Important reminders for PCMS parents.

Public Service Announcement:
We have heard from a handful of parents who have told us that they have checked their student's 20-21 schedule in Harmony (our student management system) and it does not seem to be correct.

Student schedules for the upcoming school year are not finished; they are still being completed and balanced. In fact, PCMS staff have currently set parent's and student's ability to see schedules Harmony to ""Off"" in order to avoid confusion until all schedules are completed. Unfortunately this feature is not working. We have reached out to Harmony in order to find a solution, but at this time have not heard back from them.

Typically, we release completed student schedules in early July, and we are on schedule to do so again this year. We will email parents as well as post a notification on this page when schedules are complete and have been released.

PCHS Graduation has been rescheduled for July 18, 2020, at 2pm, in Tiger Arena. Mandatory graduation practice for seniors is scheduled for Friday, July 17th, at 12pm.

This school year has ended in a way that none of us would have ever wanted or dreamt of. Having to reschedule an important event like graduation is never easy and we realize it may cause conflicts with already set plans or vacations. We also realize that several seniors will not be able to attend in July due to prior commitments such as Basic Training, early college programs, job opportunities, etc. and for that, we will always be sad and full of regret.

Therefore, PCHS has also scheduled a “Parade of Seniors” event on May 23rd at 2pm. Information regarding the route will be posted at a later date. Detailed information has been emailed out to all seniors.

While we will sadly not be holding our day of service this year, we would still Iike to continue the tradition of an 8th Grade Class t-shirt this year (free of charge to students). To do so, we would like all 8th grade students to tell us what t-shirt size they would like. You can do this using the Google form at the following link: https://forms.gle/F4tdKShCm6uqEt2K8

Attention 8th Grade Students (and their parents and guardians):

As you may or may not know, for the past few years, the 8th grade has gotten class t-shirts in the spring that they wear while participating in our annual day of service (the morning of the last day of school).

While we will sadly not be holding our day of service this year, we would still Iike to continue the tradition of an 8th Grade Class t-shirt this year (free of charge to students). To do so, we would like all 8th grade students to tell us what t-shirt size they would like. You can do this using the Google form at the following link: https://forms.gle/F4tdKShCm6uqEt2K8

Please make sure to click submit when you are finished. We miss all of you! If you have already submitted the form, you do not need to do so again.",2020-05-01 22:58:36,,

We are planning to get some great photos of students at NI’s Prom Event on August 1.
But we know this date may present conflicts for some of our students. If you are unable to attend — or even if you’re planning to attend but have been hanging out in your fancy duds — please share photos of your prom looks to kellyruth.winter@northiowa.org! We’d like to get as many of our juniors and seniors with their prom looks in the yearbook as possible!

We still have plans to take photos in caps and gowns, etc. -- this is just a spring class photo, a nice addition to the one we took on the first day of school (included here). We’re spreading the word about this photo in a lot of different ways -- social media is just one more way.

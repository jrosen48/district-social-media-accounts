Due to the pandemic, Bedford North Lawrence will have to cancel the 2020 Prom. We held out on canceling for as long as we could, knowing that Prom is a significant event in our students' lives, and we wanted to do everything we could to preserve the tradition. Unfortunately, we do not see how this can be accomplished in the current state of the pandemic.

NLCS is working with the Lawrence County Health Dept. and making modifications to our graduation plan as needed. At this time NLCS is still planning to have our graduation on Friday, July 24th at 7:30 p.m. Additional information will be updated on the NLCS website by Monday, July 20th at 3:00 p.m.

We held out on canceling for as long as we could, knowing that Prom is a significant event in our students' lives, and we wanted to do everything we could to preserve the tradition. Unfortunately, we do not see how this can be accomplished in the current state of the pandemic.

NLCS is working with the Lawrence County Health Dept. and making modifications to our graduation plan as needed. At this time NLCS is still planning to have our graduation on Friday, July 24th at 7:30 p.m. Additional information will be updated on the NLCS website by Monday, July 20th at 3:00 p.m.

Today is the day! Our Boys travel to Jasper this AM for Sectional competition at Jasper High School!

The team went to prelims and fought hard to get in to scoring positions on Thursday at prelims. Two relays are currently seeded 1 and the third is seeded 2. The boys have at least 2 in scoring positions in the majority of individual events.

This is going to be a fight to see who can take home a Sectional crown today, so stay tuned in. Diving prelims begin at 10 AM with Swimming & Diving Finals starting at 2PM.

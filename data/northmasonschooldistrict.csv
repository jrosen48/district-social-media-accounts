Reopening school in the fall is on many people’s minds right now and I wish I could say I have a crystal clear picture of what it will look like.
The pandemic and our response as a community, state and nation are in constant flux.
What I do know, is we are trying to plan for every possible scenario.
In response to current guidance, we are planning to provide students with an all-remote learning option or a hybrid model where they come to school in person two or more days a week.
If the situation with the pandemic continues as it is right now, we will need to be ready to pivot to Continuous Learning 2.0, a much more robust version of our experience in the Spring.

District office staff continue planning to ensure we are ready for what comes.

I am thankful we have such a dedicated team!

As things change and as we get closer to the start of the year, we will let you know what is happening.

For now, thank you for your commitment to our students!

On Friday June 12th we will be delivering 2 days’ worth of food (this includes meals for Monday, June 15th) and the last homework packets from the elementary schools. We will also be collecting any last homework to be turned-in.

Monday, June 15th there will be no food /homework delivery.

Tuesday, June 16th we will be delivering a weeks’ worth of meals (five breakfasts/five lunches).

June 17th-22nd there will be no delivery of homework or food.

To the individual taxpayer the increase of 37 cents from $1.99/$1,000 to $2.36/$1,000 would equate to an 18.6% increase in what they are currently paying.

If the District were able to collect the full amount of the levy in the first year ($5.9M), it would equate to a $1.3M revenue increase over the levy dollars budgeted to be collected in 2020 ($4.6M). This is a 28.3% increase.

For comparison: In 2016, when our last levy was approved at $2.36/$1,000, the state minimum wage was $9.47. In 2020, the minimum wage is $13.50. This is an increase of 42.6%.

To the individual taxpayer the increase of 37 cents from $1.99/$1,000 to $2.36/$1,000 would equate to an 18.6% increase in what they are currently paying.

If the District were able to collect the full amount of the levy in the first year ($5.9M), it would equate to a $1.3M revenue increase over the levy dollars budgeted to be collected in 2020 ($4.6M). This is a 28.3% increase.

""Sandy is a life speaker! She speaks uplifting messages to staff, students, and families. She is an excited adult for the kids she works with. She never shies away from a task she has been asked to do but rather does it whole-hearted! She will work on the same concept with a little person over and over with gusto!""

""I would like to nominate Sandy Balant for the employee spotlight. She always goes above and beyond her duties. She is always available for whatever is needed. She always shows love to students even at hard times. Sandy is always on the move to assist where needed.""

Thank you for all you do for NMSD Sandy!",2020-01-07 11:00:46,,

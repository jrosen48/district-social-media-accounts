Monday, April 6, is a professional development day for our staff. We will still have professional development for our staff remotely, meaning students will begin receiving new assignments on April 7. All extracurricular activities on the school calendar will not take place because of the state school closure order. We will reassess on May 1, 2020 to decide if any of the events will be rescheduled based on guidance from the state and federal governments. Any information contained in this communication is subject to change, as the fluidity of events will dictate the level of response from district officials.

Dear parents and guardians,
Recently, you received a letter from your district explaining steps that Lifetouch is taking to rectify some of the issues parents have had with their fall picture packages. One of those steps was to print a picture package free of charge for every student in the district. That package was supposed to be delivered before Winter break. Unfortunately, we continue to have challenges in our manufacturing facilities that have delayed that delivery until after break. We sincerely apologize for that delay. We value the trust you and your school places in us to capture your child’s school memories. We hope to have our manufacturing issues resolved soon so we can get back to providing the same quality and service that school communities have grown accustomed to with Lifetouch.

Thank you,

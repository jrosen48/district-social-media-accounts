We have an issue during student drop-off time in the morning. We need your help. After our staff has entered the building, some families are parking in the drop-off lane to walk their child to the building. This is causing a backup. Other families then try to go around the parked cars and are pulling out in front of families trying to exit the drop-off lane. The left lane is the exit lane in the morning, not a passing lane. Please remember that if you want to walk your child to the door of the building, you need to park in the parking lot and use the crosswalk.

We appreciate everyone taking a little extra time - and slowing down - to make sure we are not creating an unsafe situation for our children and our families.

Thank you for your assistance!

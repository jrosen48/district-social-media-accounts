How many times do you hear “What’s for dinner?
Soon you could answer “We’re having East of Chicago Italian Subs!”

The NHS cheerleaders are taking Italian Sub orders (without lettuce and tomato) to help pay for our *NEW* Uniforms. East of Chicago Subs are made fresh in Galion, by owner/operator and past Northmor graduate, Jared Thew.

See any Northmor JV/Varsity Cheerleader or coach to order. Payment is due upon ordering and all orders and payment must be to a cheerleader by Monday, September 22nd. (Cash or checks only—checks made to “Northmor Athletic Boosters”)
$8.00 for a 12 inch sub.
Sub Pick-up will be in front of the Northmor Board of Education office on Thursday, October 1st between 4-6pm. A cheerleader will deliver to your car!

Its Italian Week at Northmor! Support Northmor Boosters on Wednesday, September 30th with their Drive Through Spaghetti Dinner, and then have a fresh made Italian sub for dinner Thursday, all while supporting our Golden Knight Athletes!

Thank you all for your patience and cooperation as we navigate all these changes together! Today was a great 1st day of school! We are thrilled to be back in the building. Here are a couple of reminders to help us continue to move in a positive direction:

1. When dropping off in the morning please pull all the way to the end. Make sure your student(s) are ready to get out of the vehicle. As soon as you have stopped they may get out and enter either door they need to go in. Drop and go!

2. Water bottles may be sent to school with your child.

3. Dismissal went better than I expected. Hang in there with us these first few days. We will get the system down and it will move much faster. Getting tags assigned was a major accomplishment!

As always, thank you for choosing Northmor Local Schools. Fell free to reach out if you have any questions, concerns or helpful suggestions!

Below is this week’s sports schedule. Guidance for spectator attendance for all athletic contests are expected to be released by the Governor’s office on Tuesday. Once received, we will send out our district-specific procedures. The first event under new spectator procedures would be Saturday’s home Varsity Volleyball tri with Clear Fork and Lucas. When our contests are away, host schools may have variations of spectator procedures. We will get that information out to you when we receive it.

Thursday’s Varsity Football scrimmage is unlikely unless the Ohio Department of Health’s contact sports order is changed before then, but we are waiting to see what Tuesday’s expected Governor announcement brings before cancelling.
Thank you for your patience and understanding as we navigate all of the schedule and procedural changes that continue to occur as a result of COVID.",2.0,"Northmor Athletics

The basketball and football programs have teamed up to create a unique fundraiser given the unique football season beginning in a couple of weeks. Below is a link if you are interested in participating. We had to be creative to supplement financial loss as we will not be having concessions this fall and the football team will be unable to host their annual pie auction. One entry and you are in for the entire season, you do not have to be present to win, and you can win multiple times in a season or even a game! The prize is cash and one win guarantees at least your money back. The flyer is lengthy but all of the details should be there!

Ask questions in the comments and I will answer them! Also feel free to send a direct message or email if you are not comfortable commenting your question. I will be at the school next week to collect any entries from people that would like to participate, just let me know a time! Thank you for your continued and constant support of our programs.

This year the preseason OHSAA parent meetings will only be done via FinalForms, as the entire presentation is in each child’s set of forms. Coaches will still be conducting preseason team parent meetings either via Zoom or in person. Your coach will be contacting you about when your team’s meeting will take place, if they haven’t already. Please make sure all FinalForms, including a current physical, are complete for all Fall athletes.

Coaches are scheduled to meet with Mr. Hershberger today to go over and walkthrough our district-specific protocols in regards to Fall sports practice and contest procedures. We are committed to the health and safety of our student athletes and coaches. There is still a great deal of uncertainty that lies ahead with Fall sports.

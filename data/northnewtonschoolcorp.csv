During this dissection, students learned about the major blood vessels of the heart and their functions, including taking measurements. Students also demonstrated their knowledge of the four chambers of the heart and the different valves and their location and function. The students were amazed of the difference in size between a cow's heart and a sheep‘s heart. Some of the students even held the heart up to their own chest area to compare just how large a cow's heart is, compared to their own.

The students have been studying the cardiovascular, blood and lymphatic systems. This lab will culminate with students demonstrating their skills by taking blood pressure readings on each other.

A special thanks to Hanford’s Meat Packing for providing us with the cow hearts that were used in this lab!

The tax increase in the SKRR School District is largely caused by two reasons. The MN State Legislature has added a Local Optional Revenue (LOR) Authority to the District's Levy. The LOR Levy authority will be removed by the School Board at the truth and taxation hearing on December 11. Adjusting the LOR downward will reduce the District's levy increase by about half. The second reason for the District tax increase is due to an increase in student enrollment. This is not within the School Board's control to reduce. This increase is notably due to Open Enrollment from other School Districts.

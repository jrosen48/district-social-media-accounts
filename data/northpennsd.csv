We did it! Yesterday we wrapped up our emergency meal program that we've had open since March! With over 340,000 free meals served, we couldn't be more proud.
Monday marks a new school year & we're ready to continue doing what we do best-feed our NP students! Check your inboxes, an email is going out this morning with important updates regarding our program. This Monday, our distribution time will be the same, from 11am-1pm. Families only have to come out once next week and receive a whole week of meals!
All elementary schools and Penndale Middle School will be open for curbside pick up (with the exception of Knapp due to construction, we encourage those students to visit Penndale!).

Do you qualify for P-EBT? Families could receive up to $370 per child if qualified. If you already receive free/reduced meals at school, you do not have to do anything further. If finances have changed in your household, we are still accepting free & reduced applications at SchoolCafe.com to help families receive this funding from DHS.

Each spring, members of the key club clean up the garden and plant flowers in preparation for their annual Memorial Day service held in honor and remembrance of fallen NPHS graduates. Due to social distancing regulations, the key club was unable to assemble for such purposes this year.

Shout out to NPSD Facilities team members Christina Hazzard, Brandy Potser and Steve Fitzsimmons for stepping up and helping this special garden bloom.

Although the NPHS Key Club is not able to hold its annual Memorial Day ceremony, NPTV will be re-airing last year’s ceremony in honor of our North Penn heroes on Monday, May 25 at 11:00 am on Comcast local channel 28 and Verizon local channel 29.

Due to social distancing regulations, the key club was unable to assemble for such purposes this year.

Shout out to NPSD Facilities team members Christina Hazzard, Brandy Potser and Steve Fitzsimmons for stepping up and helping this special garden bloom.

Although the NPHS Key Club is not able to hold its annual Memorial Day ceremony, NPTV will be re-airing last year’s ceremony in honor of our North Penn heroes on Monday, May 25 at 11:00 am on Comcast local channel 28 and Verizon local channel 29.

This is similar to Dear Abby.

Our first ""Ask Franklin"" question was ""Prom is coming up. What is a good/creative way to ask a boy/girl to prom?""

Franklin's answer? ""Roses are red, donuts are the bomb, do me a favor and come with me to prom."" And we think adding the ""prom"" donuts wouldn't hurt either. ;)

We encourage inquiries for Franklin when seeking advice. Individuals can inquire through email to: dmincks@northridgevikings.org

Look over the Summer Bucket List below, choose at least 3 that you would like to do this Summer and tell me why (I realize some of these activities will more than likely be unable to happen due to Covid 19, but we can be optimistic😉). I look forward to seeing what everyone is hoping to do😊

*Three things I look forward to this Summer are;
1. Making homemade lemonade 🍋
2. Watching fireworks 🧨
3. Playing mini golf ⛳️

As you complete any of the tasks you chose, have someone record or take a picture of you and post your video/pic below.

Keep those bodies active and moving, and make sure you get out and enjoy the warm weather this week👍🏻",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10164026571180554&id=358548485553,,0.0,"Mrs. H’s Monday PE Challenge:

As we approach Summer and the warm weather it brings us here in Michigan, let’s start to look forward to some outdoor fun☀️

Challenge:

Look over the Summer Bucket List below, choose at least 3 that you would like to do this Summer and tell me why (I realize some of these activities will more than likely be unable to happen due to Covid 19, but we can be optimistic😉). I look forward to seeing what everyone is hoping to do😊

*Three things I look forward to this Summer are;
1. Making homemade lemonade 🍋
2. Watching fireworks 🧨
3. Playing mini golf ⛳️

As you complete any of the tasks you chose, have someone record or take a picture of you and post your video/pic below.

Keep those bodies active and moving, and make sure you get out and enjoy the warm weather this week👍🏻",2020-06-01 11:55:57,,

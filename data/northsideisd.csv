Today was not the first day of school we imagined. I’m sorry.

I know it’s been a frustrating day as we have all struggled with numerous technical issues. We are still working with our MyNISD Portal vendor to resolve the access issue. This was not simply a matter of a lack of bandwidth or a network failure.

In the meantime, we have a temporary solution that will allow us to get up and running as we had hoped with Schoology. That link was pushed to nisd.net earlier this afternoon.

Please know that we will not count students absent or penalize them for any assignments today because they were not able to access the virtual learning platform.

I appreciate the flexibility and creativity of our teachers, students and parents as they did their best to reach out to allow students to connect today.

As the week unfolds, we will keep you updated with any new information.

It will get better. We will get better. Thank you for your patience.

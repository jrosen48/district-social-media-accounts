Many people use the Rivers and Lakes around our communities and villages to travel on in the fall and winter. The North Slope Borough School District reminds you that, during fall freeze up, these lakes and rivers are extremely DANGEROUS.

Traveling on them by snow machine and or on foot when the ice is thin can cause you to break through. Even though the lakes and rivers are sometimes shallow, you can still get caught under the ice and drown.
PLEASE, remind students to not ride or walk on thin ice!

Signs of rabies include: stumbling, aggression, and biting inanimate objects.
Please call the NSB Veterinary Clinic at (907)852-0277 if you witness a fox exhibiting these abnormal behavioral signs.
The rodent (lemmings, weasels, voles) population is increased this year resulting in foxes getting closer to town.

Please vaccinate your animals for rabies every year!
Thank you!",2018-09-27 14:07:45,,

Former Patriots, Jon Goldsberry, Seth Johannemann, Alex Bettag and several former teammates of Jon Goldsberry that played Division 1 and/or Professional Football have joined him to kick off the First Annual Southern Indiana Football and Life Skills Youth Summer Camp. The camp will be for Grades 7-12 (entering 2013 season) and will be held at Heritage Hills High School on June 21-22.

Football players in the Tri-State area deserve an opportunity to meet and learn from a group of guys that have had the opportunity to experience something many kids dream of, but few actually get the chance to do.

This camp won't apply to all of you, but I graciously ask for your support by clicking the ""Share"" button below, regardless of where you are on the map. Jon, Seth and Alex would really appreciate your support and they look forward to a great camp in June!

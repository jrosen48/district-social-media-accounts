Community transmission of COVID-19 is happening in the Northwest Arctic Borough. Maniilaq continues to offer testing at the airport or tent, but not everyone that travels to the region utilizes this opportunity. In order to flatten the curve, we all need to do our part, by making sure our guests and visitors are linked to COVID-19 testing. It is possible to be asymptomatic and contagious; this means that a person can feel fine but still be spreading COVID-19.

One way to help reduce the spread is to be vigilant and keep our social bubble small. The best way to reduce the spread is to wash hands frequently, clean high touch surfaces often, cover your cough and sneezes, travel only when necessary, and wear a mask in public places and when it's not possible to stay 6 feet away from non-household members.",0.0,"Maniilaq Association

This is a difficult time to be graduating, and I’m sorry you can’t physically be with your classmates, teachers, and family. You have accomplished great things, but these circumstances don’t detract from that. I wish you all the best in the future!

In the coming weeks, I will be sending Congressional certificates of recognition to graduating seniors. It might not completely make up for missing commencement ceremonies, but it is one small way for me to recognize high school students for their great accomplishments.

For the past couple of weeks Maniilaq Association has been offering screening and rapid testing to incoming passengers and offering guidance on self-quarantining per the Northwest Arctic Borough and State of Alaska’s travel mandate.

It is important for the health of communities that individuals agree to voluntary testing upon arrival. That way if someone tests positive, the individual and others they have been in contact with can be isolated immediately, slowing the possible spread of disease in our region.

Regardless of being tested and receiving a negative result, passengers are still required to quarantine for 14 days after returning to the Maniilaq service area.

It is important for the health of communities that individuals agree to voluntary testing upon arrival. That way if someone tests positive, the individual and others they have been in contact with can be isolated immediately, slowing the possible spread of disease in our region.

Regardless of being tested and receiving a negative result, passengers are still required to quarantine for 14 days after returning to the Maniilaq service area.

Remember to travel only if necessary to help keep our region healthy.",2020-05-05 17:59:02,https://video-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/10000000_294632611527591_2431109668886544384_n.mp4?_nc_cat=101&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=gk8IyYLhyY8AX_00hFm&_nc_ht=video-atl3-1.xx&oh=bc80516a9452aa2f9310f287a9b7bb72&oe=5F5C5162,

We know there's been a lot of interest in masks lately and parents, families and caregivers may be wondering what age a child should be in order to safely wear one.

Cloth face coverings should not be placed on children under age 2. It's very important that you never put a mask or face covering on an infant (or an adult) who is not able to adjust or remove the mask themselves. This could compromise their ability to breathe.

You can find more information about using face coverings to slow the spread of COVID-19 on the CDC’s website: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html

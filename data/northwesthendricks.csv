Will students have to make up these missed days?
In his statement yesterday, Gov. Holcomb provided a 20-day waiver for all school districts who close school. We will only miss 9 days prior to spring break which means we will not need to make up those days. IF our schools need to remain closed for a longer period of time after spring break, we have 11 instructional days that could still be waived.

Many schools are utilizing e-learning to compensate for missed instructional days. Why isn't NWHSC?
NWHSC is not a one-to-one computing district and we have places throughout the district with no internet service, so we are not equipped to provide E-Learning at this time.

Will students have to make up these missed days?
In his statement yesterday, Gov. Holcomb provided a 20-day waiver for all school districts who close school. We will only miss 9 days prior to spring break which means we will not need to make up those days. IF our schools need to remain closed for a longer period of time after spring break, we have 11 instructional days that could still be waived.

Many schools are utilizing e-learning to compensate for missed instructional days. Why isn't NWHSC?
NWHSC is not a one-to-one computing district and we have places throughout the district with no internet service, so we are not equipped to provide E-Learning at this time. E-Learning is, however, something we are currently looking into.",2020-03-13 11:46:28,,

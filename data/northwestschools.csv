One of our own, freshman Joe Groppe and his family decided to 3d print these straps to donate to nurses, doctors, and all those that have to wear masks all day now to save their ears. Joe has figured out how many we can print if we keep it going 24 hours a day. They've had some pretty big requests from nurses, hospitals etc. Right now they have orders for hundreds of them.
If you know of a need for these please reach out to and we will connect you with Tammy Groppe.

We are overwhelmed with all the love and support shown by everyone this weekend! We accomplished the national “TOP TEN” with a solid 9th place finish! Our score increased from yesterday to today with a daily total of 93.5. Day One and Day Two average was 93.425. (To put this in perspective, the team in first place scored 97.3!)

We could not be more proud of our STATE CHAMPIONS as they paved the way for Northwest on the national scene! This was an unbelievable experience for our athletes and we are so proud of this amazing accomplishment!

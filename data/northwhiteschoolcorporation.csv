The teachers and staff at North White miss their students tremendously. It has been too long since they saw all of your smiling faces. So on Friday the staff is planning on parading through the towns of Buffalo, Monon, and Reynolds, in hopes to see many of their students. They will begin in Buffalo at 1:00 p.m. and be led by the fire departments through the town. From there we will head to Monon and parade up and down the streets then off to Reynolds. We encourage each of our students, families, and other community members to come outside and wave, hold up posters, send air hugs, scream and shout and show your support. For families that live in the rural area, we encourage you to drive into the closest town and find a parking spot along one of the streets and wave and honk as we go by. It will be ""Viking Pride Friday"" so wear your NW gear loud and proud.

Please remember everyone must follow social distancing. Staff will not be getting out of the cars and spectators please do not approach anyone in their cars.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1409480512577553&id=836049043254039,,0.0,"Hello NW Families:

NORTH WHITE RESPONDS ABOUT SCHOOL CLOSING.

As of right now, North White has the plan in place to continue with our eLearning program to provide the best possible education for our students.
We will utilize eLearning Days on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.
We will also continue to use waiver days on Wednesdays.

Our staff has done an outstanding job of acclimating to the online teaching and learning process.
We are using more programs than ever before to find ways to communicate with and help our students.
We are tracking student progress daily and are calling parents and students when issues arise, such as assignments not being done to the expected level or not getting completed.

At this time, we have not spent our time or resources on the graduation issue.
Since this announcement has been made, we will begin discussions on graduation.
Once a decision is made regarding graduation for our seniors, we will notify our North White Community of the plan.

This teamwork is the only way that we have been successful this past week.

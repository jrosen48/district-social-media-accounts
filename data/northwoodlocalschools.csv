Band Camp update #1

Continue keeping the July 27th-31st dates available for band camp with the performance on the 31st. I am working closely with administration and local health officials to determine the best way we can conduct a safe camp for students. We are planning on having a band camp during those days. Exactly what that band camp will look like will depend on the upcoming weeks. We have several plans prepared, but may need a completely different one. The exact schedule and plan will be released closer to the band camp dates. I wish I could give more information right now, but with how quickly our situation has been changing we will not know what guidelines will look like in 6-7 weeks. I assure you we will do everything we can to be safe and smart about our return to marching band. Stay tuned for more updates in the upcoming weeks. I hope you are enjoying your summer and as always happy practicing!

So we, as the track coaches, are unfortunately not going to begin summer workouts yet. We are going to let the sports who have seasons coming up this fall figure out their schedules for the weight room and building facilities before we begin to schedule ours. We will revisit the schedule later in the summer and announce when our training sessions will begin. We will keep posting workouts for those who want to continue to workout from home.

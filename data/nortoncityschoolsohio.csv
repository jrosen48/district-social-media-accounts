A big shout out and thank you to a few of our outstanding seniors from Norton's Career Based Instruction Program! Many who have chose to continued work at some essential industry jobs these past few months. Alex Canning at Acme, Alison Mognet- 11 AM Industries, Cameron Wentz- CVS, Jarrett Probst- Warwick Trucking, Max Carlisle- Mosquito Joe, and Mike Kelly- Marathon. All have done a great job this year both in the classroom and at their workplace. Many of our CBI seniors continue on after graduation in the jobs they start while in the program and gain valuable work experience that helps lead to other jobs within the company or opportunities elsewhere.

Way to go and best wishes to these wonderful seniors and to all our Compact seniors in the class of 2020!!",0.0,"Four Cities Compact

Hello! I hope everyone is well and healthy and at least enjoying the sunshine when we've had sunny days!
The purpose of this email (as well as the accompanying alert call) is to encourage NHS students to be checking their Google accounts each day moving forward. The counselors (Mrs. Colecchi and Mrs. Williams) will be sending out a lot of information to various grade levels that will include mental health information and videos, updates from universities and College Credit Plus, other academic information and various ways they want to check in with the students.
Also, the students will want to get in the habit of checking their Google accounts each day because in a few weeks we will be disseminating academic work strictly through this medium. I will have more information on that as we get closer to April 14, but for now we'd just like the students to get used to routinely checking their accounts.

Here is how to access the school work provided to students over the shut down:

1) Go the the high school web site (www.nortonschools.org and then click the high school link) and you will find grade level work for all grades 9-12. Click on the grade level for your student and a Google Doc will appear that will have all the work for that grade level.

Happy Friday to all! Yesterday the Compact held the first of our ""Career Tech Thursday"" program visits for all sophomore students interested in signing up for next year. Our first visits were to Norton HS where students stopped by the Masonry or Athletic Health and Wellness Programs. The visit allows opportunity for the prospective students to talk with current program students to understand what they learn and do so they have a good idea if the program is right for them before signing up. The visits will continue for the rest of the month with the Barberton CTE Programs up next on 1/16.

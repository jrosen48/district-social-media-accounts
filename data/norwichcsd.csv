NMS ORIENTATION WEEK!
This year, ""back-to-school"" begins with Orientation Week! Students in grades 6 through 8 have been scheduled by grade level and alphabetically by last name to organize multiple, small group sessions each day from September 14-18. (see schedule)

During Orientation, students will have an opportunity to experience how our scanning process will work as they are welcomed into the building. There will be an opportunity for students to meet their teachers, listen to our opening messages and receive the expectations that will be in place for both in-person and virtual instruction. On the technology side, orientation will include an opportunity for students to log into Schoology with guidance from our teaching staff. Social distancing and the use of masks will be important during all of our orientation sessions.

Please contact our main office if you have any questions at 607-334-1600. We can't wait to see our students!

The moment that many of you have been waiting for is almost here! Our 2020 graduation videos will be available to view over the next few days. Due to the length of the 26 ceremonies taking place over the course of ten or more hours, multiple videos will be posted to share with you all of the special moments that this milestone deserves.

When will this happen, you ask? Check in throughout the evening to see for yourself and reminisce with Norwich High School! What will appear in the first video, you wonder? NHS won't give too much away, but there were two speeches delivered that only a few people have heard!

The Norwich City School District is proud of the Class of 2020! Please come back to view our videos and celebrate ALL of our graduates.... sometime.... very.... soon....

NCSD has spent the last two months working diligently to make sure that our students are provided with breakfast and lunch. Course materials have also been packaged and delivered to homes to ensure every child has the ability to continue to move forward with learning in all subject areas. At this point during the extended school closing, NCSD has served as many as 798 students weekly and has packaged nearly 8000 meals each Tuesday.

Thank you to our committed food services staff, bus drivers and support staff for all of their hard work. Watch our video put together by our At-Risk Coordinator in the high school, Rhett Genung, to catch a glimpse of the work that takes place behind-the-scenes. NCSD Cares!

NCSD continues to provide weekly meals to students for both breakfast and lunch on school days. For additional assistance, for all family members, Catholic Charities of Chenango County has introduced a food delivery service. In an effort to help stop the spread of COVID-19, they too are providing help to local families in need of support in our community,

According to Executive Director of Catholic Charities, Robin Cotter, ""We noticed there was a decrease in people accessing the food bank, while the actual need for food was increasing,” In response to that need, the emergency food program will deliver meal packages to every township in Chenango County on a weekly basis. Essential workers who are still working at the Catholic Charities office, and volunteers of the food bank, will be rotating making food deliveries. To discuss options for emergency food delivery, call Roots and Wings at (607) 336-7897.

For additional assistance, for all family members, Catholic Charities of Chenango County has introduced a food delivery service. In an effort to help stop the spread of COVID-19, they too are providing help to local families in need of support in our community,

According to Executive Director of Catholic Charities, Robin Cotter, ""We noticed there was a decrease in people accessing the food bank, while the actual need for food was increasing,” In response to that need, the emergency food program will deliver meal packages to every township in Chenango County on a weekly basis. Essential workers who are still working at the Catholic Charities office, and volunteers of the food bank, will be rotating making food deliveries. To discuss options for emergency food delivery, call Roots and Wings at (607) 336-7897.

So, here’s your weekend lesson about supply and demand...when there are brave, amazing healthcare workers who need protection and we can do our small part to help, the answer must be yes! Mr. Klatt produced faceshield parts on our very own T-Rex 3D printer at NHS. We transported them to Syracuse and worked a shift to help with assembly. The first set of pics show our very own NHS pieces from start to finish followed by a few extra shots! Weather stripping, elastic, clips and plastic shields create protection for our valuable healthcare professionals!

If anyone in our area needs them - they can be requested here:

All masks are donated and this effort is funded through a gofundme account and an incredible contingent of volunteers.

In the last round, returning two-time champion Leona Tyler faced sixth grader Liam Hunter. After an error in the word ""prudence"", Leona went to the microphone one more time to spell a final word to earn the championship. She successfully spelled the word ""coincidence"" and won the title of 2020 Spelling Bee Champion.

As a three-time champion during grades 6 through 8, NMS will follow Leona as she competes at the regional competition at SUNY Oneonta.

MIDDLE SCHOOL FLOODED WITH INCOMING 6TH GRADERS!

There was standing room only at this year’s 6th grade orientation! NMS welcomed one of its’ largest classes on record with 155 incoming 6th graders. With approximately a 90% attendance rate for orientation, those students and their family members packed the cafetorium and the halls.

Principal Scott Ryan kicked off the evening presenting information about schedules, use of technology, expectations, homework policy and extra-curricular opportunities. Following the presentation, students had time to navigate the halls to find classrooms and practice opening the lockers. (The biggest smiles always appear when students successfully open those locker doors!)

Upcoming events on the calendar include the following:
* New Student Orientation: Wednesday, August 28, 12:00-1:00pm
* Meet & Greet Day: Wednesday, September 4, 1:00-3:00pm - for ALL students
* First Day of School: Thursday, September 5, 7:30am

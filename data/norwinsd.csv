This morning, after the instructional day had begun, a bomb threat was discovered at Norwin High School.

High School students and staff were evacuated to another location on campus while local and county police bomb canines were en route. North Huntingdon Police and Circleville Volunteer Fire Department are at the Norwin campus assisting.

School District officials communicated these details with Norwin parents. Should student dismissal become necessary, the School District will communicate those procedures to parents.

Additional details will be shared as they become available. Thank you.

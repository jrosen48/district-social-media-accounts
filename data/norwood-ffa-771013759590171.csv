Attention! We have some important information regarding the Tri-County Fair. We have had much discussion and have decided to change the dates for the fair, rather than cancel for the year. Our new dates are set for July 15-18, 2020. Next year we will go back to our usual week in June. Since we did not have a market animal weigh-in, market animals will only be weighed once at the fair. Exhibitors may sell 2 animals total in the market animal sale, each a different species. Maximum sale weights still apply.

This fair may look different than usual, but we are still excited to have one. We are taking sponsors to help in any way with the fair. Spread the word and see you in July!",0.0,"Tri-County Fair Mtn. Grove MO

Ag Ed/FFA Family,
In light of the current health issues and concerns resulting from the coronavirus (COVID-19), the State FFA Convention scheduled for April 23 and 24 is being postponed. Ag Ed staff members are working on a contingency plan for the State Convention program, State Leadership Development and State Career Development Events. My recommendation is that you reconsider holding all area and district FFA events involving significant numbers of students. While a variety of factors go into making a decision like this, be assured that the health and safety of our students and stakeholders is always our primary concern.

Dear Norwood High School Families:

I hope this message finds you and your family well. The Norwood City School District team has waited for guidance from Governor DeWine to determine what the remainder of the school year would look like. With the directive that all K-12 school buildings in Ohio are closed for the remainder of the year, it is clear that remote learning will continue. It is also clear that restrictions on gatherings and assemblies will continue into the foreseeable future impacting all of our senior celebration activities.

Please remember to follow CDC guidelines to keep you and your family safe and healthy today while the Socially Distant School Parade drives through town beginning at 2pm. We can only wave and exchange a smile. We ask that you stay with the family you live with and wave back.

It will be good to see faces even if at a distance! Please wave from your door or porch especially on narrow streets so we can maintain appropriate distance.

Big thanks to the Norwood Police Department who are going to help us navigate.

We wish we could be on every street, but the route is already 8 miles long. If directed in the moment by officials, there may be variation to the streets on this map.

If you miss the parade, remember that we will post a virtual video message later today that everyone can see online.

Please remember to follow CDC guidelines to keep you and your family safe and healthy today while the Socially Distant School Parade drives through town beginning at 2pm. We can only wave and exchange a smile. We ask that you stay with the family you live with and wave back.

It will be good to see faces even if at a distance! Please wave from your door or porch especially on narrow streets so we can maintain appropriate distance.

Big thanks to the Norwood Police Department who are going to help us navigate.

We wish we could be on every street, but the route is already 8 miles long. If directed in the moment by officials, there may be variation to the streets on this map.

If you miss the parade, remember that we will post a virtual video message later today that everyone can see online.

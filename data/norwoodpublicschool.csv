For many kids, music is the only time in their school day to be creative, break out of their shell, open up to others, and take a break from the stressors in their lives. Music for music sake is valuable. There are too many schools that have lost funding for the arts. It was inspiring to see the arts in action at Norwood, Colorado school. Yesterday, we had the pleasure of performing for the middle and high school kids that take part in the Rock n Roll Academy program. We also discussed our experiences working as independent musicians, touring, the music business, and songwriting. It was awesome to see these kids fired up about playing and creating music!

At 3:45pm today a fire alarm was pulled at Norwood Schools. This was an unplanned event and we followed our safety protocol which includes going into a lock down, contacting local emergency responders and law enforcement. These entities responded quickly and efficiently and conducted a perimeter and interior search. Our students and staff responded appropriately and we are very proud of their immediate action to keep our children safe.

Upon investigation, there was no threat on campus and no indication of fire. We released students when the Norwood Fire Chief and law enforcement gave us the all clear. We thank all the parents who were waiting to pick up their child and allowed the school and emergency personnel to do their jobs to ensure everyone’s safety. Students have been released and may be picked up or ride the bus as usual. The routes will be dropping off students about 30 minutes

These have been difficult times. COVID-19 has presented persistent challenges for students, teachers, staff and the community as we attempt to navigate through one of the most complex crises to face the business of education. We believe that the best way to work through a crisis is together – and together is how we will move forward as we plan to “Return to School.”

We have been faced with difficult decisions about what school will look like and how we will provide the best education for all students. When we return to school on September 8, 2020, our plan will begin with 100% virtual instruction through October 6, 2020. When it is safe, we will add in-person instruction. The Nova Academy Board of Trustees have agreed to follow the guidelines of Judge Clay Jenkins, health authorities and surrounding districts. We will keep you informed of changes along the way.

Thank you for your patience, commitment and partnership as we return to school for the 2020-2021 school year.

Sincerely,

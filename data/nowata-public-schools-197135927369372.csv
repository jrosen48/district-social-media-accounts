Sadly the end of this year did not quite go as planned.

Every single one of us has felt a lost with the way school ended and unfortunately for some of us not only was it these huge moments of our musical journey but it was to be our last, our goodbye, our look how hard we worked over the past 6 years to get to this point. So at this time I would like to recognize our the Senior Members of our Band and Choir. I have put together A picture bio for each Senior and I ask that you please take the time to read each one.

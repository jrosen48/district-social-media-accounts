Woot! Woot! Just wanted to give a major shoutout to Evan Ridley, Steve Willis and our amazing CEC for helping Jake and I create our second round of art kits on Wednesday, Aug. 26.

CEC volunteers Pamela Hubbard, Mike Gordon, Jill Ulm, Suzette Donosky, and Amy Bereson helped us assemble the kits that will be distributed to students this week; plus Kasey Nance is designing an infographic that will be included in the kits.

The Art Department is so thankful for your time and generosity. We couldn’t have done it without you and appreciate everything you do for NPA!

Teaching in 2020 – what a challenge! NPA’s parent volunteer group – the Community Enrichment Committee – doesn’t want social distancing to prevent us from reminding our great teachers and staff how much we appreciate them.

Starting in September, the CEC is launching a weekly “So Grateful 4 U"" Drawing.
Each week, two faculty or staff members will be drawn for a $20 gift card to a local restaurant.

To make this happen, we need your support. Our goal is to raise $630.

We recognize that times are tough for many people right now, so it may not be a good time for you to donate. (We totally get it!)

But if you can make a donation, any amount is appreciated.

Congratulations to Katherine Reddy, who teaches at Westwood High School at Mesa Public Schools for being recognized by The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History as Arizona's 2020 History Teacher of the Year. Ms. Reddy is in her eighth year of teaching and is an Arizona State University graduate!

When accepting her award, Ms. Reddy shared, ""My hope is that when they walk out of my classroom on the last day of school, each student does so as an open-minded and civically engaged individual ready to negotiate a complex and often divisive world with a more critical, inquisitive, and empathetic mind and with the skills and awareness to navigate and understand diverse perspectives.""

The night before our middle school girls Varsity volleyball team, coached by Deja Moseng won the varsity City Championship, while our Junior Varsity girls won their Consolation Match! The NPA mountain biking team closed out their season with a 7th place finish, just in front of 8th place Flagstaff High School and behind schools with populations in the thousands. Middle school cross country finished out their season at state in Surprise, AZ with some personal best times. And of course there was the Saturday morning Showcase and last night’s high school boys soccer award’s potluck.

Only high school cross country and swim and dive are still alive for fall sports with swim and dive competing at their State Championships on Thursday and Friday and cross country running their Sectional Championships on Friday. Good luck Spartans!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2480073952079770&id=234966936590494,,0.0,"The NPA high school girls soccer team won their third-straight State Championship on Saturday night down in Gilbert by shutting out an excellent Chino Valley team 2-zero.

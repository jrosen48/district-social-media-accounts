Dear Moberly Spartan family,

With the health and wellbeing of our students, staff, and community in mind, the Governor of Missouri announced this afternoon that no Missouri public schools will reopen to conduct in-person classes for the rest of the 2019-2020 school year. However, meal service and eLearning will continue for Moberly School District through the remainder of the school calendar. We will share more details about this next week.

This extended school closure leaves us with so many questions and concerns, and a lot to digest. Please know we are diligently working on detailed plans for the rest of this school year as we continue navigating and adapting in this most unusual situation. Stay tuned for answers and additional information about eLearning, semester grading, end of school year events, gathering personal belongings from buildings, and more. Visit www.moberly.k12.mo.us for additional updates throughout the coming weeks.

Thank you for your continued support!",0.0,"Moberly School District

Over the next week we will update district patrons in more detail concerning health and safety provisions as well as our hybrid learning plan. It is still the intention of the district to run regular classes for all students everyday at the beginning of the year.

For those families who do not wish for their children to return in person, the school district will provide at-home virtual learning. Those families still need to enroll their students to receive education in this manner.

Being stuck in your houses, we wanted to provide a way for you to still be able to fold paper cranes. Our goal is to get 1,000 cranes folded before May 1st!

We have two places for you to pick up paper and drop off finished cranes: Jayne Levi’s house (324 Douglas Street, Nashua) and Taylor Wedeking’s house (520 Main Street, Plainfield). There are pictures below of where the box is located at each home. Remember, after you pick up paper or drop off cranes, wash your hands!

Folding cranes is a great activity to do for kids and adults! If you need help folding, there are links at the bottom of this post to helpful sources. You can also message this page, and we can work out a different way to help you learn how to fold!

Post pictures of you and your families folding cranes and tag us in it so we can see everyone! We can’t wait to see how many cranes are folded! Good luck!

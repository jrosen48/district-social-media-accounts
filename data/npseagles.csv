I hope that you are all having a safe summer. Almost 90% of families filled out our last survey, which helped us begin planning for September. However, we know that information and circumstances are fluid and changing each and everyday. As we continue to make preparations for the 2020-21 school year, ALL families must log on to the parent portal and answer a brief question regarding your choice of virtual or in school learning for each child.

While we understand that families may struggle with a final decision at this moment, it is crucial that we have an accurate snapshot of enrollment to plan for the safe reopening of our school. You can review a draft of our reopening plan on our website before making your decision. THIS MUST BE COMPLETED BY Friday, August 7th.

As always, please reach out should you have any questions or concerns.

Dear Norwood Families:

I am writing to inform you that there is a proposal to change the date for the first day of school to allow teachers additional time for preparation. The new date proposed is September 3rd, which is one day later than what is listed on the school calendar. The Norwood BOE is expected to consider the recommendation at our next BOE meeting which is scheduled for August 18th. Please note, however, new information is being released every day and plans continue to remain fluid. As additional guidelines from the NJDOE are released, we will make sure to share it with you.

Finally, if you haven’t already completed the survey, please do so tonight. The survey will only be open until tomorrow. Thank you for your assistance.

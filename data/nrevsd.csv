Did you know that most people who experience cardiac arrest at home, work or in a public place do not survive because they don't receive immediate CPR? New Richmond Fire & EMS was proud to be invited to Mrs. Erin Meranda's health class at New Richmond Middle School last week. Our Director of Public Relations, Cameron Pelzel spent his day there teaching her classes hands only CPR. Hands only CPR is a valuable and easy skill to learn that could potentially save a loved one's life or a complete strangers life. NRFEMS values the relationship we have with the New Richmond Exempted Village School District and very proud we could share our knowledge with Mrs. Erin Meranda's health class!

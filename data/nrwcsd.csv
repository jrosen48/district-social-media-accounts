Good Afternoon from the NRW Athletic Department. We want to let you all know that we are working very hard to put together a NRWHS Annual Athletic Award VIDEO and receive and package all of the athletic awards, for students, for this school year. Fall and winter coaches are coming in on Mon. June 8th to record their portion of the video and finalize awards for their teams. Some companies have been closed during the pandemic so we are still waiting on a few more items before we will announce pickup and distribution details. Stay tuned. We hope to display the video and program on Fri. June 12th and then disseminating awards the following week. Stay TUNED!!!!!!!",0.0,"North Rose-Wolcott High School

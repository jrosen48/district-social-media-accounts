Hi! My name is Allison Howe. I will be teaching third grade at Richards Elementary School this fall. I am a Newport native who is very familiar with town traditions and the beauty of this community. I graduated from Plymouth State University in December 2019 with my Bachelor's in Elementary Education grades K-8. Although this will be my very first year teaching, I come to the Newport School District having worked with students of all grade levels across the state through substitute teaching and practicum experiences. On a more personal level, I love to go to the beach, hike, and hang out with friends and family. My favorite season is fall and I love everything pumpkin and apple flavored. Also, like many other teachers, I run on coffee. I cannot wait to start the 2020-2021 school year and get to know many of the students at Richards!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3236089669762334&id=271033646267966,,0.0,"This year we have 15 new teachers to Tiger Nation.

There will be a senior prom parade this Saturday, June 6 at 2:00 PM. Seniors will have opportunities to take pictures from 12:30-1:30 PM at the opera house, town common, and Corbin Covered Bridge.

Seniors will meet at the high school at 1:45 PM, entering through Thurlow Drive, to line up and begin the parade at 2:00 PM. The route will begin at the high school, proceed through the center of town, taking a right at the intersection, up Elm Street, onto Pine Street, down Belknap Avenue and return back to the high school.

Seniors may wear prom attire, dress attire, casual attire, or caps and gowns.

Students may ride in a vehicle with members of their household or they may ride with a date not from their household. Students who are not from the same household but in the same vehicle must wear a mask while in the car together.

Please remember to wear masks and practice social distancing during this event.",2020-06-03 13:16:42,,

There will be three different working groups composed of school and district employees, school board members, parents/guardians, and members of the community. The plan is to have each group hold about three to four meetings remotely during the month of June to create draft documents to inform our planning.

The three working groups are planning for the following scenarios in the fall:

1. Remote learning only
2. Hybrid model with both in-person and remote learning
3. Traditional model of in-person learning

If you are interested in serving on one of these work groups, please send an email to bminnihan@sau43.org by Friday, May 22nd.

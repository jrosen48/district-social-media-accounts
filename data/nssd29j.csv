ATTENTION CANYON FAMILIES. Thanks to an outpouring of generosity, we have underwear, socks, shoes, and clothing for you. If you are a fire- or smoke-impacted family, you are invited to Foothills Church in Stayton tomorrow, Wednesday, 9/16, from 9:00-12:00 and 1:00-4:00 to take what you need.

On Thursday and Friday, we are opening up to all who need assistance--those suffering wage loss or hardship for any reason--at the same times.

Many are lacking internet right now, so please spread the word to your friends and neighbors in Detroit, Mill City, Gates, Mehama, and Lyons.

(We are no longer accepting donations. Thank you!)

Episode 14 is up!🎙
Stayton High School graduating senior Riley Hodges shares his story optimism in the face of adversity. Even in his darkest times when Riley contemplated whether life was worth living, he found the will and desire for a better life: “I want to be the best me I can be,” he says. His move to Lyons, Oregon and transfer to Stayton High was a positive life choice.
Riley made huge strides academically, he got involved in everything from football, track and field, to theater and tutoring. After the unexpected death of his uncle during his senior year, Riley had several life-changing moments, including receiving the news that he’d been awarded a four-year scholarship through the The Ford Family Foundation's Ford Scholars Program. 🏆🌟

Susanne has worked for the past 13 years at McNary High School in Keizer, where she was an English teacher, building Instructional Coach, and Vice Principal. She is highly regarded for her work there and was the unanimous choice of the NSSD's selection committee. We are very excited to have a person of such high caliber leading SHS! Susanne will begin her work in the district over the summer and will be leading the school into the Fall of 2019. #GoEagles!",2019-05-03 18:40:42,,

Highlights on top again

By James Day

The Stayton Highlights are OSAA dance and drill champions again!
The Highlights captured their 14th state title in 19 years Saturday night at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum, claiming the Class 4A-3A-2A-1A title with a score of 91.48.
Stayton’s score was the top one of the competition regardless of class. The Highlights also turned in the largest margin of victory, as Valley Catholic finished approximately 5.5 points back at 85.92.
Tigard (86.63) won the Class 6A competition, Pendleton (79.98) won in Class 5A (79.98) and Canby (88.27) was tops in the Show division.
Since 2001 Stayton has won 14 state titles, including 12 in a row from 2003-2014. The Highlights, coached by Robin Meier, also have been runners-up 5 times during that period.
The title is the squad’s first since 2017, when they also won the Class 4A-1A competition. Last season the Highlights finished runners-up to Canby in Show.",2.0,"Our Town / Santiam

There were only 4 dancers chosen from all the 1A-4A schools across the state and 2 of the 4 are Stayton Highlights!

All those who auditioned were required to learn a 2-minute routine on the spot and then perform it while being judged for technique, quality, showmanship and personality.

Learning To Grow Their Own Food At Mari-Linn! 🍅🥦🥕🌽
Siegmund Landscape Supply recently donated compost to Mari-Linn school for their 4-H Garden Club.
Diane Hyde, 4-H Leader and OSU Master Gardener told us, ""Mari-Linn 4-H Garden Club has 43 active students k-7th grades, 7 parent volunteers, 2 teachers and 2 Linn County OSU Master Gardeners who meet every Wednesday at 2:30pm in the school greenhouse. We are growing winter veggies in big pots filled with healthy compost. We are preparing to start vegetable seeds for our school garden, to take home, and to sell to the community in April and May. We learn about how to give plants what they need to grow and be healthy. We will have a public open house in May. We are learning garden songs, too.""
Diane will also be teaching an adult “Seed to Supper” basic vegetable gardening class at the school on Wednesday evenings. They, too, will be using the compost and starting seeds in the greenhouse starting Saturday March 9.

Reminder! Clark Wood will be taking promotion pictures for grades Pre K, Kindergarten, and 6th on Wednesday, April 3rd.

Tips for parents:
1. Pony tails and grad caps do not mix.
2. Wear a shirt/dress that will look nice under the gown.
3. Cap and gown color choices are black, pink (prek and k only), or navy (6th grade only).
4. Pictures will be taken in the AM, hopefully before the ketchup hits their shirts.
5. This is a one shot deal. If your student is absent, there will not be make ups.
6. No money is due at the time of pictures. Inter-State Portraits will send you a proof sheet to order from if you wish.",3.0,"Clark Wood Elementary School

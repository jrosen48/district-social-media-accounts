Each student that picked up a bag on Thursdays received enough food for 5 breakfasts and 5 lunches. Over the course of the 11 weeks, our volunteers and lunch staff packed and served 34,120 meals.

These meals were paid for under a program through the USDA, which has different guidance than our normal school lunch program. We don't ordinarily qualify, but due to the extraordinary circumstances, the requirements were relaxed.

We are very grateful to all of the lunch staff and other school employees that made this program work each week. And we couldn't have done it without the volunteers that showed up each week to help pack and distribute meals. We're also thankful to the Salt Creek Wind Project for their generous contribution in support of the program.

We still need about half of our students to submit course requests to us!

Students have two options:
1. Send a picture of the registration worksheet to Ms. Linck (llinck@n-tama.k12.ia.us)
2. Enter course requests online in the PowerSchool Portal (via a browser, not the app)

For those that haven't done this yet, we are extending the deadline until MONDAY, APRIL 13 at 4:00PM. If students don't enter requests, Ms. Linck will make a schedule for them and will not make schedule changes until the first two days of the new school year.

Here are links to the worksheets and videos that explain everything you need to know for each grade!

We still need about half of our students to submit course requests to us!

Students have two options:
1. Send a picture of the registration worksheet to Ms. Linck (llinck@n-tama.k12.ia.us)
2. Enter course requests online in the PowerSchool Portal (via a browser, not the app)

For those that haven't done this yet, we are extending the deadline until MONDAY, APRIL 13 at 4:00PM. If students don't enter requests, Ms. Linck will make a schedule for them and will not make schedule changes until the first two days of the new school year.

Here are links to the worksheets and videos that explain everything you need to know for each grade!

Attention Male Athletes:

Summer workouts start tomorrow morning at the high school. See the attached schedule below. Here are a few details:

- We will have two separate workout times, a time for non-baseball atheltes and a time for baseball athletes. This is to help limit additional exposure for those athletes until the baseball season is completed.

- We will break into three different groups and rotate stations. This allows us to follow social distancing guidelines better and provides more opportunities for coaches and atheltes to sanitize equipment and the room.

- Please meet outside of H.S. weight room (east side of school in the alley) tomorrow morning for a meeting before we enter the school.

- Boys basketball open gyms will begin July 6th for non-baseball athletes. Baseball athletes will be able to join in after their season is completed.

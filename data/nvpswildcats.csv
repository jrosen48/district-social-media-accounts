Logan was elected as captain as a junior and worked very hard to encourage our team and teach our novice, however he says his biggest achievement was his weight to power ratio. As one of the lightweight men, he has continued to be in the top of the rankings against the open weight men. He says If there is one piece of advice he can give to anyone it’s that you can always do great things regardless of any obstacles. If you truly want it then you will have it. Love your team and love yourself.
Let us all wish Logan luck in his next phase of life as he opens his own screen printing business! Contact him for all your teams needs!

Wow! What a great MAEA Region 9 reception tonight at the GRAM!

Thank you to all of our students’ friends and their families for taking the time to come downtown and celebrate these fantastic and talented students.

Northview has 8 students recognized at this year’s show. Congrats again Trevor, Avery, Hannah, Aubrey, Sophie, Eva, Eliza, and Elizabeth - you are quite the talented bunch!

Also a huge thank you to the Michigan Art Education Association liaisons and the Grand Rapids Art Museum for your combined efforts in hosting this event for our students. The added studio experience and free admission to the galleries for the evening added to the overall experience.

The show will be on display until next week Thursday so be sure to check it out if you are in the area!

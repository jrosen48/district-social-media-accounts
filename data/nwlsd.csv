🦅 Hawks soar high in the sky and have the ability to view all of life from this perspective. How can you look at the big picture and not get too wrapped up in the negative today?⁠⠀
⁠⠀
🦅 Hawks represent an ability to lead others and take initiative. Like Gandhi said, “Be the change that you wish to see in the world.” Set an example of safety and others will follow.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
🦅 Hawks always observe their area before taking action. When you are visiting retailers or other public places around groups of people, be aware of your surroundings. If the area you are about to enter doesn't seem to be in compliance with safety regulations, don't enter. Help #stopasecondwave.⁠⠀

The lighting schedule begins alphabetically with Allentown Central Catholic High School and ends on June 23 with Wilson Area High School. The full schedule is below.

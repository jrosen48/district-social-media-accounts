September is National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month—a time to share resources and stories in an effort to shed light on this highly taboo and stigmatized topic. We use this month to reach out to those affected by suicide, raise awareness and connect individuals with suicidal ideation to treatment services. It is also important to ensure that individuals, friends and families have access to the resources they need to discuss suicide prevention. NAMI is here to help.

First up is special education teacher, Sharon Booth.

I have been a Special Education Teacher since 2013, mainly at the high school grade level, with an emphasis in English, Reading, Writing, and Time Management. My goal has always been to teach and guide our youth while helping them to learn and understand the importance of being successful in their academics so they will make positive contributions to their community and society.

As you read from Dr. Palmer’s message yesterday we are working on a video project to honor the healthcare heroes in the Northwestern community. Dr. Palmer wrote:

The news is full of stories of extraordinary healthcare professionals who are selflessly providing care for those who are sick with COVID-19. As we know, healthcare workers are experiencing many trials and tribulations. We admire their inner strength and are grateful for their work. Their determination to be brave, unselfish and caring is inspiring. Together they are a force of love.
We know that many of these caring professionals are part of our NWR7 school community. We feel it is a great time to honor those who are connected to our schools by creating a “Northwestern’s Healthcare Heroes” video.

We need your help! Please send a picture of your Northwestern Healthcare Hero to gfranklin@nwr7.org.

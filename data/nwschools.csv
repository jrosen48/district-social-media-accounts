The track is officially done. Couple small items to wrap up and we are ready. We have a beautiful facility and one to be proud of. After speaking with the track installers please no bikes, strollers, skateboards, etc.. anything with small wheels on the track.

Thank you to the Northwest School Board and our Superintendent Geoff Bontrager for the wonderful support to make this happen. One more big project and our facilities will compete with any in mid Michigan. Thank you to McDonald Track Painting for the drone footage.",16.0,"👍❤️🖤

For Lisa Ebener, being a music teacher means helping students realize that they can play music , too.
“Kids come to be saying, ‘Well, I’m not musical. I’m not from a music family.’ And I just Smile at them and say ‘Are you human?’ Because if you are, then [you’re musical],” says the Northwest Elementary School teacher.

Congratulations to Sarah Runkel on being named a Top Teacher for 2020!

Sarah Runkel’s grandmother always told her to get an education. As a woman born in 1919 in the hills of Tennessee, her grandmother saw education as something precious that could never be taken away. It was the open door to a brighter future. Runkel has treasured that advice her entire life, choosing to act on her grandmother’s wishes to not only be educated herself, but to instill a love of learning in the succeeding generations that have crossed her path during her 13 years of teaching. “When it comes to teaching, I feel like I
have finally found my groove; I feel like I have arrived,” said Runkel.

Congratulations to Jessica Crandell on being named a Top Teacher for 2020!

By the time Jessica Crandell was in fifth grade, she knew she would be an art teacher. Despite being a goal of hers since she was just 10 years old, it was a feat to accomplish— since many schools do not even have art teachers in the building. Nevertheless she persisted, and today she is an arts educator for 850 students in grades three through five.

I'm super proud of all my students and I miss everyone so much. I was really looking forward to the two art displays I was planning for this year. Since we can't have those art shows, I decided to put together a virtual art show to share our little Mounties' art with the world! Please enjoy and share with friends and family. There are 3 slideshows: Kindergarten, First Grade & Second Grade. They are organized by classes and students listed in alphabetical order.

I can see the curiosity in our students’ eyes, and along the way they gain confidence academically and express themselves more clearly,” says Miana Vega, coach of the policy debate team at M.S. 50 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which came in the top four in June’s national tournament in Dallas, Texas—while making history as the first bilingual team on that stage.

It was a bruising accomplishment, as some coaches and students on competing teams objected that M.S. 50 was cheating by speaking in Spanish—even though Miana’s group provided headsets and a translator who was not part of their coaching staff. Miana recalls, “There was one coach talking loudly into a phone saying, ‘They shouldn’t be here!’ My kids were shaking and crying, listening to adults speaking about them that way.

Amplify Austin is a 24-hour period of giving from Thursday, March 5th at 6:00 PM to Friday, March 6th at 6:00 PM. Last year, NYOS raised over $16,000 during Amplify Austin to support our need for additional classroom Chromebooks. This year, all Amplify Austin donations will directly contribute to our current need of a new campus facility!

Beginning in the 21-22 school year, NYOS will more than double its physical footprint with a new facility on already-acquired land next door to our Lamar Campus. Our student body will also increase from 1,000 to almost 2,000 students, and the new facility will allow us to consolidate our 2 current campuses to create 1 school community.

Best of all, thanks to the incredible support of a local foundation, YOUR DONATION WILL BE MATCHED 4:1 BY A LOCAL FOUNDATION! This means that a $20 donation becomes $100, a $100 donation becomes $500, and a $200 donation becomes $1,000!

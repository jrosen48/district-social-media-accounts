Archaeologists excavated the Schoharie Creek III site and found a large house foundation and several cisterns dating to the late 19th and early 20th century. Toys used by children were recovered and include Anker building blocks, a small tea set, and several toy guns. The Anker building blocks (shown here) date to the late 19th century and were used by the children of the Alonzo Coon’s family. These blocks were created in Germany before being shipped to the U.S. for sale between 1880 and 1920.

In 1896, Christian F. Weeber opened his bicycle shop in Albany, NY. A decade later, he began selling Ford and other automobile models at his new location on Central Avenue in Albany. Weeber, ever the entrepreneur, decided to increase sales by supporting the first Annual Hill Climbing Contest sponsored by the Albany Automobile Club. Weeber won this trophy as first prize. His victory may have indeed helped boost sales because Weeber sold an impressive number of Ford models that year! In addition to being a salesman, Weeber was an inventor. Among his many inventions, this 1903 Weebermobile is part an extensive collection at the NYSM documenting Christian F. Weeber’s life and career. Weeber went on to invent, manufacture and sell automobiles and products until his death in 1932.

In this photograph from 1975, you can see the NYSM's 4th Floor Terrace Gallery in its final stages of construction. Visible beyond the robust marble pillars and through the expansive windows are the Museum’s iconic arches that create a covered walkway around the terrace’s exterior plaza. When the NYSM opened to the public on July 1, 1976, the 25,000 square foot Terrace Gallery was first occupied by the NYSM’s Bicentennial exhibit, Forces. Today, the Terrace Gallery once again hosts one of the Museum’s most unique exhibitions, Windows on New York.

While the date and artist are unknown, these five carvings were likely made by a Sherman Farm family member. The art form originated out of China and is believed to have developed from Chinese paper cutting. They have increasingly gained popularity in the U.S. since the 1990s.

Ancient cultures all across the world marked this special occasion in their calendars with monuments and ceremonies. Today scientists call it an astronomical event but it is still widely celebrated throughout the world.

The Summer Solstice is the day of the year with the most sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere and the shortest amount of sunlight in the Southern Hemisphere. How does this happen? Since the earth is tilted on its axis in orbit, the sun appears over latitude line 23.5 degrees north (Tropic of Cancer) allowing the sun to reach its highest point in the sky.

Let your kids get creative while they design an egg-drop device.

MATERIALS: Collect materials from around the house like string, balloons, cotton balls, newspaper, plastic bags, straws, tape, etc. Most importantly, you’ll need at least one egg per design.

SCIENCE: Review the basic principles this experiment entails like gravity, drag, potential energy, kinetic energy, and air resistance. Think of examples: helicopter seeds, parachutes, protecting fragile materials during delivery. Plan out a design to slow down the process of falling and resist the force of gravity.

MATH: If you would like to practice some basic math and money skills you give the kids a budget and assign prices to the different products they can purchase to build the device using game-money.

REFLECT: What worked? What didn’t work? How would you have improved your design?

The Shakers are considered the most significant communal religious society in American history. They fled religious persecution in England in 1774 and built communities in places like upstate New York. They were revolutionary in their attitudes towards equality—accepting people of all ethnic background and providing equal access to education and business opportunities for men and women alike. The Shakers excelled in farming, producing innovative goods, and decorative arts and design.

ACTIVITY- Gift Drawings used bright colors and featured elements from nature. Creating these drawings was an important outlet for practicing Shakers and became a valued part of American folk art. Draw something from nature that inspires you! Make sure to use bright colors.

Enjoy this activity with Museum Instructor, Kat Morehouse. In times like these we learn how important community is. Our community can play a huge role in our lives and remind us that we are part of something larger than ourselves.

Community can be a source of support and inspiration. An example of the possibilities that come from community partnership can be found in looking back at the artists living, working, and supporting one another in Woodstock, NY in 1926. Learn more about the historic Woodstock art colony and creating a sense of place here: http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/exhibitions/arthur-anderson-collection

Have children create a map of their community, what people and places are important to them? Brainstorm how they can participate with those people and places in a new way while we can’t be physically together.

In honor of Earth Day, we look to the mid-19th century journal of farmer Diodate Brainard of Hubbardsville, NY. Brainard's family made their living as hops farmers. Relying on the the land, they grew large crops of hops and corn and maintained a small orchard for apples. They tapped maple trees for making sugar and syrup. The family also grew a variety of vegetables for their personal use.

Brainard's journal is now part of the NYSM History Collections. The page photographed here shows his entries from April 1 through June 6, 1848. On today's date, April 22, 1848, Diodate indicated that he set hop poles in the ground, plowed a field, and made syrup. (Hop poles were large posts that the hops would climb as they grew.)

Also pictured here is a ca. 1850 plow, made in Schenectady, that is similar to one that Diodate would have used. It would have been pulled by a horse or oxen to cut through the soil.

Bring those birds to your window by having the kids make some simple bird feeders today!

Kids can make a pinecone bird feeder with a pinecone, peanut butter, birdseed, and some string to tie it onto a tree.

For our smaller bird watchers, practice those fine motor skills by having them string cheerios onto a pipe cleaner to make their bird feeder.

As our feathery friends start to visit you can use The Cornell Lab website https://www.allaboutbirds.org/ to help you identify the birds, listen to their sounds, and learn fun facts. See what birds are in your own back yard!

Although Native Americans had used native copper to manufacture beads and tools for millennia, by the mid to late 1600s these sources were largely replaced by copper, brass, and iron obtained by Europeans. The timing of when these European metals began to circulate among Iroquoian people has been a topic of long-standing interest among archaeologists. Most archaeologists have accepted that the first evidence for European metals in the Mohawk River Valley of New York was no earlier than 1525-1550.

Notably, between 1883 and 1885, Milton Hershey worked for Huyler before returning to Pennsylvania to start his own chocolate company.

Huyler's eventually moved its headquarters to Irving place and 18th street while expanding to 54 stores across the country. As with most candy companies, Huyler’s suffered two fires in 1889 and in 1917.

Notably, between 1883 and 1885, Milton Hershey worked for Huyler before returning to Pennsylvania to start his own chocolate company.

Huyler's eventually moved its headquarters to Irving place and 18th street while expanding to 54 stores across the country. As with most candy companies, Huyler’s suffered two fires in 1889 and in 1917. After his retirement, Huyler’s sons ran the business for some time and, with additional help from investors, continued to operate several candy, ice cream shops, and luncheonettes. #HappyValentine'sDay #NYSMhistory #Huylers",2020-02-14 09:23:44,,

Did you know that Albany didn’t “officially” become the capital of New York until 1971? During the 1971 legislative session Assemblyman Charles Henderson discovered that there was no statute officially declaring Albany as the capital city of New York State. Assemblyman Henderson introduced legislation to designate Albany as the capital officially. The bill was voted on March 3, 1971 passing with 134 votes in support to 3 votes in opposition. Those who voted against the bill cited the harsh winters as a reason to relocate the capital to another city in the state. Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller signed the bill into law on June 1, 1971.

Although crinoids (also called sea lilies) may look like beautiful underwater flowers, they are actually animals with very plant-like features. Similar to the roots of a tree, crinoids have a holdfast that branches out and holds the animal firmly to the ocean floor. The “stem” is made up of tiny little circles with a hole in the center called columnals that look similar to Cheerios. These are stacked on top of each other and the living part of the animal runs through the holes. On top of the stem is the main body of the crinoid called a calyx. It is composed of solid plates attached together with a mouth and anus on the top. Long arms reach up from the top of the body and finger-like pinnules branch off from the arms. Most crinoids are sessile, which means that they are attached to the ground. They wave their long, hairy arms around and snag particles of food out of the water. Tube feet pass the food down the arm to the mouth on the top part of the body.

Even before the #ErieCanal, New Yorkers wanted “improvements in the internal navigation of this state” as Philip Schuyler wrote on behalf of the Inland Lock & Navigation Companies in 1796. He hoped to add canals to both the Mohawk & Upper Hudson Rivers.

Philip Schuyler ran the Northern and Western Inland Lock and Navigation Companies alongside Elkanah Watson. They began construction at Little Falls, New York in 1792 and continued various stages of construction along the Mohawk until 1803. In this letter, Schuyler asks for aid from a Mr. Weston who was then working for the Pennsylvania Canal Companies.

Brainard was a hops farmer in Huddleville, in the Town of Hamilton, New York. The journal covers his daily life from 1846-1868. On this date in 1847, Diodate cut some “saw logs”, on the 20th he “drew” (pulled) them to the local sawmill, where they were cut into planks. Diodate picked them up on the 23rd. It appears that he was using the planks to build a floor in his stable.

Diodate could have used a log sleigh similar to this one from Cossayuna in Washington County.
The 19th century sleigh consists of two connected “bob” sleighs. The log or logs would be mounted on top of both bobs and pull by a horse(s) or ox(en).

Excerpts from January 1847:
Jan 15 - warm & rainy – cut a tree for saw logs – ground hard
Jan 16 - sawed small logs – growing cold
Jan 20 - drew saw logs to mill- very cold weather very clear
Jan 23 - finished drawing poles out of the swamp – drew home plank wood

The announcement took place at the Nation’s Onöhsagwe:de’ Cultural Center, where the pipe tomahawk has been on loan since March 2019. The pipe tomahawk will now be on permanent display at the Cultural Center, Seneca-Iroquois National Museum.

The 18th-century pipe tomahawk was gifted to Seneca leader Cornplanter by President George Washington at one of several meetings between United States and Iroquois Confederacy leaders in the years 1792 – 1794. The Cornplanter pipe tomahawk entered the New York State Museum’s collection in 1851 from Seneca diplomat Ely Parker. Sometime between 1947 and 1950 the object went missing from the Museum and for nearly 70 years was in the hands of private collectors. Thanks to the generosity of an anonymous donor, the pipe tomahawk was returned to the State Museum in June 2018. The pipe tomahawk was on display at the New York State Museum from July through December 2018.

Artifacts found in New York State are often evidence of the interaction between Native Americans and Europeans. This small “tinkling cone” recovered from the Pethick site in Schoharie County, New York, shows how Native Americans sometimes “reused” European artifacts for their own purpose. While it may have been previously part of a small brass kettle, the artifact's materials were refashioned by tapering and rolling it into a small cone that was then used to decorate clothing and other Native American items in the 1600’s. #NYSMresearch #pethicksite",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10156398586061330&id=177815241329,,0.0,"#ScienceTuesday: Cultural Resource Survey Program

This snowbound mastodon momma and her young calf have been frozen in this Ice Age landscape at the NYSM since the pair were first placed on display over 33 years ago! Opened to the public in 1986, the exhibit took over two years to research, design, and install and required the expertise of a team of artists, designers, geologists, botanists, zoologists, and even a taxidermist! Photographs included here show how the ancient wintery landscape and masterfully crafted mastodons were created from start to finish.

Oh my!
Featuring a big top tent, gorillas, and even a clown dressed as Santa, these fabulously unique holiday cards belonged to renown Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus clown and Binghamton, NY, native, Pat Valdo. Valdo, who joined the circus in 1904, served as director of personnel from 1929 to 1969, after which he was designated the title of Director Emeritus. Born Patrick Francis Fitzgerald, he passed away in 1970 at the age of 89, having spent 65 years with Ringling.

The NYSM is lucky to have a couple of Valdo’s holiday cards in our History Collection. The 1941 card featured the famous gorilla Gargantua and his newly paired female gorilla Toto. The second card, undated, features a clown resembling Pat Valdo’s costume, dressed as Santa Claus.

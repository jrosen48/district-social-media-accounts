During this time of remote learning, we want to let our students know that we are always here for you!

The song “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” was written by Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson in 1966, inspired by a walk through Central Park and their ambition to become a part of Motown Records. It was originally recorded by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell.

Besides shaping the sound of Motown in the 1960’s, Marvin Gaye was equally important in the fight for racial equality. His top album, “What’s Going On”, is just as relevant now as when it was released in 1971.

Retired OA teacher, Mr. Lewis, created 5 'Air Pressure' experiment videos using items you might have around the house.

Since retiring a few years back, Mr. Lewis has regularly visited students at Apalachin and Owego Elementary Schools to conduct science experiments. He has been missing the interactions with students and teachers and wanted to attempt some virtual experiments with them.

Have some fun and give them a try. Share your pictures and videos with us by using the google form link on the website.

Retired OA teacher, Mr. Lewis, created 5 'Air Pressure' experiment videos using items you might have around the house.

Since retiring a few years back, Mr. Lewis has regularly visited students at Apalachin and Owego Elementary Schools to conduct science experiments. He has been missing the interactions with students and teachers and wanted to attempt some virtual experiments with them.

SPECIAL ""Square Awareness"" announcement.

Each year for artfully SQUARED, we receive an incredible amount of donated artwork from people of all ages and skill levels in our community. Because we received such wonderful support, we wanted to give back to our community during COVID19.

Featured here are over 80 pieces of artwork – primarily created by Owego Free Academy Students and their teacher, Susan Camin – that we delivered to the residents at Riverview Manor Rehabilitation & Nursing this afternoon. It is our hope that these works of art brighten walls of this facility and bring joy to its residents.

In times like these, we hope this artwork will nourish the spirit of those at Riverview Manor Rehabilitation & Nursing.

Be safe, be well, and – if possible – be creative.

PS: We will still have artfully SQUARED pieces displayed on social media and available for a $20 donation. Stay tuned for next week, we have a special Monster Adoption Drive.",2.0,"The OFA Art Department has been busy! ❤️🎨💙

Pictured is Tanner from OES and Caleb from AES with Barb Neal from Cornell Cooperative Extension. Mr. “O” is also pictured, as he is the grandfather of Caleb and retired AES Librarian. The farm stand is located in front of AES and will hold the extra produce from the AES Learning Garden. The community is welcome to check the farm stand periodically to see if there is any extra produce available for FREE and can always donate any extra produce to share from their home gardens.

With the kids working hard this summer in the AES Learning Garden, they wanted to be ready for when produce begins to grow. Pictured is Tanner from OES and Caleb from AES with Barb Neal from Cornell Cooperative Extension. Mr. “O” is also pictured, as he is the grandfather of Caleb and retired AES Librarian. The farm stand is located in front of AES and will hold the extra produce from the AES Learning Garden.

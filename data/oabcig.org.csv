To help limit the spread of COVID-19 and to allow our student athletes to participate in sports, we are limiting the number of spectators at our events this week.

Tuesday, September 15, Ridge View is hosting River Valley Community School District and Oabcig Community School District in Schaller for Varsity Volleyball. Each of our Varsity players will be given 5 tickets. Opposing teams will be given a limited number of tickets. This ticket entitles the bearer to attend the game, but he/she will still need to pay/use activity pass before being admitted. If you do not have a ticket, you can not attend the game. Face masks are required at all home volleyball games.

The volleyball game is available to watch via live stream at nfhsnetwork.com. Choose Ridge View and subscribe. You will get all the home volleyball and football games for $11/month. Cancel subscription anytime. It's super easy and convenient and you help support your Raptors with every subscription.

Grab a chair and head outside to wave and cheer for for them as they go on a car parade to celebrate their graduation. We are hoping to have a fire truck lead them around each community.

They will start in Odebolt at 4:00 on Sunday, May 17, and parade through the streets of Odebolt for about 20 minutes then head to Arthur. Loop through Arthur then head to Ida Grove by approximately 5:00. They will drive the streets of Ida Grove for 20 minutes and will finish by heading to Battle Creek (approximate arrival of 6:00).

It is hard to believe how close we are to May and the end of the year. We would like to get your child’s materials back to you from the classroom. Monday May 4th we are going to make time available to pick up materials from school. We will be open from 11AM to 1PM and 4:30PM-6:00PM. You can pull up on the south side of the building. Please walk in the dismissal door and we will direct you to the big gym to pick up your bag of materials, they are lined up by grade level. Once you pick them up you can exit the big gym out the back door to go to your vehicle.

This is the time to drop off library books or classroom books, if you are done with them. There will be a box for them to go in. Chrome books will not be handed in at this time. Julie Weeda will send out more information as to when and how that will happen. You will also be given information on purchasing the chrome book if you would choose to do so.

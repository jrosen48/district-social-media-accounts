Preparticipation Physical Examinations completed for the 2019-20 school year will be accepted during the 2020-21 school year upon submission of a parent and athlete signed waiver (previously known as Form B). Students who did not have Preparticipation Physical Examinations completed for the 2019-20 school year must complete a Preparticipation Physical Examination for the 2020-21 school year.

What this means is any child that had a physical for the 19-20 season only needs to complete the Part B form for the 20-21 year. All 7th graders will need to have a full physical. We will address any others that have to have a full physical due to potential exceptions.

When I first began the student council advisor position it was to build relationships with the kids I didn‚Äôt have in my classes. That is exactly what has happened over these last few years!

The laughs and adventures with you have been endless. I am so blessed to have you all on my council. From the small things of only working concessions and planning snowball to the big project ideas we have had and even carried out. We have literally transformed the OHS student council and all that is thanks to you! I couldn‚Äôt imagine a better team by my side working hard and dedicating their time to make our town, school and students a little brighter! I will miss you as you venture onto bigger and better things. I can‚Äôt wait to watch you grow and learn as you start the next chapter of your life. I hope you always remember to work hard, be humble and never settle for less than you deserve. Congratulations on all you have accomplished! Snaps for that!

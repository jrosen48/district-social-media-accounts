These boys had put in many pre-season hours on Tuesday morning open gyms to work on swing technique, pitching strength and accuracy, and position specific skills. We were ready and thrilled to debut our new uniforms and to host our first annual OA Varsity Baseball Tournament featuring great talent from around the area.

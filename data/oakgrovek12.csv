We have a safety issue we need address with the car line. We need ALL parents to have a car tag in their window when picking up children after school. Starting Wednesday, any vehicle who does not have a school issued tag will have to go to the office after school to get one before picking up their children. Anyone who enters the building must be wearing a mask and go to the office.

If you need one before Wednesday, please call the office.

Thank you for helping with this issue.

If you have kids at home and need some new project ideas how about color/write/make pictures etc and send them to our residents (or any other long term care facility). Most if not all across the US are not allowing visitors. Our residents LOVE getting letters cards etc and this would help provide some light in these uncertain times!

If you have kids at home and need some new project ideas how about color/write/make pictures etc and send them to our residents (or any other long term care facility). Most if not all across the US are not allowing visitors. Our residents LOVE getting letters cards etc and this would help provide some light in these uncertain times!

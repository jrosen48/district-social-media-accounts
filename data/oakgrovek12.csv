We have a safety issue we need address with the car line. We need ALL parents to have a car tag in their window when picking up children after school. Starting Wednesday, any vehicle who does not have a school issued tag will have to go to the office after school to get one before picking up their children. Anyone who enters the building must be wearing a mask and go to the office.

If you need one before Wednesday, please call the office.

Thank you for helping with this issue.

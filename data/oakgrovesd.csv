Santa Clara County is at the Red Risk Level under the State’s new COVID-19 reopening framework. That means certain activities can resume, and certain businesses can reopen indoor operations at reduced capacity. Some indoor businesses and activities are still too high risk to allow at this time, however, and the local order and directives ensure that people who live in the county are protected from these risks. For example, movie theaters, indoor gatherings, and indoor dining are not yet permitted to reopen under Santa Clara County’s Order. Remember to follow the more restrictive set of rules. Continue to keep your distance, wear your mask, and get tested.

Help for Students in Crisis - Mental Health (CA Dept of Education)",7.0,"State Superintendent Tony Thurmond and the CDE are extremely concerned about the mental health and wellness of students whose lives have dramatically changed during the COVID-19 response, as well as the health of staff who are also coping with these changes.

To support students, schools, and communities during this challenging time, the CDE has gathered information regarding mental health resources, including links for students to get direct access to mental health professionals. The new “Help for Students in Crisis” web page includes crisis and warm line numbers, along with other COVID-19-related resources for providing virtual mental health services, and information for mental health providers, families, and youth: https://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/cg/mh/studentcrisishelp.asp.

When I have the opportunity to speak to Oak Grove School District Elementary School students -- at a City Hall Tour, College Day, or a visit to their school auditorium -- they often have NO idea who I am.

But then I ask them if they like to play at their neighborhood park, if they like going to their neighborhood library, if they take walks on City streets, if they notice new buildings, if they love waving to our San Jose Police Officers and Firefighters… and everyone raises their hands.

I tell them that those are all services made possible by the City of San Jose. And I, as their representative and voice at City Hall, help support these services and make decisions that make our neighborhoods a cleaner, safer, more inclusive place for everyone.

I can’t do this alone. Thank you to all the students, families, educators, administrators, and Board Members at OGSD's State of the District last night for listening to my #SJD2 update and for continuing to engage with the City to make our home a better place!",0.0,"We were pleased with all the community that came out last night!

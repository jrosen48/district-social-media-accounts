This week, all teachers are engaging in technology training a) to support learning in school that prepares students to learn and work in our digital and connected world AND b) to support remote learning that provides academic continuity for students if there are school closures.

It is our hope that students can come back to school in August. ‚ù§Ô∏è",2020-05-20 11:53:32,,

In the month of May we have a new activity we can do #OakHillTogether! We invite you to create, place, and find painted rocks around our town!

Watch the video, and the Smittle kids will tell you how it‚Äôs done! They also got us started with surprises around town!

Directions:
1. Start with a clean, dry rock
2. Use acrylic paint, paint markers, or permanent markers
3. When dry, coat your rock with an outdoor acrylic sealer
4. Add #OakHillTogether
5. Place your rock in a public place in Oak Hill
6. When you find a rock, you can take a photo of it and share it. Add #OakHillTogether to your post so we can see your finds!

Happy creating and hunting!

They were the only group this year out of 20 high schools in the nation to be invited to participate in the NASA Student Launch Initiative.

“While I am new to working in education, I have been an active classroom volunteer all through my children’s elementary years. After spending the past 15 years as a full-time parent, I am thrilled to be in the classroom assisting with the learning process in literacy and math. My favorite part of the job is helping a student learn a difficult concept or helping them complete a difficult task. The bonus is knowing that at the same time I am helping make the teacher’s job a little easier.”

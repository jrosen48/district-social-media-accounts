This year we are going to compete in the ORTOP First Lego League Challenge called Into Orbit! In order to prepare for the competitions there will be an after school club for two teams to design and build our Lego EV3 robots!!!

We need enough motivated students to fill two teams grades 4-8 and are always looking for adult volunteers to help out after school and at the exciting events. No experience necessary, just a willingness to helpout and have fun! Also, grade 8 students can participate in both FLL and First Tech challenges.

So far we have received an ODE grant to help out with some of the costs to start!!!

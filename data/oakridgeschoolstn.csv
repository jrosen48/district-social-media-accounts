Good morning, everyone. I’m emailing now from the incredible graduation setup in the Arena. I use the adjective “incredible” intentionally: I can hardly believe that we have such a graduation for our students during these challenging times. I have gotten to watch this play out from the Arena pressbox. The Graduation Committee took pains to organize a safe but celebratory graduation that will arrive on time and complete at the normal graduation time. As an ORHS graduate, former coach, and longtime teacher, I declare that this is the most Oak Ridge thing ever, and I couldn’t be more proud.

We received an awesome update from the Lego Robotics team at Jefferson Middle School (TN) we spoke to last month on Roofing Materials & Design! They won FIRST PLACE and are headed to the State Championships! WAY TO GO ATOMIC EAGLES!

Here are the kind words from their teacher:

""Thank you so much for your support of the Atomic Eagles this season. With your help, they were able to come up with an innovative project idea. They presented well at competition this past Saturday. I am proud to tell you they received the First Place Robot Design Trophy. They have earned the opportunity to compete again on February 8, 2020 at the East Tennessee State Championships.

Thanks again for your help,

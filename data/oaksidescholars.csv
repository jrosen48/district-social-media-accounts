Let's review the power of KIND. The Internet is a powerful tool that can be used to be kind or unkind to others. We come across all kinds of content online and on social media. Some of what we see is rude, mean, or even hurtful. Watch the video, learn to identify cyberbullying, what to do in an uncomfortable situation, how to consider others' feelings, and how to be an upstander when cyberbullying occurs. Let's treat others as we would like to be treated. Printing is optional, complete the grade-appropriate Digital Media Sheet. Students, explore your favorite game site on the Internet for 20 min. Students take some time to practice being kind online. Most importantly, be safe and have fun!

Let's review the importance of your digital footprint. A digital footprint is a trail of data you create while using the Internet. It includes the websites you visit, emails you send, and the information you submit while online. Depending on how it is managed, this trail can be big or small, harmful, or helpful. Watch the video and take some time to reflect on your digital footprint. Printing is optional, complete the grade-appropriate Digital Media Sheet. Students, explore your favorite game site on the Internet for 20 min. Students compare the different trails you leave behind and think critically about what kinds of information you want to leave behind. Most importantly, be safe and have fun!

Let's take a moment and explore our feelings. Use your feelings to help you distinguish between good digital interaction and bad digital interaction. Let's make a point to be aware of our feelings even when we are on the internet. Remember, ""when in doubt, talk it out"". Anytime you are on the internet and something makes you feel uncomfortable, tell a trusted adult. Watch the video and take some time to reflect on your feelings. Printing is optional, complete the grade-appropriate Digital Media Sheet. Students, explore your favorite game site on the Internet for 20 min. Listen to your GUT, be more aware of your feelings, and tell a trusted adult if something doesn't make you feel comfortable when you use digital media. Most importantly, be safe and have fun!

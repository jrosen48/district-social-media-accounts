The deadline to apply for P-EBT food benefits has been extended to July 31. Please review the criteria to see if your family is eligible and needs to apply for benefits. Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer (P-EBT) is a one-time benefit for eligible families to buy food. Immigration status does not matter when applying for P-EBT. The public charge rule does not apply to P-EBT benefits.

P-EBT is for children 5-18 years old who received SNAP food benefits for the month of March 2020. P-EBT is also for children up to 21 years old who are certified for free or reduced-price meals through the National School Lunch Program at school during the 2019-20 school year. Children that attend a school that offers free meals to all students (Community Eligibility Provision or Provision 2) are also eligible.

If you have 90-94, 2 absences

If you have 95 or higher, 3 absences.

■All absences, except medical, court, school sponsored trips or a college visit, count against the student for exemption purposes. Medical means a Dr.’s appointment and you are at school part of that day. If you are gone the entire day that is not considered medical.
■Students can elect to take the test to raise their grade
■Exemptions can be revoked up to the day of the test
■Students who are failing the class will not be eligible for exemptions
■Three tardies in any one class equals an unexcused absence for that class.
■Students in grades 7/8 will be allowed to choose which 2 core subjects that wish to apply the exemption to each semester. They will be required to take the other 2 core exams. All students who meet the exemption criteria will be allowed to exempt elective courses.

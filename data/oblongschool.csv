OPH Faithful,

Spread the word that we are now hosting an online sale for old Oblong and Palestine/Hutsonville jerseys. All proceeds go to the school's sports boosters. There are quite a few jerseys to select from but the total number is unclear. Attached are pictures of some of the jerseys we have. All jerseys start at $10 each. It is unclear what numbers are available at this time outside of those listed. I will be sure to post a list of what is available at a later date.

If you wish to see the jerseys we are at Oblong HS Wednesday the 15th from 4-5 PM. I can also schedule additional days if we have multiple people interested. If there is a number you are interested in please let me know and I will note it and look when I am back in the locker room.

This is a great opportunity to support the sports booster so please spread the word!

Thank you,

There are quite a few jerseys to select from but the total number is unclear. Attached are pictures of some of the jerseys we have. All jerseys start at $10 each. It is unclear what numbers are available at this time outside of those listed. I will be sure to post a list of what is available at a later date.

If you wish to see the jerseys we are at Oblong HS Wednesday the 15th from 4-5 PM. I can also schedule additional days if we have multiple people interested. If there is a number you are interested in please let me know and I will note it and look when I am back in the locker room.

This is a great opportunity to support the sports booster so please spread the word!

Thank you,
Coach Straka

Guest Teacher Training at RIU6 – Substitutes needed for RIU6 Region Schools

September 15 @ RIU6 from 8-3pm.

If you have a College Degree, an Emergency Teaching Permit can be issued for you to do day to day subbing in our schools as much or as little as needed. This training is a small preparatory program with some virtual videos, lots of paperwork, a few key special education topics, and a $25 processing fee, and you can get your emergency teaching permit to substitute in our schools and make some money on off days or every day as our schools are desperate. Email mlaverde@riu6.org or call 814-297-5103.



Future Training Days:

9/15/20, 11/10/20, 1/26/21, 3/30/21

You can see him telling the responders what each item is used for and how it will help in an emergency situation. Our plan is to equip each and every emergency responder in venango county with a sensory bag, our ultimate goal is to provide 1 for every vehicle.

We recognize our students that earned Hasson Hornet High Fives and students sit with their teams. Today we also recognized our Student of the Month nominees for January and February. They eat lunch on the stage and were announced to their peers. January’s word was ambition and February’s word was Citizenship. Way to go Hasson students!,2020-02-11 17:09:38,,

Whoa, we did it! The Oil City girls capped off a perfect season (15-0) tonight by beating Grove City 96-74. It is the first league title since 1973 for the girl’s team, and we believe the first undefeated season perhaps since then. Coach Charlie created a perfect line up, but GC didn’t go quietly, GC coach threw a good line up and we had to withstand the waves of talented swimmers one after another. But, in the end the Oilers came through. The girls also broke a pool record tonight that was set in 1996 by Warren. Morgan Stover, Emily Russell, Christina Smith and Christa Schneider posted a 1:43.85 topping the previous 1:44.56. And, we added a new district qualifier in walk on swimmer Ronni Hammerly, well done!
The fellas faded into the background tonight, but they too closed out the regular season with a win closing the regular season with a 13-2 record. 28-2 combined record is AWESOME!!! Coaches are so proud to wear Blue and White. Next up, the inaugural Region Cup meet at Grove City College on Saturday - GO OILERS! #oilcityswimming #oilerswimming #undefeatedseason",2.0,"Oil City High School Swim Team is with Emily Coxson.

If you're looking at the proposed class schedules and wondering what in the world ""synchronous"" and ""asynchronous"" mean, you're not alone. I suspect we'll be seeing these words a lot for the next little bit, so let's clear it up.

Tomorrow (FRIDAY) special is the #ptopizzaparty. This $20 deal benefits the Ocosta PTO and includes 2 balls of dough, pizza sauce, cheese, pepperoni, and instructions on how to make 2 ~12” pizzas.
This is a super fun activity to keep the kids busy and engaged - it takes around 30-40 minutes ( including cook time) to get dinner on the table.

Pizzas can be picked up at Aloha Alabama 3-6pm on Friday or delivered to your address in Westport/Grayland (before Pomegranate).

You can order today (Thursday)for tomorrow here: http://ocostapto.square.site/

Lets talk about healthy ""Cope Cakes"". The kids hear it all the time from me. We have to practice healthy coping skills when we are calm and collected so when our ""lizard brains"" switch on, we know what to do. Now is a great time to practice those skills. You have to try a skill at least 3 times before you say ""it didnt work"".

Family Activity to accompany Ms. Sweet’s Story

I picked a basic taco recipe, after thinking way too long about how cooking is a part of a families unique identity. How tacos are cooked in my house, probably are not the way they are cooked in yours. Take some time tonight and tell your kids what your families’ recipes are. Why are some foods saved for special occasions? Tell the stories of how you learned to cook. The mistakes you made along the way. Cooking #together is a great way to strengthen your families’ unique identity.

Today I learned: The Ocosta transportation supervisor wakes up at 3:30 AM when bad weather is forecast. At that time, he drives EVERY road that our buses will have to pass; monitors the weather forecast; and then calls the district Superintendent with his recommendation by 5:30AM.

You may not be aware (I wasn't) that many of our district bus routes contain narrow, gravelly, rural, and steep roads (many surrounded by potential hazards like cranberry bogs and ditches). Navigating a 40' bus, transporting 50+ children, through these routes can be challenging in the best of circumstances. Decisions to close or delay school are made to ensure the safety of everyone involved.

I just got home from seeing Mary Poppins at the Bishop Center for Performing Arts and it's at or near the top of one of my favorite performances there or anywhere including the 5th Avenue Theatre in Seattle where you can spend as much parking your car as buying a ticket at the Bishop Center. Tickets for this show are hard to come by but an additional matinee might be added next Saturday March 12th.

At the next station, families would wait while another staff member verified information and issued the equipment. After a short wait, the attendant would hand deliver the hardware and answer any questions. The whole process was smooth, orderly, sanitary, and safe.

Dear Families,
The speed of change during the past few weeks has left all of us feeling unanchored. A little more than three weeks ago, school was still in session, and everyone was beginning to show signs of restlessness in anticipation of a spring break. High school seniors were beginning to use the term ""senioritis,"" and looking forward to many treasured traditions and rites of passage on the way to graduation.

While we understand the health and safety reasons for this directive, we are deeply saddened by the loss. We so looked forward to being together again as a learning community before the summer months.

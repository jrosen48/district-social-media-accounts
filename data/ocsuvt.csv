In case you haven't heard yet, I am starting live workouts this morning (3/23/2020) at 10am live on YouTube. This will be happening every week day (Monday-Friday)!--with the possibly of bonus videos! I would love staff and students to get some exercise so feel free to follow along or watch the video later because it will be uploaded. All you need is your body and a water bottle.

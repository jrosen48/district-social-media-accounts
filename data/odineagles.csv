Dear Parents/Guardians,

Our Accelerated Reader program through Renaissance Learning is challenging students to engage in reading and to continue to build their reading skills. During the mandated school closure, students may take Accelerated Reader tests at home.

Students may access the Accelerated Reader tests using the following link.

https://global-zone08.renaissance-go.com/welcomeportal/372337

Each student will then log in as if they would at school. They will select “I am a Student” and then enter their login and passwords. They can then proceed as normal to take reading quizzes.

Thank you for continuing the partnership between home and school during this unprecedented time! We hope that the new access to Accelerated Reader at home will keep students reading!

Thank you!

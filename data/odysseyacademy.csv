I want to share with you another special organization that is here for you as well. It’s the Family Service Center (FSC) with many people specifically trained in supporting mental health.

We first met FSC when we lost our Galveston campus in Hurricane Ike. It was a very stressful time, and the staff at FSC came to OA to help us process and deal with all that was going on. They were so wonderful. I now serve on their board of directors and HIGHLY recommend them to anyone needing someone to talk with. They are just amazing!

Please take time to read their flyer and learn more. They have some great ideas about how to keep yourself healthy… physically, emotionally, and mentally. They also have contact information if you would like to reach out to them to talk with someone.

An amazing experience! Before we went to the cemetery we stopped by a museum that began with WWI and showed the build up to WWII. At the end of the tour there was a video that was shown that was split screen and it showed the Germans and the Allies preparing for D-Day. The video was so well done and the ability to capture both sides and to see real emotions on both sides was incredibly humbling. There was not a word spoken after the video. It was so silent you could hear a pin drop. My prayer is that many other students at Odyssey will go and see this historical sight. It is one thing to read about it in books but to actually be there and breath the same air and hear the waves crashing and to envision the war going on around is incredibly moving.",0.0,"Odyssey Academy added 34 new photos from March 15, 2016.

Reach out to the classroom teachers if you have specific questions related to their class and procedures.

Dear Odyssey Families,

We want to truly thank all of you for your support in the development of Odyssey's plan for reopening. Our plan was submitted to the Connecticut State Department of Education today, and we are waiting for approval. We consider this plan to be a draft, as we anticipate there will be adjustments that will be made in the coming weeks with any new requirements that we receive from the state. We welcome your feedback and suggestions!

REOPENING ODYSSEY - Fall 2020-1",0.0,"July 24, 2020

Dear Odyssey Families,

We want to truly thank all of you for your support in the development of Odyssey's plan for reopening. Our plan was submitted to the Connecticut State Department of Education today, and we are waiting for approval. We consider this plan to be a draft, as we anticipate there will be adjustments that will be made in the coming weeks with any new requirements that we receive from the state. We welcome your feedback and suggestions!

Make some coffee or tea and join in on the conversation.

This event is NOT for students.

However, parents will need to log in to their child's school e-mail in order to join the Meet.

The codes to join these Meets will be given out by the classroom teachers so be on the lookout for that.

We are working on an 8th grade celebration video highlighting all 8th graders at OMS. I have just sent out an email to all 8th graders asking for a baby picture and a current appropriate picture of each 8th grade student. I am asking for these to be emailed to me at my school email. I am also asking that if possible they be sent to me as PDF's. We are also sending out a google form for students to fill out regarding memories and fav. quotes. PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS GETTING COMPLETED! I NEED PICTURES BY MAY 5TH. If emailing them is an issue, please let me know either through this facebook page or my email! I am SOOO EXCITED to see the pictures of each 8th grade student. We are also sending a note to those 8th graders that online is not an option for them at this time to be able to get their pictures as well. Start sending me those PICS 8th GRADERS!!!!!!

We have some ways to help with this! Some of our amazing Oelwein businesses have offered to allow Huskies to park in their lots and access their internet.
We have also found that Medicom and Qwest offer some great options for making internet at home more affordable for lower income families (if you qualify for free or reduced lunch, you may qualify for their discounted internet rates)!
Head over to https://www.oelweinschools.com/help-with-internet-access-for-students/ for more information!

Your child is to have a neat and clean appearance and must wear their D.A.R.E. T-shirt which they will receive that day. The first few rows are reserved for the graduates. We remind you to turn off your cell phones during the ceremony. We also ask that you not clap for your individual child, but wait until the end to acknowledge all.
The ceremony will last approximately one hour. Students may go home with their parents. If you wish your child to ride home early with another adult, you must send a note to school. We are responsible for your child, so please check out with Mrs.Smock upon leaving. Students will not be allowed to make phone calls to make arrangements that day. If you cannot attend, your child will complete the day and go home as usual. If you have any questions, please call the school at 283-3015.

We remind you to turn off your cell phones during the ceremony. We also ask that you not clap for your individual child, but wait until the end to acknowledge all.

Hello! My name is Nicholas Dittmer, and I am currently a senior at Oelwein High School. I am 17 years old and involved in football, basketball, and track along with choir, and the national honor society.
-
I have been interning at CITY for the past month, and so far, my experience at CITY has been awesome! Everyone is always very friendly and willing to help me with anything I need. I am very thankful for the opportunity that CITY has given me through interning with them, and in return, I hope to give them a working student program to help boost their productivity.
-
The most excited I have been so far is when Colin Wetlaufer, CITY's President, gave me a project to do for the company that he was also really excited about.

These students would love to make approximately 40 fleece scarves that would be used by students in our elementary buildings to keep warm during the next few months. To bring this service based project to life, they will need 50 yards of fleece.

I feel very fortunate to be 1 of 10 teachers selected to participate in the Waterloo Black Hawks ""Dash 4 Cash"" event on Saturday, November 23 during their hockey game with Cedar Rapids. There will be $2500 at stake, and all of the money I collect will go towards purchasing materials for my technology classes. In addition, $3 of every ticket purchased with the following link will automatically go to OMS.

https://waterloo-black-hawks.square.site/product/mr-rex-dash-for-cash/25

Plans are being made to take a bus for students that would like to make the trip to the game, and it will be funded by the 21st Century Grant. Details on how to sign up will be coming soon. The students that sign up and ride the bus will not have to pay to ride the bus or get into the game.

The puck drops at 7:05 PM.

The 2020-21 school year began as most school years do - students flocking to school buses as they begin their day of school.

This year was a bit different - dozens of students opted for virtual learning every day. They will remain at home and do their learning that way while other students will rotate between in-school and virtual learning.

Whichever path a family chose, it all came together today!

OESJ Von Baker commits to Cornell for baseball

OESJ RHP Von Baker has committed to Head Coach Dan Pepicelli and the Cornell University. Cornell participates in NCAA Division I as part of the Ivy League.

Baker becomes the first player ever from OESJ High School to commit to a Division I school.

“Von is a true student athlete,” said OESJ Athletic Coordinator Travis Heiser. “He works hard inside and outside of the classroom. With a 92 MPH fastball, standing at 6’7” and weighing in at 235, he is a big presence on the pitcher’s mound. Also, he excels in the classroom.”

“He’s a very smart kid and academics are important to him and his family,” Heiser said. “He had a goal to play baseball at the Division 1 level while attending a top level college, and everyone at OESJ is happy he gets the opportunity to do it.”

We would like to congratulate Von and the Baker family on his commitment to Cornell.",0.0,"Congratulations Von! ⚾️

Students also had the chance to climb the Kane Mountain Fire Tower and enjoy the spectacular views. Heidi Sprouse, OESJ Pre-K teacher and author spoke with the students before their trip.

We know you still have many questions and we want to answer as many as we can for you. We also respect that you would like questions answered as soon as possible. We are compiling an FAQ document so that there is one central location for the answers to your questions. This will help families all have access to the same information in one location rather than trying to locate it in various posts or comments.
Questions can be sent to chruby@of90.net. We will share as many answers as we can via the FAQ and will continuously update it.

Grandy took a moment for the Court to recognize two of our outstanding teachers. Mr. Eric Meinkoth was recognized for the many ways he teaches students to be good citizens. Mrs. Ashley Frey was then recognized for her heartfelt support to students, as evidenced by the impact she made on Fulton graduate and OTHS student, Donnie Simpson.

We thank Judge Grandy and Catina Simpson for recognizing them as examples of the excellent educators in District 90.

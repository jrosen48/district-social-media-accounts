🚨 MAJOR NEWS! 🚨

This is definitely our most exciting #GoodNewsFriday yet! We were extremely excited to have received word that we have received funding through a CDBG grant to the tune of 💲5️⃣0️⃣0️⃣,0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣! This money is to revitalize the Senior Center and accomplish some much needed work. I cannot thank the team of people who made this possible enough: my Chief of Staff Linda Teel, our grant writer Lisa Andoscia, and our folks in the Senior Center and Planning Departments. We had fun surprising the seniors at bingo today!

Plans for the funding include: redoing the front entrance – ADA accessible doors, ramp and railings, installing a commercial kitchen to expand meal service, installing exterior patio, new fencing and landscaping, resolving drainage issues, repaving sections of parking lot for improved safety, upgrading the electrical system, replacing the old oil boilers to gas fired, and installing exterior insulation and cladding to the facility. Work is expected to begin in the spring of 2020.",0.0,"Did you know that it was one year ago today that we officially announced our big $500,000 grant for the Senior Center?

Our next spotlight goes to.... the Cumberland Highway Department!

Here is what their nominator had to say:

“I wanted to nominate the Cumberland Highway Department workers as Unsung Heroes this week because of their work on the playground. I took my daughter yesterday and it was absolutely beautiful. I can only imagine all the hard work they put in to get everything built, plus there is the new fence, and they put down grass.

If you haven't been over there yet, please go. You almost have to see it to believe how awesome it is. So I wanted to thank them for working so hard and for creating a really beautiful space for our kids and grandkids for years to come.

Thank you.""

Personally, here in Cumberland we are incredibly lucky to have such a vibrant Portuguese community in Town. They are an important part of our fabric. I appreciate the many contributions this community has made to make Cumberland the place it is today.

To you all, I say: Obrigado!",2020-06-10 17:00:49,,

One mile of river front, right next to Lonsdale, home to deer, ducks and rabbits. I took the time with Planning and Community Development Director, Jonathan Stevens to hike the site, inspecting the Pratt Dam portage area, unnamed Island, and to take in the view from the top of the JM Mills hill, 85 ft above the river.

You may have seen that the Council has adopted our administration’s conversation and management plan for this area - “New Pond Park.” The plan identifies this 62 acre Peterson/Puritan site and the future plans for a park, walking trails, playground, ball field, and enhanced river access.

I am always grateful to get to explore the beauty of this community.

My Community Outreach Coordinator got to go out to Diamond Hill Park to check out the work being done to improve the multi-purpose field by Tom Irwin Advisors.

I am so impressed by how high tech the work being done is. Our project advisor, Ian Lacey explains how it all works:

1.) Clear the weeds!

2.) Sand Master - improving drainage, should be done this afternoon!

3.) Seeding - adding performance turf grasses!

4.) Top Dressing - will help level the field.

5.) Grow-in: focusing on nutrients and getting stronger!

6.) One year maintenance! 🎉

Hi All! As many of you know, I am a spin instructor at SpinWorks. Every year, we run fundraisers to support the Northern RI Food Pantry (located in Cumberland). We are currently using our studio for a new cause (temporarily, of course): food collections!

Monday - Saturday 9am- 12pm, we will have donation boxes outside the studio to support our local food pantry. If you are in a position to donate, anything is greatly appreciated. If you're a business owner, and can order them large amounts of food (that they will pay for), let me know and I'll get you in contact with the right people.

Lastly, if you're willing to donate, but can't make those hours, reach out to me and we'll set up our own contact less pickup 🙂

Thanks friends! Feel free to share!",6.0,"I have had the privilege of volunteering at the Northern RI Food Pantry several times.

This represents a partnership between the Cumberland Recreation Department, Cumberland Fire, the Police Department, and Cumberland Emergency Medical Services. We are so thankful for the many ways that they continue to serve this community.

The Easter Bunny will begin his route (following along elementary school bus routes) at 10 am on Saturday riding on the back of a Fire Truck. There will be a Police Car in front and an EMS SUV behind. Children will get to wave to Easter Bunny as he passes through their streets.

We cannot tell you when exactly the Easter Bunny will arrive on your street, but listen for the sirens!

Here's to a hoppy and safe Easter for all!

P.S - we will be providing an update on how to follow along with the Bunny’s location soon. Make sure you like the Mayor’s page to get updates.",2020-04-09 17:11:11,,

Nationals! ⭐️🏅⚓️

I have to extend a huge congratulations to the ladies of Cumberland High School's 4x800 relay team who are on their way to Nationals! 🎉 Yesterday at the New England Championships they certainly had a race to remember with:

- An 8th place finish (ranking 1st in Rhode Island)
- A huge 17 second season best
- Finishing less than half a second away from a school record.
- Their place SECURED at Nationals!

I could not be more proud of Shakira, Grace, Emma, and Lizzie! The 4x800 relay certainly takes both speed and stamina.

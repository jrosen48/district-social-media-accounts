This past weekend we celebrated the Geneseo Central Class of 2020.

The community is so proud of you. We know the last few months have not been easy, both socially and academically and you still continued on with the very best you have to offer.

You became part of a learning system that was created on the fly and with what little time you had, you all did it with stride. You continued on with your academics, and never faulted and that is something to be commended and celebrated

You missed out on things like prom and senior trip, but know that the best is yet to come. You will go on and become amazing people and do amazing things. This was 3 months of life, a small fraction compared to your bright futures and during this unprecedented era you will take what you learned from what has happened to make the world a better place. Compassion, appreciation, understanding and maturity helped you through, these are traits that will see you well into your next chapter.

Remember to be brave, vast and brilliant, if you do nothing will stop you.

The Hot Corner returns this week for the LCN and our first special invitee is Geneseo senior Madison Whitney who has dealt with a few significant injuries that she has handled with the utmost class and character.
Here's what soccer coach Nick Drollette had to say...
""Maddy is a wonderful young woman. She has been the epitome of a leader and was named captain for her senior season. Her outlook through her two knee injuries has been incredibly positive. She is an inspiration to her teammates and coaches alike. Maddy isn't just a dedicated player, she is dedicated to the growth of the program and sport in general. This past summer she helped me coach the three and four year old girls micro-soccer group with more than 30 preschool girls. Maddy has a perpetual smile on her face and is mature beyond her years. She is a joy to coach and I am very excited to see what her future holds.""",0.0,"Livingston County News

Hi everyone! This is going to be a bit of a long post but I'd appreciate you taking the time to read it. Our hiring policy (practice?) has changed slightly to try and maintain a 10:1 ratio of kids to staff, so if there are 60 kids signed up we should have 6 counselors. As it stands now our registration numbers are on the low side which means we are currently in a holding pattern in terms of hiring new staff. If you haven't yet sent in your registration forms we would greatly appreciate you doing so in the next few days. Remember, you can drop them off to Mr. Rose or Ms. Howard at school and we will take care of them for you. Also, if you can help spread the word about getting forms in that would help us a great deal.

May 13, 2019 at 3:05 PM ·

This past week we have been talking about cooperation and community. The girls did a ladder run to work together as a team. A ladder run is when they run in a line and the last person sprints to the front of the line. Everyone had an opportunity to sprint to the front. They did a great job of supporting and encouraging one another! I attached some pictures of the ladder run. In addition we talked about the different communities that we are a part of and how they are important to our lives.

This Wednesday have your daughter wear her Disney clothes to practice.

Our practice 5K is on Friday, May 31 from 3:00-4:30 PM. You are welcome to come to this practice and cheer on the girls if you would like! We will send out more information about the practice 5K as we get closer.

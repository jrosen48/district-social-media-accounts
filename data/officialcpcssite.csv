We need your help as we navigate the logistics of reopening school in September. Please consider providing us with valuable survey information that will help with our decision making.

We're using a new tool called Thoughtexchange to gather your input. You'll be asked to answer one open-ended question with as many responses as you like and then move on to the next step which is Star. In Star, you'll see your thoughts and the thoughts of others and assign stars to each thought (from 1-5) depending on how strongly you agree or disagree with the idea.

Thoughtexchange keeps confidential who shared each thought and who assigned what ratings. You can rate as many thoughts as you'd like before moving on to Discover where you can see all the thoughts sorted by the average star rating.

You can also navigate by using the bar across the top to go back and share more ideas or star some more thoughts at any time. View the video below for more information!

The administrative team along with our Reopening Committee needs your help. Below is a link to a survey to gather information to help us prepare for reopening school in September.

We need parent and community input. Everyone can use the same link (below) and respondents will be asked to identify as belonging to a district. Respondents may participate more than once. For instance, they can answer as a parent of a student from another district, and an employee of Colton-Pierrepont.

Students of CPCS can also participate in the survey. We encourage our students in grades 7-12 to complete the survey. If students in younger grades wish to participate we ask parents to help guide them through the process.

The deadline for the Exchange has been set for a week from tomorrow--July 16th at 5PM

Hooray, more pictures of kids! Second grade is working on a wheel and axle research and maker project. First, the students used Lincoln Library’s FactCite 123 database and read about wheels and axles. They answered some questions, looked for examples around their homes, and then some built their own creations with a wheel and axle. Good job, 2nd Graders! .

We appreciate your understanding as we navigate adjustments with our food logistics. Our ultimate goal is to provide meals for CPCS students 18 years of age and under. With this goal in mind, we also have a responsibility to provide a safe work environment for food preparation, food distribution, and food pick-up for all individuals.

It has been determined that for CPCS to continue to provide meals in a safe and efficient manner we will have to adjust our pick-up location to the Hannawa Falls Fire Station on Mill Street, starting on Monday, March 30, 2020, from 11:30 am-12:30 pm.

As we continue to wait for further guidance from the Texas Education Agency, we do know, at this point, that students will be allowed to return to campus in August. Of course CDC guidelines will be followed as well as TEA's recommendations. The first and foremost consideration will be the safety and security of our students and staff. Please respond to the short survey that we need our parents to answer. Thank you, in advance for your participation.

Whichever method you choose, please only choose “yes” to one method. All students must follow the attendance requirements as required by law. Students will be counted present or absent when they log into the classroom and attend each class period. The Runge ISD grading policy, pre-Coronavirus, will be used for the new school year.

I wanted all to know that we are in daily communication with TEA and its guidance about Covid 19. We are monitoring this situation closely and area superintendents will be working together to make the best decision possible for districts. TEA has left the decision to open or close to local school districts. We want to make the best possible decision for our students and staff. The safety and well-being of our school family is priority.

At this time, we will move forward as scheduled. This could change tomorrow. If a decision to close is warranted, we will communicate and post this information as soon as possible.

Good evening,

I want to put out an official statement about a threat made at school today. A high school student made a terroristic threat to another student. Other students heard the threat and reported it to the teacher. In turn, the teacher reported it to the office. The Sheriff’s Office was immediately contacted and they quickly responded. The high school student was cooperative and had no weapon with him. However, he did make a verbal terroristic threat. After law enforcement investigated the incident, the young man was arrested. This person was also the one that stated that he was going to shoot up the school tomorrow. He is unable to do that. He is in jail now. I want to commend the students who heard the threat for doing the right thing and reporting it immediately to an adult on campus. In this day and age, we will not take any threat lightly. The safety and security of all our students and staff is top priority.

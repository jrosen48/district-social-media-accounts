February is Turner Syndrome Awareness Month ‚Äî- so on Tuesday, February 11th we ask that in honor of one of our own OHS Cheerleaders, Kylie Gardner, that everyone wear Purple as the theme for the night for the Girls Home Basketball Game against Gothenburg. Kylie has been an OHS Cheerleader for the past three years, she is such a hard worker & always has the BIGGEST smile on her face as she Cheers on your Sons & Daughters in all their athletic events. Kylie is ALWAYS present at all the State send offs. Kylie never asks for anything but is always so willing to give! This is going to be a surprise for her & one that will make her feel on top of the world. Please join us in celebration of Kylie & wear Purple üíúüíú",5.0,"Russchelle Sutherland Dehning

My name is Brandi Lippert and I am new to Ogallala. In the past I worked with others at Christmas time the ""Adopt a Grandparent” initiative in our communities. I would like to continue this initiative in Ogallala. Adopt a Grandparent initiative provides a pair of socks and lotion wrapped to each resident in the nursing home (Indian Hills). We have a total of 37 residents. I am also the Ogallala Middle School Counselor where I plan to have some students make cards and deliver the socks and lotion to the residents on December 17, 2019. You can adopt one senior for $12 or 3 for $30. If you would like to adopt a grandparent feel free to drop money off at the Middle School or mail them.

Several Nebraska area bands are invited each year to compete in the Street Marching and Field Marching routines in Ogallala. The parade is free to the public so please show up and support the participating students!

The Street Marching begins at 1:00pm with the best viewing along Spruce Street. The Judges Station is near 4th and Spruce while the end of the route is at the High School Football Field.

The Field Marching begins at 2:30pm at the Football Field following the Street Marching event. There is an entry fee of $3 for the Field Marching event and Activity Passes cannot be used. The entry fee helps fund the Music Boosters and supports the students of the Fine Arts Department. Awards for both events will follow the Field Marching event.

There will be concessions at the Football Field with the proceeds to help support the Music Boosters.

If you need any other details please feel free to contact any of the Booster Club members, including Lance Larington at Nebraska Printworks, or Mike Schlake at Ogallala Public Schools.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=128907685130955&id=110408926980831,,0.0,"7th Annual Indian Marching Festival

Need books? Due to a generous donation, Youth Impact has thousands of new, fantastic FREE books. Stop in tomorrow or Saturday and pick out a few when you make a cash donation and get a limited edition tote to carry them.

The original event requested a $100 donation but I spoke with Executive Director Jay Stretch who told me that YI appreciates any amount of cash donation as it has had to cancel two of its fundraisers and needs to recoup its losses to serve our Ogden-area kids.

Census data is completely confidential and is only used to produce statistics that provide funds for youth activities, such as classroom technology and free and reduced lunch, which many in our community are utilizing daily. The data also supports funding for affordable housing and transportation as well as health-related programs like CHIP, SNAP, Medicaid and Medicare.

Take 10 minutes today to fill out the Census. It super simple and can be done on the computer or by telephone and with the support of a Census worker.

Ogden City Government is counting on each and everyone of their residents doing their part to support the community and ensuring they count in the 2020 Census.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1570903006398435&id=131001210388629,"2020 Census | United States Census Bureau

2020census.gov",0.0,"Ogden's 2020 Census response rate is increasing, but there's still a ways to go. It is extremely important that everyone in the home, from the youngest to the oldest, COUNT in the U.S. Census Bureau.

Census data is completely confidential and is only used to produce statistics that provide funds for youth activities, such as classroom technology and free and reduced lunch, which many in our community are utilizing daily. The data also supports funding for affordable housing and transportation as well as health-related programs like CHIP, SNAP, Medicaid and Medicare.

Take 10 minutes today to fill out the Census. It super simple and can be done on the computer or by telephone and with the support of a Census worker.

Ogden City Government is counting on each and everyone of their residents doing their part to support the community and ensuring they count in the 2020 Census.

“Katie has been working as an ERI staff for almost 7 years, I believe. She is extremely dedicated to the program the school. She has great strength for her co-workers because she has been doing it so long she has seen the results from properly running the ERI program. She is excited and engaged in teaching the little kids letters, letter sounds and over all improving literacy from the very beginning of a students educational career. In my opinion, without staff like Katie the bigger goals that district has set would never happen. The ""little people"" that implement these programs on a daily basis make our district look good. They often go unnoticed or unrecognized for doing all the hard work.” -",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1519366238218779&id=131001210388629,,0.0,"Congratulations to Katie Edwards, Polk Elementary ERI staff assistant, for being honored with Ogden School District's February Achieving Higher Award!

Did you know that the Utah Clean Cities Coalition launched their first Idle Free campaign in 2006 and by 2010 Governor Herbert declared an Idle Free month in Utah? Since then over 71 mayors and 400 schools have gotten on-board and Ogden School District is one of them.

Please be part of the solution and turn your key to be idle free when you drop-off and pick-up your students as well as anytime you're in a drive through, parked at a railroad crossing or just sitting in your vehicle.

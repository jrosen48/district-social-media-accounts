We heard your stories of challenging times and the hardship that distance learning placed on you and your loved ones. We also heard your gratitude for keeping our communities safe and spending more time with families.
Your experiences are invaluable as we plan for the 2020-21 school year during these times of uncertainty. It is our shared goal to lift up our students through education, while keeping them safe. Your voices will undoubtedly help us do that.
You can find the full results of our Fall Planning Survey on our website here: https://education.mn.gov/MDE/dse/health/covid19/publicEng/.
As we look toward the future, please know Minnesota school districts and charter schools are working extremely hard to support our students, families and educators. With your help, we will find innovative solutions to the challenges of our times.",2020-07-10 09:52:03,,

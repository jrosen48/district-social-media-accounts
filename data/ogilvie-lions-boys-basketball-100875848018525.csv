Afternoon Basketball at Isle High School

The fifth annual afternoon basketball game between Isle and Ogilvie, members of the Great River Conference, was played Thursday at Isle. Tipoff was at 1 p.m. so all Isle students in grades K-12 (about 400 kids) could attend.

The two schools rotate between hosting a boys game and a girls game each season.

Thanks to local sponsors, a ""Husky Pride"" t-shirt was provided to every Isle student who attended the game, and students who stuck out from the crowd by displaying ""Husky Pride"" were invited on the court at halftime to compete for prizes.

The final score was Isle 63, Ogilvie 47 ... and a great time was had by all.",0.0,"Had a great time competing at Isle Public Schools yesterday! Thank you for the awesome environment to play in!

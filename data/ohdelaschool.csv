Last Friday US Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos noted that states will have the flexibility to cancel state testing this year given the COVID-19 situation. States choosing to do so will need to file a waiver with the US Department of Education. On Sunday, 3/22/20, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine indicated in his press conference that he would be asking the General Assembly of Ohio to suspend state testing for this year. The General Assembly will be in session this week, and it is anticipated that this legislation will be passed at that point. If passed that legislation would pave the way for the Ohio Department of Education (ODE) to submit a waiver request. OHDELA has suspended all testing planning and scheduling as we await updates on that legislation and a formal announcement from ODE. For now, all families who had scheduled a testing time in the April 3-April 17 window should assume that they will NOT test during that period. We will provide additional updates as we receive them.

Today, March 23rd, through Friday, March, 27th, is spring break for OHDELA students and instructional staff. There will be no live class sessions this week. However, this is a great time to catch up on missed assignments and improve low course grades. You have access to all online courses and supplemental resources (iXL, iReady, Newsela, etc.) throughout this week. Also, if you have unsubmitted offline time from prior weeks, or if you complete offline time this week, please be sure to submit that from within the appropriate course.
Teachers are out of the office and will not be available to respond to calls or emails, but Advisors, Administrators, and Office Staff are still available via email and phone, so please reach out if you need anything. IT support will also continue to be available this week.

Today, March 23rd, through Friday, March, 27th, is spring break for OHDELA students and instructional staff. There will be no live class sessions this week. However, this is a great time to catch up on missed assignments and improve low course grades. You have access to all online courses and supplemental resources (iXL, iReady, Newsela, etc.) throughout this week. Also, if you have unsubmitted offline time from prior weeks, or if you complete offline time this week, please be sure to submit that from within the appropriate course.
Teachers are out of the office and will not be available to respond to calls or emails, but Advisors, Administrators, and Office Staff are still available via email and phone, so please reach out if you need anything. IT support will also continue to be available this week.

As we wrap up the semester and finish out our fall classes, we want to remind everyone about the offline tracker tool. To receive credit for any activities you do that are not within your class, you have to let your teachers know about them by filling out the information in the offline tracker. Examples of these sorts of activities would be studying, doing a worksheet with paper and pencil, researching another website, typing an assignment in google docs, or basically anything you do that is ‚Äúoutside‚Äù of the buttons in your classroom. Its super easy to do and the video below shows you how.

How to add time to your engagement and attendance

As we move into spring, we will be teaching you some tips on how to use this as a part of your daily school routine, but let‚Äôs use this last week of the semester to be sure everyone knows how to use this great tool to get credit for the learning being done outside the classroom!

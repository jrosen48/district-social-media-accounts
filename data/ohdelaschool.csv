Last Friday US Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos noted that states will have the flexibility to cancel state testing this year given the COVID-19 situation. States choosing to do so will need to file a waiver with the US Department of Education. On Sunday, 3/22/20, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine indicated in his press conference that he would be asking the General Assembly of Ohio to suspend state testing for this year. The General Assembly will be in session this week, and it is anticipated that this legislation will be passed at that point. If passed that legislation would pave the way for the Ohio Department of Education (ODE) to submit a waiver request. OHDELA has suspended all testing planning and scheduling as we await updates on that legislation and a formal announcement from ODE. For now, all families who had scheduled a testing time in the April 3-April 17 window should assume that they will NOT test during that period. We will provide additional updates as we receive them.

As we wrap up the semester and finish out our fall classes, we want to remind everyone about the offline tracker tool. To receive credit for any activities you do that are not within your class, you have to let your teachers know about them by filling out the information in the offline tracker. Examples of these sorts of activities would be studying, doing a worksheet with paper and pencil, researching another website, typing an assignment in google docs, or basically anything you do that is “outside” of the buttons in your classroom. Its super easy to do and the video below shows you how.

How to add time to your engagement and attendance

As we move into spring, we will be teaching you some tips on how to use this as a part of your daily school routine, but let’s use this last week of the semester to be sure everyone knows how to use this great tool to get credit for the learning being done outside the classroom!

The bullying was so intense that he would come home with a bloody nose due to his blood pressure being so high. The stress was almost more than he could bare. Now he has severe anxiety and it is very difficult for him to trust anyone. He no longer tries to talk to anyone his age because of the fear of being bullied. He has always been a good student and that is one of the many reasons he was bullied. Now that he is enrolled at OHDELA, a lot of his stress is gone due to the fact that he does not have to worry about being bullied.""

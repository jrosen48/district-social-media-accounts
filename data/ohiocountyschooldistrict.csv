Bopp said she is excited to continue her academic and athletic pursuits as a member of the Thundering Herd, but she noted that she still has much to look forward to and much to accomplish in her senior year at The Palace on the Hill.

Last February, Bopp won her first West Virginia championship in the 100-yard breast stroke. She looks forward to continuing her academic and athletic success in her final year as a Wheeling Park Patriot. Bopp is the daughter of Diann and Victor Bopp.

This week, we will learn about GRATITUDE!

Feeling and expressing GRATITUDE can help improve your overall mental health. It's important to take time to allow yourself to feel that gratitude and express it to the person, place, or thing that brought that feeling to you.

Sometimes, when we are feeling down, it is hard to find things for which to be grateful. We feel the burden of negativity and ""bad luck"". However, we can quickly find GRATITUDE by reminding ourselves of the people who love us, our needs that are met, and the things that make us happy.

This week, we will learn about COPING SKILLS! These are strategies you can use to help you calm down when you are feeling angry, sad, and overwhelmed.

When you use healthy coping skills, you don't only feel better but are able to think more clearly to better handle the situation.

Coping skills can be either negative or positive. The best way to decipher between the two is to ask yourself:

⭐️Is this healthy?
⭐️Is this safe?
⭐️Is this helpful?

If you can't confidently answer yes to all of these questions, it would probably be best to choose a better coping skill.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1373083313081332&id=298822727174068,,0.0,"❤️ Social Skill of the Week ❤️

This week is all about being an UPSTANDER!

An upstander is someone who stands up when they see something wrong. You can be an upstander by saying something, doing something, or telling someone. But what does that mean?

Say something to the bully:
Stop. - We don't do that. - That's not cool. - You aren't being nice

Say something to the other person:
Are you ok? - Want to sit together at lunch? - Don't listen to them.

Do something:
Change the subject - Ask about homework - Don't laugh or play along.

Tell someone:
Tell an adult - Tell a parent - Tell a teacher - Tell a coach!

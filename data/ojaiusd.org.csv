A quick reminder that OUSD's Summer Meals program ends this Friday, July 24th! Our last meal distribution service will be held Friday at Meiners Oaks Elementary, 400 S. Lomita Avenue, from 11 a.m. to 1 pm.

On August 19th, meal service returns for district families, who have enrolled their children in OUSD schools, whether on-campus or at meal distribution points (TBD). Our families also have an opportunity to apply for free or reduced fee meals. Look for a mailed packet to go out in early August.

Dear OUSD Family,

It is with deep sadness that I share that OUSD employee Maurya Foy passed away this week.

Maurya began her career with Ojai Unified in 2008 as a substitute teacher, working at every site within the District, and finding her love of teaching. This was a second career for Maurya, and she took her new adventure one step further, and went back to school to earn her Education Specialist credential. She became a part-time RSP teacher at Chaparral High School for the 2013-2014 school year, and served the needs of the students at Chaparral High School until her passing on May 28, 2020, at home with her family. She was very dedicated to her work in helping her students to succeed.

If you would like to make a contribution in Maurya‚Äôs name, her family has asked that it be a contribution to your favorite charity ‚Äì Maurya herself was always supportive of the Humane Society.

Each week,Ms. Taylor volunteers with Nordhoff High School's Fine Arts students, teaching relief and monotype printmaking. Some of these students are preparing their creations for display and sale at the 43rd annual ""Art in the Park"" Memorial Weekend, May 23rd & May 24th.

As a very active artist herself, Ms. Taylor's newest creation will be coming soon to the Ojai Valley Inn. The Art of the Egg, an artistic egg hunt installation that will display beginning March 19th, includes eight eggs, decorated and designed by Ojai Studio Artists, including Ms. Taylor's contribution. Thanks to the Inn for its support of local art and artists, as well as a $5000 to the Studio Artists for scholarships to local art students!

Hello and Happy Friday!

I hope you all had a wonderful day! As I was visiting classrooms today, I was reminded that so many of our students love Valentine's day, and what a great opportunity it is to remind us of the value of kindness. We can recognize and acknowledge the inherent goodness of our students and each other on a daily basis. One needs only to chat with children, witness the supportive acts of staff, marvel at our daily volunteers, attend a PTO event, or participate in one of our many amazing events to recognize that huge hearts are alive and well in our learning community.

We hope you enjoy snapshots of today's events, and how our schools celebrate #theheartandfutureofOjai

Have a wonderful Presidents Week! We look forward to seeing you and your children back on Monday, February 24th.

Since 2002, Food For Thought Ojai has provided garden education at OUSD school sites, working with teachers and students to keep our school gardens thriving and ready for lessons in nutrition, history, geography, math, and science. Acting as #experientialeducation opportunities, these gardens are places to play, relax, taste and experience the joys of gardening.

FFTOjai's on-going program has helped to raise awareness of the importance of healthy nutritional practices, and the integral role of agriculture in our community, encouraging students to reconnect to the land and the environment that sustains them.
Recently, OUSD students collected seeds for a seed bank and harvested lettuce, planted in the fall.

Last week, Mira Monte Elementary School opened its newest on-campus project - several ""Wall Ball"" walls!

Wall Ball is a game - similar to hand ball - that our students and parents wanted to add to the many recess and lunchtime activity choices at Mira Monte. Integrating both #wellness and #creativity, this project was funded by Mira Monte Elementary School's PTO, and designed and created by local artist Gayel Childress and Mira Monte's 4th and 5th grade students.

We're thankful for our community of artists who continue to engage with our schools and students on projects like Mira Monte Elementary School's newest ""functional"" art project!

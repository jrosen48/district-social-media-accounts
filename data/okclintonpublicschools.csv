Happy Tuesday Southwest families! We are working hard trying to contact all of our students. If you have not heard from someone at school, please let us know. Don't forget our new CPS Hotline number 323-2855 where you can order meals, basic school supplies, or talk with a counselor.

If any parents or students would like to speak with me directly, you can call or text me at 972-885-8521.

Even though we can't be together right now, I want to challenge all Southwest Twisters to continue to be bucket fillers every day! Today, I'm sharing a bucket filler puzzle that you can do online. I'd love for you take a picture of your completed puzzle and put it in the comments!

Have a wonderful rest of your day and enjoy the beautiful sunshine! Mrs. Quintero

SPRING BREAK 2020 & Cardboard Boats Races :-) Yes, indeed! We kicked off the 2020 Spring Break with the traditional Clinton Cardboard Boats Races. The race runs the course of the Lazy River all around Water-Zoo and with our Lazy River's 400 feet, it's a major achievement to even finish the race. Just look at the pics. The teachers and the kids had loads of fun, so if your school would like to visit us for a bit of a silly day, or even really just swimming ;-) make sure to get in touch!

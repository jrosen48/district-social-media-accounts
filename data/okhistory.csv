On August 19, 1958, members of the OKC NAACP Youth Council occupied seats at the Katz Drug Store lunch counter in downtown OKC and politely asked to be served. When denied service, the students remained seated in a peaceful protest. After three days of the student sit-in (led by Clara Luper), the management at Katz Drug Store agreed to serve them and it became an integrated lunch counter.

On August 19, 1958, members of the OKC NAACP Youth Council occupied seats at the Katz Drug Store lunch counter in downtown OKC and politely asked to be served. When denied service, the students remained seated in a peaceful protest. After three days of the student sit-in (led by Clara Luper), the management at Katz Drug Store agreed to serve them and it became an integrated lunch counter. This was the first direct action in a struggle for civil rights that would last several years. The Clara Luper Legacy Committee will host a virtual celebration of the sit-in movement tonight at 6:30 p.m. at www.claraluperlegacy.com.

Earlier that year, Wiley Post had constructed a hybrid floatplane from a Lockheed Orion. He wanted to test the operational capabilities of the aircraft with a long-distance flight. He asked his friend Will Rogers to join him on a junket to Alaska and Siberia. Unfortunately, the hybrid Orion proved to be aerodynamically unstable. Shortly after takeoff, Post lost control of the aircraft and it crashed into the Walakpa Lagoon near Point Barrow, Alaska.

On July 30, 1956, Anita Hill was born near Morris, Oklahoma. She was academically gifted from a young age, and eventually became an attorney, educator, and author. In 1991, Hill was forced into the national spotlight after she accused U.S. Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. Hill testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but Thomas narrowly received Senate confirmation. Although Thomas was appointed to serve as an associate justice, Hill’s efforts brought a great deal of attention to the issue of sexual harassment in our country. Learn more at bit.ly/AnitaHillOK.

It was the largest of approximately 107 documented Civil War military engagements throughout Indian Territory. The engagement took place just two weeks after the famous Battles of Gettysburg and Vicksburg. Approximately 9,000 Union and Confederate troops, mostly American Indians and African Americans, were involved in the Battle of Honey Springs. Of those, approximately 200 total casualties were suffered. After a decisive Union victory, Confederates lost control of Indian Territory north of the Arkansas River.

On July 16, 1935, the world’s first parking meter was installed in Oklahoma City. It was invented by Carl Magee as a solution to parking congestion. The problem was that people who worked downtown occupied all of the parking spots, which forced retail customers to park far away from stores. The new parking meters solved this problem—and you could park for only 5 cents per hour! Learn more at bit.ly/ParkingMeter.

On July 13, 1888, a post office was established in Alikchi, Indian Territory (present-day McCurtain County). Alikchi is the Choctaw word for “doctor” or “medicine man,” and the community’s name is related to the nearby sulphur springs—believed to have healing properties.
The Choctaw Nation’s Apukshunnubbee District court grounds were also located in Alikchi. This is where the last execution under Choctaw law took place (which happened to be on July 13, 1899). The man executed was William Going, who had been convicted of murder.

The Choctaw Nation’s Apukshunnubbee District court grounds were also located in Alikchi. This is where the last execution under Choctaw law took place (which happened to be on July 13, 1899). The man executed was William Going, who had been convicted of murder.

On July 2, 1964, the Civil Rights Act was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson. The act prohibited discrimination (on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin) in public places; provided for the integration of schools and other public facilities; and made employment discrimination illegal.
Oklahoma’s Black citizens had been fighting to end segregation and discrimination for many years prior to 1964, so this was an important victory. However, the Civil Rights Act did not end discrimination completely. There was still work to be done.

Ladd’s great-great-grandfather, Frederick Drummond (1864–1913), worked in Pawhuska and later settled in Hominy. Frederick and his wife Addie built a beautiful home there in 1905. The 115-year-old Frederick Drummond Home is open for tours Wednesdays through Sundays. For tour times and admission prices, please visit www.okhistory.org/drummondhome. Still curious about the Drummond family lineage? Below we trace the paternal line from Ladd all the way to Frederick.

On June 26, 1901, a post office was established in a town known as Praper (Creek County). It grew as an oil-boom town after the development of the Glenn Pool Field in 1905. A railroad was built through town the following year, and the community became a major shipping point (often transporting crude oil to Texas refineries). In December 1906 the post office was re-designated as Kiefer, and moved 2.5 miles to the west. Learn more about Kiefer, Oklahoma, at bit.ly/KieferOK.

On June 5, 1950, the U.S. Supreme Court made a ruling in the “McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents” case—deciding that a state university could not treat one student differently, solely because of his race.
Chief Justice Fred Vinson indicated that the treatment of George W. McLaurin at the University of Oklahoma was itself a violation of the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause. Vinson wrote: “Such restrictions impair and inhibit his ability to study, to engage in discussions and exchange views with other students, and, in general, to learn his profession.” Learn more at bit.ly/McLaurinOK.

On May 31–June 1, 1921, one of our country’s single worst incidents of racial violence took place in Tulsa, Oklahoma. During the course of 18 terrible hours, more than 1,000 homes and businesses were destroyed, and credible estimates of deaths range from 50 to 300. This was the Tulsa Race Massacre.
By the time the violence ended, the city had been placed under martial law, thousands of Tulsans were being held under armed guard, and the state’s second-largest African American community had been burned to the ground. One of the great tragedies of Oklahoma history, the Tulsa Race Massacre has lived on as a potent symbol of the ongoing struggle of black and white citizens to forge a common destiny out of an often troubled past.

On May 12, 1903, a post office was established in Supply, Oklahoma Territory (present-day Woodward County). The town was named after nearby Camp Supply—a frontier military post established in 1868. It was not until May of 1943 that the town’s name was changed to Fort Supply.
From 1938 until 1942, a dam and reservoir were constructed just south of town in the valley of Wolf Creek. At that time, it was the largest earthen dam in the United States. Learn more about the town of Fort Supply at bit.ly/FortSupplyTown.

Once bountiful, then exploited to near extinction, the bison have persevered and endured as a symbol of the American West.

In April 1910, Bud and Temple Abernathy (ages 10 and 6) rode alone on horseback from Crossroads Ranch near Frederick, Oklahoma, all the way to New York City.
Jack Abernathy, father of the adventurous young boys, was a close friend of President Theodore Roosevelt and was planning to meet him in New York City. Abernathy’s sons begged him to allow them to go ahead and travel the 2,000 miles on horseback to meet their dad and President Roosevelt. The trip took the boys approximately two months and they arrived in time to ride in a parade with President Roosevelt.
And how did the boys get back home? They drove themselves in an automobile, of course! The Abernathy boys became celebrities and took several cross-country trips in the years that followed.

On April 15, 1897, the first commercial oil well was drilled in present-day Oklahoma. The Nellie Johnstone No. 1 was drilled after George B. Keeler noticed oil seeping from the ground on the south bank of the Caney River near Bartlesville. The well produced more than 100,000 barrels of crude oil before it was plugged in 1948.

It was supposed to be the third mission to land on the Moon, but an explosion on board meant that the spacecraft would have to circle the Moon without landing. The Oklahoma connection to Apollo 13 was Fred Haise (lunar module pilot), who graduated from the University of Oklahoma and served in the Oklahoma Air National Guard.

On March 30, 1897, a tornado hit Chandler, Oklahoma Territory. It killed an estimated 15 people, injured hundreds, and almost destroyed the entire town. By 1898, sturdier brick and stone buildings were constructed. Several of those territorial commercial buildings, homes, and churches are now listed in the National Register of Historic Places (as are a few buildings constructed by the WPA and those related to Route 66).

It was the terminus of the Muscogee (Creek) and Cherokee Trail of Tears, and eventually became part of the Osage, Muscogee (Creek), and Cherokee Nations. The Texas Road and the Arkansas River functioned as main arteries for travel—serving explorers, traders, immigrants, and the military.

On February 22, 1912, coal miner Rufino Rodrigues saved more than 150 men (some claims have estimated 190 and others as many as 259) from a fire in the No. 5 Shaft in Lehigh, Oklahoma. After discovering the fire, and at great risk to his own safety, Rodrigues did not immediately escape the coal mine, but started a 1.5-mile journey throughout the complex to warn the unsuspecting miners of the danger. To combat the smoke he carried a water bucket to soak his wool shirt and then cover his face. Dazed from smoke inhalation, he had to be pulled out of the mine. Nine miners did not survive the blaze, but many more would have been trapped without Rodrigues’s warning.

Of course, one was only a nine-day term (in January 1963, following the death of US Senator Robert S. Kerr). The sitting governor, J. Howard Edmondson, resigned in order to be appointed by Nigh to fill Kerr’s Senate seat. Learn more about Governor George Nigh and seven decades of Oklahoma’s political history during a Lunch and Learn with Dr. Bob and Governor George Nigh next Wednesday, February 26, at noon.

On January 17, 1894, a post office was established in a town known as Lawson. But in February 1903, the post office was re-designated as Quay.
Quay was a quiet, agricultural trade center until the 1910s and 1920s (when it quickly became an oil boom town). The estimated population was 4,000 people! By the time the first federal census was taken in 1930, the town had 186 residents. As the Great Depression set in and oil production declined, people moved away. Quay was disincorporated in August 2000 and is no longer officially a town. Learn more at bit.ly/QuayOK.

On January 13, 1903, legend has it that John Wilkes Booth committed suicide while staying at the Grand Avenue Hotel in Enid, Oklahoma Territory. By this time, Booth was using the name David E. George.
A doctor diagnosed the cause of death as self-administered arsenic poisoning. Later it was told that the deceased had purchased strychnine that morning at a local drug store. The body was taken to Penniman’s Furniture Store, also a funeral home. A coroner’s jury soon heard stories about this strange, locally unknown man: he was a house painter who did not know how to paint, who always had access to money but died penniless, who frequented bars and loved alcohol, who often quoted Shakespeare, who knew no one but was known by many outside Enid, and who was quoted as saying, “I killed the best man that ever lived.”

The doors were built to open inward, and when people crowded them to escape, they were trampled. This tragic fire resulted in new laws that required school exit doors to open outward.

Did you see any ghosts? 👻 Share your stories in the comments!
It is estimated that Oklahoma has had approximately 2,000 ghost towns. These towns sprang into existence and died due to economic booms and busts, the routing of railroad lines, power struggles between town promoters, and even natural disasters. Towns such as Hochatown, old Kaw City, Lugert, and Sardis disappeared when reservoirs and lakes were developed.
Ghost towns everywhere have a certain lure. Faded, weather-worn signs dangling in the wind and stone foundations of former buildings, as indications of long-forgotten settlements. Learn more about ghost towns in Oklahoma at bit.ly/OKhistoryGhostTowns.

On October 24, 1901, Ida B. Bleini was appointed as the first postmaster of Grant, located in present-day Choctaw County, Oklahoma. The town was named to honor President Ulysses S. Grant, and can trace its origin to c. 1885 when Basil Gooding opened a store at the site.
At one time, there were as many as 30 businesses in Grant. The east-to-west Arkansas and Choctaw Railroad initially surveyed a route through Grant, but the tracks were actually laid five miles north of town. Many entrepreneurs relocated their businesses to the new rail line, and in 1902 the town of Hugo formed at that location. Learn more about the town of Grant at bit.ly/GrantOK.

On October 8, 1918, the 36th Infantry Division suffered approximately 1,300 casualties during a battle near Saint-Étienne, France. Two men who entered service from Oklahoma, Samuel M. Sampler and Harold L. Turner, received the Medal of Honor for their bravery on this day. Both Sampler and Turner served in the 142nd Infantry Regiment, 36th Division.
And #DidYouKnow? The 36th Division had more American Indians than any other unit. Most were assigned to the 142nd’s Company E. When the commander of the 142nd suspected that Germans were wiretapping communication lines, several of the Choctaws from Company E helped by transmitting messages in their native language. This led to their designation as Code Talkers. Learn more about the Code Talkers in “The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture”—bit.ly/CodeTalkersOK.

On September 7, 1931, a new bridge across the Red River (located between Colbert, Oklahoma, and Denison, Texas) was finally opened to traffic. The free bridge had been at the center of a dispute that saw involvement from both the Oklahoma National Guard and the Texas Rangers. Before the dispute was settled, Oklahoma Governor William H. “Alfalfa Bill” Murray declared martial law and even showed up to the scene armed with a revolver. This controversy is often referred to as the Red River Bridge War. In the end, the free bridge near Colbert remained open until 1995 (when it was demolished and replaced with a new bridge).

On August 30–31, 1975, a large music festival took place in Atoka. “48 Hours in Atoka” was Oklahoma’s answer to Woodstock and other music festivals across the country. Advance tickets were only $10, and the crowd size was estimated at 40,000 people! Performers included Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Jerry Lee Lewis, Freddy Fender, Jessi Colter, Larry Gatlin, Hoyt Axton, David Allan Coe, and Jerry Jeff Walker. Many music historians consider the festival in Atoka to be the beginning of the outlaw country music movement.

On August 15, 1935, Wiley Post and Will Rogers were killed in a tragic plane crash. Both men were avid boosters of aviation and technology.
Earlier that year, Wiley Post had constructed a hybrid floatplane from a Lockheed Orion. He wanted to test the operational capabilities of the aircraft with a long-distance flight. He asked his friend Will Rogers to join him on a junket to Alaska and Siberia. Unfortunately the hybrid Orion proved to be aerodynamically unstable. Shortly after takeoff, Post lost control of the aircraft and it crashed into the Walakpa Lagoon near Point Barrow, Alaska.

Suddenly, two armed men (one with a machine gun) interrupted their bridge game and abducted Mr. Urschel and Mr. Jarrett. This began a startling kidnapping case that evoked the new Lindbergh kidnapping laws, led to 21 convictions, coined a new name for FBI agents, and culminated in one of the first filmed trials.

On July 17, 1959, Governor J. Howard Edmondson signed a bill that legalized the sport of boxing in Oklahoma. Prior to that date, it was a misdemeanor to engage in a prizefight in the Sooner State.
The Oklahoma Territorial Legislature had declared in 1890 that pugilism was “a crime against the public peace” and rejected a bill to legalize boxing in 1895. Although Governor Lee Cruce used the Oklahoma National Guard to enforce the state’s prizefighting law, Oklahoma’s anti-boxing legislation was unpopular and so it was ignored.

On July 17, 1863, the Battle of Honey Springs took place near present-day Checotah, Oklahoma. It was the largest of approximately 107 documented Civil War military engagements throughout Indian Territory. The engagement took place just two weeks after the famous Battles of Gettysburg and Vicksburg. Approximately 9,000 Union and Confederate troops, mostly American Indians and African Americans, were involved in the Battle of Honey Springs. Of those, approximately 200 total casualties were suffered. After a decisive Union victory, Confederates lost control of Indian Territory north of the Arkansas River. The Union victory also ensured federal control of Fort Gibson in Indian Territory and Fort Smith in Arkansas.

Wheelock Academy is located near present-day Millerton, Oklahoma. It functioned as a boarding school for American Indian girls, mostly Choctaw, from 1884 to 1955. The origin of the institution dates to 1832 when a Christian missionary couple, Alfred and Harriet Wright, resumed the work they had earlier conducted among the Choctaws in Mississippi. Following Choctaw removal to Indian Territory, the Wrights established a mission station, school, and church.
Wheelock Academy was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1965. It is nationally significant as the first academy in the Choctaw Nation and as the model that other tribes in Indian Territory used when creating their own schools. Wheelock is one of 22 National Historic Landmarks in Oklahoma. Learn more about Wheelock Mission and Academy in “The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture”—bit.ly/WheelockOK.

On July 1, 1834, a post office was established at Eagletown, located in present-day McCurtain County, Oklahoma. It was named for the many eagles that nested in a nearby swamp along the Mountain Fork River. Eagletown was prominent in regional history from the early 19th century and in the period of Choctaw national sovereignty from the 1830s to 1906. The Choctaw rapidly recovered from the trauma of the Trail of Tears, and Eagletown became a trading center on the much-traveled Military Trace. In addition to a store, by the 1850s there were several gristmills, a water mill, cotton gins, and a sawmill in the vicinity. A ferry also operated there on the Mountain Fork River. Many prominent Choctaw leaders chose to live in or near Eagletown. Especially notable were principal chiefs George Hudson (1860–62), Peter Pitchlynn (1864–66), and Jefferson Gardner (1894–96).

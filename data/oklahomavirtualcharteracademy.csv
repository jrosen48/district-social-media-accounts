We realize this has been, and continues to be, a deeply unsettling time for communities across our country. Though many things are still uncertain, please rest assured that students’ education at K12-powered schools is not one of them.

In the midst of seeing unprecedented interest in our programs, our teams have been hard at work strengthening operations to better serve each student’s learning needs. Please know that any initial challenges students may face will be resolved in the coming days and weeks.

Please refer to communication from your school regarding important instructions during the high volume start to this school year, and please continue to check the K12 Help Page for updates: http://ow.ly/dAvV50BikRf.

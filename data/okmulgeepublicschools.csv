We are so very proud of our 2019-20 Senior Link Crew Leaders! Not only have these students navigated high school successfully but they chose to share their experiences and lessons learned with freshmen throughout the school year. They hosted movies with popcorn, a Christmas luncheon with individual gifts, took them bowling followed by lunch in the park, brought them donuts for breakfast, but most importantly, checked in with their freshmen on a regular basis to make sure they knew their Link Leaders were always there for them! Thank you, each one of you, for all that you did to make this school year a success for all students at OHS!

Our transportation staff for picking up and bringing so many of our kids to school safely and with a smile and greeting as they get not the bus. Our office staff for doing so much each day including answering questions, playing nurse, greeting everybody and even watching classes sometimes. Our teachers and teachers aides for working hands on with the students to insure they receive the best classroom experiences.

All total we had 40 teachers trying out Zoom video conferencing yesterday. Definitely not what we are used to, but a great way to check in on each other and begin planning for distance learning for our kiddos. Thankfully we anticipated that this might happen so before spring break each grade level gathered up some home learning lessons. Have no fear parents and students...we are going to have some things ready for you to do with your kiddos (and we think you just might have some fun while doing them).

All total we had 40 teachers trying out Zoom video conferencing yesterday. Definitely not what we are used to, but a great way to check in on each other and begin planning for distance learning for our kiddos. Thankfully we anticipated that this might happen so before spring break each grade level gathered up some home learning lessons. Have no fear parents and students...we are going to have some things ready for you to do with your kiddos (and we think you just might have some fun while doing them).

It may still be our scheduled spring break, but so many teachers and staff members have already mentioned how much they miss our students and wonder how they are doing.

Please let your children know that they are missed each and every day whether it's a school break or a health crisis requiring us to be closed for a time.

For right now no formal instruction is being sent home for students to work on, but there are so many things parents can do with their children during this time.

We will be sharing tips and ideas periodically for you to use at home. Some will be online resources and some will be things you can do around the house. Whatever you do, just take this time to enjoy spending time with your children.",2.0,"Okmulgee Primary

Today, I presented HB3640 in the House Public Safety Committee. This bill formalizes the process for implementation and statewide training of the Handle With Care program. Handle With Care is a program aimed at ensuring that children who are exposed to a traumatic event receive appropriate interventions so they can succeed in school to the best of their ability.

I am so grateful for the Members of the House Public Safety Committee for supporting children who have experienced a traumatic event. Together, we are helping law enforcement agencies and school districts have the resources and interventions they need to help children in their communities.

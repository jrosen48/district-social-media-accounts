Ethan is a great student who sets a great example for his peers on a daily basis. He shows genuine concern about completing the activities in class at the highest level. He consistently checks in about his level of performance and strives to do the best he can. He is a good person and good student. Although this has nothing to do with me nominating him, his twin brother, Jacob was nominated for 2nd quarter SOQ :-)

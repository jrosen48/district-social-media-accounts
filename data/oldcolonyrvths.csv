LAKEVILLE — If you have the drive and determination to become an Eagle Scout, the highest rank recognized by the Boy Scouts of America, you don’t let something like a global pandemic get in the way of achieving your goal.

That was the case with Stetson Street resident (and Old Colony student) Josh Schwalm, who recently capped off his 11-year dedication to Scouting with a successful application to become an Eagle Scout.

Old Colony’s Katherine Ashley wins Heidrea for Heroes Veteran Legacy Scholarship

https://marion.wickedlocal.com/news/20200725/old-colonys-katherine-ashley-wins-heidrea-for-heroes-veteran-legacy-scholarship

Katherine has set her sights on becoming a mechanical engineer and will be attending Wentworth Institute of Technology. Apart from being ranked number 1 academically in her graduating class, Katherine is a two-time captain of her school’s cross-country team. Outside of school, she’s a Meals on Wheels volunteer (among several other volunteering activities) and somehow manages to squeeze in an additional 30 hours of work each week.

Please enjoy this Hamilton Parody while we continue to work with our Fall Reopening Task Force on plans for the Fall of 2020.

We must enjoy the storms, feel the rain, enjoy the company of others, perfect imperfection, and when the storm is over, search for our rainbow. Instead of fearing the next lightning strike, we must find a way to dance in the rain.

We continue to endure a storm unlike any in the history of Old Colony, and perhaps the world we live in today. Storms will come and they will pass. We must find our opportunities to dance in the rain and know there are rainbows waiting.

Our mindset is everything. We will fill our cups with raindrops so that they are more than half full, and in the words of the late John Lewis, “Do not get lost in a sea of despair. Be hopeful, be optimistic.”

It’s teacher appreciation week and what better way to celebrate than to feature the MRAEF Educator of the Year, Samantha Clarke from Old Colony Regional Vocational High School!

We asked Sam share some fun facts about herself and we love what we learned!

Sam Clarke
ProStart Educator
Old Colony Regional Vocational High School
Fact 1: My love for baking started when I was around age four, my grandmother would babysit me and we’d baking everyday.
Fact 2: I learned how to read in first grade by using cookbooks.
Fact 3: I incorporated my hobby of gardening into teaching last year by starting a school garden, hosting outdoor lessons about herbs and how they can be used in cooking is now a regular event in our culinary program at OC.

MRAEF Fun Fact: Old Colony Regional Vocational High School placed first at the 2020 MRAEF ProStart Invitational Culinary Competition and 3rd at the Management.

This was poem my Dad shared with me years ago. (From Mr. Linehan, Assistant Principal)

See It Through
BY EDGAR ALBERT GUEST

When you’re up against a trouble,
Meet it squarely, face to face;
Lift your chin and set your shoulders,
Plant your feet and take a brace.
When it’s vain to try to dodge it,
Do the best that you can do;
You may fail, but you may conquer,
See it through!

Black may be the clouds about you
And your future may seem grim,
But don’t let your nerve desert you;
Keep yourself in fighting trim.
If the worst is bound to happen,
Spite of all that you can do,
Running from it will not save you,
See it through!

Even hope may seem but futile,
When with troubles you’re beset,
But remember you are facing
Just what other men have met.
You may fail, but fall still fighting;
Don’t give up, whate’er you do;
Eyes front, head high to the finish.
See it through!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2562167567372990&id=1827711180818636,,0.0,"Old Colony Morning Message: Thursday, April 16, 2020

Ryan and Seth (seniors) finished up a custom Fire Department table. Today with the rest of the class we delivered and assembled it at Freetown Firefighters, Fire Headquarters. This is the third Fire Department table our students have constructed for towns that send students to Old Colony. The decal was made in house by the Graphic Communications Shop.

The freshmen class, learning the difference between Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3 circuits. They learned how to use a digital voltmeter. They learned the components of a doorbell chime. Great first cycle for these students. Mr. Parker visiting the shop and teaching a student how to wrap an extension cord. I can't wait to see what these students accomplish this year.

I want to thank the owner, Taylor Murdough and Vito Rubini for giving us the opportunity to tour the Glynn Electrical facility. I would also like to thank Glynn for employing our students through our co-op program. They are giving our students the opportunity to make money and be part of a state of the art company on the cutting edge of the ever fast-growing electrical trade. The sophomore’s had a great start to the first cycle of 2020 with conduit fabrication and non-metallic sheath cable projects. They also competed in kahoot games testing their vocabulary skills and enjoy healthy competition.",0.0,"OC Electrical

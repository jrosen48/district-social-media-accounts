Once per quarter, the school invites in a speaker who is an expert about a time in history or who has experienced an event in history and has a story to tell.

Last year, OOMS had a 9/11 survivor come in during lunch. Students could sign up to attend and eat lunch while learning from the speaker. It was a huge success, and that's how the Living History Speaker Series was born.

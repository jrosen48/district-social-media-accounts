After the conclusion of the last pick-up session this afternoon, and with the help of OFMA President Jamie Reigle, OFHS was thrilled to be able to partner with Super Heroes to Kids In Ohio to donate all remaining trophies to be repurposed and distributed to children battling adversity.

OFHS Principal Dr. Holly Schafer was joined by volleyball coaches and players for the presentation of the trophy donation to Batman - our special visitor representing Super Heroes to Kids in Ohio! #CommunityPartnership

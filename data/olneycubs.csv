Hey POOHS!

Mrs. Bennett and I found out yesterday about the passing of one of our dearest band director friends, John Tunnell. Some of you may remember him as part of the Divan of the Maskat Shrine which hosts the annual Oil Bowl game. He was a HUGE supporter of the Oil Bowl Band and a former director of the group, as well as a band director for many years in north Texas.

A ""Celebration of Life"" service is tomorrow (Monday) at 5:00 p.m. in Wichita Falls. This will make it very difficult to have rehearsal tomorrow evening, so we will not meet at all tomorrow.

Regular rehearsal will begin again on Tuesday, August 11 from 4-9:00 p.m.

Please also note that there will be no band uniform organizing session tomorrow afternoon, nor uniform checkout on Tuesday at 2:00 for Seniors and Juniors. Checkout has been suspended until we receive the uniforms back from the cleaners.

Please spread the word about tomorrow's cancellation of rehearsal - section leaders might want to check with your sections.

Thank you for your understanding as we honor our friend and mentor.

Cant tell you how great it is to have sports to cover again. These are a few photos i took of the Lady Cub Volley Ball practice for an up coming story in the Enterprise.

Makes me happy to know that all the Cubs will be able to take part in sports, band, FFA and academic competitions this year. The Cubs i have been able to watch in sports so far seem very happy to be able to get back to a little normal and see all their friends again.

Please come out and support the Cubs this year.

This is a great opportunity to learn more about practical beef cattle production. You will focus on feeding, management, records, etc. You will learn as well as develop personal and leadership skills for the future. It is open to students in 3rd-12th grade.

You have opportunities to participate at the county level and beyond. It’s also ok if you don’t have a cattle background. We can help you with what you need to know.",2020-07-22 18:33:13,,

Band has definitely been her primary activity all through high school. You’ve probably seen her up on the podium conducting as drum major at the football games. She qualified to compete at state for ensemble this May but, like so many other things right now, we just aren’t sure if that will happen.

We know the coronavirus has created challenges for AP students and teachers. Here’s how the College Board will support you during this time:

1️⃣ We’re providing free, live and on-demand AP courses

To support AP students affected by school closures due to COVID-19, students and schools will have access to live AP review lessons, delivered by AP teachers from across the country. Lessons will begin March 25.

2️⃣ We’re developing a new at-home testing option

Because of the challenges created by COVID-19, we’re developing a new at-home AP Exam option. Students will be able to test on a computer, tablet, or smartphone.

We will invest so that every AP student impacted by COVID-19 has the tools and connectivity they need to review AP content online and take the exam from home.

During this challenging time, we will work to give every AP student the opportunity to earn the college credit and placement they’ve been working toward all year while maintaining a focus on the health and safety of our AP community.

The College Board is developing tools to mitigate the impact of school closures on students in the Advanced Placement Program. All AP students and teachers will be able to draw on the free online resources that were provided to every AP classroom this fall. Additional resources will be made easily accessible to AP students and teachers through mobile phones and other devices. These include free online AP lessons and review sessions from some of the top AP teachers in the country.

The AP program is finalizing streamlined AP exam options that would allow students to test at home, depending on the situation in May. We’re working to give every AP student the opportunity to claim the credit they’ve earned. The AP Program will communicate the details of these additional solutions to educators and students by March 20.

The College Board’s focus will remain on student safety and ensuring all students have the tools they need to work, and opportunities to receive the credit they have earned, during this challenging time.

Do you know the history of the Red Ribbon Campaign? In response to the murder of DEA Agent Enrique Camarena, angered parents and youth in communities across the country began wearing Red Ribbons as a symbol of their commitment to raise awareness about the killing and the destruction caused by drugs in America. In 1988, the National Family Partnership sponsored the first National Red Ribbon Celebration. Today, the Red Ribbon serves as a catalyst to mobilize communities to educate youth and encourage participation in drug prevention activities. #RedRibbonWeek #KikiCamarena #sendamessgaestaydrugfree",0.0,"The Red Ribbon Campaign

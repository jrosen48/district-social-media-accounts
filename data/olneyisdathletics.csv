April 14 at 5:03 PM ·

My calendar went off today with a notice of another Cub game i would miss out on photographing and capturing memories for my Cubs.
This was a special night. It would have been Lady Cub Senior Night. I only had the chance to capture 1 or 2 games so i made this video as my way of
a little piece of Lady Cub Softball Senior Night.
Its not much but i hope you enjoy it and will share it with any of the Lady Cub and coaches on your friends list.

“Sunsettin in O-Town” tournament was a success. We have a few Thanks we would like to give:

• Wacey and Laci Tate
• Fort Belknap Electricity
• Tower Extrusions
• Stewart’s

Without these people/businesses this tournament would have not been possible!

We also want to thank all the highschool athletes that worked the door and concession as well as all the players that registered for the tournament!

Hey Olney, Mattie Barrington is leaving at 10 am this Saturday headed to Austin for State Golf. This is her Senior year and last time to play at State. Lets give her a great big Olney send off downtown. Make posters, have noise makers, wear your Olney colors. If anyone wants to write her a note of encouragement, you can get to me, Teri Underwood Barrington or Coach Phillips.

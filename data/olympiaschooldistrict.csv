Our Child Nutrition Services staff provided more than 196,000 meals, including nearly 5,000 hot lunches this summer at child care sites, since we closed our school buildings in March and shifted to full-time distance learning.

Thank you to all of our OSD employees and community partners who contributed to this effort. We look forward to beginning our fall meal distribution program on the first day of school Wednesday, September 9.

Meal distribution locations, times, links to free and reduced-price lunch applications and more are posted on the district website, linked below. 🥦🥯🌭🥗🍎 #ShoutOut #MealDistribution #ChildNutritionServices

This week, Governor Inslee asked the National Guard to help by volunteering at Food Banks due to the lack of volunteers. This should help the Food Bank get the distribution of weekend food packs back on track.

Derek has been married for 16 years, loves dogs, and is a Retired Army Officer with 23 years of service.

His favorite thing about being at OHS? The awesome staff of course! Real pleasure to work with and all are very helpful to a rookie like me!

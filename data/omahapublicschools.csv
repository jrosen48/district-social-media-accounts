Both, Rev. Vivian and Rep. Lewis, were voting rights advocates and worked alongside Martin Luther King Jr. to bring racial injustices to light and change policies to make the U.S. more inclusive.

OPS aims to continue in their legacy by providing a space in all our American Government classes for students to register to vote. In addition, we have moved to reserve Election Day as a day off of school and work to encourage our staff, students, and families to take advantage of the opportunities that Rep. Lewis and Rev. Vivian sacrificed so much for us all to have.

Our high school libraries also have copies of Rep. Lewis' young adult novel ""March"" for students who may want to learn more about his impact.

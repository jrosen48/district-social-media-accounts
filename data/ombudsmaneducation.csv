Charter Valencia staff is collaborating with these community partners and will invite to our school so they can meet our students and educate them on the services they provide at our upcoming College, Career & Community Resource Fair on November 20, 2019. We also will be inviting them to present at one of our upcoming 3C (College, Career & Community) Presentation Series held weekly at our schools.

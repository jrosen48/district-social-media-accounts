Onalaska athletes and families:

Our number one goal above everything else is always the safety of our kids. Our Administrative team has been constantly monitoring the COVID-19 situation across the state as well as the county and locally. As of today with all the information we have received of area districts having confirmed cases and the recommendations from the Governor, it is in the best interest of our athletes, school, and community to suspend summer workouts from June 29th through July 12th. We will continue to monitor the situation to hopefully open back up on July 13th. This is a precaution measure as we have not had any cases at our workouts. We appreciate all the positive attitudes and the great work our students have put in so far but we feel this is what is best.

Athletes be sure to continue to work on your own so we don’t lose the work you have been doing! Stay safe while we all get through this.

We look forward to seeing you all again in 2 weeks!

The Golden Horizon Chapter Recognition is a state award that recognizes well-rounded local FFA chapters that have an inclusive, progressive, aggressive program of activities that promotes maximum participation in order to deliver the leadership component of agricultural education. Chapters are recognized within Single Teacher and Multiple Teacher divisions. Chapters are placed into Gold, Silver and Bronze categories, with the top 25% of chapters in each teacher division receiving a Gold Ranking. If Onalaska FFA's Program of Activities or student AND advisor involvement is ever considered ""average"" please refer to their accomplishments throughout this past school year. It takes long hours and pure dedication to be honored as one of the top chapters in the state! Onalaska FFA received a GOLD rating and was recognized on stage this afternoon during the 6th general session of the 2019 Texas FFA Convention in Fort Worth. There were only 26 total FFA chapters throughout the state that were honored with this Gold-rated distinction. CONGRATULATIONS, ONALASKA FFA!!!

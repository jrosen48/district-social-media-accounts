The OCSD seeks parent feedback as we plan for what learning will look like in the fall. To gather this feedback, we are utilizing a tool called Thoughtexchange. You are asked to respond to one open-ended question, consider and assign stars to some of the ideas shared by others (20 or 30 is ideal), and learn what’s important to the group. Your thoughts and stars are confidential. You can come back as often as you’d like to participate, and in fact, we ask that you do return to star some of the new ideas shared since you first participated. The ratings will help us understand the most important areas to focus on for planning for instruction in the fall.

The OCSD seeks parent feedback as we plan for what learning will look like in the fall. To gather this feedback, we are utilizing a tool called Thoughtexchange. You are asked to respond to one open-ended question, consider and assign stars to some of the ideas shared by others (20 or 30 is ideal), and learn what’s important to the group. Your thoughts and stars are confidential. You can come back as often as you’d like to participate, and in fact, we ask that you do return to star some of the new ideas shared since you first participated. The ratings will help us understand the most important areas to focus on for planning for instruction in the fall.

The OCSD seeks parent feedback as we plan for what learning will look like in the fall. To gather this feedback, we are utilizing a tool called Thoughtexchange. You are asked to respond to one open-ended question, consider and assign stars to some of the ideas shared by others (20 or 30 is ideal), and learn what’s important to the group. Your thoughts and stars are confidential. You can come back as often as you’d like to participate, and in fact, we ask that you do return to star some of the new ideas shared since you first participated. The ratings will help us understand the most important areas to focus on for planning for instruction in the fall.

As we all know, schools in O’Neill will be closed temporarily in an attempt to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus. This will present many challenges to families in our communities, including the possible lack of regular meals. We’d like to offer FREE takeout sack lunches on Saturdays & Sundays for students in our area schools!

Here are the details:

- 11am-2pm, Saturdays & Sundays through APRIL 5th (this may extended depending on our school district’s closure dates)

- ANY area student in grade PK-12 (one per student)

- Absolutely no purchase necessary!!

- Just DRIVE-THRU or STOP IN and order the SACK LUNCH SPECIAL!!

- SACK LUNCH SPECIALS include either a hot dog or cheeseburger with French fries and an additional side (additional side will vary depending on supply)",3.0,"DQ Grill & Chill of O'Neill, NE

COOPER HOFFMAN!

Cooper went along to the State Robotics Championship to help out the other teams. He helped keep them organized and made sure they were to their matches on time. Cooper also kept jumping in to help set up the game fields after the matches, even after matches that our teams were not competing in. At the end of the meet, he was helping the tournament hosts take down and pack up the practice fields. Cooper did all of this without being asked. Great example of the O'Neill Way.

Once again, congratulations to Cooper!

Congratulations to our Students of the Week,

ALYSSA MOSER, KELSEY OSBORNE & ZELIE SORENSEN!

Alyssa earned TWO first place medals at Howells-Dodge on Friday, February 21! One of those was her Humorous Prose, and the other was for her OID. Her hard work with coaches and at home is definitely shining through!

Kelsey's piccolo solo on Stars And Stripes Forever was the highlight of the Band Concert. Many in the audience complimented her outstanding performance.

Zelie's group was cooking in FCS, and Zelie decided to do the messy dishes by herself as the rest of the group was trying to finish up cooking.

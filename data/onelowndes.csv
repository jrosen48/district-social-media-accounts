These awards are highly treasured because they are given by students. Many of these students have been looking forward to this day and the opportunity to present their award to the one adult who has made the biggest difference during their time at LHS. Now is the time to recognize our honor graduates and those who have supported them, encouraged them, and challenged them. #OneLowndes

The student of the week for Ms. Current's DES class is Mason Simpson! Mason is a hard worker who has attended all of our Google meets and participates daily. He is responsible, asking for clarification when needed and completing his assignments. He does a great job of responding to the feedback I leave for him and is an enthusiastic and fun student to have in class- both in person and online! Go Mason!

Bauch’s Brainy Bunch had a MARVELOUS time “hanging out” in class. They beat Ms. Sears and Mrs. Larson in a game of Kahoot reviewing 5th grade math skills. We are so proud of these students for their skills and coming to distance learning every week.

We know there are many questions and concerns about the upcoming season especially as it relates to fan participation. Season tickets have not gone on sale for the 2020 season due to the uncertainty of Covid-19 issues.

Governor Brian Kemp has extended Georgia’s public health state of emergency through June 12, 2020. We hope that after this date there will be more guidelines issued and we will begin to have an idea of what Friday nights in the fall will look like.

Our hope would be tickets could go on sale at the end of June with a July deadline for renewal but until we have more answers season tickets will not be sold. #OneLowndes",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3065499426850689&id=473758912691433,,0.0,"There is a lot of excitement around the Lowndes Viking football program this year!

There's something about great leadership that's palpable from the moment that I step foot inside of a school system, and that school district's culture is never an accident. Rather, it is the byproduct of the vision and leadership of people like Superintendent Thomas Brindley and Director of Curriculum and Instruction Coleen Moore at Oneonta Central Schools. I had two indescribable days addressing their wonderful students and faculty, and their and their principals' signatures (personality, humor, charisma, etc.) were evident at every turn.

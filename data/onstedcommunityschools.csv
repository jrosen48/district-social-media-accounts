Lenawee County commissioners issued an executive order Monday to further mitigate the congregation of people in public places.

The order closes park and recreation areas, such as playgrounds, track facilities, tennis, volleyball and basketball courts, softball and baseball fields, gazebos and similar areas that “encourage close contact with others,” according to a news release.

This includes both public parks and playground and recreation areas at apartment complexes, schools and private property where access is permitted beyond immediate family members.
The order does not and is not intended to keep people from walking, cycling, hiking or running in public. These activities are still allowed, but social distancing guidelines should be followed.

As most of you know, Thursday is usually an exciting time for our students but it can be a bit stressful for families. One way we are hoping to help is with a parking option. Most families will be able to find parking in the gravel lot or in the church parking lot across from the elementary school. We also have reserved parking downtown at Borchardt's Market and our transportation department will have a bus to transport your family to the elementary school.

We are going to offer a bus shuttle from Borchardt’s Market to the school at 7:30, 7:45, and 8:00 in the morning.

We will also have three bus deliveries to shuttle families back to their cars. Pick up will be directly in front of the elementary school in the drop off/pick up zone at 9:30, 9:45, and 10:00.

In the morning, students need to be dressed in their costumes. Our parade begins at 8:15 and we don't want anyone to miss out!

As most of you know, Thursday is usually an exciting time for our students but it can be a bit stressful for families. One way we are hoping to help is with a parking option. Most families will be able to find parking in the gravel lot or in the church parking lot across from the elementary school. We also have reserved parking downtown at Borchardt's Market and our transportation department will have a bus to transport your family to the elementary school.

We are going to offer a bus shuttle from Borchardt’s Market to the school at 7:30, 7:45, and 8:00 in the morning.

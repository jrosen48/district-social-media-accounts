The members of the Bennett Watershed Detectives Club didn’t let the school closure and the subsequent switch to distance learning stop them from their important investigative work. The club continued to meet virtually after school each week during their normally scheduled club time to review and discuss their activities and lessons, which had been planned by Environmental Educator/Watershed Youth Educator Matt Savatgy and Watershed Program Assistant Amanda Cabanillas. The club advisors produced weekly stream-related video content with corresponding activity sheets for the young detectives to complete with their families. Among other things, they learned about stream features, culverts, road stream crossing assessments, and stream cross-sections. To learn more, check out the following links and photos!

Onteora students enrolled in the Pre-K program administered by First Steps Preschool celebrated their upcoming move to Kindergarten with a festive—and gloriously noisy—end-of-year event. Fire engines and police cars, their lights flashing and sirens blaring, led a car parade through neighboring streets and the school’s parking lot. The students, traveling in their own family vehicles, waved to the cheering and applauding teachers, staffers, and well-wishers who lined the parade route. Serving as master of ceremonies was Uncle Rock, AKA Onteora Board member Robert Burke Warren, who played some of the children’s favorite songs, including “The Garden Song” (by David Mallet) and Uncle Rock’s original tune, “Hold it in My Heart” (The Thank You Song). Adding to the fun was a playful clown, a slew of encouraging posters, and a bit of impromptu street dancing. The proceedings, which were broadcast live over a local radio station, ended with the presentation of moving-up certificates and a small gift.

After grabbing a delicious snack prepared by the Onteora Food Services Department, they proceeded to the football field, where the school’s traditional graduation stage had been set up for the day. Donning their graduation garb, the seniors posed for photos in front of cheering onlookers, who included proud parents as well as teachers waving pom-poms and celebratory signs. The soon-to-be graduates then spent a few moments with filmmaker Angel Gates, who is donating his time and expertise to create a special video tribute to the Class of 2020.

Thanksgiving came early to Onteora’s three elementary schools, where 124 senior citizens recently enjoyed a free Thanksgiving-inspired feast with all the trimmings—including turkey cubes and gravy, whipped potatoes, stuffing, green beans, cranberry sauce, and pumpkin pie. Pictured are scenes from Bennett’s senior citizen luncheon, where members of the Student Government acted as servers and the school’s talented student musicians provided the stellar entertainment. The event was sponsored by the elementary school PTAs, which split the cost. Happy Thanksgiving to all!

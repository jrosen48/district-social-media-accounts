Attention OCS Parents/Guardians:
Online registration for the 2020-2021 school year is open on each OCS school website. We are asking that parents of all students in grades K-12 complete the online form by July 15.

If you prefer to submit your registration documents in person, our schools are open during the summer but have limited staff. Please call the school before you go to make sure the appropriate staff is available.

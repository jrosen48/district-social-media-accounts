The Wellness Bus is offering no-cost testing to those without insurance, regardless of documentation status. If someone has insurance, they will bill their insurance. All insurance plans are now covering the cost of the test.

The Wellness Bus Testing Schedule:

They prefer that people make an appointment, (801-747-9547) but they can come without one, preferably in their car as they are doing drive-thru testing.

COVID -19 testing requirements have been loosened and the state now wants to test ANYONE that has at least one COVID symptom - fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, muscle aches, loss of taste or smell. Also, ANYONE who has been exposed to someone with COVID-19 should also get tested.",2.0,"https://www.facebook.com/103944177911645/posts/130271945278868/?d=n

They prefer that people make an appointment, (801-747-9547) but they can come without one, preferably in their car as they are doing drive-thru testing.

COVID -19 testing requirements have been loosened and the state now wants to test ANYONE that has at least one COVID symptom - fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, muscle aches, loss of taste or smell. Also, ANYONE who has been exposed to someone with COVID-19 should also get tested.",2020-04-21 10:26:44,,

It may sound strange, but even as we're figuring out how to work with our new reality this year, we're also planning for next year.

Right now, that means signing up for your committee for next year. You'll find a link below.

Please sign up even if you've already been asked to be a Community Support or Co-op Rep for a teacher.

Or if you've already been asked to be a committee chair or co-chair next year.

Or if you aren't even sure if your child will be here next year. (Though I can't imagine why you'd want that).

As always, thanks for all you do to make our school a great place!

ICYMI, this Friday, February 28, 2020, is a half-day for all of our schools. The Salt Lake Education Association (our district’s teachers’ association) has declared a Day of Action. Teachers will be holding a walk-out in the afternoon to encourage the Utah Legislature to prioritize public education funding.

In the Salt Lake City School District (SLCSD), our highest priority is the education and safety of your students. With so many teachers anticipated to participate in the walk-out, we will not have the capacity to provide adequate supervision to keep your students safe and learning that afternoon. Accordingly, we need to implement a half-day schedule on Friday, February 28, for all SLCSD schools.

As forecasts call for snow overnight, we encourage parents to prepare for extra time to get students to school safely. We are planning on our schools being open and operating as normal.

Our crews will be out early in the morning evaluating the roads and if plans need to change, we will notify parents as soon as possible. Parents are also reminded that they may keep their students at home anytime they feel it is unsafe for their student to travel to school.

More information about our weather closure guidelines can be found at https://www.slcschools.org/departments/communications-and-community-relations/guidelines-on-closures-delayed-starts-and-early-releases/.

1) Click either (preferably both) links, https://www.facebook.com/OpenClassroomSLC/ or https://www.instagram.com/openclassroompenguins/
2) like the post(s),
3) then - this is the important part - post in the comment section of the post one thing you love about the OC. It's super important to ""like"" and add the comment as Facebook/Insta's algorithm will push the ad more for us at no cost. Our goal is to get 50 comments before Jan 28th.

That's it!

The reason we are doing this is to leverage the power and influence of the current community to invite others to the OC. We are also implementing a digital ad campaign that will run along with these posts. Keeping enrollment high allows for more funding for all grade levels. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP!

Dear Parents and Guardians,

It is time for us to plan for next year, but we need information from you to get started.

Please complete the online placement form, so that we know who is returning to the Open Classroom next year and teachers can begin to process of creating classes for next year.

Fill out the form once for each student, even 8th graders, and even if you are not planning on returning to the OC. It only takes a few minutes. You can do it on any computer, or even your phone!

If you are not positive whether you will return, I suggest you fill it out as if you will return, and leave a brief explanation in the comments section at the end.

It will be held in the cafeteria and runs from 7:30-8:20 AM. Students will be taken out to the playground at 8:20 and supervised until the bell rings.

It is critical that students not be dropped off before 7:30 AM.

This is a drop in service only, meaning that you do not have to register in advance. You can walk your student in or if they are comfortable, they can walk themselves in.

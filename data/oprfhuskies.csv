Dear Oak Park Community,

We are sickened and horrified by the needless killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers.

We are frightened for the black and brown members of our staff and our community who daily must endure the racism of our society. We are furious at the inequities that cause so much injustice and poverty and suffering. We are committed as an organization and as individuals to dismantle the systems of oppression that have created these conditions and that fuel them.

We join with our fellow members of the Urban Libraries Council in releasing this statement (bit.ly/3gMfEvp) to communicate our shared commitment as library leaders to dismantle systemic racism.

Find ebooks and digital resources below curated by our librarians as we proclaim that Black Lives Matter.

In solidarity and with humility,

Oak Parkers urged to make a difference by participating in coming Census

Village of Oak Park, Illinois
April 12 at 11:25 AM ·

The US Census Bureau is tracking the 2020 Census response rate for every community in the country. Oak Park has a response rate of 55.6 percent as of April 10. That's slightly higher than the state average (52 percent) and national average (47.5 percent), but there is still along way to go to making sure our community is accurately counted. If you have not already, please take a few minutes and fill out your 2020 Census form online, via email or by telephone. Why is this so important? The once-a-decade count will help lawmakers, business owners and many others make critical decisions over the next 10 years. The data also helps determine how to allocate funds for services that help families, older adults and children, which will be critical as Oak Park and the country recover from the coronavirus pandemic.

If you have not already, please take a few minutes and fill out your 2020 Census form online, via email or by telephone. Why is this so important? The once-a-decade count will help lawmakers, business owners and many others make critical decisions over the next 10 years. The data also helps determine how to allocate funds for services that help families, older adults and children, which will be critical as Oak Park and the country recover from the coronavirus pandemic.

Dear OPRF High School families and community members,

On the evening of Friday, March 6, a water leak from a busted pipe caused a short in one of our 480V transformers. When power was lost, the emergency generator kicked on. Electricians visited the high school today and determined that the damaged transformer needs to be replaced. However, at this time, due to the age and weight of the transformer, we are unable to say when that can happen. We will know more next week.

Additionally, while the ventilation system in the auditorium was also impacted by the power outage, tonight’s performance of “Disney’s Newsies” will continue as scheduled, and school is still in session come Monday.

We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work through this situation, and will keep you updated as things progress.

BEHIND THE SCENES: Just like you, we are spending our weeks preparing our ""classrooms"" and checking our wi-fi for the school year. We asked Program Naturalist, Kaitlyn, to snap a selfie while she was out exploring so we could get a peek into her location scouting trip.

Since we will be offering Virtual Field Trips this year, it's necessary to scout locations where we might normally have had in-person field trips to make sure they are appropriate for naturalist-guided virtual experiences. We're aiming for the same look and feel of a traditional Inside the Outdoors lesson.

While keeping learning continuity and distance learning goals in mind, all programs are designed by Orange County Department of Education STEM content experts and support current Next Generation Science Standards. Details and registration coming soon!

On the front page of ocps.net there is a School Reopening graphic that will take you to a description of the choices so you can begin considering which is best for your family. This will help to clarify the options that were discussed last Tuesday.

The options include:

1) face-to-face five days a week as required by the state;

2) Orange County Virtual School, an existing option that has been in place for years;

or

3) a potential innovative model that requires state approval once the school board votes on the plan next Tuesday.

If and when the state approves an innovative plan there will be an on-line registration to select a model for your child for the 2020-21 fall semester which ends in December. We will send an update after the board meeting on Tuesday.

We know this has been a difficult time of uncertainty for our seniors. As a result of the governor’s “Safe-at-Home” order and schools being closed through at least May 1, graduation ceremonies for all of our high schools have been postponed.

The governor said in his press conference today that he is not ready to announce a return to school date. His decision is critical to our plans. The superintendent has engaged her student advisory council, and high school principals have received input from their student government representatives regarding options such as smaller ceremonies in school auditoriums or football stadiums. They have even considered virtual ceremonies. In the superintendent's discussions with students, she has heard their disappointment but also witnessed their resilience.

We will announce final graduation plans to recognize our amazing seniors as soon as possible. At this point, we believe they may be delayed until June or July. We will provide updates as they become available.

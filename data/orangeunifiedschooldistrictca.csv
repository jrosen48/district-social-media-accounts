4th of July Flyover

Keep your eyes on the skies today, July 4, as the WWII era “Willa Dean,” a C-47 Skytrain, and two Marchetti SF-260s fly over the City of Orange in celebration of the birthday of our great nation, and to honor those who protect it.

The flyover should be above Orange around 2 pm today.

The attached map is not an exact representation of the flyover flight path, and the route may vary based on conditions at the time of the flight.

This amazing aerial presentation is made possible by a collaboration between the Cities of Orange, Buena Park, and La Habra, and the support of our 2020 Orange Tree Community Partners, Chapman University, Ricci Realty, SC Fuels, Thompson Building Materials, and Wilson Automotive. We would like to thank the Lyon Air Museum and Air Combat USA for their contribution to this event.",5.0,"City of Orange California - Municipal Government

The College Board is developing tools to mitigate the impact of school closures on students in the Advanced Placement Program. All AP students and teachers will be able to draw on the free online resources that were provided to every AP classroom this fall. Additional resources will be made easily accessible to AP students and teachers through mobile phones and other devices. These include free online AP lessons and review sessions from some of the top AP teachers in the country.

The AP program is finalizing streamlined AP exam options that would allow students to test at home, depending on the situation in May. We’re working to give every AP student the opportunity to claim the credit they’ve earned. The AP Program will communicate the details of these additional solutions to educators and students by March 20.

The Board of Education last night approved an emergency resolution to ratify the decision to hire Signal Restoration Services to begin remediation work at the Villa Park High School track and athletic field.

Signal Restoration Services is working to abate abandoned buried transite (asbestos containing pipe) in an area of the new track and field space where an outside contractor had been performing excavation for State mandated Americans with Disability Act (ADA) work. The pipe fragments discovered were not near any common student areas on campus and the area remains inaccessible to unauthorized individuals. Orange Unified has been working diligently with South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) and hazardous materials contractor EnCorp on the abatement process, which should be complete next month.

""Rivals by Chance... Supporters by Choice"" We want to send a very big 'Thank You' to Nicol Jones and her family for showing their support and taking the 95K Challenge! Nicol Jones is one of those special people who will advocate for the success of every student. She was a major factor in passing Measure S for all of OUSD, and recently she went above and beyond by supporting the Canyon gym renovation, at a school that NONE of her children will ever attend.

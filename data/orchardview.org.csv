1. Grab and go breakfast stations will be set up at the main entrances. Grab one as you enter.

2. There will be 4 tables set up throughout the commons to get your schedule. You can go to any table to get your schedule. Please don’t crowd around the tables. Form a line and keep your distance.

3. After you get your schedule, find your locker and practice your combination. Once you get your locker open, place your backpack and other items in there.

4. Proceed to your first hour class with a writing utensil and paper to eat your breakfast and start your day!

Remember that there will be many staff members in the hallways to help, just ask. Also, please remember to keep your masks on at all times.

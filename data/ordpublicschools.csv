We recognize the need for students to collect materials from teachers and lockers. To accommodate all of our students, a schedule was created to alleviate all students from coming at once. The schedule can be seen below. If the schedule does not work for your family, please contact the front office to make other arrangements.

Starting MONDAY, MARCH 23rd, we ask that students arrive at our south entrance near the high school office. Upon arrival, Mr. Snyder will make contact with you to determine what you need from the building. Your items will be relayed to a teacher, who will gather them and bring them to you. PLEASE REMAIN IN YOUR VEHICLE OR OUTSIDE DURING THIS PROCESS. Thank you for your patience during this time.

We are working on developing a plan to continue the school lunch program through a ""Grab-and-Go"" delivery. On Wednesday, March 18th from 11:00am - 1:00pm, we will be providing a Take-Out Lunch and Breakfast for our students. Families that are interested may drive up curbside at Ord High School by Entrance 20 by the New Gym to get 2-3 lunches and 2-3 breakfasts per student. With the anticipated winter weather in our area on Thursday, this will be the only pick-up this week. Our plans are to have this on a daily basis starting next week.

This is an evolving plan and we will do our best to adjust to the needs of our students. Priority is to get breakfast/lunches to our students as soon as possible until we can have a daily meal provided for our students.

Winter in Nebraska can be challenging and we have been closely watching the weather for tomorrow. This winter weather advisory is a bit trickier to predict due to the anticipated time frame when the winter weather is supposed to move into our area. Winter weather is supposed to start around 9AM tomorrow and pick up as the day progresses with heavy amounts starting around 11:00 AM. After consulting with the National Weather Service in both Hastings and North Platte, advisement was that travel would be significantly difficult even at a noon or 1:30pm early dismissal. Confidence is high in the snow amount and the timeline of the storm.

Therefore, due to the anticipated weather forecast of significant snow accumulation and high winds impacting our area, there will be no school or school activities on Tuesday, November 26th, 2019. This decision was made, as always, with highest regard to the safety of our students.

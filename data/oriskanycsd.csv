Due to the Governor’s mandates surrounding COVID-19, each senior was allowed to bring two guests, as participants and attendees socially distanced through a ceremony that included the traditional speeches from the valedictorian, Kara Daskiewich and salutatorian, Angelina Hays, as well as the singing of both the Oriskany Alma Mater and the National Anthem.

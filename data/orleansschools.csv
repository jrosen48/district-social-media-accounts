Upon completion town officials has agreed to have its street department install the banners on the period street lights all along Maple Street (SR 37) .

Nikki Deckard expects that the processing of orders and gathering of photographs of each senior to be completed soon. Organizers stress that they want to be able to include all Seniors in the effort.

Congratulations to Mrs. Burton for being names the staff member of the month for March. She is very deserving. She does after school activities such as drama and Just Say No. This is not the reason she was chosen. It is what she does every day when she is with her students. She is patient and very knowledgeable of her students’ needs. She works diligently every day to provide her students with the best education possible. She spends a lot of time preparing for her students, providing for their individual needs. She is as dedicated as they come. She doesn’t complain about the many hats she must wear.",0.0,"Congratulations Mrs Burton!

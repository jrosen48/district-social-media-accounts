This one day will need to be made up to stay in compliance with State Law. We will be adding one day to the end of our present school calendar. Consequently, Friday, June 7th will be a regular full day of school and the last day of school will now be Monday, June 10th.

Despite our attempt at getting this day waiver through OSPI, Washington State Education Law states that each school district shall conduct a school year of no less than 180 school days in such grades as are conducted by the school district (WAC 180-16-215 ), and, a waiver was not granted.",2019-04-16 17:49:04,,

Why OverDrive?
The OverDrive collection is an extension of our physical library, only it’s online with 24/7 access to eBooks and audiobooks. It’s convenient for students to check out titles anytime, anywhere with no worry about misplacing a book or running up late fees – these digital titles automatically return at the end of the lending period!

To use OverDrive, students browse the secure website for titles, borrow using your username and password, and enjoy on your computer, tablet, smartphone or eReader device. Usernames are generally firstname.lastname and passwords will be the student's lunch code. If you have problems, please see a librarian.

You can view our High School Library collection at the following site AND you can view both eBooks and physical books.

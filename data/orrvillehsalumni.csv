Chris Jones, whom you may know as director of instrumental music at Orrville High School, will be teaching General Music for grades 3, 4 & 5 for the coming school year. He is working on his lesson plans and contacted us with this request:

“I’d like to do Zoom interviews with 36 people from Orrville who are passionate about music, but it is not necessarily part of their job. I will then turn the interviews into mini lessons for each grade with a ‘Music in Our Community’ interview as a spotlight each week for my virtual lessons.

A huge thank you to those who have donated to the menstrual kits. Today Ethel and I (and my daughter Tina) were able to go to Magwero and give kits to 34 girls there. The teachers will also be receiving kits.

We had a wonderful time of sharing the Word of God, debunking myths surrounding their periods, letting them know it's nothing to be ashamed of, and why it's best to wait to have sex. They were really engaged, and so appreciative of the supplies. It was a really great morning!

We will also be doing a distribution at the Magwero School for the Blind, and also for the normal school in the village there. But we will need more supplies!

If you are interested in helping these girls stay in school, you can see the video we put together in the link with all the information. You can send donations to our church (info in the video below) or to paypal.me/JulieTsoukalas and mark it 'for kits'. Every penny goes toward helping these girls stay in school!

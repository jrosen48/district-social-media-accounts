Ortonville School Families,

I wished to reach out to you following Governor Walz's press conference today. Our Ortonville Fall Planning Team is excited to receive the Governor's ""Safe Learning Plan"" which provides local control (with MDH guidance) on the ""Return to School"" for the upcoming year. Our team will be meeting again for a full day of planning tomorrow. We anticipate having our plan finalized no later than noon on Monday followed by a presentation to staff at 2:00 PM. We plan to share this out to families on Monday, August 3rd following Board adoption. Today was a great day. I'm proud of how our Governor and his leadership team layed out a supportive and comprehensive plan. Please know, our plan has the safety of all staff & students in mind. I'm proud of our committee work thus far and I know families will appreciate their efforts. We look forward to sharing this out Monday night. Please keep in mind, your safe choices today can keep our kids in front of their teachers. We're in this together!

Our mission has always been to ensure the future by creating lifelong learners. There have been a lot of tears during this planning time because we miss your children, but our commitment and mission has never wavered. While every role has been different, all staff have worked together, bravely and boldly to take on the unknown and further help our students and district. We will recharge this weekend and on Monday our commitment will remain the same: to help your children learn and grow! Parents, you are not in this alone!

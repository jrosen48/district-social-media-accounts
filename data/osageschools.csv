After logging into Schoology and watching a video of Mrs. Huftalin explain the project the teams were faced with the problem of saving Fred the Worm who lost his life vest while whitewater rafting. The students worked really hard together to come up with a plan, test the plan, and then make any improvements and test it again. They could only touch the 2 paperclips provided and not Fred, the life vest, or the raft!! Today we ended with each team sharing out.

Less than 24 hours! Just a couple of reminders:
1. It will be warm this week, please bring a water bottle so you can stay hydrated.
2. It's always a good idea to have an extra mask with you, just in case one gets sweaty or damp.
3. Everyone will enter through the main doors on the east side of the school.
3. There will be a lot of new parts to our school day, don't be afraid to ask questions.

Student and staff safety is at the forefront of EVERY decision made.

The Osage School District understands the inconvenience that the decision to not offer in-town bussing will cause families.

In order to balance safety and our strong desire to still offer face-to-face learning, difficult decisions have had to be made regarding transportation in order to serve the ones most in need of bussing.

A great deal of time and efforts have been put towards creating walking school busses and to increase the safety of children needing to cross busy roads.

FAMILIES: Please have your children utilize new crossing guard locations, whether they are walking or riding a bike. These locations are: 5th and Main (Hwy 9), 7th and Mechanic (Hwy 218), and 7th and Vine.

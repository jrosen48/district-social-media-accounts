My plans after high school are to attend Mizzou and major in Forensic Anthropology. Working with dead bodies seems more fitting as they won’t talk back. I already moved to Columbia and can’t wait to start the next phase of my life….with faster internet!

Throughout high school, I participated in many extra curricular activities as well as working as a pharmacy technician. I also competed on competitive cheer and dance teams at Cheers!

Elizabeth Garlick:
Hi! I’m Elizabeth and I like warm hugs! Just kidding we’re in quarantine! Anyway! I will be attending Northwest Missouri State University where I will receive my Bachelors of Science degree in marine biology. I have been involved in many school activities such as Student Council, FBLA, NHS, FCCLA, choir, band, Strength Club, track and field, volleyball, and softball. I have quite a few hobbies that include: singing in the shower and to my cat, laughing with my sisters, stressing about homework lol, and hanging with my friends! As you can see I have had a pretty great life here at Osceola and even though my last year has been cut short I couldn’t be any more grateful for the life experiences and the memories I have gained!

My plan for after high school is to attend Mizzou in Columbia, MO. I have decided to participate in the College of Engineering. I intend to Major in Civil Engineering.

The people who have had the biggest impact on my life are my father and my mother. They remind me everyday I am destined for great things in life.

My favorite memory at Osceola High School is being able to make lifetime friends with guys I hangout with every day. One of my favorite memories will be sitting at the lunch table with Tyler, Mitchell, Hunter, Killian, Joe, Landon, and Evan. I will definitely miss being there and it is time for Chapter 2.

I would also like to thank the teachers and the administrators for their hard work and for believing in me. Thank you Osceola for helping me with my future. #MODecisionDay",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3157863737592190&id=870826289629291,,0.0,"Senior Spotlight: Donald White.

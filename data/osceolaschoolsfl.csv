Included in this book are 17 simple, yet powerful, stories written in English and Spanish from our current ESOL population at Osceola High. There are also 7 stories from ex-ESOL students who graduated in previous years from OHS (24 stories in all, 246 pages).

According to recent research (The English Journal), the Coming to America club at OHS is the only high school club in the United States of America which has published four books in a series... WOW!

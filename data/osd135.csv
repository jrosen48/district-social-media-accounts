As the school year comes to an end, we are sad that we won’t see all of the smiling faces of our students one last time before summer. We hope that everyone has been able to say goodbye to their classmates and teachers this week.

For our last District-wide challenge, we are inviting families to share their last day of school photos with us! Take a last day of school picture of your child(ren) and email the picture to ewillner@orland135.org by the end of the day Sunday, May 31st. Along with your photo, please include your child(ren)’s name(s) and school(s). We will randomly select 10 winners!

Dear School District 135 Families:
The police department is seeking the assistance of Orland School District 135 families. We are asking that you lock your vehicles when parked on your driveway and on the street, and to never leave your keys in any vehicle. Thieves have taken many valuable articles from unlocked cars and stolen cars that have had the keys left in them. The thieves may also use garage door openers to enter residences. Additionally, sometimes these thieves have used stolen cars in the commission of other crimes. These crimes are completely preventable by locking your vehicles while parked outside, never leaving your keys in your vehicle, and always concealing valuables in the vehicle. Remember if you don’t lock it, you could lose it. We ask that if you see something, you say something so that we can prevent more crimes from occurring.

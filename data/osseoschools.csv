Dear GG stands for ""Grandpa"" or ""Grandma"". We are asking for kids in Brooklyn Park to make a card, color a picture or write a short letter to a local senior citizen and address it to “Dear GG”.

This project will give kids a creative way to bring joy to a senior during a time when they are unable to receive visits from family or friends due to COVID-19. We believe this is also a way for kids to have a fun project that will benefit someone else in their community during these unusual times.

The cards or letters should be signed with the child’s first name only and can be dropped at the Brooklyn Park Police Department during the days/times listed below. The police department will deliver the cards and letters to seniors living in Brooklyn Park.

Drop off time and location:
Saturday, August 1 from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.

Educational Support Professional Nora Walz-Laidlaw was on a mission to brighten the day for ECSE scholars when Dollar Tree employees intervened and purchased more than 100 pinwheels for students. As ESPs and bus drivers recently delivered learning packets to each student's home, they also left behind a pinwheel that contained a loving message.

Kudos to our mission-driven employees who continue to find unique ways to make positive and meaningful connections with students during this time apart. And, thanks to Dollar Tree employees for helping to bring smiles to the faces of some of our youngest learners!

Educational Support Professional Nora Walz-Laidlaw was on a mission to brighten the day for ECSE scholars when Dollar Tree employees intervened and purchased more than 100 pinwheels for students. As ESPs and bus drivers recently delivered learning packets to each student's home, they also left behind a pinwheel that contained a loving message.

The track and field star, who has been mentoring students in Jennifer Phillips' second grade class at Fair Oaks Elementary through the Classroom Champions program this year, met with students virtually this morning for a video update. While he's still training from home, Taylor said his life looks a lot different these days but that he's staying positive and looking forward to competing at the postponed Olympic Games in Tokyo next summer.

During the Google Meet, students had a chance to ask Taylor several questions, learning about his favorite food (salads), future pets he hopes to have (two dogs), and how he's been keeping busy during COVID-19 (lots of reading!).

Distance learning has been an adjustment for students throughout Osseo Area Schools, but Taylor had high praise for Phillips' scholars. ""I am so proud of how well you all have adapted,"" he told students. ""It's phenomenal!""

In this new era of education, it is easy to see how a wave of emotions can take over someone. Emotions are a normal part of our lives, but for some of us, a very difficult thing to acknowledge and talk about. We want you to know that we care very deeply about you as a person. We miss seeing you in person and we miss having those interactions with you on a daily basis, but it doesn't mean that we have stopped caring about who you are. We are empathetic to your feelings of uncertainty and anxiety. We feel that way too. You are not alone in your feelings. Each and every single one of us here at OTHS want you to know that we are here for YOU. If ever you feel like you need to talk, we have the tools and abilities to make sure that your feelings are heard. Please don't hesitate to reach out to us. Without you, there would be no OTHS.

When do you have to stop for a School Bus??

1. On two-lane roads, drivers traveling in both directions must stop when the red lights on a school bus are flashing and the stop sign is extended.

2. On one-way roads, all vehicles must stop when the red lights on a school bus are flashing and the stop sign is extended.

3. On four-lane roads where traffic moves in both directions, drivers traveling in the same direction as the school bus must stop when the red lights on the bus are flashing and the stop sign is extended.

School buses may only let students exit on the side of the road that bus is traveling. Students are not permitted to cross four-lane roads where traffic travels in both directions.

Drivers should be aware that school buses make stops at all railroad crossings.

Please be safe out there.",2.0,"O'Fallon Police Department

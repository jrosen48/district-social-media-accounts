This year's auction truly has something for everyone. Whether you're a golf or fishing aficionado, we've got two great recreation packages to check out. Or if a week on the beach is more your thing, be sure to view details on this gorgeous lakefront home. Last, but not least, take in the beauty of Michigan with these watercolor rag prints. Don't wait! Someone else is probably bidding on these now!

ELECTION INFORMATION! Every registered voter should have received an Application from the State of Michigan last week. If you would like to receive a Ballot for the May 5th Election, YOU WILL NEED TO SIGN THE APPLICATION AND RETURN IT TO THE CITY CLERK (the State provided a postage paid return envelope, pictured below). If you did not receive an application from the State, contact the City Clerk and she will mail one to you. Our new drop box is ready to be used, please place your voted ballots or applications - or any other City mail, in the new drive-up drop box. The Clerk can be reached at acronen@cityofotsego.org. City Hall is still closed, so the easiest way to contact the Clerk would be by email. With this being an all Absent Voter Ballot Election, and the State sending out the application, it is not your normal process.

We didn't have a plan in place (as of this morning) to feed our students during the closing of schools. Julie Guthrie, the Food Service Coordinator at OPS, asked how many students we had and took care of 3 days worth of food for each student. This is the kind of thing that is going on behind the scenes between school districts in Allegan County right now. For those of you not involved with the schools, there is a tremendous amount of work and planning going on right now because people want to take care of our children/students. It warms our hearts daily to see people working together and sharing resources. Thank you again, OPS! Outlook students and parents were thrilled!",,,

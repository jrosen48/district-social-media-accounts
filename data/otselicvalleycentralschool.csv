**************

Dear Parents/Guardians:

I hope this letter finds you and your family in good health. Due to Governor Cuomo's school closure order, the health office was not able to provide sports or grade-mandated physicals this year. This is a constantly changing situation and we hope it will be school as usual in the fall, but until then we must adapt. At this time we are also unsure if we will be able to provide physicals over the summer for the upcoming sports season. If your child has already received a physical this year, please have the provider's office fax it to me at 315-653-7500. If your child does not have a current physical (less than a year old), please contact their health provider and arrange for them to receive a physical. Please have a safe and fun filled summer and I hope to see your children in the fall with school running as usual.

Yesterday a caravan of teachers and staff followed Mr. Berson and Mrs. Richards in a 3-hour drive across our geographically large district. It was worth every minute and every mile because each member of the Class of 2020 is now proudly ""signed."" The photos shared here give you just a glimpse.

We also want to thank the neighbors who were very patient, and frequently amused, by the friendly car horns.

Just wanted to let you know that the OV Online Store is now open again. The deadline for the Spring sale was March 23rd but many of us, me included, may not have had time to go on or we just plain forgot due to the COVID 19 outbreak. A couple of people did order, but the company has not been open so those orders have not been filled yet. The company is hoping to reopen in the next couple of weeks if everything goes well. They said that we could reopen the online store for more orders if we wanted to. Since this order hasn’t been filled yet, I thought, why not?

So, if you would like to order some OV Viking apparel to show off your Viking Pride this summer and next Fall, you might consider ordering. Orders will be taken until May 25th and should come in sometime in mid-June if all goes well.

Plan after graduation: Attend SUNY Morrisville

Major: Medical Office Administration

Favorite memory from High School: ""Always playing UNO in the lounge and losing my senior year to the coronavirus.""

What does it mean to be a Viking? ""You must be caring and kind to others. It is like having one big family always pushing you to do your best and to push you to work for what you want.""

Congratulations, Madison!

Here is our response by Town. The lighter the brown, the higher the response. The Town of Bainbridge, New York is leading the way with 25.5%, followed closely by the Town of Greene with 25.3% and Town of Norwich at 21%.

Still time for your town to catch up!! Who can get to 100% first??

So much is going on behind the scenes: Tremendous effort, quick problem-solving, creative solutions, and teamwork--all in service to our students.

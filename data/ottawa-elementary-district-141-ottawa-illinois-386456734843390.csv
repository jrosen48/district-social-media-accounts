Ottawa Elementary is making preparations for the scheduled return to school in August. We are awaiting guidance from ISBE in order to proceed with formulating a plan. We will share our course of action with our families on Facebook and the district website after our plans are complete. At this time, we believe ISBE will be strongly encouraging some type of a physical return to school.

Some steps we have taken at this time:

Purchase of iPads for every student in grades K-8; 160 of the iPads will have built-in wifi for families who may not have wifi at home should Remote Learning be required again

Ordered 17 sanitation stations to be distributed at all 5 buildings

Ordered 17 non - contact thermometers to be distributed throughout the buildings

Ordered 12,000 masks, both cloth and disposable; we anticipate ordering more

Dear OES Families,

On Monday, March 16th OES will have a half day of school for the purpose of preparing for the possibility of E learning (electronic learning) days. Students in grades K-6 will dismiss at 11:30 a.m. Shepherd students will dismiss at 12:10 p.m.

At this time, school is still scheduled for student attendance throughout next week as mandated by the governor. If anything were to change, we will alert our families immediately.

A Blackboard phone message will be sent later today to families. To clarify, this is not a notice of cancellation of school next week; it is for the purpose of holding a half day inservice on Monday to prepare for the possibility of E learning.

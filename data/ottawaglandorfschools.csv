Thank you Putnam County Schools!

While Putnam County continues to see an increase in COVID 19 illness, a large portion of those cases are in our adult population. The few cases that have been identified in children were found to be linked to spread within a family or in the community. It is important to note that spread has not occurred in the schools! We would like to thank the schools for all they have done to keep our children safe. We will continue to monitor our cases and work closely with our schools to reduce the spread of illness in this population.

Why do graduates move the tassel?
The gesture of moving the tassel from one side of the cap to the other symbolizes the individual's movement from candidate to graduate. Prior to the ceremony the tassel is expected to be worn on the right. During the ceremony it should be moved to the left side after students receive their diploma.
Some believe the reason why you place the tassel on the right is because you have earned the right to graduate. Moving the tassel to the left after graduating is symbolic of crossing over from high school to another stage in your life.

Hello Everyone!! I miss you guys already! I put the eggs in the incubator last night and wanted to share with you what’s happening! I took pictures of them in the incubator. The incubator is the styrofoam container that keeps them very warm so they can develop into chicks! You will see the temperature is almost 100 degrees inside. I put 14 eggs in the incubator, we will see how many will hatch! I also have to put water in the bottom of it to keep the humidity up so they can grow inside the eggs! The last picture is of a plastic egg that I have that I will show you every day what is happening inside the egg! Let me know if you have any questions as we go! Feel free to make comments right on the page here that everyone can see! :)

How many eggs do you think will hatch? Put your name and your prediction down!

Autumn Court had a small fire, and needed a temporary place for their residents to go until they can get back into their building, and our staff was glad to help. A big shout out to the local fire departments, the Ottawa Police Department, the Red Cross, and the Putnam County EMA staff members. Our local safety service organizations are amazing.

One more example of what a great community we live in. A place where everyone is willing to help out a neighbor in need.

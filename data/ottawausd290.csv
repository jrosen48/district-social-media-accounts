Yesterday afternoon, Governor Kelly mandated that masks be worn in all public spaces. As our summer programs continue and others get ready to start, please be aware that in order to comply with the Governor's order, we will be asking all students and staff to wear masks while attending summer school and driver's education, both of which begin on July 6th. We will have masks available, however, they are in short supply. We would ask that if you have a mask for your student that you send them with it each day. If you have concerns about attending these programs, please contact your building principals to discuss the different options that might exist.

On Wednesday, I will meet with the Franklin County Health Officer to review our weight and summer conditioning programs and how the Governor's order impacts what we do there. Once we have further clarification on what we need to do, we will address that with both our parents and students.

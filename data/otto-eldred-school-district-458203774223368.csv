2025 meal deliveries were made this week in just 4 days!

Those meals required over 40 hours of labor from a wonderful group of ladies, which then needed 30 hours of delivery time (by a fantastic set of drivers) over hundreds of miles of road requiring dozens of gallons of gasoline.

That is about 250 gallons of milk consumed this week, which came from dozens of cows (even some chocolate ones), raised by PA farmers.

Each meal contained an entrée for lunch and breakfast, with multiple fruits and multiple vegetables which were all grown/raised/packaged and delivered by our fellow Americans.

These meals not only keep our kids ""full"", at least for a few minutes anyway, but also keep our local, state and national economy moving. Our producers need to be needed!

We have been in close contact with the Eldred Borough regarding the needed sewer line repairs under Main Street. Due to the continued issues seen over the past week, the repair on the line will occur sooner than anticipated. The Borough has been monitoring the line over the last week and will continue to do so during the upcoming week. To help reduce any additional issues, we will minimize water use during the day.

Activities to repair the sewer line will begin after school on Friday, February 21 and should be completed by end of day on Sunday, February 23. The elementary building will be closed for any use from Friday after school through Sunday. If we anticipate any issue opening the building as normal on Monday, February 24, notice will be sent on Sunday.

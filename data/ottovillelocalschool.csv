Working from home? Here’s a great tip in case you need to scan a document. iPhone users: go to “notes” and hit the little camera button. It will ask if you want to scan a document. Lay out the pages you want to scan and it will save them all as a PDF file! So easy and helpful if you depend on using a scanner like I do!

Feel free to add any more helpful hints for those working from home.",6.0,"Jenell Kistler Bramlage

Hey Putnam County, let’s make some noise against drugs!
During the months of November, December, and January, students from all nine county schools are creating Instagram videos to promote abstinence from drugs. The theme is “Make Some Noise Against Drugs”. Schools with the most “likes” for their videos will earn money to be used for prom/post prom activities.
So follow your school’s Instagram accounts, or all 9 schools like me, and support them as they make some noise against drugs.

Hey Putnam County, let’s make some noise against drugs!
During the months of November, December, and January, students from all nine county schools are creating Instagram videos to promote abstinence from drugs. The theme is “Make Some Noise Against Drugs”. Schools with the most “likes” for their videos will earn money to be used for prom/post prom activities.
So follow your school’s Instagram accounts, or all 9 schools like me, and support them as they make some noise against drugs.

Just had to post this picture from a game I covered on Saturday. These women are all grandmothers of girls that play basketball for Ottoville. These women were fun to talk to and were all in with their support of Ottoville.

High school sports are competitive and sometimes the event brings out the worst in fans and unfortunately that is what we see and usually remember once the event is over. So that being said, I wanted to take a moment and recognize the more positive side of high school athletic competitions.

Every school has their supporters that are at every event during good seasons and bad, good weather and foul and at the end of the game they recognize the efforts put forth by both teams and represent their communities in a positive manner. These are the fans I want to give a shout out too and say Thank you for being the fan and supporter we should all strive to be... hats off to you ladies....",0.0,"Kent Tarbox is with Ruth Miller.

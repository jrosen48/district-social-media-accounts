The BOE meeting video link is up at https://youtu.be/w4XFPkifqzw

At the 1:26:04 approx point, Supt. Thompson discusses some ideas for discussion with the Village Manager at Schaumburg.
In short, he mentioned:
1. Impact fees
2. Setting aside TIF money to pay D15 if kids live in the residential area and attend D15 schools-that annual cost is estimated currently at about $13,000/student/year
3. Donating land in the TIF area for a possible school to be constructed
4. Redesigning the concept plan to move the majority of homes into the D54 boundaries- apparently D54 have 28 buildings and in the last few years their enrollment has shrunk by 3,000 to approx. 14,0000.

There has been another change to the rules for our grab and go food program. Now, all young people in district-run schools, including preschool and TK students can receive food. That’s in addition to our K-12 and Young Adult Program students.

Families have to verify their students are in our schools to receive food, in much the same way they would be verified by being physically present in school under normal circumstances. Moving forward, please bring the form mailed to you that includes your student’s ID number. For more information, you can visit our website at www.ousd.org/covid-19studentmeals.

Remember that during the summer, we had 24 sites, and now we have 22 sites shown on the map. One new site is the co-located International Community School and Think College Now. Also, the hours of operation have expanded by an hour. We are now open, eight a.m. to one p.m. on Mondays and Thursdays.

-On July 2nd, we will host a meeting to share some preliminary recommendations (click here for more information).
-On July 10th we will communicate the decisions and agreements we have made at that point, but some unresolved issues will remain.

Overall, we will be making recommendations for a phase-in model. That is, bringing more students back on campus over time within the physical and staffing capacities that we have across the district. This - of course - depends upon the public health guidance we are getting from the county, our finalized labor contracts, and ensuring that we are supporting our families’ and students’ needs.

""My thoughts and concerns are always first and foremost with our students, families and staff. I think about how you are taking all of this in and coping, especially when compounded with the stress of facing COVID-19 over the past almost three months. I think about how these racist and unjust acts affect your own sense of self and development, and how so many of our parents, especially our African American parents, carry the burden of fear every time their sons and daughters walk out of their homes.

Of course, this is not abstract for me. My husband and I sat with our kids last night. With sirens in the background, we talked about oppression and injustice. We talked about not buying into the hate. We talked about being safe and what it means to be a young black person in this country. We talked while my heart was breaking for my kids, my husband, and myself, once again.""",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3013862518660095&id=122688404444202,,0.0,"Superintendent Johnson-Trammell shares some thoughts on recent events.

The moment was topped off when Golden State Warriors star, Stephen Curry and celebrity chef, Ayesha Curry brought a special home cooked lunch for everyone. Their organization, the Eat Learn Play Foundation, has played a critical role in supporting our free meal service for students.

Before they left, the Currys posed for some socially distant photos with the group and Garfield P.E. teacher, Chris, asked the Warriors guard to shoot some hoops on the Garfield basketball court so he could get some photos for the kids. Curry was happy to oblige. Many thanks to all OUSD Nutrition Services staff and volunteers!!! #iamOUSD",2020-05-01 15:49:58,,

With so much uncertainty, here’s a reminder of something we know to be absolutely true; On behalf of all middle school teachers, principals, staff and support, we miss you, we are thinking of you, and we ❤️ you. This has been a week unlike any other — save for the hard working, problem solving, innovative thinking, and responsive leadership of our people and community who show up everyday. That simply hasn’t changed, and won’t change, no matter what. We got this. We got you. Now bust out some games and enjoy the weekend! #seeyousoon

This month’s character trait is Flexibility, which is defined as willingness to change plans or ideas without getting upset. A person must adjust to the changes life brings. Many try to rearrange others or insulate themselves from disappointment, but flexibility does not involve controlling the outcome or avoiding commitment. Flexibility begins with clear vision and a willingness to apply principles of good character in each situation, regardless of the unique circumstance of that situation. When the unexpected or the inconvenient happens, we must take responsibility and adapt to complete our goal

In July of 1947, a tornado blew out the top floor and the building was repaired into a two-story structure. It was used until 1977, when it was torn down.

This month’s character trait is Generosity, which is defined as carefully managing my resources so I can freely give to those in need. Generosity can inspire individuals to reach their full potential and benefit others in turn. It is not limited to a particular time of day or season of the year. Generosity is an attitude that does not begrudge others what they have and seeks to benefit others in ways appropriate to their needs. Well-ordered giving has a multiplying effect that allows each person involved to grow. These benefits spread out in all directions, creating similar benefits in others’ lives, and eventually finding their way back to the original giver. We can experience satisfaction by generously helping others.

Today let's welcome Jake Jensen!

""Hello! My name is Jake Jensen, and I get to teach sixth and seventh grade science at Owatonna Middle School this coming school year!

I grew up in Owatonna and graduated in 2013. I grew up loving this community and I saw the impact my grandparents made in the community as teachers here, and their example has brought me down a similar path.

I graduated from Bemidji State University with a Bachelor’s degree in science education in 2017. This spring I graduated from Saint Mary’s University of Minnesota with a Masters of Education.

My first three years of teaching were in Sauk Rapids-Rice, where I was fortunate enough to be the head cross country coach. I am proud to bring my learning and experience here, to grow as a teacher and work for this great community!

Landon has been a consistently hard-worker, and virtual instruction did not get in the way of his focus and drive for learning the trumpet.

Recently, Landon completed the last exercise in Book 1 for Trumpet playing the melody from ""Manhatten Beach March"" by John Philip Sousa.

Landon's accomplishments this school year are a testament to his hard work: He was chosen for the MN Middle Level Honor Band and the MBDA Beginner Honor Band (both which were unfortunately canceled due to the pandemic) and was also scheduled to play a solo with the high school band this spring.

Despite the cancellations, Landon holds a positive attitude and work ethic. Look for more great music to happen in Landon's future!

I started teaching at OHS in 2002. During that time I have taught 9-12, journalism, public speaking, and elective literature classes. I also coached the OHS Speech team for 10 years.

Seven years ago, I became the adviser of OHS Magnet. My students made the move from print to online over the years. They have published OHS news and multi-media that has been recognized for excellence at the state and national levels.

I love coming to work at Owatonna Public Schools. I love the daily conversations and laughter that fill my day with my kids. My colleagues are amazing teachers and friends!

I am more of ""work behind the scenes type of person"", so the ""Wagner Appreciation Week"" is a little out of my comfort zone. I am humbled by the kindness and this honor from the Owatonna Teachers. This year especially has been tough and I believe all teachers are the teacher of the year.""

Written by Auden and Nicolina from 5RO

Every year our art teacher Mrs. Dutton has us do a collaborative art project, which means that the whole school does an art project in all different ways. This year she came up with the idea of having our whole school do a heart project because she was kids being rude to one another. She wanted to put up a big reminder all over the school to always be kind and not to bully because of their differences.

The individual heart squares are 5 inches by 5 inches. Kindergartners did kiwik stick, 1st graders did crayon batik, 2nd graders did chalk, 3rd graders did watercolors with salt, 4th graders did sharpie design with watercolor, 5th graders did tempera paint.

Now that she is done, she will put them together on a big poster board to make it look like quilt. There will be enough for six boards and she will spread them out all over the school.

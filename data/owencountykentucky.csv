September 8 at 3:18 PM ·

It is with thoughtful consideration and deep regret that we announce Sweet Owen Day 2020 will be canceled. After much discussion, the planning committee decided to not host the 2020 festival due to COVID-19. We believe that the health and safety of our community is our top priority. We strongly believe, in light of the current situation, canceling the event is the responsible thing to do. We recognize that our decision will have an impact on our community but we assure you we did not come to this decision lightly.

Sponsorships are a large part of making Sweet Owen Day a success. We could not in good consciousness ask sponsors to invest money in these difficult times. Thank you to each of the sponsors that have contributed through the years to make Sweet Owen Day a success.

We look forward to coming back bigger, better and stronger on September 18, 2021.

After nearly a year of construction, we officially celebrated the completion of our new $1.4 million field operations facility in Owenton. Owen County Judge Executive Casey Ellis and Owenton Mayor Adam Gaines joined us today for a safe, socially-distanced, ceremonial ribbon cutting at the new facility.

This investment will serve as an operational hub for our Northern Division, which includes Franklin, Gallatin, Grant and Owen counties. The 9,900-square-foot maintenance garage has nearly 6,600 square feet of garage space as well as 3,400 square feet for personnel needs.

COVID-19 Update, Please Share.

April 22, 2020

We still have 0 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Owen County.

Governor Beshear announced 196 new cases today, bringing the state total to 3,373. The Governor also reported 14 additional deaths, bringing the total number of deaths to 185. The good news is the number who have recovered continues to grow faster, with the total now reaching 1,311.

Governor Beshear announced plans to ramp up testing to 20,000 tests per week beginning next week. With only 36,075 tests done to-date in Kentucky, this will be a drastic increase in testing.

The U.S. death toll has now risen to over 46,600, an increase of more than 2,400 deaths in the past 24 hours.

Please continue to follow the CDC guidelines and wear a face covering if you must go out for essentials.

Stay Safe, Stay Healthy and Stay Home.

COVID-19 Update, Please Share

April 11, 2020

We still have 0 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Owen County. Governor Beshear announced 185 new cases in Kentucky bringing the total to 1,840. Unfortunately he also had to reported 4 new deaths bringing the state’s total of COVID-19 deaths to 94. The U.S. now has more than 522,000 positive cases and the death toll has climbed to nearly 20,300, an increase of 2,000 deaths from yesterday.

I know tomorrow will be difficult as we have to celebrate such a special time of year in such a different way. In an effort to “Love Thy Neighbor” please remember to follow the CDC guidelines to prevent the spread of the corona virus to them.

I pray that God blesses each of you and your family with a safe and healthy Easter.

Stay Safe, Stay Healthy and Stay Home.

COVID-19 Update, Please Share

April 5, 2020

No changes to report this evening. We still have 0 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Owen County.

As I’ve said before, I have no doubt it’s here and you should always act as if it is. Governor Beshear reported more than 30 new positives today in this state. That statistic is a bit deceiving as he eluded to. Last Sunday’s report was 45 new cases which was sizably lower. That’s because a lot of labs aren’t reporting on Sunday or have less staff working running tests on this day. 5 more deaths have occurred in this state from COVID-19.

Please continue to practice social distancing and adhere to guidelines that will help you protect yourself and the ones you love.

Covid-19 Update

April 1, 2020

Good Evening,

More than 90 additional cases of COVID-19 in Kentucky were confirmed today. As of now, there are still 0 confirmed cases in Owen County. As I said this morning, we know this will not remain 0 forever and you should act as if it is here, because it is very very likely that it is.

Due to the fact that social distancing is not happening in certain businesses some changes were made today. A big thank you to Owenton Police Chief Terry Gentry for working with our Owenton & Owen County businesses to ensure compliance of the Social Distancing rules.

Stores are encouraged to enforce this and local law enforcement will also be assisting to ensure compliance.

Please look at the graph below, you can see the estimated lives saved by the practices the Governor has put into place. While it may not be an exact science, this model uses the best possible data from other countries and other states. Up to 30,000 lives verses 3000 by our arc estimates. This is huge!!!!

Prescription Delivery Availability

To further prevent the spread of COVID-19 Cull Family Pharmacy is closing the inside of their store to the public. This will be in effect starting at 10 am today (3/20/20). Prescription medications will still be available for pick up. As before, they have made accommodations to bring prescriptions out to your car. Give them a call at 502-484-3046 to let them know you are here, and they will be happy to bring you your medicine.

In addition to Cull Pharmacy’s curbside pick up and delivery service, I have ordered Owen County Public Transit and Owen County EMS to help fulfill the delivery needs in support of Cull Pharmacy should the need arise. For your convenience, Cull Pharmacy will coordinate any delivery needs so there is no need to contact any other agency.

Today, we are going to a demo using Newton's Laws of Motion!

**UPDATE!** So for some reason, the video stopped recording before I was done - ugh! So here's a review of the mini lesson at the end:

1. The egg has more inertia than the toilet paper roll because it has more mass. Therefore, it is more difficult to move and takes more force to move.
2. When you apply a force to the plastic lid, it moves the lid as well as the toilet paper roll because it has less inertia (an object at rest stays at rest unless acted upon by an outside force! Newton's First Law!)
3. Because the egg has more inertia, it did not travel with the lid and TP roll, so it stayed at rest UNTIL gravity pulled it down into the water.
4. Newton's First Law is also called the Law of Inertia.

There's Newton's First Law in action!

Another episode of Science with Saikin! Today, we are doing one of my FAVES - Elephant Toothpaste! All you need is hydrogen peroxide, yeast, soap, water, food coloring, and a bottle or cup with a skinny neck (you can see it better that way!)

Science with Saikin! In light of students being home due to school closures, I'll be doing some Facebook Live science demos! Today, we are doing a little demo on chemical change.

*Update* Please feel free to share these videos! And let me know what you'd like to see in terms of demos! I'm really hoping to do one demo a day or every other day.

Hey Hey Everyone!! Hear this please... the expectation for kids learning at home CANNOT be the same as what they were expected to do in the school setting!! There are soo many factors that are playing into them not keeping the same exact routine and schedule! Ease into it! This is just as new to them as it is for you and they will need some time to adjust to putting forth a different mental focus at home and that's ok! Honestly, as teachers, we over-plan all the time and this situation probably isn't all that different. Ask questions of us, clarify expectations, but please please don't fight with your children about the work! Their mental health is a priority right now as their precious world has been shifted quickly and dramatically! There is not a teacher out there that doesn't want to help with what they've sent home so please reach out to them if you need to! We can and will do this together!

We can keep our students healthy during this flu season by following these very important steps:
Wash their backpacks, jackets and other clothing items that they wear often.
Keep them home if they are sick, or have been sick within the last 24 hours.
Remind them to wash their hands on a regular basis, and cough/sneeze into their elbows.

We will continue to wipe down surfaces of frequent contact, such as desks, keyboards, doorknobs...

STUDENTS WHO BECOME ILL WHILE AT SCHOOL WILL BE REQUIRED TO SEE THE NURSE BEFORE BEING RELEASED.

Thank you for your cooperation. Stay healthy.

Please ask your child if they have their progress report, all students received them again today!

November 1st is the end of Quarter 1. Report Cards will be sent out the following week.
Please remember to contact Bernadette Smith, in Student Services, if you would like to get an appointment for Parent/Teacher Conferences.

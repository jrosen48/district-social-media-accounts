It came in separate emails to include the newsletter, the Middle School Awards Presentation, and the 8th Grade Presentation.

PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE

The end of this kind of crazy year is here. None of us expected an ending like this. I want to thank all parents, guardians, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and care-givers to all our children here in Oxford -- we couldn't have done this without you. So many students stepped up and did a great job working from home under less than ideal conditions.

This summer we will be preparing for September and whatever that may look like. Hopefully we will be back in each of our buildings with all of your wonderful children. Regardless, know that the teachers and staff will be prepared to teach in any environment.

Have a great summer, stay safe, know that you are missed and loved, and we hope to see you soon.

“It’s all about balancing helping others with still making time for your own school work.”

In both his advice to others and in his own life, Oxford Academy High School’s Bryan Huggins puts helping others before himself, and that’s why we’re so proud to recognize him as an Akshar’s All-Star.

That balance, work ethic and attitude are exactly what our communities and our nation need right now and in the years to come.

The 4th graders were just able to meet with Terry Stark, the Mayor of Oxford, on Zoom. They asked some excellent questions. Mr. Stark did a wonderful job answering them and encouraging them to take part in their local government. We would love to say thank you to him for his time and willingness to use technology in a different way to educate our 4th graders.

Some of the questions below:

1. Do you like your job?
2. Is being the mayor your only job?
3. Do you get paid a lot of money to be the mayor?
4. What do you like to do when you are not working?
5. Do you have any pets?
6. Do you know when Covid-19 will end?
7. When is your birthday?
8. What is the hardest part of your job?
9. What was a challenge you had to face as the mayor?
10. Who helps you with running the village?
11. Do you want to run for reelection?
12. How many years are your terms?

We look forward to seeing how young Blackhawks participate in elections, governance, and community support in the years to come.

Thank you!

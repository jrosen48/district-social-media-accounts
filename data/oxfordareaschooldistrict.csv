On December 7, Oxford Area High School Student Council hosted the school's 13th annual Holiday Festival. Various clubs and the individual classes provided crafts and activities for elementary-aged children and their families throughout the morning.

Santa was on hand for pictures with the children and to share Christmas wishes, and the Oxford Parent Teacher Organization ran its annual Book Fair & Santa Shop so that the youngsters could do some shopping on their own. Student Council also collected toys for the high school's annual Toys for Tots drive.
Continuing a tradition that began with the first Holiday Festival, Student Council members sold refreshments at Eli and Alex's Lemonade Stand to benefit the Eli Seth Matthews Leukemia Foundation.
Student Council wishes to express its thanks for the generosity of all the families who attended the festival.",2019-12-20 14:39:28,,

Hey, folks! Let's show the 2019-20 graduates of Oxford Virtual Academy (OVA) some love!
Motorists traveling along S. Glaspie St. in the village are encouraged to be on the lookout for signs, lots of signs, on the east side of the road. But don't worry, they're not more construction-related signs.
This morning, OVA's administration -- Principal Janet Schell and assistant principals Gianna Mrozek and Matt Santala -- placed 37 signs along the portion of S. Glaspie St. in front of Scripter Park. Each one bears the name of an OVA graduate.
Let's all give OVA's graduates a big hand and wish them well in their future endeavors. Whether you received your Oxford education in a traditional classroom setting or via a computer, you're all true-blue Wildcats and we're very proud of you.
Congratulations and good luck, grads!",0.0,"Thank you for the great pictures and post Charter Township of Oxford. Congratulations, OVA grads👩‍🎓👨‍🎓 We are so proud of you, Wildcats!!

*****UPDATE*****

STADIUM LIGHTS FOR SENIORS HAS BEEN POSTPONED UNTIL MAY 20, 2020.

Due to the overwhelming reach and response to yesterday’s post, we are postponing the stadium lights for seniors until next month. In conversations with the Oakland County Sheriff’s office, we have come to this collective decision to be sure we are not violating the current Executive Order and we are not putting anyone at unnecessary risk.

We apologize for the disappointment you all must be feeling, we feel it too, but we must put everyone’s safety first.

**********************************
Tomorrow, April 20 we invite our fellow Wildcats to come together in their cars at Wildcat Stadium as we turn on the stadium lights at 8:20 pm (20:20 military time) to honor all of our seniors who have had their final year of high school cut short.

When the lights go on, the scoreboard will be set for 20 minutes and 20 seconds. It is imperative that everyone stays in their own cars to remain safely socially distant.

As you know, there was a shooting incident that occurred this morning off campus near McAuliffe School. As a result, one student was injured and suffered non-life threatening injuries.

I would like to thank the principal, teachers, and McAuliffe team for taking care of the students in a caring and loving manner. We also thank the Oxnard Police Department for their immediate response to this incident. Lastly, I would like to thank McAuliffe parents and families for their understanding and patience today during this stressful incident. We will continue to ensure the safety and securing of our students and staff. Thank you.

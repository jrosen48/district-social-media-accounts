Post Date:04/28/2020

To help stop the spread of COVID-19, the Monterey County Health Officer is requiring residents to wear a face covering when going out into the public to perform essential activities, effective 12:01 a.m. on Thursday, April 30, 2020. Combined with sheltering in place, social distancing, and frequent hand hygiene, facial coverings are shown to help slow transmission of COVID-19.

The adult school will have homemade masks available to staff, one per staff member, until they are gone, at the high school between 11:00 and 12:30 today and tomorrow.

In case you can't get to the high school, our own, Toula Hubbard and her daughter, created this video that will demonstrate how you can make a mask from a shirt you may already have in your closet!

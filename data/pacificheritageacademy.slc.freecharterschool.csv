As we prepare and plan for this upcoming school year, we will be following CDC health guidelines. The different definitions of what code (Green, Yellow, Orange or Red) we are in will be explained through an email & video post by the end of next week, so please be patient with us. We will share the modified schedules after we receive input from our families. #staypositive

Lifetouch will be at PHA tomorrow, March 5, for spring pictures! Only students who bring money for a picture packet will have their portrait taken.

A reminder that your student still needs to be in dress code for class (a school shirt and solid-colored bottoms). You may bring your child a change of clothes if you'd like their portrait taken in something other than dress code.

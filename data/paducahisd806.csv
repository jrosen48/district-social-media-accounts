The #2020Census is here. 😁 Everyone counts in the census!

Starting today most households across the country will start to receive 2020 Census Invitation Letters that look like this ⬇️ inviting them to go online and complete the 2020 Census!

If you didn’t receive a paper questionnaire, don’t worry. You will get one eventually if you have not responded by April 8.

Don’t forget to count:

✔️ Babies born on or before April 1, 2020, young children, foster or adopted children, grandchildren 👶
✔️ Relatives and non-relatives (your mother-in-law too!) 👵
✔️ Long-term visitors (not abuelita who is visiting for only a couple of days though) 🏠

The #2020Census is here. 😁 Everyone counts in the census!

Starting today most households across the country will start to receive 2020 Census Invitation Letters that look like this ⬇️ inviting them to go online and complete the 2020 Census!

If you didn’t receive a paper questionnaire, don’t worry. You will get one eventually if you have not responded by April 8.

Don’t forget to count:

✔️ Babies born on or before April 1, 2020, young children, foster or adopted children, grandchildren 👶
✔️ Relatives and non-relatives (your mother-in-law too!) 👵
✔️ Long-term visitors (not abuelita who is visiting for only a couple of days though) 🏠

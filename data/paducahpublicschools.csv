Since receiving Governor Beshear’s recommendation that the start of school be delayed until September 28, I have been in constant conversation with local health officials, district leadership, and our board of education about the best path forward. We have requested and received local and regional data to analyze the local impact as opposed to the state-wide impact of the COVID-19 virus.

We are exploring every option at this point regarding how and when to start school. While we may be able to make an announcement sooner, we will announce the specifics of our plan no later than the next meeting of the Paducah Board of Education on Monday, August 17.

Our staff have been planning to implement both at-home and at-school learning, as we originally planned, so I am confident that they will be prepared for either option.
Regardless of how we deliver instruction to our students, let’s continue to work together for what is best for each and every child.

Since receiving Governor Beshear’s recommendation that the start of school be delayed until September 28, I have been in constant conversation with local health officials, district leadership, and our board of education about the best path forward. We have requested and received local and regional data to analyze the local impact as opposed to the state-wide impact of the COVID-19 virus.

We are exploring every option at this point regarding how and when to start school. While we may be able to make an announcement sooner, we will announce the specifics of our plan no later than the next meeting of the Paducah Board of Education on Monday, August 17.

Our staff have been planning to implement both at-home and at-school learning, as we originally planned, so I am confident that they will be prepared for either option.
Regardless of how we deliver instruction to our students, let’s continue to work together for what is best for each and every child.

With no hesitation, Officer Matthew Strohiemer and Officer Tyson Riley escorted the young ladies to their choice of restaurant for dinner and then to the dance.

Clark Elementary's Paxton Beck, McNabb Elementary's Isabela DeLaRosa, and Morgan Elementary's Cori Gordan will spearhead efforts at their respective schools.

Fifth graders at the three schools will write back and forth throughout the year. The Class of 2027's Pen Pal Project will culminate at the end of the school year with fun and games at Paducah Middle School.

This will be the third year that Clark, McNabb, and Morgan students will participate in the writing program. The student-driven project, established to engage young students as they transition from elementary to middle school, allows fifth graders to get to know their future classmates before the transition to middle school. It also allows students to hone creative and authentic writing skills. In addition, the program fosters inclusion, empathy and acceptance.

Last year, the project was honored by Kentucky’s Commissioner of Education as one of three outstanding Student Ambassador Initiatives.

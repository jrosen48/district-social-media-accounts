We have been able to continue our backpack program at PUSD. We are trying to provide food boxes for as many other families that are struggling or quarantined as possible. We have been handing out soap, sanitizer and disinfecting wipes as well, especially for our families without running water. We are running low and it is hard to purchase those items on a large scale right now. I am asking for donations of rubbing alcohol, bleach, or hydrogen peroxide if you have any extra to make homemade wipes. Also any plastic containers you may have that we could put them in. I know everyone is struggling right now, but anything you may be able to contribute would be amazing. Please let me know and I will pick it up or arrange a drop off time at the district office. Thank you and please take care.",5.0,"Taz Williams, Student Support Services Director posted this earlier about the return of the backpack program.

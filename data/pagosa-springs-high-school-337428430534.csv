One of these extras is a yard sign that the graduates will receive on the day of the graduation viewing, May 30th. Several people have expressed an interest in donating to some of these ""extras"" to help recognize the seniors. Here is one of those opportunities. If you are interested, please click on the link and follow the instructions. Feel free to share this with other family and friends.

While we cannot have parents walk their child inside this year, here's what we can do:

Our staff will not park in the upper lot on Tuesday Morning. Instead, we want you to feel free to park there from 8 to 8:15 after buses have already gone from the area. You can take as much of that 15 minutes as you need to get your little one excited, comfortable, and ready as possible to take on their first day of school before walking them to the aide at the gate.

The instructional aide will walk them to the door where their teacher will welcome them and give you a big wave.

The District welcomed the staff back in a unique and fun team-building way for their first day back of the 2020-21 school year with a surprise --the staff got to participate in ASD's First Annual--""The Amazing Race - Pagosa style"".

The teams raced to complete a series of 12 tasks from clues that took them all over town racing to do such things as: take a picture with the county commissioner, find the Safety Resource Officers in your school and take a selfie with them, document Family School Bee House messages, sing the Pagosa Pirates fight song on stage...and so much more. Teams raced to the finish line at the stadium where they joined their peers for some water and a snack.

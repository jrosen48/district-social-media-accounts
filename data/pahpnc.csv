Hi Mrs. Norcross,

I hope you are well! I wanted to tell you that Noah had such a wonderful experience in 6th grade. He is new to Phoenix and we were both unsure of what to expect but it has been such a positive experience. He loves school and loves to learn and having 6th grade cut short has been difficult for him. I want to also tell you that his teachers, Mr. Armentrout, Mr. Howell, Mrs. Turner, Ms. Griffith, Mr. Rodriguez, and Mrs. Dicey have made the transition to home learning smooth and clear. Their support has been endless and if he or I have questions, they are just a click away!
I really appreciate their organized assignments and consistent communication.
He is really looking forward to 7th grade and we hope school will resume in August.
Stay safe and be well!

I thought you should be aware that Mrs. Craddock, my daughter’s third grade teacher, called her today. She asked how she was doing and wanted to know if she could help in any way. She was so very kind and reassuring. (mother had been sending her pictures of our hard little worker.)

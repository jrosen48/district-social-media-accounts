Valley School District Staff and Families,

It may be hard to believe but there are only two weeks left in this school year and our seniors will be done in one week! Thank you for hanging in there with us through our Continuous Learning model and keep pushing hard until the end. A few key dates:

‚Ä¢ Food service with delivery will run through June 18 (two meals on June 18)
‚Ä¢ Last day of school for grades K-11 is June 12
‚Ä¢ Last day of school for seniors is June 5
‚Ä¢ Paideia High School pre-graduation process is June 6

One of my biggest takeaways this spring is how important teamwork and working together is for the success of our students. Together IS better!

Take care,

Valley School District Staff and Families,

As you have likely heard, Governor Inslee has extended the closure of schools for the rest of this school year. It is a good reminder that we are in the middle of a health crisis and will do everything we can to stop the spread of COVID-19. With that said, our plan is to continue running the meal service, childcare for first responders and medical professionals, and provide continuous learning. The district will receive additional information and direction from the Office of the Superintendent of Instruction (OSPI) on continuous learning. Please know, we will continue to work hard and provide the best education possible for our students.

Take care,

Does your donation matter? Yes it does!

Today we had the joy of sharing your donations with Paladin Career & Technical High School. This absolutely amazing school lifts up kids that were not excelling in traditional schools. There is a fluctuating percentage of homeless kids at Paladin. In a recent survey of their homeless youth, 100% - that's 100%! - said they felt ""supported and cared for and their immediate needs were being met by Paladin"". WOW!

Today YOU helped Paladin get food and supplies into the lives of their students and you helped their homeless youth know that people they don't know - CARE ABOUT THEM! :)

As fast as we collect items - they go out. Your donation matters!

If you feel led, I can do a contactless pick up at your house or you can drop off at mine. 612.618.6936

Most needed items: larger size diapers, wipes, pull ups, baby formula and food, anything cleaning, PODS for the washing machine, feminine products, pet food, all toiletries and for food - those things that are easy to make (soup, heat and go food, box food, oatmeal, etc.).

Fardowso Abdi of the Paladin Career and Technical High School in Blaine, recalls: “When I was in a traditional school, people only saw me for my hijab and I was subjected to harassment. Negative feelings festered inside of me and caused me great mental harm. However, I have realized my calling in life: dealing with implicit bias. During my time here at Paladin, I have changed tremendously. I used to be an angry student and I didn’t know why. Paladin gave me the time and space to understand where my anger was coming from, and having this information about myself has empowered me. I am now embracing my role as an advocate and leader among my peers. This is why alternative school programs are so important.”

Fardowso Abdi of the Paladin Career and Technical High School in Blaine, recalls: “When I was in a traditional school, people only saw me for my hijab and I was subjected to harassment. Negative feelings festered inside of me and caused me great mental harm. However, I have realized my calling in life: dealing with implicit bias. During my time here at Paladin, I have changed tremendously. I used to be an angry student and I didn’t know why. Paladin gave me the time and space to understand where my anger was coming from, and having this information about myself has empowered me. I am now embracing my role as an advocate and leader among my peers. This is why alternative school programs are so important.”

“As an athlete, there’s a lot of focus on physical fitness. This partnership with Calm is all about mental fitness. It’s something I’ve always prioritized, and it’s just as important to my game, my career, and my life than anything I can do physically. The ability to focus and calibrate everything going on inside your mind is a skill that can be strengthened over time, and Calm helps me do that.

Words of wisdom to fellow classmates: “Paladin's main education method, project-based learning, is so open and adaptable. Use this flexibility to earn the credits and hit the targets you need while still learning what YOU want to learn in the way you want to do it. Earn those painful math credits by singing, drawing, dancing, or playing an instrument. Earn those history credits by writing a short skit, constructing a battlefield, or dressing as various historic figures. Have fun while also learning! Trust me on this! I managed to turn Minecraft, of all games, into history credits! Play to your strengths, and you'll graduate in no time.""

GET CHROMEBOOKS FOR 75% OFF TO HELP WITH DISTANCE LEARNING

As families and school districts prepare for weeks or perhaps months of distance learning, Minnesota Afterschool Advance (MAA) is here to help! The same tax credit MAA uses to help families pay for afterschool and summer activities can also be used to get 75% off up to $200 of computer hardware, like Chromebooks, per family.

How can MAA help?
MAA can help families purchase Chromebooks at a 75% discount. We do this by using a tool called the K-12 Education Tax Credit.

MAA makes a no-interest advance to you for the 75% covered by the tax credit, and then state dollars automatically repay the advance when you file your taxes at the end of the year. These are extra dollars—you will still get your regular refund.

Limit one per household.

Words of wisdom to her fellow classmates:

My advice would be when you find yourself not knowing something never hesitate to ask the Paladin staff has all the help you need, it’s okay to take a break from something because you don’t want to stress yourself over something that can be easily fixed, stay focused at all times don’t let your friends be a distraction or it will slow you down, when you know you need to get something done just do it don’t procrastinate, work on math every chance you get just because that’s what everyone usually has left in the end and
lastly don’t give up!

Here are some inspirational words to start the weekend...

When you go out and see the empty streets, the empty stadiums, the empty train platforms, don't say to yourself, ""It looks like the end of the world."" What you're seeing is love in action. What you're seeing, in that negative space, is how much we do care for each other, for our grandparents, for the immuno-compromised brothers and sisters, for people we will never meet.

People will lose jobs over this. Some will lose their businesses. And some will lose their lives. All the more reason to take a moment, when you're out on your walk, or on your way to the store, or just watching the news, to look into the emptiness and marvel at all of that love.

Let it fill and sustain you. It isn't the end of the world. It is the most remarkable act of global solidarity we may ever witness.

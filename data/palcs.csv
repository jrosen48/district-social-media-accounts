Rachel, a current PALCS Parent, recently shared with us her positive experience with our Guidance Department: ""When my son arrived at PALCS, Ms. Patty & Ms. Dawson were very helpful in getting him registered. He started two weeks late, but Ms. Dawson made herself available to our family to ensure that he caught up with the other students. She also assisted with being a ""voice"" for him when it came to communicating with his teachers. She always made sure that she found a solution for us -- whether it was concerns about a class or issues with the laptop/printer. When we were registering for Spring classes, I realized that my son had two classes overlapping, and Ms. Patty worked with Ms. Dawson to get him switched right away. The process of registering for classes and receiving support has been awesome!""

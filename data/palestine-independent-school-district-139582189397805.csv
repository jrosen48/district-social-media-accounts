Next up in our meet the faculty series is Gina Dudley, MSN, RN.

I started my nursing career more than 26 years ago as a LVN, later acquiring my Associate Degree in Nursing. While working in the hospital setting, I had the pleasure of being mentored by many wonderful nurses that inspired me to pursue higher education. In 2014, I graduated from University of Phoenix with my Masters of Science Degree in Nursing.
I have worked in a variety of settings ranging from Medical - Surgical , Intensive Care, Pediatrics and Community Health. As a eager life learner, pouring into others has always been my passion. I am truly blessed that The University of Texas at Tyler has allowed me the opportunity to help others discover their purpose and passion and fulfill their dreams. The moment your student has a WOW factor is such a wonderful feeling. It gives me pleasure to see our past students successfully working within our profession to improve health care not only in our community, but all over the world.",2.0,"Way to go PHS alumni Mrs. Gina Dudley!!!

The 3rd grade Launch classes surprised their teachers this evening with a parade to say thanks for a great year and let them know how loved they are! Mila has LOVED having Mrs. Jenkins and Mrs. Foote this year and was sad the year was cut short! We love our school, the teachers, the kids and the parents we’ve gotten to know these last few years. 🐾 #wildcatnation #southsidestrong Ohhh and I think Sawyer is now kinda hoping he can just skip 2nd and go straight to 3rd with these two beautiful teachers! 😍🤣",2020-05-08 13:24:43,,

This is Jason Marshall, Palestine ISD Superintendent.
As I’m sure you know by now, Governor Abbott has closed on-campus learning for all schools for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year.
Therefore, Palestine ISD will continue providing meals and Home Learning Packets to students as we have for the last month.

Please visit our PISD web page or our PISD Facebook page for my latest letter addressing the Covid-19 situation and our continued response.
Have a nice evening.",2020-04-21 18:45:00,,

Use a cloth face covering in public to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
Your cloth face covering should:

✔️Reach above the nose, below the chin, and completely cover the mouth and nostrils
✔️Fit snugly against the sides of the face
✔️Be made of multiple layers of fabric that you can still breathe through
✔️Be able to be laundered and machine dried without damaging the material or shape

Do not buy surgical masks to use as a face covering. Those are intended for healthcare workers and first responders. Many items you may already have in your home can be used to create face coverings. Try creating a cloth face covering using bandanas, ski masks, washable napkins, or dish towels. https://bit.ly/2Ravt42",0.0,"CDC

Do not buy surgical masks to use as a face covering. Those are intended for healthcare workers and first responders. Many items you may already have in your home can be used to create face coverings. Try creating a cloth face covering using bandanas, ski masks, washable napkins, or dish towels. https://bit.ly/2Ravt42",2020-04-07 06:37:21,,

Some making videos as a contact. I have seen signs out and about. I love the new birthday parade idea and certainly has brought joy to some kids and adults.

We have been learning about nutrition and the guidelines our cafeterias have to follow to prepare lunches. Codye gave us a great tour and answered all of the questions my hungry kids had.

o Wash your hands, cover your coughs and sneezes and stay away from people who are sick.
o Try to avoid someone who is showing symptoms. (This is the other side of not spreading the disease, which is not catching it.)

Tonight we honor Coach John Absalom on his 600th career coaching win. With this win he joins three other coaches with 600 or more wins on the Texas Association of Soccer Coaches list and is the 15th coach all-time to reach this mark nationally according to the National Federation of High Schools website. Coach Absalom has accumulated these wins across 4 schools, Killeen, Whitehouse, Jacksonville and Palestine. Coach Absalom has accumulated 354 of those wins here at Palestine, with 314 on the boys side and 40 on the girls. Among those wins were four trips to the state tournament and one state championship in boys soccer. In addition he has also won three regional titles and had numerous state meet appearances in boys and girls cross country. Your family, friends, fellow coaches and players thank you for all your tireless dedication, preparation and discipline that have gotten these programs to these elite levels.

Some of the students said they used to be so scared and hate bats. But, since watching our live stream cameras and learning more about bats, they are no longer scared and are eager to learn more. 😃👏

Please submit a recipe in your child’s category and a family favorite. You can either submit them via email to palopintoPTO@gmail.com or you may choose to write it out on the form that was sent home in communication folders this week.

Your officers this year are, Donna Polston - President, Skye Dorr - Vice President, Katrina Porter - Secretary, Jennifer Nierman - Treasurer. We are all excited about this school year! We have some fun fundraisers planned! Stay tuned for details.

Meet the Teacher is August 15th at 3:30PM for Pre- K students and new students, and 4:30PM for returning students. We will be there with some treats and refreshments. Please speak with one of us if you have any questions about PTO or would like to volunteer.

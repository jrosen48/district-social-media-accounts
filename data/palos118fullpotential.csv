Good afternoon,

This morning we received a report of suspicious activity involving a cream colored SUV at a bus stop at 130th Street and 86th Avenue that occurred yesterday afternoon. Students at the stop reported the possibility of the driver taking pictures of them. Parents reported the incident to the Cook County Sheriff's Department and officers are investigating. We have no additional details from the Sheriff at this time. Additional patrols have been added to the area as a precaution.

Now that school has started, I am asking our entire school community to be vigilant of suspicious activity at bus stops and immediately report any suspicious activity to local police and your child's school. Student safety remains our top priority and I thank you in advance for working with us to ensure our students remain safe traveling to and from school this school year.

Thank you,

And to children of all ages – this is a very strange moment that you’re living in. Your parents and I didn’t experience something like this when we were kids – but I can tell you for sure that the hard things we did live through, we learned from. And you’re going to learn from this. You’re going to see what it looks like when the world comes together, and what it looks like to put your faith in science, and research, and the teams of people here in Illinois and beyond who are working on treatments and vaccines to save lives. We will get to their other side of this, and that other side will be a place that appreciates the best of the before, but with a greater sense of compassion and connection. And the best part is that you are going to be the ones guiding us forward. All of you, with your creativity, your passion, and your care for others are going to shape our future.

This fundraiser is part of a research project they did in Mrs. Meskimen’s ELA class with the novel, The Bridge Home by Padma Venkatraman. In the novel, the characters find themselves homeless, in need of clean water, food, medicine, and shelter. With the help of outreach programs like Habitat for Humanity, the kids are given a fresh start in life. Munchkins are 2 for $1.00 and all proceeds will be donated! Stay tuned for more students and their fundraising projects in the coming weeks. ❤️",2019-12-09 12:05:12,,

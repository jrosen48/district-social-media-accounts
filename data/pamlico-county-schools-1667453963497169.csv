Coach Hale won a Rural Participation Project scholarship in 2019 to attend the Science Olympiad coaches clinic. According to Sheri, ""Having a Science Olympiad team has always been a dream of mine and this year the dream became a reality! I really enjoyed the coaches training in the fall and I came back with so much exciting tips, photos, and emails of other coaches willing to help the newbies!""
Our goal is to have a lot of fun together as a team. We’re really interested in the Team Spirit award! Since this is our very first Science Olympiad team for our school system, we’ve already achieved so much just by having a team! Sure, winning a medal would be great, but seeing how much the team has learned and seeing the excitement in their eyes makes them all winners in my book!

There is a quote that states:

“The greatest gifts you can give your children are the roots of responsibility and the wings of independence.”

Our students are all over the state this weekend representing PCHS, themselves and their families!

Good luck to our wrestling team as they travel to Asheboro to compete in regionals.

Safe travels to our Youth and Government students as they present their ideas in Raleigh.

Best wishes to the members of the PCHS band that are traveling to Wilmington to perform in the All Region Jazz Band.

We couldn’t be prouder!

YES!!!! You read that right!!!! PCMS faculty, staff and students are going back to the middle school!

Monday, March 4th will be our first day back on OUR campus since we were displaced in September by Hurricane Florence.

Here are a few reminders to make the transition as smooth as possible!

MORNING:

Student drop offs may begin at 7:30 in the back parking lot near the band room on McCotter Road (running beside the middle school)

6th Graders will report to the Family Learning Center
7th Graders will report to the cafeteria
8th Graders will report to the gym

AFTERNOON:

We dismiss at 3:15.

7th and 8th Grade Car Riders will be picked up in the same parking lot they were dropped off in the morning.

6th Grade Car Riders should be picked up in the first parking lot on McCotter Road (beside the middle school)

Looking forward to being all together once again!",3.0,"It’s a partial opening but thankful to have them under one roof again!!! Thanks for all the hours of hard work by so many to make this happen!!

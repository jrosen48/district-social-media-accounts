All of the events will be livestreamed at TeachersCan.org/events, unless indicated otherwise there. And get some sleep , because your schedule of events starts at 7:30 each morning, including tomorrow. You don't have to be a teacher to participate, but we are doing this specifically to pay tribute to our awesome Texas teachers.

""Danely and I started a project at home and tried it on our friends and family, and it has been so great.

During these hard times news and social media are covered with updates and everything you need to know about Covid-19. We don’t really know how everyone is dealing with it. It’s a scary time. So we decided to do something for our families staying at home and doing their part.

We would like to ask more kids to participate with us. This is a way we are trying to keep students connected and have a little laugh along the way. We would love videos and pictures from our teachers,principals, and anyone that works with our kids.""

Hey everyone!! Sorry it’s super late but I thought I’d share some of my thoughts with y’all! Now I know it’s easier said than done but we all have to work together on this one. The people taking the biggest hit from this mess is the community. Small businesses are struggling more than ever right now and I feel like we should step up to the plate and lend out a hand. I’m not sure about y’all but my definition of being #pampaproud is standing up for the little guy. And right now the little guy needs all of our help. Everyone!! Take time out of your day to thank the people in service!! If you don’t want to cook please call in local!!! Eat local! Support locally!!! Help the community!! I know we can do it! Let’s all be #pampaproud together!

I would like to Propose a challenge to everyone. Along with spirit week I want everyone to take a selfie of you supporting a local business and tag me!!! For every person who tags me I will do 10 push ups. So if you want to see me struggle go out and support local!! That’s the challenge!!!",6.0,"Here is a challenge from Sir Harvester!

Hey everyone!! Sorry it’s super late but I thought I’d share some of my thoughts with y’all! Now I know it’s easier said than done but we all have to work together on this one. The people taking the biggest hit from this mess is the community. Small businesses are struggling more than ever right now and I feel like we should step up to the plate and lend out a hand. I’m not sure about y’all but my definition of being #pampaproud is standing up for the little guy. And right now the little guy needs all of our help. Everyone!! Take time out of your day to thank the people in service!! If you don’t want to cook please call in local!!! Eat local! Support locally!!! Help the community!! I know we can do it! Let’s all be #pampaproud together!

I would like to Propose a challenge to everyone. Along with spirit week I want everyone to take a selfie of you supporting a local business and tag me!!! For every person who tags me I will do 10 push ups. So if you want to see me struggle go out and support local!! That’s the challenge!!!",2020-04-01 07:45:09,,

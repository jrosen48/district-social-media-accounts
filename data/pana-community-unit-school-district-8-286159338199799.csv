Why not leave the catering to someone else and purchase your ticket today? For only $10, you will receive an 8-oz. marinated pork chop, twice-baked potato casserole, green beans and a roll. Tickets can be purchased at any school office as well as the Unit Office.

Pickup will be at the PHS Circle drive on Sept. 23rd from 4 - 6 pm.

Again, the PEF thanks you all for your generous support!",2020-08-30 19:05:24,,

All our students are being presented a quality education. Triple A students choose to accept this opportunity to grow academically. The ultimate reward will be a better start in their educational life after high school but there is nothing wrong with receiving rewards while in school.

This week Triple A students have been enjoying a relaxing time of fun and friendship with their peers celebrating their achievement. Playing games, watching movies, and going to watch a movie in the theater have been on the list of things to do for the group. Check out the short video showing one of the fun events.

We don't know of a student in our high school that cannot achieve this goal of becoming a Triple A student. Parents please encourage and support your students. Point them towards setting this goal for the next semester.",2019-12-18 07:31:41,https://video-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/80932827_803318070142005_3504778688895909888_n.mp4?_nc_cat=102&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6InN2ZV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=VWCerjzpbAkAX-wwfUw&_nc_ht=video-atl3-1.xx&oh=5bdfa89d3ac24c43858ff5b68f523ca9&oe=5F623F9C,

Panama Public Schools is communicating with parents of students who will be juniors during the 2019-20 school year.
Our school district plans to administer the ACT® test in spring 2020 to eligible juniors as part of the state contract with the Oklahoma State Department of Education and ACT.
Last year over 95% of Oklahoma schools selected to administer the ACT. Our district believes this is an excellent opportunity for all eligible juniors to take the ACT at no cost to them or their families.

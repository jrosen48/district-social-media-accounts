I would like to invite all interested student athletes and parents to an informational meeting to be held in the LHS auditorium on Wednesday Feb. 6th at 6:30 p.m. Attendance at this meeting does not commit your child to participate, however it will be helpful in determining student interest and if the development of these programs should proceed forward. Again this is for girls in grades 6 - 12 during the 2019-2020 school year.",2019-01-30 11:31:31,,

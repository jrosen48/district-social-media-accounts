1) The volleyball tournament at CRB scheduled this Saturday 9/5 has been canceled due to rising Covid-19 cases in Carroll County.
2) Volleyball will now play a JV/Varsity Thursday 9/3 scrimmage @ Glidden-Ralston. This is a closed scrimmage, with no parents or spectators allowed.
3) The football game this Friday 9/4 vs. Clarinda has been moved from Clarinda to Corning (SW Valley HS) due to Clarinda's field recently being reseeded and not yet ready for play.
- Please note for ALL spectators attending this game. MASKS/FACE COVERINGS ARE REQUIRED UPON ENTRY AND MUST BE WORN THE ENTIRE GAME. Panorama spectators will absolutely be abiding by these rules set by the host school. This will be policed/enforced at the game.

As Panorama CSD begins our “Return to Learn” plan for the fall of 2020 we need to have our stakeholders reflect and offer feedback on the distance learning that took place this spring. While we are extremely proud of the efforts of our staff and students this spring, it was our first experience with distance learning. A survey link has been sent to all parents and students 3rd through 12th grade.

Good Afternoon! This is a quick update regarding our plan for secondary students. First, thank you to everyone who filled out the Instructional Options Declaration Form. After collecting responses from over 90% of our secondary students, we feel confident that we can offer 4 days per week of in person instruction for our students in 6th-12th grade. Students who have chosen in-person instruction will report to school Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. On Wednesdays, they will complete work from home.

Students who have chosen Full-Virtual instruction will complete work from home Monday-Friday and meet with their teachers virtually on Wednesdays. More information will be coming soon, once schedules are set. Our goal is to have schedules done by August 27th. Mark your calendars for Virtual Meet Your Teacher Night on September 3rd at 5:30P.M.

The Puma Press received a gold rating in the Michigan Interscholastic Press Association's annual Spartan Awards!

Our publication was judged by a retired journalism teacher from Wyoming. In her comments, she said, ""For such a young newspaper, The Puma Press has a strong, solid grasp on what it means to publish a newspaper that is the voice of the school community of Pansophia Academy. The large number of eighth-graders on staff should bode well for the future of the writing and editorial staff.""

We are so proud, and can't wait to get started on next year's paper! Congratulations to our amazing newspaper staff!",7.0,"The Puma Press

Mrs. Barrand here ... A March/April issue will be posted soon on the school website. It will not be printed; the May issue will also be online-only. I am hoping to be able to print a special June issue dedicated to the seniors and featuring their senior photos and graduation coverage. Obviously, all of this is wait-and-see, but that's what I would like to do. On a personal note, I hope my students are well, and that they are using the skills I have tried to teach them with regard to seeking responsible journalism. Now more than ever, kids, make sure you are turning to credible sources. I miss you.",2020-04-19 17:27:05,,

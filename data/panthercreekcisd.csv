Congratulations and good luck!

My name is Shila Woodcox. My love for animals has always played a major role in my life. I’ve always wanted to help and care for all I could no matter the breed. My mother would ask what I wanted to be when I grew up, and when I said a Vet Doctor who helps exotic animals, she always said she could tell it would have to do with animals. I will attend college online for the first semester. Following college, I will have achieved a degree in Veterinary and as a Marine Biologist. I am excited to see my hopes and dreams come to life. The future is endless with possibilities.



I would not have been able to accomplish this much in my life without the help of my parents, family, teachers, counselor, principal, and the remaining faculty and staff at Panther Creek. The love and warmth I have been shown, has strengthened me as a person, and given me the desires and drive to reach for the stars.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2857311197637633&id=363460693689375,,0.0,"Senior Spotlight!!

Parents and Guardians:

As we navigate through these circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 spread, students will be receiving all assignments online. A Google classroom has been created for your student with information on each assignment to be completed. Google Classroom can be accessed via https://classroom.google.com/ or the Google Classroom App can be downloaded on any smartphone, iPad, etc.

Each student has been invited to their respective Google classroom using their school email address. All assignments for each class will be completed on iCEV. Click the link in the Google classroom to login to iCEV. If students are enrolled in multiple courses, please have them complete the assignments for each course. If they need their password reset or need their login information, please contact me as soon as possible. Thank you for working with us during this confusing time, and thank you for your continued support of our district.

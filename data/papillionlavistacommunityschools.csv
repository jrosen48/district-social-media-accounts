A parent nominated him and described him as an outstanding art teacher, especially during remote learning.

“Mr. Blevins did not give his students the idea that honing their art skills was any less important than math or English. Mr. Blevins gave students meaningful, interesting assignments and provided feedback,” this parent said.

The parent explained that Mr. Blevins lessons gave her daughter a significant morale boost during a time of isolation and anxiety.

“She was encouraged to think in a different way and use her creative mind which gave her something to look forward to and improved her mood (much needed!). Mr. Blevins demonstrated greatness during a time when it would have been easy and even understandable for him to do less,” she said.

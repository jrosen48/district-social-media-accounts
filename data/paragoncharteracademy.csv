Dear Paragon Families,

You may have read/seen Governor Whitmer’s news report last night regarding upcoming, statewide school closures (from March 16th through April 5th) as a prevention measure to guard against Coronavirus. Many of you have connected with me to share your concerns about what our school is planning to do.

To provide some clarity while we finalize our closure plans, I am writing to confirm that school will be open today, Friday March 13th, for a full day of school. We plan to have a regular learning day with breakfast and lunch service for our students. Having school today allows families time to make arrangements for the days/weeks to come and also for students to gather their personal belongings from school and take them home.

We are working today to outline specific next steps for our families. Our goal is to ensure that learning opportunities are available for students during the closure. These next steps will be coming as soon as possible.

Thank you for your ongoing support of Paragon.

Sincerely,

Ben Kriesch

I just want to brag a little bit about how much I LOVE Halena’s schools drop off/pick up routine. Not only do they require you to have a card with your child’s specific numbers on it to be able for them to be dismissed but they also help them to and from the car if you choose to use the drive up lanes (super helpful on days when you have your other littles with you or still have bed head and don’t want to embarrass your child 😂) and help them on their way to class. Everyone at this school has been amazing, so welcoming and SUPER friendly to the children which is HUGE for some first timers.

Work in progress!... Adjusting to a new schedule that involves life at home with your kids and finding the right balance will take time. Good days and bad days will be had. •
Maybe you and your child thrive on keeping a set schedule with lesson plans or maybe you feel like you are just surviving! The most important thing is figuring out what works for you and your child(ren).
•
We are trying to find balance by incorporating a variety of activies each day that allow us to create, connect, move, work, sing, dance, read, and PLAY! I loosely plan a few structured activities around these categories for each day. This is helping us, mostly ME, because *I just can't* ""play cars"" and ""talk like cars"" all day and maintain my sanity! 🙃

Giving choices! 📚
✔️Encourages spontaneous word use
✔️ Models and reinforces vocabulary
✔️ Teaches reciprocal communication
•
The many benefits of using choices throughout your daily routines! Did I mention that choices can also help avoid power struggles and give your child the illusion of being in control? 😉🤣 If your child is saying a few words, they are ready for choices. Hold up an item in each hand and show them the choices as you say them. ""Do you want the apple (hold out apple) or the banana (hold out banana)?""

Replace ""IF"" and ""WHEN"" with ""FIRST, THEN""!
•
Your toddler is still learning language, so keep it simple to help them be more successful.
•
❎If you don't wash your hands, you can't have snack.
❎We can eat snack when you wash your hands.
✔️ FIRST wash hands, THEN eat snack.
•
This is a great strategy for teaching follow through on a less desirable task prior to doing a highly preferred task.
•
Here are some that I use daily:
First put on shoes, Then go outside.
First, wash hands, Then eat snack.
First brush teeth, Then read books.

Ninety percent of a child’s brain growth occurs during birth and 4 years of age, which is why it's so important to read to your child from the time they are babies.

Reading will also help create a bond between you and your child, so find opportunities to read every day. You don't need much preparation. Setting aside 5-10 minutes each day will be enough to make a big difference in your child's life!

For 4 and 5-year-old children, the understanding of books goes much deeper. A good strategy to keep in mind is to ask them to talk about any topic they would like to. Listen to what they have to say and follow up with questions. Ask too for them to describe details.

Remember to point out pictures after reading the text, as children often use the content within pictures to respond to questions, instead of words. Provide clear, simple visuals to support vocabulary learning.

There are individual differences in how children engage with books, but 1-year-olds tend to be more responsive, particularly if they have been read to since they were infants and have had positive experiences with books.

A pattern of daily reading over time is related to language and cognitive development. Make it a habit to dedicate part of the day to something related to books; either read them or simply play with them. Anything counts!

Sometimes it's challenging to know exactly what your child should be doing at any given age.

For newborns, is important you cuddle with them while you read so they feel safe, warm, and connected to you.

Sing nursery rhymes, make funny animal sounds, or bounce older toddlers on your knee. Show that reading is fun and make sure to use different expressions.

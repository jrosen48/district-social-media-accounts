When considering making a plan for your money, it is important to review as many ideas possible so you can make the right decision for your family. James Schenck with Fox Business shares these suggestions on stimulus money:

1. If you are still working and you don't have enough money in your emergency fund to support your family for 3 months, place your stimulus money into your emergency fund.
2. If you are still working and you have 3 months of expenses saved in your emergency fund, use your stimulus check to stimulate the economy and support your favorite businesses. You may also find low refinance rates on homes and cars. Call and negotiate.
3. If you are out of work, use your check to cover your family's basic essentials. Make sure to apply for unemployment if applicable.

His direct, individual instruction demonstrated the significant preparation he put into his lesson planning and was delivered in a tone that showed caring and understanding.

Attention Stillwater County!

Updated Health Order
Re: Extension to Length of Duration.

Please acknowledge the Updated Health Order which includes the increased length of the order to coincide with Governor Bullocks Shelter-in-Place.

While Montana has reached a current number of 365 confirmed positive Covid-19 cases, Stillwater County remains at 1 confirmed positive case. On a national level, our country has doubled in number of positive covid cases in the last 8 days. Additionally, our U.S. deaths have increased by 11,000 in a short 8 days.

Given the above information, it is imperative that we work as a community to continue to work towards slowing the curve and slowing the spread. Continue practicing social distancing, constant hand washing and hand sanitizing, and utilizing curb side pick up and delivery for your essential needs.",0.0,"Stillwater Billings Clinic

PROM INFO",6.0,"School administrators and Prom committee members from Absarokee, Bridger, Park City, Roberts and Fromberg met today and made the collective decision to cancel the 2020 Prom. (Belfry was unable to attend) Unfortunately, due to continuing concerns surrounding the COVID-19 virus and in compliance with Federal and State directives, including the Governor's request to “Stay Home"", we’ve been forced to arrive at this decision. It is with heartfelt regret, but we believe that cancelling the Prom is in the best interest of our students and communities at this time.

State Convention Postponed!!!

After careful and substantial consideration regarding the impact that the coronavirus has and will continue to make, it has been determined that the best option is to suspend the 2020 State FFA Convention and CDE Days in Great Falls until further notice. This decision was made by representatives from the Montana FFA Association, MSU Ag-Ed Department, Montana Board of Trustees and the Montana FFA Foundation. This is obviously heartbreaking news and something that is unprecedented. At this point we were most interested in getting the word out to everyone. Currently, no plans are in place on the best way to move forward. Please wait to hear from state administrators regarding potential solutions.

Good Morning - PRAHS!!!!

It is Tuesday, April 13th and the hunt is on! You have a week to find as many #WorldofHearts and #BetheLight displays as you can.

The quest is simple - see a display, make a tally. Turn in the total number of displays you found to either Mrs. Schroeder or Mrs. Walsh by Tuesday, April 21st. Take a picture of the display you like the most and send it to either Mrs. Schroeder or me by Tuesday, April 21st. You cannot pick your own.

The displays can be on public buildings, businesses or private residences.

Remember - the goal is to get out of the house, practice social distancing and see the support in our community.

Still want to make a display? It is not too late, pick your spot (door, window, lawn,etc) be creative and get to work. There is still time!

Hope you had a good Easter weekend and ready to get back to work!

This book is about a bad seed. A baaaaaaaad seed. How bad? Do you really want to know? He has a bad temper, bad manners and a bad attitude. He's been bad since he can remember! This seed cuts in line every time, stares at everybody and never listens. But what happens when one mischievous little seed changes his mind about himself, and decides that he wants to be- happy?

A big thank you to RDO Frozen/Lamb Weston for their continued collaboration with the PREAF for our recent Community French Fry Sale. We are very thankful for their generous donation of potato products and transportation of products to the sale. And we are especially grateful to the community and to all those who attended and supported our event. Thank you to all who purchased potatoes, as all money raised from the sales goes directly to the PREAF and are allocated to educational, fine arts, and athletic programs in the Park Rapids Area Schools. Thank you to R&R Rental for your donation of your forklift for the entire day at the sale. And thank you to the many students, teachers, coaches, and parent volunteers who helped at the event.

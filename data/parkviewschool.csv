Parkview Elementary School 3rd graders welcomed PHL17's Ashley Johnson and illustrator artist, Maria Iannone, to unveil ""Just Us"", a book written by our own Mr. Hernandez, and narrated by our own Miss Peterson. “Just Us” is the 5th book Mr. Hernandez has published and the third book Miss Peterson narrated. Our students were able to ask the 8th grade illustrator questions about her art work. Students also shared their opinion of the book.

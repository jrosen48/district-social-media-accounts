I have heard from a few people about concerns with activities postponed for Monday, August 10th. In an effort to make sure Admin, the board and staff are all on the same page I wanted to delay one day.

The District's goal is to get students back into activities and back into classes. The decision to delay was mine, as I wanted to get everyone on the same page and will send out information to parents tonight after the board meeting so there are not varied sources of information going out.

I would ask for patience and understanding, as we make sure to have the best plan and consistent information moving forward.

Dear Parents,

NOTE THE CHANGE DUE TO WEATHER PREDICATIONS...Our final pick-up and delivery day for this strange ending school year will be Thursday, May 21. We are sad not to have a different kind of closure to the year, but will make the best of what we can do while maintaining the health and safety of everyone.

We will have pick-up and delivery according to alphabetical groups by family last name. All teachers will be here, spread out appropriately to send your children off for the year. So, please bring your kids if you can. We will have you stay in the car and move through the line to the different grade levels to get any items and turn things in.

9:00 – 10:00 am A - F

10:00 – 11:00 am G - L

12:00 – 1:00 pm M - R

1:00 – 2:00 pm S – Z

Please do your best to arrive during these window times. If you are not able to come this day, you are welcome to stop by the school any day during office hours through May 29.

Parma Residents! I have a favor to ask of you. Would you be willing to ""donate"" your front yard for a couple of hours on Saturday May 23 to a Parma Graduate? I would like to put together a Drive-By Open House for our kids. I know that most of the after-graduation celebrations have been put on hold due to the current social distancing instructions. I thought that we could station a graduate at various places throughout town, and well wishers could drive by and congratulate them. There might be some decorating done by some of the families (that will be cleaned up by the graduate's family). Also, I would like to put together a map to distribute (so your address will be printed). If you are willing to donate your front yard for graduation, please private message me with your address and phone number and I will try to match you up with a graduate. Please contact Angela Shaw.",0.0,"Angela Shaw

Our buses will depart our middle schools at 1:00 P, reaching their after school stops between 1:10 and 1:50 P. Then, they will depart their elementary schools at 2:00 P, reaching their stops between 2:10 and 2:50 P. Our bus drivers miss their students and hope many will visit them at their normal after school stops this Friday.
Thank you for your time this evening! Remember families, when you think of our Parma Schools, the best is yet to come!

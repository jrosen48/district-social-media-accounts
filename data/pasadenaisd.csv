On Wednesday night, Dobie High School held a car parade to honor the Longhorn Class of 2020. Led by the parade’s Grand Marshall Dr. DeeAnn Powell and Dobie Principal Franklin Moses, the school converted the student parking lot into a four-lane street using parked vehicles. The future graduates paraded through the lanes as teachers, administrators, family and friends cheered them on.

Seniors decked out the exterior of their vehicles and drove through the parade route. At the end of the parade, seniors picked up their caps and gowns as they smiled and beamed with joy. That age-old Dobie pride was certainly on display last night and we hope it continues until the finish line. Congratulations

Pasadena ISD Family,

As I sit at my desk typing this, I am reminded of how difficult this pandemic has been for so many of us. This is usually a very busy time of year when I would personally attend as many award ceremonies, end-of-the-year banquets and fun celebrations that I possibly could fit into my calendar. I miss our students and our staff and no matter how busy I stay, I find myself thinking about the laughs, the hugs and the recognitions of achievement that we are all missing. One thing I refuse to give up is our plan to celebrate our Class of 2020. Please know we are moving forward with our plan to celebrate our seniors in July in whatever safe and permissible format that is allowed at that time.

Pasadena ISD Class of 2020, we are so proud of you for staying focused and staying strong throughout this pandemic. We decided to do something special to recognize our resilient senior class. We have created customized Facebook frames for each high school for our students, proud parents and community members to upload to their Facebook profile so everyone across the district and the Houston area can see our PRIDE in the Pasadena ISD graduating seniors. Please click this link to view the instructions to upload the Class of 2020 frame through Facebook. https://www1.pasadenaisd.org/departments/departments_c-_e/communications/social_media/facebook_frames

As we approach the end of the year, I want to inform you that Summer School this year will be virtual and information will be provided by each campus. Kindergarten through fourth grade will focus on small groups of children who have gaps in their reading and math skills. Students enrolled in Personalized Learning in grades 4-12 will complete focus areas and projects, while grades 5-12 will continue current course work and recovering failing grades from the first semester. Initial credit will also be offered for high school students. Registration information will be provided by campuses next week.

Looking ahead, we will be offering full-day Pre-K online registration for the 2020-2021 school year starting next week. Information will be posted on our district website. I ask each of you to check our district website and social media outlets for updates on a regular basis. Campus social media is also a great way to stay informed regarding information specific to your child’s campus.

I know there are many questions about returning library books, devices and other items at this time. Guidance about handling the safe return of these items and all end-of-the-year procedures and plans for the summer have been developed by each campus and these plans will be shared very soon.

In closing, I just want to encourage everyone to FINISH STRONG! We will continue to keep you updated through social media, district and campus website and phone calls.

Take care and stay safe,

In the first edition, we honor Emilio De Los Santos, a Dobie High School graduate from the Class of 2008 and HOSA alumnus.

De Los Santos is an EMT with Republic EMS, a private ambulance service based in Texas. He has been aiding in the COVID-19 battle with his fellow first responders at America's ER in The Woodlands and Cypress, while also responding to medical emergencies in an ambulance.

Thank you, Emilio for your service. Our hearts are with this local healthcare hero.

Pasadena High School Bulldogs as you walked around campus have you ever taken the time to look at the murals on the walls? These works of art are the finished products of teams of senior class students in our Visual Arts and Design Academy - VADA. We think they make a great contribution to our campus.

Marshall Fundamental rising seniors Armond Davis (front left) Marshall Fundamental ASB Fundraiser Commissioner and Lyndsey Bailey (front center) are making a difference in the lives of young students who live in the Pasadena community. Both are working in a program hosted by the City of Pasadena - Public Agency and held at Victory Park that provides summer recreational programs to enrich the lives of young kids ages five to 12.

The program varies based on the site, however, all sites include movement and creativity as the students participate in various activities including sports, arts and crafts, recreational swimming, and fun field trips.

For our rising seniors it provides them the chance of giving back to the community, to model positive behaviors, and to earn income.

Thank you Armond and Lyndsey for making a difference in the lives of young people.

Through a series of small world connections a big deal connection was made between VADA class of 2020 student Brooklynn Alfred and NASA research mathematician Katherine Johnson.

Brooklynn was inspired by Mrs. Johnson's story and chose to honor her in an award winning design focused on heroes of aviation for the Hollywood Burbank airport. Katherine Johnson is an African-American mathematician whose calculations of orbital mechanics as a NASA employee were critical to the success of the first and subsequent U.S. manned spaceflight. Mrs Johnson's granddaughter shared the artwork created by Brooklynn with her, that moment captured in these photographs. Also pictured is the design which will be printed 26 feet tall and will hang on the Hollywood Burbank Airport tower this year. What an honor!

As part of the Pasadena Educational Foundation Outreach Volunteer initiative we welcomed volunteers from the TCS Education System whose task was to assist us on a project of our choice. The task selected was to paint and upgrade our Bulldog Baseball Diner.

Thank you to all the volunteers. We very much appreciate your support. Our group was one of five groups commissioned by Allison Pultz, the PEF Volunteer Coordinator for projects on four other PUSD school campuses.

You know what that means.
This week we celebrate Ms. Whipple in our #FeatureFriday!

Hi! My name is Cassondra Whipple. I am the High School/Middle School Office Manager here at Pipestone Area Schools. I also assist the athletic director with all things related to school activities. I am entering my second school year here at PAS, but have five years of office experience under my belt.

I have a son, Jaxson, who is three and a half years old. We have three dogsüêæ, many chickensüê•, and a couple fluffy kittiesüê±.

In my free time, I love being outside. Lately it has been landscaping projects, which includes a customized sandbox for my son. When I'm not working on my house or at school, I love spending time at my parent's farm or floating on the water in a kayak.

I graduated from PAS in 2014! The secretary I took over for was the secretary when I went to school!

PAS is home for me. I remember the impact that the secretaries had on my life, and now I get to be in that position, making school just a little more fun for each student that comes through the doors.

A BIG Thanks for all you do for kids! School social workers are a vital link in the school community. You not only counsel children, but staff as well.

You bring students, teachers and parents together to work towards understanding and success. You calm the disruptive child so the teacher can get back to educating, and you help kids prevent and resolve conflicts making the building a better place.

You are a voice for those kids and families who can't find the courage or words to express their needs. You connect parents with resources, and in some cases, coordinate educational and outside care to help families be less overwhelmed. And for some situations, you find resources for physical needs such as food and housing.

You support the school and the people in it- helping kids and teachers be ""ready to learn"" every day.

We are happy to have Toni Mathews on our team at PAS!

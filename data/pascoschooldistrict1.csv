April 27 Idea: BALLOON EXPERIMENT
Today's Staycation takes basic home supplies and performs a fun Science experiment. Watch how the combination of Vinegar and Baking Soda blows up a balloon.
A few side notes:
1. If you don't have a funnel you can make one by cutting the top off a water bottle. You will need to position it just right when filling the empty bottle with vinegar.
2. Don't overfill your balloon with baking soda because it will not go upright if there is still some left in it. One tablespoon may be enough.
3. Safety first, make sure to wear safety glasses and protect your surfaces when performing this experiment.
Most of all have fun with your kids and record it! We would love to see how this turns out for your family.

April 2 Idea: GOING ON A BEAR HUNT!
Join the Staycation Fun around the nation. Simply place a stuffed bear in a window of your home or business so when families go for car rides or walks during quarantine, they can hunt for bears!
For those of you with kids, let's turn this into a learning experience. Print our score card and walk around your neighboorhood with them, having them add up how many small, medium & large bears they find as well as other types of stuffed animals.
Have fun with your whole family while practicing social distancing!
Send photos to recreation@pasco-wa.gov so we can post in our comments.

On Thursday, June 11, we will be handing out variety boxes of fruits, vegetables, dairy, and chicken on a drive-thru basis at two locations. Each box will include fruits and vegetables, as well as cheese, butter, milk, and diced chicken.

The Farm Fresh Pop Up events are intended to help families who are struggling to put food on the table. The school district continues to work with local farmers who are willing to donate fresh fruits and vegetables to help the community.

The locations are:
• Fivay High School at 12115 Chicago Avenue in Hudson
• Wesley Chapel High School at 30651 Wells Road in
Wesley Chapel

The trucks are expected to arrive at the locations at approximately 8:30 a.m. Distribution will start as soon as the crews set up the delivery stations, and will continue until the boxes run out. We will practice safe social distancing and wear masks. We ask that members of the public remain in their vehicles. Just pop the trunk and we’ll do the rest.",2020-06-10 14:16:11,,

What is your role in Pasco County?

I am the second grade team leader/ facilitator at Chasco Elementary School.

What do you love about your job?

I love watching the students build their confidence and self-worth. They change their mindset from “I can’t” to “I will.”

Who or what inspires you?

My mother has always been my source of strength and perseverance. She has shown me it is not about how many times you fall but rather about how many times you get back up.

Tell us something unique that people may not know about you.

I have quite the eclectic range of hobbies from fishing, to theatre and everything in between.

What is your role in Pasco County?

I am the Plant Manager at Lacoochee Elementary School.

What do you love about your job?

I love the little smiles, high fives, and"" Mr. Lopey"" hugs from the students. At Lacoochee we are a family!

Who or what inspires you?

My family inspires me! I am a former student of Lacoochee Elementary School. Dr. Renee Sedlack, former LES principal, has always inspired me to be the person I am today. My grandmother, who drove a school bus for thirty years, always pushed me to never give up and focus on my personal goals.

Tell us something unique that people may not know about you.

What people don't know about me is that I have a dream to create a Fishermen mentorship program for children.

What is your role in Pasco County?

I am the Plant Manager at Lacoochee Elementary School.

What do you love about your job?

I love the little smiles, high fives, and"" Mr. Lopey"" hugs from the students. At Lacoochee we are a family!

Who or what inspires you?

My family inspires me! I am a former student of Lacoochee Elementary School. Dr. Renee Sedlack, former LES principal, has always inspired me to be the person I am today. My grandmother, who drove a school bus for thirty years, always pushed me to never give up and focus on my personal goals.

Passaic Elementary Arts and Science Charter School holds an annual Art Show every April. Unfortunately, this year we can’t all be together like usual, so we will have a virtual Art Show instead!

Art Show Link: https://youtu.be/67YI7z0gzL4

Students were asked to create anything they wanted and submit their work from home. This video is a collection of all the artwork that was submitted. Some of our teachers even created artwork of their own!

Please feel free to share the link with family and friends.

Thank you to everyone who participated.
I hope you enjoy the show!

With so many students learning from home, the critical question we face as educators today is: what does effective and productive distance learning look like exactly? Through distance learning, schools can continue making great strides forward with students for the future. In fact, with the right infrastructure and learning management systems in place, along with hotspots to allow all students Internet access from home, distance learning can still result in real learning. Without these systems already in place, continuing education at the same rate as before would be virtually impossible. Many schools across the country are struggling to provide the resources necessary for students to continuously be challenged in meaningful and measurable ways from home.

Always striving to stay a step ahead and prepared for any hurdles thrown its way, iLearn Schools was thankfully ahead of the curve and prepared for such a challenge.

Dear iLearn Schools Community,

Amid a rise in hate crimes around the country, including the recent attack in Jersey City, it is more important than ever we work to ensure all of our schools and all of our students are safe.

Unfortunately, NJDOE's proposed rules for school security funding for all public schools inexplicably excludes public charter schools. This means that public charter schools are singled out as the only schools in New Jersey being denied access to critical security funding grants. We need to collectively TAKE ACTION in order to get this fixed.

We need YOUR HELP to get NJDOE to reverse this position and give public charter schools access to the funding that they deserve!

CLICK THE LINK IN THE COMMENT SECTION BELOW to send an email to the Governor's Office, Department of Education, Legislative Leadership and your local legislators so that our students are protected.

Thank you for taking the time to do this for your children!

Parents,

Keep up the good work! THANK YOU for taking care of our community’s children and teachers and helping us slow the spread of COVID-19 by keeping your children home when they have symptoms, test positive, or are in close contact with someone who is positive. Our students are notifying us if they know something as well. We are in this together! If we want to have a great year, we must protect each other.

REMINDER: Please do NOT send children to school who have symptoms and are sick; allow them to attend online.

Today, we watched the Governor's update on reopening schools. We will continue forward with our plan to have school using our Wade-In approach. Families who would like to choose the online option may do so at any time by notifying the principal. As you can imagine, this has been a very difficult decision with information changing daily. We intend to do everything in our power to keep our students and staff safe. We need your help. Please keep your child at home if you, your child, or a close family member has symptoms or has been diagnosed with COVID-19. Below you will find how we will notify families of cases in our schools; we will not use social media to notify families. If we need to close a class or a school, we will do so for a minimum of a two-week period.

Next Tuesday, July 14, after the school board meeting, we will announce our reopening plans for the upcoming school year. We know there is no one way that works for every family. Hence, we look to give families two options from which to choose. This year it will take us continuing to work TOGETHER AS A TEAM to keep our students and staff safe.

Tonight, we conducted our first parent workshop. Each Wednesday we will have a session designed especially for our families. Sessions that deal with our students’ mental health and our new learning management system are up next. We will share links early next week. Sessions typically begin around 4:30 pm. They will be posted on our website for your review a few days after each session.

ITS REGISTRATION TIME!! If you have not registered your children for school, please do so to help us plan our resources and get our Pirate learning packs together.

You have been amazing and supportive through all of this! We love our families and staff! We miss our kids! Thank you for your input and ideas. We will safely move ONWARD TOGETHER!!",5.0,"Pass Christian Schools

Thank you for completing the parent survey! Together with ideas taken from it and stakeholder groups (parent, student, teacher, admin, & business leader) we have developed a frequently asked questions (FAQ) document to address questions you may have about the reopening of school. We realize that 100% may not agree with our responses; however, we want to be as transparent as possible to allow families to make informed decisions. Families will also receive a memorandum this weekend with information regarding the FAQ as well to allow us to reach those who may not have social media. After reading the document, if you have questions, please email support@pc.k12.ms.us. We will address your question and possibly add it to the FAQ.

Pirate Nation,

Our school year has officially come to an end! What a year! It was filled with many amazing memories that COVID-19 will never take from us and many new memories that were made in spite of it.

We have proven how powerful our commitment to excellence is through our partnerships with families and community. Commendations are in order for our teachers, parents, admin team, support staff, and community members for a job well done. We are especially proud of our Pirate Learners for leaning into this situation to keep learning. Having thrived through this together, we will all be stronger for it!

We do not know what next year will bring; yet, we are making plans to make it special. As soon as our state health officials provide more guidance, we will share our final plans. Stay safe and have an awesome summer! We love you!",3.0,"Pass Christian Schools

Savanna: I loved the cooking challenge because I got to spend time with my mom by myself which is hard with younger siblings.

Abbygail: Finding a recipe was fun because I learned how to cook with my mom and now I know how.

Joseph: I enjoyed the cooking challenge because once you get really good at it, it's a life skill that no one can take from you.

Pirate Learners have been participating in a Life Skills Challenge this week. One of the 9-12 challenges was to send an encouraging text to someone and let them know you are thinking about them. Here is what our Pirate learners had to say about this task:

Alyssa: I enjoyed seeing everyone's responses to my texts because in today's world, you don't see a lot of positivity.

Cameron: It's always good to check on people to see how they are doing because you never know what someone is going through at the time and your words of kindness and encouragement could possibly save a life.

Nyjah: The most enjoyable skill was kindness because some people need that one bit of kindness in their lives.

Stay tuned for more #piratelifeskillschallenge posts! Pirate learners, complete the challenge by Friday, May 22nd to be entered into a gift card drawing!",3.0,"Pass Christian Schools

I can’t believe this happened today ❤️😭 my baby girl got to go to school today, put on her cap and gown, see her teachers, get some love and graduate from pre-K. It’s not the graduation ceremony I’d envisioned but it was made so much sweeter under our current situation.

Clip of the week!

Why do we persist with serving and delivering meals even in the midst of a pandemic? Here is why!

Why is our district so special? Here is the reason!

Our children recognize that our school staff is extending themselves and missing them that they give what they have to give - love! We miss our children and each other so much!

Hats off to our child nutrition team, transportation, admin, and faculstaff for demonstrating your love for our children.",0.0,"Pass Christian Schools

April 30 at 8:45 PM · Pass Christian, MS ·

These past two days have been such a whirlwind of emotions for me. I want to thank all of my teachers (especially those that wrote me a letter!), these scholarship organizations, and my community for continuing to push me to strive for excellence. There are no words to describe how thankful and grateful I am for all of this, but what more is there to say than that the Pass Christian School District is truly like no other. The time and effort being put into making our senior year so special, in spite of COVID-19, is proof that the Pass Christian Schools are 100% dedicated to their students. During this crazy time, they have given us a reason to smile because of their continued efforts to give us the happy ending that we all want and deserve. This year has been nothing short of a wild ride, but thank you again Pass High for making our Senior Awards Night and Sensational Senior Day still possible. One more thing, congratulations to my fellow classmates on all your accolades!! Class of 2020, this one’s for us!! #WeArePirateStrong ❤️",2.0,"Jimmy Hoang is feeling thankful at Pass Christian High School.

SPRING BREAK IDEA: Since we should only go out for essentials such as food/meals, medical needs, work, etc., we encourage you to check out all of the drive through/curb side services in Pirate Nation. Our business owners have strongly supported our schools. Let’s continue to return the love. Stay safe! #piratestrong",3.0,"Pass Christian Schools

What can Pirates do during spring break for fun? Read a book and share your review to encourage others to try it.

Drake has a good idea! #piratesread

Today is Fabulous Friday, and today we engaged in learning through play, go noodle, IReady Reading and Math. We also logged into google classroom and completed assignments. We ended the week on a positive note understanding why we need to continue learning. I want to shout out to the Pass Christian School District and the awesome educators, who continue to provide quality education.",0.0,"Arlean Porche

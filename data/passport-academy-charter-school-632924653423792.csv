I attended Passport Academy for a short period of time because I got caught up in the streets. I loved the teachers there. Ms. Boyd and other members from Passport Academy were good to me.
However one day I was in the wrong place at the wrong time and I received consequences that took me away for a few months. Passport Academy still had my back and I was still able to get my school work done while I was away.
I graduated from a place that was not my choice but I earned my Diploma. I even got a chance to take pictures with Ms. Boyd and the principal because they came to that institution to support me on my graduation day.

Regrettably, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Passport Academy Charter School (PACS) is forced to announce the postponement of its graduation ceremony, originally scheduled for June 5, 2020. The school waited as long as we could to see if there was any way to keep the original graduation date.

You will still be OFFICIAL GRADUATES of PACS as of June 5th. And we are dedicated to the idea of holding an in-person graduation to celebrate the accomplishments of our seniors. As of today, our graduation date has been tentatively changed to July 2, 2020 at 6 P.M. at Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall on the University of Pittsburgh Campus in Oakland. Please note this graduation date is subject to further change based on the continued guidelines set forth by Governor Wolf and the Pennsylvania State Department of Education.

As a back-up plan, PACS has begun planning for a virtual graduation if we are unable to proceed with an in-person one. One way or another, we will keep our promise to you and celebrate the accomplishments of the PACS Class of 2020.

I can't believe I earned my High School diploma. I started High School in 2015 and I went through so many obstacles but I did it. 🥳PACS really supported me. They stuck by my side through everything. Some staff called and texted me every day. They did not let me quit.

I'm just a mom working my way through this crazy life, so that I can give my child the best of everything 👩‍👦. Graduation is not the end it’s the beginning. I plan on becoming a Math teacher. My diploma will give me the opportunity to be my best. I can't believe I did it y'all!!!

Yesterday there was an incident that occurred at a neighboring school. Unfortunately, a couple of our students were involved. At no time during this incident were the safety of our students in danger.

Every incidence that occurs with our students inside and outside of school we take seriously and reminds us of the importance of safety and security.

We want to assure our families and the community that our school is evaluating and updating our school safety plan. We continually learn and evaluate best practices to ensure the safety of our staff and students.

We appreciate your support as we work together as a community to maintain a safe environment. The safety of our students and staff is and will remain our highest priority. We take pride in our school and students despite mistakes that they may make. We are excited to be in our new location and look forward to showcasing our successes.

M.L.K Jr was a Civil Right Activist whose agenda was the Civil Rights of African Americans. However his agenda didn’t just benefit African Americans, but it triggered gains for nearly all marginalized groups.

The Great Birmingham Campaign led by M.L.K. was the catalyst for The Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Fair Housing Act of 1968.

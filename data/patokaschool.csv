Grades: All teachers should be updating grades to Teacherease often to ensure students know if there is work they need to make up or if they want to redo an assignment.

Finals: Unfortunately, we have decided to cancel finals for our junior high and high school students. We understand their disappointment by this news, but we assure you we plan on returning finals, with all the happiness and excitement they bring, next school year.

Breakfast and Lunches: These will continue to be delivered until at least May 22nd. We await further instruction from the state if they are to continue after that.

We're happy to answer any other current or future questions anyone may have. We are doing our best to get as much information as we can out to the students, parents, and community members. We may forget some details and such along the way, so please do not hesitate to ask because you may not be the only one wondering.

Hope everyone is staying safe.

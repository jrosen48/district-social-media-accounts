Back to School Bash DRIVE-THRU is scheduled for Tuesday August 25th from 5:30 - 7:00. This is for grades Preschool and 1st - 4th (Kindergarten is excluded because they have their own orientations). Please use this map as a reference guide. It shows where teachers will be set up and where the nurse station is located. It also highlights appropriate routes while on campus. This is an excellent opportunity for you and your child to meet their teacher while remaining socially distanced. Families can also drop off their school supplies or any items that still need returned from last school year (i.e. Chromebooks and chargers, Library books, teacher books, etc.). Also, if your child receives medication at school, we will have a Nurse Station where you can drop off medications for our nursing staff to store at school. Please take advantage of this quick ""meet and greet"" with your child's teacher as we move closer to the start of the new school year. If you have specific questions, please contact bhieber@phpatriots.org.",0.0,"Patrick Henry Elementary

Our first meeting for a first summer workout will be held tomorrow Friday June 12, at 9:00 AM on the high school track. Please remember to avoid congregating, bring a towel and personal water bottle. Tomorrow's workout will include drills, an introduction to ""Boot Camp"" for some,and a short run 20 to 30 minutes. After the workout I will ask each runner to take home a uniform to try on. I expect to be finished by 10:30 AM.

Also. If you haven't done so already please read the OHSSA guidelines for sport before coming to the workout.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY PATRIOT!!! üéÇ üéÅ üç∞

A year ago this special little soul made his appearance into the world. At first glance we knew something about him was ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù. What we didn‚Äôt know is the gravity of how he would impact and inspire those around him.

We were criticized for keeping him alive. People thought that we should ‚Äúput him out of his misery‚Äù and that we were ‚Äúselfish and cruel for keeping him alive‚Äù.

There are many things I don‚Äôt know, but the one thing I DO know with all my might is that everything happens for a reason. And I know that every day with this little guy is a gift.

Congratulations on your first trip around the sun little buddy! And here‚Äôs to many more days of spreading hope and happiness to all you meet! üá±üá∑üíôüê¥

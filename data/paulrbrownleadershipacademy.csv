All cadets entering 7th grade are required to have Tdap and Meningitis vaccines. HPV vaccine is also recommended for rising 7th graders. In addition, a new N.C. law now requires rising 12th graders to have a booster dose of the Meningitis vaccine. As required by law, these cadets must have these vaccines within 30 days of starting school.

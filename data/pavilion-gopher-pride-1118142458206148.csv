We are thrilled to announce that the 2020 Outstanding Early Career Teacher and the recipient of the Teacher Turn the Key Award is KYLIE SMITH.

Kylie is the agricultural teacher at Pavilion Central School in Western New York. She ensures that her classroom provides a safe environment for all students, regardless of background or intellectual ability, to receive a broad education in agriculture. To achieve this, she utilizes inquiry-base, hands-on learning to demonstrate the connections of the agricultural concepts to the real world to the students.

Congratulations Kylie and good luck representing New York at the Region 6 contest and have an amazing time at the 2020 Teacher Turn the Key Conference.

*The Outstanding Early Career Teacher Award is a means of encouraging young teachers to remain in the profession and to recognize their participation in professional activities.

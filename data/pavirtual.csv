Today begins National #TeacherAppreciationWeek, and we are so proud to feature a few teachers who are special to our supporters. These teachers have gone above and beyond for their students.

Here is what Natasha in Philadelphia had to say about Mrs. Freynik at PA Virtual Charter School, who makes sure her students are learning with technology:

""Our son, who is in first grade, just completed his first novel book report as well as a diorama to explain the components of a grasslands habitat. Both projects required oral presentations and she encourages students to take notes, preparing them with practical tools for work. He loves his teachers, especially Mrs. Freynik, and is fully engaged during classes.""

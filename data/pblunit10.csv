Front Porch Project

April 23 at 3:38 PM · YouTube ·

To say the Front Porch Project was a success is an understatement. For the past two weeks, Haley Stagen and I have been driving around snapping pictures of families outside of their homes. Some were funny, some were serious, but ALL were appreciated. We cannot say THANK YOU enough to everyone who participated. By allowing us to come to your home and take photos of your family, you were a part of something big for our community.

We started this project hoping to get 15-20 families involved and raise a few bucks for a great program. By the end, we had visited over 70 families (while keeping our distance), met so many wonderful people, and raised $2,500 for the PBL Backpack Program. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for making this such a cool project to be a part of! Enjoy this short slideshow of the wonderful people involved.

What a FUN night last night and assembly today! Thank you to everyone who helped in some way! So many to name!

Heart Healthy Night was a huge success because of all the awesome volunteers! Our community is awesome! And amazing high school students took time out of their Thursday night to hang out with us! So cool!

We gave away tons of prizes thanks to all the businesses in town who donated!

The kids found out Coldwell Banker Realty (Brooke M. and Kennedy W.) paid for the Paxton True Value bounce house for the WHOLE SCHOOL all day Wednesday as a reward for us reaching our goal! Woot woot!

Finally, these two got to throw pies in Barry and Amanda Styck face today! So happy I work with awesome people willing to do anything for the kids!

Jill Evans, Regional Director with Maco Management, donated backpacks to Poplar Bluff JR High. Poplar Bluff Villas sponsored the backpacks as part of their back to school bash that was given to the residents last week. The back to school bash provided dinner for the families, playing water games outside with all of the residents and having tons of fun! Poplar Bluff Villas then gave every student there a new backpack filled with supplies needed to start school and wanted to keep paying it forward.
The Poplar Bluff Villas is a newly constructed 48 unit community located at 2301 Eugene Blvd in Poplar Bluff. Meredith Wiggins, District Manager for our Poplar Bluff and surrounding areas, takes much pride in her properties and couldn’t be prouder to have one of many of her properties pay it forward to PB residents and the school community.

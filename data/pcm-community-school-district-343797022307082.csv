PCM Parents,

Starting Tuesday, May 26th from 12pm to 7pm, High School students will begin turning in computers for the summer. Students will park in the main lot. Volunteers will guide a safe amount of students to a line that will keep everyone six feet apart next to the new learning center. Once inside, we have six cleaning stations placed 10 feet apart. Students will clean their computer and charger. During this time, a volunteer will check in all pieces of equipment. Students must have their computer, charger, and bag. Cleaning stations will be wiped down after every student visit. The schedule below will determine the day you are to report for turn in.

Seniors - Tuesday May 26th from 12pm to 7pm

I am saddened to share that Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds announced that Iowa schools will now be closed for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year.

More updates and information will be shared early next week regarding our plans for the rest of this school year.

Announcements regarding spring activities will most likely be made later today from the various Iowa activity and athletic governing agencies. A decision regarding summer activities and athletics will be made at a later date.

On Saturday, March 14th , 2020, Prairie City Police Department, Jasper County Sheriff’s Office, and the PCM School District will conduct a rescue task force mock exercise. School staff, Fire, EMS and Law Enforcement responders will practice the response utilizing Rescue Task Force Principles and the National Incident Management System. The exercise will take place at Prairie City Elementary School and the PCM Middle School site. The exercise will start at 8:00am and end at 12:00 noon.

The purpose of this exercise is to evaluate response procedures to active shooter incidents. The Information
reinforced and lessons learned from this exercise will be used to revise RTF policies and procedures as needed and
implement them countywide.

We will need fifteen to twenty student and adult volunteers for this event. Please contact Kim Pettyjohn at

The Love, Jordan premiere was an incredible success! I’m happy to say that I held a role in bringing this story to life. What started out as an idea became an emotional project that has sparked conversation and hope for change. I’ve already heard several amazing stories about how this premiere, and the conversations that sparked from it, have actually helped people! This topic is something that hits me close to the chest and I’m beyond excited that it made such an impact. It’s one thing to say we make content; it’s another to say we make content for change.

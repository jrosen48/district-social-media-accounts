Happy Moment Alert!

Have you seen the video of the principal and teachers of Clarks Creek Elementary to their students? You’ve got to see it! Soon after that video was posted, we were asked to help students surprise their teachers with a video to show how much they miss school. We are so very proud of our community and especially all our teachers for all they do…Enjoy the video!

If your child would like to send a note to their teacher, no matter the school district or school, post it in the comments below! If you would like to share photos directly with Clarks Creek, use their album here: https://photos.app.goo.gl/o49GmQi9JJg9pKBt6

My name is Nolan Birke, I am 12 years old and I've been a Riley kid since I was born. It would mean a lot to me if you would make a donation to support the world's first Dance Marathon created with toys!

I created a video and fundraiser in honor of my friend Jack Moon, who was recently diagnosed with cancer. I am hoping to raise $2,500 for Riley Hospital for Children, the hospital that helped both Jack and me.

I was born with clubfoot and needed complicated surgeries on my feet and legs. My Riley surgeons did such a great job that today I am a competitive track and cross country runner for my school teams! My dad also works for Riley Children's Foundation so our whole family gets to see how donations are used to help Riley kids like me every day.

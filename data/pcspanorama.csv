We have received word from our publisher that unfortunately the 2020 Panorama delivery date will be delayed. Our book is scheduled to ship on August 1st.

The yearbook is submitted and printed in increments throughout the year. Due to the Covid 19 virus the printing process was halted for several weeks. The plant is now printing books again but due to social distance guidelines they have to work with a much smaller staff. Our publisher has always been very reliable but they are overwhelmed with thousands of books to print and ship and are understaffed.

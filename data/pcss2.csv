Parent teacher conferences will be held on Thursday February 6th from 12:45pm until 5:45pm. Teachers will have a short break from 3:05pm until 4:05pm. There will be absolutely no parent meetings during this time. If you are planning on attending the parent teacher conferences, please use the SignUPGenius link provided in this email to choose a time slot to meet with teachers.

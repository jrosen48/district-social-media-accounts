Today begins Teacher Appreciation Week, and we just had to show our folks how much we appreciate them, which is hard to do when you're not together. So we did a drive through lunch for all our staff, sponsored by our PTA and admin! We also had a yard sign for some pics to document this day. We love our staff and couldn't be more proud of them, especially over the last month and a half! They are ESSENTIAL and are the BEST! ❤️❤️❤️ #socialdistancinglunch #crystalhillredjackets

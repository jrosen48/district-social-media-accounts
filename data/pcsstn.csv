Sometimes there are serendipitous moments when our WOW team just looks at one another and says, “WOW”. The Magic Treehouse book, Tornado Tuesday, was in a random tote of books we carried into Northeast Elementary on Friday. Coincidence, maybe. Serendipitous, at the least.

Some just haven’t found their favorite book yet.” Good books, fiction and nonfiction do more than develop comprehension skills and build vocabulary. Compassion, empathy, problem solving, imagination, and curiosity, are just a few thinking and social/emotional skills and goals we all have for our children. Good books and subsequent conversations with a child! ...And I just don’t believe the “Face in a Phone” method replaces it. #putnamstrong #read20 #putdownthephone",2.0,"Barbara Greeson is with Jim Greeson and 3 others.

Kids in the care of Putnam County School System on Thursday and Friday were engaged in any number of planned, fun activities while parents worked, while parents volunteered to help with tornado relief, or because their homes and lives had been disrupted by the storm.

The uncertainty of this morning’s forecast creates concern for transporting students safely to and from school today. While the approaching system may amount to little, if any, accumulation, I am concerned about students being on the roads in buses or cars at the time the front is predicted to move through our area, especially in the higher elevations. Forecasts call for around 1” inch of accumulation of ice and snow beginning around 7:00 am and continuing through noon today.

Yesterday was National Police Woman Day. We are a day late in posting this, but we wanted to recognize Officer Mindy Fowler. She is currently assigned as one of our School Resource Officers for the Pea Ridge School District. Officer Fowler is an outstanding officer and really goes above and beyond to ensure our children are safe.

If you see Officer a Fowler, please let her know how much she appreciated. We most certainly do!

However, we’ve heard from a number of eligible families who either never got a card/benefits or didn’t get a card/benefits for all the eligible school-age students in their home, and we are working on getting those to you as quickly as we can.""

If your family is affected by this, please visit the link labeled at the top of the food services page.

Also, we want to encourage families to be periodically checking in to the district website for the most up to date information regarding district announcements and school details that you may need. This is our primary channel of publishing information so that everyone (including those not on social media) can find what they need. We also use email as a communication channel and redirect to the website, like we are doing here 👇🏼

Pea Ridge BLACKHAWKS go to Shiloh Friday, Aug. 28!
***
To all Blackhawk football fans, Shiloh is giving Pea Ridge 275 ticket vouchers to use for our football game Friday.
There will be NO walk up tickets at the gate for visitors. This will be the case for all away games this year. (Ticket numbers will vary at each away venue depending on their size)
Football program families will be given first choice for these vouchers. The remaining number of vouchers will be announced on Wednesday and then distributed on Friday at the School Admin building from 8 a.m. until they are gone. We are expecting very few left-overs for this game.

District leadership would like to clarify that Pea Ridge students have two options this year - Face to Face (using a blended approach) or Virtual. Face to Face will be in person with safety measures implemented and the capability to quickly pivot to online for reasons related to COVID. Virtual is online teachings and curriculum where your child will be learning new material and being instructed by Pea Ridge teachers.

Face to Face is the default for every student if the virtual enrollment form is not completed.

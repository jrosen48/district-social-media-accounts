This is a little picture book I made for my kids to explain why they can’t go to school or to see their friends like they normally do. So I made a little slide show. Please do share with anyone who has little ones that might not quite understand. The animal references come from the last article I saw explaining the origin of the outbreak. Also, pangolins may be the cutest animal I have ever seen.

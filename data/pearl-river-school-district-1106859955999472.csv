Another athletic update for clarification. Yesterday the governor gave some information about school sports in his press conference. His press release is attached to this post. This release is now being followed up with NYSPHSAA meetings today with Sectional Executive Directors and then the State Athletic COVID Task Force. After these meetings take place we will have further information about what the State is providing in terms of guidance about fall sports. Section One will also have some information that will be important to how and when fall sports may start. Once we have all this information we will communicate to the Pearl River community about fall sports and registration. I am hopeful that we will have this communication out to the community before the end of the week. Thank you for your patience.",0.0,"Pearl River Athletics

This was a hard earned achievement and great honor! Pearl River is the only club in three counties that brought Judicial members to the state conference. Teige Beaudry successfully argued his case to a panel of Justices, one of whom was Liam Fitzpatrick. Ciara Timoney and Marissa Anselmi were members of the Press reporting not only on the happenings of the conference, but also created insightful interviews of attendees.

There has been an outpouring of requests of what can be done to help the kids who won’t be able to show the livestock they raised for Houston Livestock Show that was canceled. Here is how you can help. Buy the animals. You can either choose to send the animal to processor to fill your freezer or you can donate the animal to the floor to be sold at market price and those monies will be divided equally to all exhibitors. If you don’t want to buy an animal, there are links to donate funds and all of the donated money will be divided equally to all student exhibitors as well. This gives Pearland FFA a way to presale all the livestock and give the kids a chance to show off all of their hard work. Actual show date will be determined once the school gets back to normal.

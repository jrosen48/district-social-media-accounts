In her words...

“I graduated from PHS, and I’ve taught in Pearl Public Schools for over 23 years. PHS is an awesome place to work, and I can’t imagine working anywhere else. The supportive administration and staff here are like no other. I must admit that it’s my extraordinary relationship with my students that make my days here so very special. I love interacting with each of them and it means the world to me when current and past students stop by to say hello and catch up. I learn more from my students than they would ever know. The PHS administration understands the importance of making connections with students, and they allow me to not only teach content knowledge but to also teach life lessons. PHS is truly one big family, and I’m a very blessed teacher!”

Our next PHS Spotlight is Mrs. Ashley Weems. She is the Department Chair for the Special Education Department. She mainly works with seniors, and she is a BIG reason for our Special Education graduation success.

In her words....

“From the moment I walked into PHS 20 years ago I have loved it here. There is just something about this place. You feel it the moment you walk through the doors. There is acceptance, determination, and pride. Our students are some of the most hardworking people I have ever encountered. The teachers are outstanding, and they take their jobs very seriously. The administration is supportive and understanding. I love that the people here are so invested in making this school one the top schools in the state. I love most of all that I get to be a part of it every day.”

In his words...

“Over the last 21 years, Pearl High School has become a second home to me. The family atmosphere here can be felt down every hall and in every classroom. The culture at PHS consists of excellence in education and a special connection between the staff, administration, and students. I couldn’t be more proud when I tell people that I am a Pearl Pirate. Here, education is intertwined with friendship, family, and encouragement. Pearl High School is more than a school; it is a way of life. It’s a pirate’s life for me.”

Our school is the focal point of our community. Families, businesses and community leaders are supportive both in educational and extracurricular activities.

In her words...

At Pearl, we do not rest until each individual within these walls is challenged, encouraged, and inspired. Everyone here has a chance to grow and be successful, and Pirates somehow never tire of lifting others on their shoulders. Students help other students; teachers help other teachers; teachers help students; and students help teachers. Whether you work here or are a student here, you are valued. It just does not get any better than that.

I love working at Pearl because of the acceptance and love that I have received. Once an individual is touched by Pirate hearts, he or she is forever changed. I would like to say thanks to all Pearl Pirates, past and present, for blessing my life.",0.0,"#WeArePearl

People always ask me what it is like to work here in Pearl and why we, as a family, made this our home. I think our first PHS showcase, Mr. John Craven, gives the perfect answer.

This guy right here has been my right hand man, a wonderful mentor, and a great friend since I walked in the door. He isn’t a man of many words, but when he does speak, people tend to listen. I think his words capture the essence of who we are, the storied history of our school, and the vision our teachers have created.

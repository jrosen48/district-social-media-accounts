We hope everyone is doing well and staying safe.

The PISD Board of Trustees approved two updates in regards to the 2020-2021 school year at a Special Meeting held on 06/24/2020.

The first update is in regards to the School Uniform Policy. Due to uncertainties with the 2020-2021 school year stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, the PISD Board of Trustees has waived the School Uniform Policy for the 2020-2021 school year. Students will still be expected to follow supplemental dress code expectations which will be outlined in the Student Handbook.

The second update is in regards to the 2020-2021 School Calendar. The PISD Board of Trustees approved an updated calendar to include 180 days of instruction. By including 180 instructional days, TEA will provide more financial support to districts to better support all students.

It was a heartwarming event with many children smiling, asking questions, and enjoying the cadets share such exciting stories. Such a program serves to motivate children to become avid readers and reinforces in cadets the desire to be excellent role models and responsible students themselves.

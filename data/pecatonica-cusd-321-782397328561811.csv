“Although I was only in FFA for one year I really enjoyed it. I had helped out in previous years with little things but this year I was officially a member. I enjoyed all the things I did with FFA but my favorite was when I went on the field trip to the Women in Agriculture Conference in March. The conference itself was very chaotic and exciting and the same could be said for the group of girls I was with. I’m sad that I was only part of FFA for a short period of time but I will still remember all the stuff I did and the things Mr. Schultz “taught” us.
In the fall I will be attending Highland and hope to move onto University of Stevens Point in 2020.” We’ll miss you Maggie! Wishing you the best of luck!💙💛💙",0.0,"Please enjoy the FFA Senior Tribute to Maggie Sager.

He truly has made an impact on every single kid that walked through those classroom doors. We can’t imagine FFA trips and activities without you.

As many of you know, tonight we will be turning on the football/track lights at 8:00 to honor our seniors who are missing out on the special time in their senior year. If you plan to attend below is the plan for the night.

Seniors with their immediate family can park in the parking stalls in the high school parking lot. Supporters can enter at either entrance (Remain in your cars).

If you come in the 12th street entrance, you will turn left past the baseball field, around the parking lot past the football field and exit onto main street in front of the high school.

The Ocean Cleanup is an organization that is looking for ways to develop technology to clean up our oceans. This week, the boys have begun the fundraiser portion of their competition and are asking for donations. The night of the pageant, they will take the stage and compete in the remaining 4 categories: formal wear, outfit of choice, talent, and question.
Last year the money raised went to The Children’s Miracle Network, with Pecatonica Key Club, the contestants, and the sponsors raising more than $5000!

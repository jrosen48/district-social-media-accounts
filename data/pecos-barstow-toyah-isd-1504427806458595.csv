I’ve known Joel since 1989 from our days at Angelo State. Joel is a hard working guy but DOES NOT like to be in the spotlight whatsoever (we may not be friends after this)! Joel has been at PHS for 24 years and 27 years altogether as an AT. He teaches a Sports Medicine class as well as a few PE classes and always has a staff of students eager to help him. Joel is a stand up, very humble guy, never says “no” to anything asked of him and is well deserving of this “shout out”.

Meet Barbara Spring | Text by Hannah Rawls | Longwood Student

Little 7-year old Barbara was about to enter first grade when the schools closed in 1959 in Prince Edward County, Virginia.

Spring (as one of a set of triplets) and her ten siblings were all shut out.

In 1963, she attended the Free Schools with her two brothers. Graduating from Prince Edward County Public Schools in 1971, she attended
Longwood University, then wanted to get into law enforcement.

In 1974, she was hired in Richmond as a police officer, later becoming the first black female firefighter in the city of Richmond, VA. Barbara served many years before retiring in 2004.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Governor Northam has closed all public schools until the end of the academic year. The Virginia Department of Education(VDOE) is working diligently with all school divisions to develop guidance for continuity of learning as well as to address the many questions related to this closing. VDOE is expected to have an in depth conference call tomorrow afternoon with all superintendents to further discuss options. Know that we will continue to support our families and community and will communicate information as readily as possible.

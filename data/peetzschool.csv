We are sharing this series of DIY, family-friendly projects that use ordinary household items to keep kids engaged and still learning. The projects are designed to spark creativity, foster friendly competition and create fun family moments during this challenging time.

We encourage you to share their project videos and pictures with Peetz School on facebooke and @DiscoveryEd and @TGRFound.

The first challenge is INVENT A VEHICLE -Develop a new vehicle for transporting hazardous waste. Share your pictures by Friday, April 24th. Visit http://tgreduexplore.org/families for details on this challenge and many more. We will have another one posted next week!",2020-04-22 12:45:32,,

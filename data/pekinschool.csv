Elementary open house is from 3:30 to 7:00 PM. By widening the time we hope to minimize the number of families in our building at a single time to be able to social distance.

7th grade open house is at 5:30 PM in the HS Commons. 9th grade open house is at 6:15 PM in the HS Commons. We ask that only 7th grade, 9th grade, and new families to the Junior High or High School attend the secondary open house at this time.

The school nurse will be set up in the elementary cafeteria to answer questions and provide you with any forms to be completed.

We still have many families that have not completed the e-registration process. Please register as soon as possible. In addition, if you have textbooks or classroom materials at home please return those to us so we can prepare for in person instruction.

We are moving forward with holding graduation outside at the track. If by chance we would need to move inside, the gym is set up to hold graduation. If that should occur each senior will be allowed to have 4 families members with them inside.

Please continue to follow social distance guidelines if you are coming to watch graduation at the track. We will be live streaming graduation on our Facebook page.

Our date for High School graduation is Saturday June 27th at 7:30 pm. Due to it being outside we needed to come up with some alternative dates if the weather doesn't cooperate. Our first rain date option would be Sunday June 28th at 7:30 pm. If it appears that rain is in the forecast for the entire weekend we would schedule graduation for Friday June 26th at 7:30 pm.

Our plan for graduation is to hold our ceremony outside on the football field. This will allow more members of our community to attend while still practicing social distancing.

We will share additional details of how we will practice social distancing with the community as we get closer to graduation.

Have a great day and Go Panthers!

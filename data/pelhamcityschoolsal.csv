It is unbelievably hard to describe the feelings that came over “the Ridge” today. From 11:00am-12:00pm, we smiled, waved, danced, blew kisses, caught flowers, and cried as we said “farewell” to our 2019-2020 school year! WOW...WHAT A YEAR! We were a BALL of EMOTIONS because we NEEDED to see those smiles! In an imperfect world, their smiles are pure PERFECTION and we ALL needed that today! Thank you PRES families for making the “close” of this year one WE will never forget. EVER.

To our teachers, words cannot express how grateful we are to have such a WARM, and CARING group of individuals who truly LOVE their students! Daily, we are amazed at your selfless acts and we THANK YOU!

NOW...SCHOOL’S OUT FOR SUMMER! We hope you have an AMAZING summer and we will look forward to seeing you for our 2020-2021 school year!

It’s the 100th day of school and we could not have been more excited about it! Our students and teachers had so much fun today from counting with marshmallows and chocolates, to building towers, to even turning themselves into 100 year olds! There were tons of learning stations in the classrooms and a hat parade given by 1st grade. The best part of this day was the act of kindness our students and teachers did for one of our students, Destiny, on her birthday! The outpouring of love from our PRES families and staff was simply AMAZING and we far surpassed our goal! And this is why WE ARE PELHAM!💚💛

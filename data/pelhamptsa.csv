Our Tiger Challenge event on Friday was a HUGE success and the students, staff and volunteers had so much fun. It was so great to see the students taking part in some friendly fitness based competition and team building. So many smiles and fun memories. 🐯💙
BUT.....the fundraising efforts fell short and we are below last year’s numbers. These funds help support field trips, activities and improvements to PMS.
We are hopeful that there are still some forms out there that haven’t made it in or some students who still may be working on fundraising. Below you will find a link to the sponsor form in case you need another.

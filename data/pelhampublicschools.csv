Sebastian and other school-wide winners from across New York State will now take a written test with the top 100 scorers advancing to the state competition in Albany.

Each year, all 6th, 7th and 8th graders participate in the bee in their Social Studies classes with each class winner advancing to compete for the school crown. In the competition, students are asked questions about different locations around the globe. Sponsored by the National Geographic Society, the experience is designed to inspire and reward students' curiosity about the world. Each year, thousands of schools across the United States participate in the National Geographic Bee, competing for college scholarships and the glory of being the National Geographic Bee Champion.

Curious about how much the property costs and how we will pay for it?

The negotiated purchase price for the property is $1.1 million. The Board of Education will use unassigned fund balance to pay the full cost, meaning that no borrowing is necessary and the purchase WILL NOT RAISE TAXES. Even though there is no tax increase, the state requires that acquisition of property be voted on by the public.

In negotiating $1.1 million as the purchase price for the property, the District:

Consulted with a local real estate agent to establish a projected list price
Reviewed list prices of similar properties and the seller’s asking price, and
Took into consideration the unique value the property has to the District

A certified appraiser also recently confirmed the value of the home to be $1.1 million.

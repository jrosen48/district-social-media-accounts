Tomorrow evening, Tuesday, July 21st from 6pm to 7pm, I will host a Public Discussion Zoom Meeting for families about the reopening planning in Pelham. The Zoom log in information was sent via email this afternoon.

The meeting will give me an opportunity to share the progress we have made thus far. It will also allow people watching to ask questions through a moderator. In the unlikely event that we have more than our maximum number of 300 people who want to attend, the meeting will be recorded so anyone will be able to watch it afterwards. We will use Zoom since I anticipate these gatherings could be larger than DHHS suggests at this time and many people may not be nearby due to summer plans. I hope to hear from many of you.

Thank you for your patience and your energy.

Below is a link to a brief survey. We ask that you fill out one per child and it is due by June 5, 2020. The purpose of the survey is two fold. The first purpose is to assess remote learning, its strengths, shortcomings, challenges, and successes. This will give us feedback on how to improve remote learning and gain a better idea of the needs of the community and students. The second purpose is to begin the planning for the fall and reopening. We are seeking responses to help plan and create the most successful and safe reopening. In order to do this, we need to take into account the needs of students, staff, parents, and the community. We do not know what the fall will look like, but we will continue to work hard in the planning for our students.

Survey responses will be taken until Friday, June 5. A link is below.

Good afternoon,

I hope everyone has the opportunity to enjoy this great weather on this long Memorial Day weekend. Just a quick reminder that meal deliveries will be Tuesday, May 26 and Thursday, May 28 due to the Monday holiday.

Even though the Memorial Day parades won't happen and the celebrating summer season bbq’s may not take place this year please, remember that Memorial Day wasn’t about celebrating or car sales. It is a time to honor the deaths of our fellow men and women who died in the service to our country. It is a time to have quiet, reflective thought on this ultimate sacrifice they gave in service to our country. This year provides us an opportunity to see past the typical celebrations and remember the intention of Memorial Day and pay respect to those who have died and recognize the sacrifices of their families. We honor them by remembering them. A huge thank you to all our Veterans who took that risk in order to serve our country.

Every two years parents and guardians of students with disabilities are asked to participate in a parent involvement survey through the NH Department of Education. Typically, these surveys are mailed out to parents, but as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic the surveys will be completed electronically this year. If you are a parent of a child who receives special education services we ask that you help us and the department of education to improve the supports and services provided by completing this survey. We hope that you will consider taking a few minutes to offer us this valuable feedback. The last day to complete the survey is May 19th, 2020.

Good afternoon,

Just a quick note about a free meal delivery service that we need your feedback on!
We have been working with our food service team, the bus company, state programs, and others to develop a remote meal delivery service for students in Pelham!
We are very excited about this and the ability to deliver food to students and families in our community in this time of crisis. Please see the attached flyer for more details and a short survey (almost painless, I promise) to fill out regarding this program.
A huge thank you to Kelly Rambeau our Food Service Director and Deb Mahoney our Business Administrator for all their work in making this program possible.

Thank you and have a great day!

170,16.0,,26.0,,2017049761675495,"Dear Pelham Community,

As of last night we had no intentions of an early release as after observing weather reports and participating in the superintendents call with the National Weather Service, the snow was not predicted to arrive until after dismissal around 5:00 p.m. giving us plenty of time to transport students home safely. This morning weather forecasters moved up the anticipated start time of this storm. It is now predicted to be in our area by 2:00 p.m. Dismissing early is one of the most challenging decisions as it is a huge inconvenience to parents to accommodate such a decision. However, the safety of the students is of the utmost importance to us and far out weighs the challenges to accommodate an early release decision. I wish to give families notice that this decision may be necessary to keep students safe and I wish for all parents to prepare for a possible early dismissal today.

If such a decision is made it will be made before 11:00 a.m. as the weather reports become updated.

Sincerely,
Superintendent Bill Furbush",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2017049761675495&id=156930081020815,,0.0,"Dear Pelham Community,

With a theme of “Paws for Reading,” Jefferson staff set up activities around the school in conjunction with the Buy one, Get one Free book fair. “We do this fair to get books in the hands of students at a discounted price, and adding the literacy activities allowed teachers to make bookmarks, play games, read with families, and have fun with students outside of the school day,” said Teacher Librarian Paula Winward. With the help of Pella Rolscreen and the literacy night volunteers we were also able to make sure every student that attended received a free book as well. We had over 70 families attend the activities and many more visited the book fair before the activities began. The book fair helped get over 1600 books in the hands of students at a discounted price.

Many of the students at Jefferson have seen these shows so I thought it would be fun to create our own.

Lisa Jansen joins 5th-term member Joan Corbin and 3rd-term member Gregg Gustafson in filling three open board positions for the Pella Community School District. Congratulations to our newly elected and re-elected board members!

There was a significant increase in voter turnout for this year’s election. In addition to selecting three board members, a majority of “yes” votes were collected which extends the Physical Plant Equipment Levy for the district.

Thank you to those community members who dedicate their time to our district by serving on the board, as well as all of those who voted in the school election on September 12!

Every Wednesday morning, the students of Ms. Sheets can be found walking door to door in the middle school with a coffee cart. They sell cups of coffee for $1 each with all of the profits going to different charities throughout the year. During the month of September, the money raised selling coffee to teachers was used to buy items for Pella’s food pantry. Thanks to the teachers’ generous donations, the students were able to purchase 39 boxes of macaroni and cheese and 37 cans of soup and spaghettios to donate to Pella's food pantry!

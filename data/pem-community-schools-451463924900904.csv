The School Board will be using the data from the survey to identify an action plan to improve facilities. A plan may include asking the voters to consider some items on a bond referendum and / or look at alternative funding methods for some identified projects. The District will also use the survey and identified needs to prioritize what facility items may need to be phased in over time.

PEM Varsity Drama Presents--Disney's High School Musical! February 22-25. Pre-sale tickets with reserved seating are on sale at Foresight Bank in Plainview - now through Feb. 19th. Any remaining pre-sale tickets will then be available to purchase at the door before the performances. Ticket prices are $8 for Adults and $5 for students.

Disney’s High School Musical began as a made-for-television movie. It quickly became one of the most watched events in TV history. In 2006, the show swept through the awards season, winning with the Emmy, Teen Choice, American Music, TV Critics and Billboards Music Awards.

Now PEM's talented kids get to tell the tale. Newcomers to High School Musical will delight in the upbeat music and dance. Fans of the show can experience new musical numbers, written just for the stage show. The story is much the same: Basketball jock Troy and “brainiac” Gabriella defy the odds in this 21st century Romeo and Juliet. As the couple battles for the lead in the school musical, the also have to face the toughest clique of all: the Theatre geeks.",2018-02-05 08:50:06,,

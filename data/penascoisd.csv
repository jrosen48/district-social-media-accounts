Two times a week, I am inviting guest readers to join my preschool class for Story Time. Over the course of the year my students have been introduced to community helpers, and I think that there is no time like the present for our littlest of learners to feel community. Reading any story of your choice, you would record yourself reading a story (5 to 7 minutes), and I would post it to my google classroom for my students to view at home.

Teachers, if you have any students that need to bring up a grade or make up community service hours this could be an idea!

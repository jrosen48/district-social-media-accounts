PHS will be conducting its graduation ceremony on Saturday, May 30th. Due to the pandemic impacts and social restrictions that are currently in place, this year’s ceremony will be different from year’s past, in particular, we will be utilizing a “drive-thru” strategy. There is a limit of one vehicle per graduate to the presentation of diplomas that will take place at the Round-Up Grounds. Despite these historic times, we are excited to be able to honor our graduating seniors in the Class of 2020.

Although final details are still being determined, graduates and families should expect to receive instructions for the 30th within the next 5-7 days.

Meals: We are implementing what we hope is a smoother process to receive meals at the PELC and Washington Elementary utilizing a “drive-thru” strategy. For those that are driving in, we will use the parent drop-off lines at both the PELC and Washington. For the PELC, parents will need to enter the parking lot off Fraser Avenue. Staff will be present to direct traffic for those who may not be familiar with the drop-off line process. For those that walk-in you are still welcome, but we will be enforcing the six-foot rule for social distancing with our lines.

Testing: The state of Oregon’s waiver to the US Department of Education was conditionally approved yesterday. What this means is that the Smarter Balanced Assessment will not be given this spring.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157400802822830&id=102479612829,,0.0,"Superintendent Message, March 25, 2020 @ 8:00 am

We continue to work on our plan to support students and families while schools are closed due to the Coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak. While we are out, the District will be providing breakfast and lunch for families at the PELC, Washington Elementary and the Recreation Center at CTUIR. A separate announcement will be forthcoming over the weekend with specifics.

In addition to meals, at this time we are hoping to have online and/or hard copies of activities that students can be engaged with during the break. These will be ungraded, but are designed to keep students active and engaged with grade-appropriate materials. By Monday, each school, grades K-8 will have links on their websites to online opportunities. For those without internet access or computers, we’ll have hard copies of resources at the District Office located at 107 NW 10th Street. Our office will be open the week of March 16th thru the 20th from 7:30 am to 4 pm.

There is much to be proud of in Pendleton and 2020 should be no exception. The Pendleton School District staff is poised to inspire and motivate students to excel in all aspects of their education. From the classroom to the athletic fields and from labs to field experiences, Pendleton students have access to a high-quality and diverse educational experience.

As we begin the new year, it is my hope that we challenge ourselves to inspire our students to excel, in order to make the Pendleton School District a continued source of community pride and one of the many reasons for families to live, learn, work and thrive in Eastern Oregon.

We hope that you'll be able to tune in to Facebook Live as Mrs. Hueske and Mr. Timmons lead everyone through the buildings to see the excited Faculty and Staff before the first day of school! We hope to capture the fun of getting to see your teacher and classroom, while limiting campus exposure from visitors.

The video will be up for families to watch if you can't join us at noon. Hope to see you all soon!

*** Following our Virtual Meet the Teacher, Mrs. Hueske and Mr. Timmons would like to show parents a few of the new routines and things for the 2020-2021 school year. ***

Items we plan to cover:
- Morning dropoff / Screening process

Today, TEA released guidelines for returning to on campus instruction for the Fall. While we have been discussing what reopening would look like since April, this document gives us what will be required of us to welcome students back into our buildings.

In the coming weeks, we will be releasing our local plan for how our Wolverines will come back to learn. There are a few things I’m comfortable saying today:

1. Things will be different. TEA’s requirements are going to modify school operations as we had been accustomed to.
2. Penelope is going to follow all required steps and potentially some voluntary measures to ensure students, staff, and visitors will remain safe.
3. We are ALL going to have to work together to make this year successful. Extra things are going to be required of all of us and in the process, these measures may inconvenience or frustrate us at times.

As always, thank you for your support and understanding. Together we are going to make it a great year to be a Wolverine!

While we are sheltering, If you are looking for something you can do to help Penelope ISD and our Community, be on the lookout for your invitation in the mail to complete the federal census. The invitation letter that came to our house was printed on blue paper. The federal census helps us all by creating accurate numbers that assist the federal government when establishing funding amounts or awarding grants.

Las recomendaciones de hoy de parte del presidente Trump y el CDC es de reunir en grupos de menos de 10 personas. Según esta información, creo que la única opción que tenemos es extender las vacaciones de Spring break otra semana.

The past few days I have been monitoring guidance from the CDC and the COVID-19 reported cases from the Texas Department of State Health Services. I have also been monitoring the actions of our neighboring school districts. This entire time I have been weighing the health and safety of Penelope students with the needs of our parents and our community.

The new guidance today from President Trump and the CDC is for all Americans to limit groups to less than 10 people. Given this new information, I feel that in the best interest of keeping our Wolverines healthy, I have no choice than to close Penelope ISD for an additional week following Spring Break.

Please know that I do not take this decision or this responsibility lightly.

I will continue to update you through the all call system, on Facebook, and on our school website when there are new developments. Thank you for your patience and understanding as we navigate through this situation.

We had 14 students who participated; Rachel Esquivel, Grace Kasberg, Amber Westmoreland, Amanda Christian, Amberly Jennings, Alex Eddy, Madison Quiram, Austin Todd, Logan Miller, Emily Labella, Abby Pineda, Shane Kelley, Cory Nave and Justin Esquivel. Jr. Chapter Conducting was 3rd, Jr. Quiz was 3rd, Radio was 4th, Sr. Quiz was 6th , Sr. Creed was 6th, Job Interview was 9th, and Jr. Creed 13th. Our 3rd places were one spot out of advancing to area. This is above and ahead of our showing last year; we entered more teams and had more success and I believe we worked harder this year. I am really proud of the kids; gradually we are making progress and I hope they are starting to believe in themselves a bit. Unlike UIL we compete against more schools much larger than us; Burleson, Alvarado, Glen Rose, Granbury just to name a few. Please congratulate these kids and thanks to all of you for you do.",2011-11-10 09:04:10,,

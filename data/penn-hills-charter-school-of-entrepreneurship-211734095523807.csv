Savanna Lewis was recently featured in a Nazareth Prep Mentor article titled: How Nazareth Prep Mentors Have Inspired.

Below is the excerpt.

Tracey McCants Lewis with The Pittsburgh Penguins is passionate with her mission to develop and inspire our region's youth. To build her intern Savannah's executive presence and legal knowledge, she had her attend an Allegheny County Bar Association Luncheon, where Tracey spoke on a panel. This luncheon was hosted by the Women's Bar Association. Savannah was engaged and interacted well with attendees at her table while her mentor spoke on the panel. At the table were the Deans from Duquesne and the University of Pittsburgh Schools of Law, lawyers and law students. This experience will remain a part of Savannah's life and career journey forever!

Great job Savannah, and best wishes as you continue to soar to success.

Micro Memory!

Let's reminisce on how the MicroSociety at PHCSE prepares our scholars for the real world. Students who run their various ventures get the opportunity to visit their counterparts in the real world. Students of the Post Office, visited the Unites States Post Office in Verona, to take a tour of the facility. Our more creative and crafty ventures visited Painting with a Twist to learn how creativity sells.

We look forward to making more Micro Memories in the future.

For Ms. Linda, this was her first time working at a school, but she finds that the children bring her joy, as well as hugs.

The big difference for her in this career, is the ""friendly and welcoming"" relationships she forms with many families and students. Her lasting impression is to be genuine.

""It's so nice being part of something that has been growing over the course of a few years, and seeing how things have improved in that time.""

Ms. Nance began her career in the non-profit sector, at Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, where her first Human Resources role was Employee Specialist.

What she enjoys most about her job is the opportunity to be part of a team that lives by its values in a work environment that is genuinely welcoming and compassionate, while being guided by sound business decisions.

Story below:
Students at Penn Hills Charter School have been actively participating in our Small Bites program. Recently they have been learning how to make their own guacamole from scratch by mixing tomatoes, onions, herbs, and avocado. While practicing this recipe, the students were also taught how to safely and properly cut all of the ingredients to be added into their recipe. Knife safety is a huge priority in our curriculum to ensure our students are properly trained by our chef instructors with the education to stay safe both in our class and outside.

Meet Mr. Ruffin, our building substitute teacher.
Mr. Ruffin, or Brother Ruffin as he is known throughout the building, is a man of character and discipline, attributed to his background as a former Marine, serving from 1972-76.

A Pitt alum and a friend to all who walk through our door, Mr. Ruffin is thankful to serve as a mentor, instilling knowledge and positivity to the children of PHCSE.
Did you know, Mr. Ruffin shares the same birthday with Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.

Thank you Mr. Ruffin for everything you do.

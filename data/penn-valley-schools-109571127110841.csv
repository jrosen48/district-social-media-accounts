Good morning! It appears that Penn Valley and Rough and Ready have been spared in the first PSPS event for the year. We will be operating as usual!

If you live in an area without power, please contact your school office to notify the teacher that your power is out due to PSPS. Continue to work on assignment from your Friday log sheet to the best of your ability.

Be safe as fire conditions are extremely high. Please reach out if there is anything you need!",0.0,"Penn Valley Schools

Just a quick note to let everyone know we will be providing meals over the Summer to anyone who is under the age of 18. We are unable to continue with our hub locations when school is officially on Summer break, but will have Ready Springs as the pick up location each day. You do not need to be present to pick up meals so please work with your neighbors to divide and conquer daily pick ups! 😊

Starting June 8th, meals can be picked up at Ready Springs School in the gymnasium Monday - Friday from 10 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.

Hello Penn Valley Families. Attached is an update regarding a few things we do know as we move forward throughout this unprecedented school closure.

Please note all Penn Valley Schools will begin August 17, 2020. We are uncertain exactly what school will look like and plan to update families as we learn more. We know social distancing will be necessary if we are able to open our doors in some capacity. We encourage families to begin planning for childcare and family needs in advance. Please contact your site administrator if you need ideas or assistance.

Also, plans for 8th grade promotion for Ready Springs and Vantage Point will be sent out next week. The ceremony is scheduled for Thursday, June 4th at 11:00 a.m. You will want to plan to be to your designed area prior to that time. More to come! 🎉

Please know we are applying for waivers from the State for any days beyond the two days we currently have built into our calendar so that make-up days will not be required. We plan to review our calendar starting next year as we know students missing school hours is not optimal. This is something we have to negotiate with our teacher’s union and have meetings already scheduled. All of this is new to everyone and we are doing everything we can.

Good evening! After monitoring updates throughout the day, we have determined all schools in Penn Valley will be closed tomorrow, October 11th.

Currently PG&E is not able to provide any updates for our area for power restoration. Some sections have gained power late this evening, but the majority of Penn Valley has not. Based on the information provided from PG&E we are confident in this decision.

Please know we make the best decisions we can at that moment and feel families would rather have a decision made tonight than wait until 6:00 A.M. tomorrow morning. We believe power should be restored sometime late Friday or early weekend and know PG&E is planning to begin additional restoration efforts as soon as they have sunlight.

Again, we apologize for any inconvenience and truly hope we can start fresh Monday morning! Thank you for all the support and understanding.

As a reminder, all lines must be visually inspected prior to being re-energized. These inspections can only take place during daylight hours. There are hundreds of lines to inspect across the State so please know crews are doing all they can.

Good morning! We received information that PG&E expects to receive an all clear from their meteorology team between 12:00 and 2:00 P.M. today that will allow ground and air crews to begin line inspections and repairs. As a reminder, all lines must be visually inspected prior to being re-energized. These inspections can only take place during daylight hours. There are hundreds of lines to inspect across the State so please know crews are doing all they can.

PG&E has two Community Resource Center tents today until 8:00 P.M. at Sierra College NCC - Nevada County Campus at 250 Sierra College Dr. Residents can find an air-conditioned tent to sit in while they charge devices.

We will have more information about school closure by 8:00 P.M. tonight. Again, thank you for understanding and please call Dr. England with any needs or questions at 530-277-6373.",2019-10-10 13:21:35,,

SCHOOL CLOSURE FOR 10/10:

Good evening! Unfortunately, all Penn Valley Schools will be closed tomorrow.

We have been advised PG&E has been given permission to begin inspecting lines as of 6:15 P.M. The inspections take many hours and all lines have to be safe before they can start re-energizing electricity. Some power has been restored in the South Auburn area but we were also told there is a possibility winds will pick up between midnight and 3:00 A.M.

We apologize for any inconvenience and know this is a tough time for us all, but safety is always our number one priority. We will have additional updates tomorrow before noon and again by 8:00 P.M. We cannot make any decisions about Friday at this time.

Also, all field trips and District events are cancelled for the week and will be rescheduled once school resumes.

DETAILS ON WHY THE POWER OUTAGES OCCUR:

We received some details about why the power outages occur in our area. here is specific information:

“The PSPS does not necessarily mean that the wind event is right here in our County. A Senior Manager for PG&E explained the large transformers that generate power to the service lines that crisscross throughout our state are located in areas that may see potential high winds. The effects of the high wind on the transformers and extensive service lines can be a potential fire danger in light of the low humidity and dry conditions.”

We know this isn’t much detail, but at least provides some basic explanation when we all question what is happening when winds are not occurring in our community. We are just the messenger on this but hope it somewhat helps. 😊",0.0,"Penn Valley Schools

Good afternoon. We just received word there is a very high probability that power will be turned off between 12:00 A.M. and 4 A.M.

A call will go out to all families at approximately 6:00 A.M. tomorrow, along with email notifications and Facebook posts. Power is anticipated to be out 36-48 hours. PG&E will begin restoring electricity and we are not sure how long that process will take. As we have updates on time, we will pass that along. As always, please feel free to contact Dr. England at the District Office today, or via cell at 530-277-6373.

UPDATE ON POWER TURN ON:

At this time we have been told PG&E is hoping to have power back on before dark. It all depends on damage to lines (possibly from other areas) that affect our community. We are optimistic we will get back to our usual routines tomorrow. Hang in there and we will keep you posted later this afternoon as additional information is provided. We can confirm some power in the GV area has been restored within the past few minutes.",0.0,"Penn Valley Schools

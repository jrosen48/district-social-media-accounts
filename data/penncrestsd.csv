Congratulations to Shari Barickman (6th grade teacher), Sarah Eckstein (art teacher) and Joy Shaffer (technology teacher) who were recently successfully awarded an NEA Student Achievement Grant of $5,000! They teamed up this past winter to write one for aquaponics lab equipment for MES! The NEA Foundation awards grants of up to $5,000 exclusively to NEA members to enhance teaching and learning. The installation of this lab is an exciting project at MES that will provide us with many unique learning opportunities. Stay tuned to see our lab come to life!",2020-05-12 22:33:41,,

By Diana I. Robinson, contributing writer Life as we knew it was about to change. On Friday, March 13, the Governor of the State of Pennsylvania informed Pennsylvanians that schools would be shut down for the next two weeks. At this point, my dad decided it would be a good idea for us to start raising chickens. We would be home more often and able to take care of these babies. [ 287 more words ]

Coronavirus has everything up in the air and our admin and board have been great at adapting to new regulations and information quickly.

As of now, we will be planning some type of graduation ceremony for our seniors. Plan on there being something on June 5th at 6pm. Each attendance area is different and we may have 3 separate types of ceremonies to reflect each school. But, each school will have a ceremony.

All other student events are cancelled as of now. We may get more guidance from the experts soon which will change this, but it appears this may continue into the summer. The district is is trying to develop as many contingency plans as possible ranging from everything is open as of June 9th to everything is still closed going into next school year and everything in between.

MES has put together a site with activities to keep your family engaged during our school closure. On the site you will find that each grade level has a tab with grade specific learning opportunities, a 'Fun for the Whole Family' page with things like virtual field trips and creative tutorials, as well as pages with factual info about the coronavirus and kid-friendly resources to explain this pandemic to your children. Nothing on this site is required for children to participate in or complete. There are simply so many great resources being shared and created as a result of this situation. Our goal with this site was to make it easier for our families to find and access them in one place.

There is something for everyone! Take a look!

Education committee meeting Monday Nov 11th at 5:30 at Central Office. Here is the schedule for upcoming athletic meetings.

I think people are just starting to figure out that when this board holds meetings to gather input from the public, the intent is to actually get input from the public.

One great takeaway from tonight's meeting beyond the great suggestions about needing more yelling and bomb '01 Deville's was when Board President Mark Gerow said the answer doesnt always have to be either/or, sometimes the answer is AND.

The intent of this board is not to take opportunities away from kids or to save money combining or co-oping. It's to provide better opportunities to fit our district.

The process of looking at our sports and band started last May. It will be wrapping up in February with the board receiving recommendations afterwards. This is an inclusive process designed for residents to tell the board what the district wants instead of the district just telling residents what the board is going to do.

Get involved. We can only do better if we hear from all of you.",2.0,"Jeff Brooks for Penncrest

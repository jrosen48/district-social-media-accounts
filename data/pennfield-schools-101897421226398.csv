This morning it was brought to the high school administration's attention that a student may be bringing a gun to school. We are in the process of investigating this rumor. The student who was rumored to be bringing the gun is in the office with the school administration, safety liaison and the superintendent.

At this time, we do not believe the safety of the students at the high school are in any danger. We are continuing to investigate this rumor.

The high school was placed in lockdown as a precautionary measure under the sheriff's department direction so that the K9 unit was brought in to determine if any weapons were in the school.

Your student's safety at Pennfield Schools is our top priority.

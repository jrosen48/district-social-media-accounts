The Penn Hills School District is working collaboratively with PHEA (our teachers' union) to fill the Linton MS music position that became vacant as of last night. Unfortunately, we do not have appropriately certified teachers on staff or on furlough to fill this long-term substitute position; however, in the best interest of our students, we are committed to exploring all creative options that may be available to us, some of which look very promising.

As a matter of transparency, the Linton MS administration is advising families and staff that two Penn Hills Police Officers reported at approximately 2:45 pm today after a 911 call was made from outside the school. The caller alleged that a student had been stabbed and/or was at risk of being stabbed. The police officers interviewed a student whom they thought might have additional details. Following this interview, the police shared their conclusion with the Building Principal that the 911 call had been made based on hearsay.

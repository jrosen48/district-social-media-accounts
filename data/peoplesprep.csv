To be clear, this report was a complete shock to each of us at People's Prep. Unfortunately, there was no prior warning from Mr. Leon, and other than what has been reported in the press, we have no additional information from the school district.

This week, People's Prep will be issuing a formal response to Mr. Leon's letter, and we will be following up with a letter to our community very shortly. Additionally, we are hosting a meeting for People's Prep parents and guardians in the school's cafeteria this Thursday, January 9th at 6:00 pm to discuss the New Jersey charter school renewal process, the context of Mr. Leon's letter to the Commissioner, and ways that parents can support our school community at this time.

Earlier this morning, one of People’s Prep’s fire alarms was activated, causing a momentary break from our academics.

Students and staff evacuated the building in an orderly fashion, Newark’s fire department was on the scene, and we were given the all clear. Our community reentered the building and continued their day.

Upon review, the remnants of a small fire were found in the first floor boys' locker room. The activity did not spread beyond the discovered location, and other than the evacuation, no one was affected. We are currently investigating how that fire started and will update you when we have more information. Please feel free to contact the school if you have any concerns or questions.

Thank you.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2149143351821164&id=136492256419627,,0.0,"Dear Parents and Caregivers,

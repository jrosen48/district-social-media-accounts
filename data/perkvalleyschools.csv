Mieke and Dover Wilmoth were expecting a regular day at school until both of them received a surprise visitor to their classrooms at Evergreen and Middle School West - their father, Maj. Jamey Wilmoth! Maj. Wilmoth has just completed a tour in Afghanistan, where he was serving on a Forward Surgical Team as a nurse anesthetist. This was Maj. Wilmoth's fourth tour as part of his 13 years in the Army. He surprised both his children with a visit to school on Thursday, and spent some time talking with students about his role overseas. Maj.

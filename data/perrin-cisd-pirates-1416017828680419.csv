Just some information for tonight's Jr High game in Weatherford. It will be at the field downtown, NOT at the High School. Here is the address

https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kangaroo+Stadium/@32.7484198,-97.7971347,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8651fe07c68fb2db:0x92abb9fd584a18d2!8m2!3d32.748321!4d-97.7948226

Parking (for all fans) will be in the North ‘Reserved’ Parking Lot and those gates will take you to the home bleachers. The visitor’s bleachers will not be open. The West Gate will be used by Weatherford athletes, coaches, and officials so I would rather keep all fans from coming in that way.

Weatherford (and state law) require face masks to be worn when entering and exiting the stadium. There is plenty of room to practice social distancing in our stands… the only thing we ask is that you clean up after yourself, no cleaning crews will be coming after the game.

The north west restrooms will be unlocked, all other restrooms will be locked.",2.0,"GOOGLE.COM

In an effort to keep all of our employees safe but continue to make sure the children of Perrin-Whitt CISD receive food for the week, we are making a change in our meal delivery service plan. Starting Tuesday, April 7th we will hand out meals (for the week)one time per week. All meals will be delivered between 9:45 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. and will need to be refrigerated. Changing our meal plan to one day a week will reduce the chance of exposure for everyone involved.

Food will be delivered on the following dates:

Tuesday, April 7th
Monday, April 13th
Monday, April 20th
Monday, April 27th

Below are a list of the drop off spots and times. Meals for the week can still be picked up at the school from 7:15am-9:15am on Mondays only.

Alright, we have an update for tomorrow’s playoff baseball game. The weather has hit Windthorst pretty hard, so their field will not be playable tomorrow. So we were able to get the game moved to Hoskins Field in Wichita Falls. Since it is a little further, and to make sure fans can still make it in time, the game will start at 3:00. The field is turf, and as long as the rain will hold off, we will be playing some baseball!

Due to the extreme drought conditions and high potential for wildfires Judge Mitchell Davenport signed an order minutes ago prohibiting the sale and use of fireworks in the unincorporated areas of Jack County. This order also prohibits all outdoor burning.

The Jacksboro fire department will still be at the lake this evening where you will be allowed to discharge fireworks in certain areas. THIS WILL BE THE ONLY PLACE YOU ARE ALLOWED TO SHOOT OFF FIREWORKS WITHIN JACK COUNTY!

It has become evident today that not many of the summer calendars I sent home the last week of school actually made it home. Summer conditioning started today. There are two different times kids can come. They do not have to come to both. It is for all athletes, not just football. This is a way for the kids to prepare for the upcoming year of sports. This is not a camp that the kids had to sign up for.

It is Monday through Thursday. First time is 9am-12 and the other time is 5pm-7. We will take off the week of July 4 and the last week will be the week of July 31.

If athletes want to come to open gym they must do a workout first.

We will be having Summer School for students that need make- up hours, credit recovery, for any 8th grade student that does not pass the second administration of the STAAR, and/or for any high school student that does not pass their EOC’s.

Summer School will run from June 6-20, Monday – Friday, 8:30 -3:00, for any 8th graders that failed the second administration of the STAAR. Credit Recovery will run June 6-30, Monday – Friday, 8:30-3:00, and EOC Remediation will run June 20-30, Monday – Friday, 8:30-3:00.

Students will need to bring their own lunch. Lunch will be from 11:30 -12:00. Also, buses will not run, so students will need to have their own transportation.

We will be notifying parents and students as soon as we get test results and all grades are final.

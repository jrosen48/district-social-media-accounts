PUHSD is pleased to announce an update to our graduation plans. While we are still holding virtual graduation ceremonies, we have modified our drive-through ceremonies to give graduates the ability to exit their vehicle and walk across a stage in their cap and gown as they receive their diploma. The stage will be positioned along the drive-through path so that families can clearly view this moment from their vehicles and celebrate with their graduate. Please watch for an announcement from your school with additional details.

We sincerely appreciate your patience and understanding as we have worked through modifying our graduation plans while remaining compliant with public health orders and recommendations. Graduation is a significant right of passage and we want to ensure our graduates and their families can celebrate and have as many memorable moments as safely possible.",,,0.0,"Graduates and Families:

Blackboard Link Enrichment Tools & Resources",4.0,"Parents and students, we would like to thank you for your continued support as we move forward during these challenging times. As information is shared from the various health regulatory organizations with our educational community, we will ensure this information is communicated with you. This forum is a method to provide our parents and our students the opportunity to find resources to have our students focus on enrichment opportunities. While the Perris Union High School District encourages all students and families to work together on enrichment opportunities, these are optional, and students are not required to submit work to teachers. These resources are intended to support all students until school reopens. In the interim, if your son or daughter should have any questions, please have them email their teachers directly. Federal and local recommendations are changing daily. If we need to extend our school closure, the dates will be adjusted, and we will let you know as soon as information is available.

Rico was a freshman here at Heritage High School. Out of respect for the family, no other details will be shared at this time.

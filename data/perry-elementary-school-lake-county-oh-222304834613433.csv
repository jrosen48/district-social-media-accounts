Thank you all for your support and patience as we navigate these uncharted waters together! To continue learning during this time away from the school building, all students in grades 2-4 will be taking home their chromebooks in order to access work during the scheduled 3 week break.

However, if K-1 students need access to a district-owned device, please fill out this form as soon as possible today, March 13th, so we can prepare the devices for pick-up.

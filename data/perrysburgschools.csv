We love it when our alumni give back!
Shane Edward '13 wanted to find a way to help as schools undertake the task of opening doors to students. Shane enjoyed his time at Perrysburg and wanted to give back to the school community. He has donated 17,000 disposable masks to the district and has included a written note on each box providing encouragement and support. These will be distributed for use in classrooms, on buses, and school facilities throughout the district. Perrysburg Schools are grateful for this gift that will help ensure students and staff have access to clean masks as necessary! Shane dropped by Perrysburg Schools today to present the masks to Assistant Superintendent, Brook Price.
Thanks Shane for demonstrating what we mean when we say #onceajacketalwaysajacket.",0.0,"Perrysburg Schools Alumni Association

Love Perrysburg history? PHS/S has a piece of it for you!
We have a one of a kind creation from local artist Mike Williams. This print is of all 3 of the Perrysburg High Schools. The current one, the previous one, now the Junior High and the Original one, now called the Commodore building. Done in a black pen and ink cross hatch drawing , These pictures are 16x20 matted, signed wrapped and numbered. Also included on the back is a little history about Mike and his love for drawing. This nicely done piece would look great in a frame or be a great gift. All proceeds will go to Parents Helping Students/Staff and will help our endeavors at Perrysburg High school to serve our staff and students. Prints will sell for $50.00 each and will be for sale as long as we have prints available. If interested, Please contact us via Facebook messenger or via our email at parentshelpingstudents@gmail.com

THANK YOU!

#GivingTuesday was a huge success with 78 donors participating and raising nearly $10,000 for the students, staff and programs at Perrysburg Schools. You all helped max out the dollars offered by our matching partners Maddie & Bella Coffee Roasters and @9RoundPerrysburg.

We had gifts come in from as far away as Texas, Minnesota, Florida and Maine. The first gift arrived at 7:15 a.m. and the last at 11:41 p.m. Employees, former employees, community members, parents, grandparents and alumni (even one from a member of the Class of 1947) all invested in our students!

Thank you - thank you - thank you!

While the winners were the schools yesterday, we do have scarves to send to 5 people whose names were drawn randomly. Congratulations to Deb Kemp, Donna & Ron Eaton, Chuck Stocking, Emily Kleeberger and Andrea Myers - your scarves are on their way to you.

We love what we do and look forward to putting your generosity to work in the classroom!

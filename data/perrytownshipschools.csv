Throughout January every classroom at the school has decided to thank different departments and organizations within Perry Township. This past week, Mrs. Wegesin’s class invited our Maintenance and Grounds Department to join them in a quick thank you celebration. Students took turns reading their letters and giving them to all of the crew members!
Thank you to our maintenance and grounds crew as well as all of our departments here at Perry Township Schools who make our kids a priority every day!",2020-02-04 14:30:38,,

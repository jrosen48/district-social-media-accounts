Please watch for pedestrians crossing from the student parking lot to the school side of the driveway. Additionally, to improve the flow of traffic during drop off time, please pull up as far as possible toward the high school cafeteria before dropping students off, then use the left lane to exit.

As an additional factor that may cause delays in both morning arrival and afternoon drop off, road construction has started on Route 22B also know on Pleasant Street. Peru crews are replacing a water line on Pleasant Street and contractors are grinding down and repaving Route 22B from Schuyler Falls to Peru. Please be patient as this will affect buses travelling these routes.",2019-09-04 15:26:11,,

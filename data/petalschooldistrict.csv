Petal Panthers,

Today, Governor Tate Reeves in consultation with MDE and MDH instructed ALL k-12 schools in the state of MS to close until April 17. This means all Petal Schools offices and schools will be closed to the public. Next week our essential staff will report to finalize our learning plan, distribute Chromebooks to students in need, and initiate our feeding program for students and families. Parents/Families - I will have a more detailed letter to share with you in the coming days. As we enter this “new normal”, please have patience with our team as we do our very best to troubleshoot and make this a successful transition. Thanks for your out-pouring of support!

Petal Panthers,

Based on the information from local/state healthcare experts in conjunction with MDE and MDH, the Petal School District will extend Spring Break an additional week (March 23-27). All schools and offices will be closed. We will continue to stay in close contact with MDE, MDH, and the Governor’s Office to determine plans beyond next week. We continue to finalize our at-home/online learning plan in the event we are out an extended period of time. I want to thank and recognize all administrators that have given so much time away from their families during spring break. More details will be coming out soon! #bettertogether

In an effort to better ensure the safety and security of our students and staff, the Petal School District Police Department will conduct a School Safety Exercise Coordinated with Area Emergency Responders on July 24, 2019 at Petal Upper Elementary School. This synchronized exercise will enable school personnel and all agencies involved to practice reacting together to crisis situations.

Two scenarios will be included in the exercise including an active shooter enactment. This will be a comprehensive exercise involving “acting victims”, school personnel, road closings, triage, and SWAT team.

In an effort to make the exercise as “real” as possible, call outs will be made over emergency channels. We ask that community members understand it is a planned exercise, not a true emergency.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2356205004459289&id=124842464262232,,0.0,"Petal School District Announcement

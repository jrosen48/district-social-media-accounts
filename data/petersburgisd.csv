We had 74 student Counselor Check-ins over the school closure letting me know how they were doing, if they needed a phone call, and/or letting me know which coping strategies they were using.

I said I would have a drawing for five $10 Raising Cane's gift cards. Here are the winners in order as they were drawn:

1. Evonie Ibarra - 8th grade
2. Fe Orozco - 3rd grade
3. Alexa Livar - 11th grade
4. Riley Gonzalez - 8th grade
5. Josiah Tatum - 9th grade

Congratulations and thank you all for checking in. Winners can pick up their gift card when they get their snow cone tomorrow.

We hope to see you all tomorrow, Friday, May 15th from 10 a.m - 12:00 noon to get your free shaved ice snow cone. Curbside restrictions apply.

Y'all have a great and safe summer!

After doing some research, we have learned that this is the largest group of students to make All Region in at least 20 years!!!
These nine have worked super hard learning new music, playing with students from other schools, and rehearsing for long hours over the last couple of days. They have also played hard, too! 😉
They have represented Petersburg well!!
If you are available, we’d love to see you at their performances at the Lubbock Memorial Civic Center today. They are as follows:

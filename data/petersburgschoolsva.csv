The open house will include tours of the updated facility. A facial covering will be required to participate in the facility tours and tour groups will remain small to allow for proper social distancing.

Petersburg City Public Schools (PCPS) has received a grant from The Cameron Foundation in the amount of $50,000 for the purchase of hot spots for PCPS students. The hot spots will allow students to access the internet from a mobile device, laptop, or other internet capable computer device.

“Through The Cameron Foundation’s support, we will be able to ensure that more of our students can access online learning during the school closure,” said Dr. Maria Pitre-Martin, Superintendent of Petersburg City Public Schools. “We are very thankful for their support over their years and their continued efforts to uplift our families during these challenging times,” concluded Superintendent Pitre-Martin.

The Cameron Foundation was founded in 2003 to promote and support groups that serve residents of the Tri-Cities region of Virginia. The foundation is named for William E. Cameron, former Governor of Virginia and former Mayor of Petersburg. He was buried in Blandford Cemetery (Petersburg).",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2944090069010451&id=123860167700136,,0.0,"Petersburg City Public Schools Receives The Cameron Foundation Grant For Technology

Maintaining a safe learning environment is a priority at all Petersburg schools. Today as part of our strong partnership with the police department, Petersburg Bureau of Police performed walkthroughs at our schools to check for security threats. A police dog accompanied officers on their security checks. No problems were found.

Also, as part of our safety program, we will hold a lockdown drill at every school this week and schools will continue to practice fire drills on a regular basis.

We depend on support from our students, parents and community to keep our schools safe. Thank you for your support.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2461333513952778&id=123860167700136,,0.0,"This message is going to all Petersburg City Public Schools families early this afternoon:

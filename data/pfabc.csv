Braedon Cunningham

After six months of no band, freshman Braedon hit the ground running at the high school. He has already shown his dedication to the program by being a member of marching band and signing up for Jazz Band. He is always on time, always on task, and is quick to pick up new concepts. In the first two weeks of school, he has shown up for more voluntary lessons than anyone else, and has a clear goal in mind of what he would like to accomplish with his instrument. He has already impressed the student leaders and myself with his commitment and willingness to learn.

Isiah Hand

Isiah is a percussionist in the Riggs Band. He has been a four-year member of the PIERREcussion drumline on quads, and has been a member of the Emerald Regiment marching band as well.

Family members:
Bradley-Father
Beth-Mother
Samuel and Elijah-Brothers
Adrian-Sister

Post high school plans: I do not plan to immediately enter the world of post-secondary education, and I will likely spend a little time traveling and gaining life experience.

Favorite band memory: My favorite band memory was probably the latest marching contest that our band has participated in. It was fun to preform both in the full band as well as drumline!

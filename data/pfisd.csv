1,527! That's the number of books we were able to give away yesterday in our partnership with Pflugerville ISD for the Pflugerville Reads Project. School librarians, volunteers, and City of Pflugerville staff worked together at 10 campuses to distribute books to children and teens.

This project would not have been possible without the generosity of the Friends of the Pflugerville Library. As always, they were eager to encourage literacy and a love of reading in the community.

Although most campuses had enough books for everyone, we know that a couple campuses had unexpectedly high turnouts and ran out a few minutes early. We are looking into additional opportunities to give away more books over the summer. Keep an eye on our social media for future updates.

He conducts Zoom meetings twice each week to explain math lessons and answer questions. Another zoom meeting each week is dedicated to fun. Wacky Wednesday meetings have themes like decades day or favorite sport. He even invites guests like our PE coach to make special appearances. Finally, he holds a weekly zoom meeting for his GT kids. He gives them special challenges, but mostly I hear him complimenting their effort, giving advice on things like college and pointing out their individual talents. This isn’t teaching, it’s an extraordinary act of dedication to filling their hearts and not just their heads.

If you do not have access to technology for your student to use for the lessons, PfISD will also have printed lesson activities available for pick-up at the food locations across the district (KLMS is closest to Mott; 8-9am and 11am-1pm).

Most importantly, we miss our Owls! We hope you are doing everything necessary to stay healthy, physically and emotionally. Please reach out to an administrator, counselor, or social worker if you have needs we can help with.

Yes, those are Golden Tickets . . . but the opportunities in store for our students are far more life-changing than a visit to a chocolate factory.

Each year, our Executive Director makes a visit to each of our partner schools to invite the top performing students in the program to interview for a Code2College Summer internship. This year, Code2College will be placing high school students at twenty different companies in the Austin area for 8-12 week paid, technical Summer internships in software engineering, IT and other high-demand roles. And yes that’s right, these are high schoolers, ages 15-18!

These are just a few of our golden ticket holders from Manor ISD, Harmony Austin, Austin ISD, Pflugerville ISD, Del Valle ISD, and Round Rock ISD!

Please join us congratulating these all-star students on this tremendous achievement and wish them the best as they prepare for their upcoming interviews!

Dear Parents/Guardians,

We hope to get back to normal operations in the very near future. We are still in the process of waiting for guidance from the state in regards to instructional days, assessments, etc. We also want to provide continuity of education to provide normalcy, connection, and of course education to our students.

We are formulating a plan in order to be able to deliver instruction to students without them physically being in one of our buildings. In order to plan for this, we need to know if students have access to internet and if they have access to a computer or tablet.

We ask that you please visit the link below to complete a brief survey for each child in your home. This will provide us information about our potential next steps moving forward. If you are unable to complete the survey online, a member of our administrative team will reach out to you by phone on Monday, March 23, 2020.

Thank you,
Heath W. Renninger, Superintendent

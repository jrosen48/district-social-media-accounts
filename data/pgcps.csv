The National Orchestral Institute + Festival has pledged to amplify creative voices that have been unfairly silenced in the orchestral ecosystem due to systemic racism. Today, we're thrilled to announce the expansion of our K-12 New Music Project! In partnership with NOI+F Sphinx Fellow Camille Jones, Prince George's County Public Schools, the DC Youth Orchestra Program and Hawaii Youth Symphony, we will commission eight Black, Indigenous and people of color composers to write works that will increase representation in K-12 orchestral music.

We give special thanks to the League of American Orchestras for awarding NOI+F with a $30,000 Futures Fund grant to make this project possible!

Maryland History Day
July 20 at 12:22 PM ·

We honor the legacy of Congressman John Lewis, who passed away Friday night. Over the weekend, we were contacted by a former History Day parent who shared with us her daughter's 2014 Documentary on Voting Rights, which included an interview with the late Congressman.

In the video, Lewis says: ""We risked our lives for voting rights because we thought the vote was powerful, that it was important. The right to vote, the right to participate in the democratic process, is precious. It’s almost sacred. It’s the most powerful nonviolent tool that we have in a democratic society. You can be low income, you can be middle class, you can be a billionaire, but we all have one vote. And why did people want to keep us from voting? Because it’s powerful.""

Students throughout the National History Day program continue to research Lewis' life and analyze his many writings to learn about the long fight for voting rights.

Since 2000, the county just outside the nation's capital has spawned some 25 NBA players, more than a dozen WNBA players, and countless more who have competed at elite universities, highlighting the decades-long prevalence of basketball within the region.

I attended Prince George's County Public Schools Black History program this evening, and I MUST post this group. I wasn’t ready and they were beyond my expectation. They are from the Eleanor Roosevelt High School in Greenbelt, MD and are called Dem Raider Boyz Step Squad.

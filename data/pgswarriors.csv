We are so proud of Pleasant Grove Public School for hosting a Cooking for Kids program that teaches students the importance of healthy cooking.
A Cooking for Kids chef worked with students in multiple classes to research, create, and enjoy these healthy recipes together. All cooking participants received prizes, and awards were given to the students who created the most favored recipes. The winning recipe will even be featured next week, for all students to try, in the school cafeteria.

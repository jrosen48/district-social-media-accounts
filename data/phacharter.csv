We are so excited to share that we partnered up with the YouTube Kids App to create a playlist featuring some of our favorite children’s book read alouds for Reading Month!

We wanted to take this opportunity to center Black authors and stories, which aren’t always included in curriculum or home libraries, but are important for kids of all races to read and have access to from a young age.

Every book we feature is written by a Black author and read aloud by brilliant Black creatives, including @im.angelabassett, @gabunion, @martellusb, @javakasteptoe, @andreapippins, @kwamealexander, and @keturahariel.

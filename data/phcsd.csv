Because the absentee ballot envelopes contain the name of each voter, others could link the individual voter to the vote. Please be assured, an envelope containing a returned absentee ballot is not to be opened until a determination is made that there is no reason for rejecting the ballot, which could happen if, for example, the voter fails to provide the signature required by law to appear on the envelope containing the ballot. Once such a determination is made and the envelope opened, the ballot is withdrawn without unfolding and deposited into the proper ballot box. As a result, at the time of counting, the ballots will not be linked to the envelope in which they were returned.

Governor Cuomo just announced that all New York school buildings will remain closed for the remainder of this academic year. The Governor was asked about a timeline for re-opening schools for the next academic year and he reported that it is too early to make that decision because it will be dependent upon the COVID-19 situation at that time.

We will continue to keep you updated as additional information becomes available.

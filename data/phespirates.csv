What is Parents as Teachers? Parents as Teachers (PAT) serves families who are expecting a child or have children under the age of kindergarten entry. A trained parent educator provides home visits with families to promote early learning, knowledge, and understanding of child development and assist in building a partnership between families, schools and community resources.

This evidence-based early childhood program is designed to offer regularly scheduled family personal visits, annual developmental screenings, monthly group connections and access to a network of resources. Together, these four components of PAT support school readiness and provide families, schools, and communities the guidance they need to ensure children are able to reach their full potential.

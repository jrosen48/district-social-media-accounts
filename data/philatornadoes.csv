We are excited to see our students back at school on Monday, August 17th. Our buses will run at their normal time and our car rider drop off will open at 7:20. We understand that the first day of school is an important event that families want to share together. For the safety of all PES families, we are limiting the number of visitors on campus by staggering the times parents can walk their children to the classroom. If you wish to walk your child to his/her classroom, we ask that you follow the schedule below.

Grades 2-6 from 7:20 to 8:00
1st grade from 8:00 to 8:30
Kindergarten from 8:30 to 9:00
Pre-K from 9:00 to 9:30

All students will have access to a grab and go breakfast. This schedule is For Monday only. Starting Tuesday, regular bus and car rider schedules will apply, and parents may not visit the classroom.

We are excited to see our students back at school on Monday, August 17th. Our buses will run at their normal time and our car rider drop off will open at 7:20. We understand that the first day of school is an important event that families want to share together. For the safety of all PES families, we are limiting the number of visitors on campus by staggering the times parents can walk their children to the classroom. If you wish to walk your child to his/her classroom, we ask that you follow the schedule below.

Grades 2-6 from 7:20 to 8:00
1st grade from 8:00 to 8:30
Kindergarten from 8:30 to 9:00
Pre-K from 9:00 to 9:30

February 5 at 4:36 PM · Philadelphia, MS ·

I’m back on the #TarWars grind and LOVED the afternoon I got to spend at Philadelphia Elementary School! Not only is Neshoba County the home of Mississippi’s Giant House Party, but it is also the home of some of the most engaged and curious students I’ve spoken to all year! If you’d like me to visit an upper elementary school near you to facilitate this program that I’ve developed with the Mississippi Academy of Family Physicians, contact Mrs. Karen Jones at kjones@riverhillsbank.com! A tobacco-free Mississippi starts with Mississippi’s kids, and I love getting to share my vision of a smoke-free state with them ❤️ #MissMississippi #MSAFP",2020-02-05 16:45:04,,

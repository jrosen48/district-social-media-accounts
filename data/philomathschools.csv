Greetings, Warriors!

We‚Äôre thrilled to spread the word about a project started by a few students at PHS called Charge Forward. The goal of the organization is to give computers to students in need, and close the rapidly growing gap between students with ample technology access, and those without it. The program is entirely free, and once a computer is given to a student, it is theirs to keep, no strings attached. The process to donate is very simple. Simply find unused computers, cables, or whatever unused technology you‚Äôd be willing to give to the cause (even if it‚Äôs broken!), and visit
/chargeforward.tech/donate. Once you submit a donation, a member of their team will meet you wherever is convenient for you, and collect your donation. Afterwards, they clean all information (and potential germs!) from the tech, to protect your private information, and after the process is complete, another student in need gets access to infinite learning opportunities.

Clemens Community Pool has been a treasured resource for Philomath, and across Benton County, since 1960. Many of you have been concerned the pool would have to close due to a lack of funding for critical infrastructure needs. We're proud to announce that the Benton Community Foundation is making a transformational gift of $734,000 to keep the Clemens Community Pool open. Our contribution is possible thanks to the Nitka family's Philomath Community Pool Fund. With this gift, the pool will be able to remain open and continue to serve as a place for all to gather, exercise, and safely learn to swim.

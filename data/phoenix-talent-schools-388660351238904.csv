The work continues at TMS on the Mechanical Upgrades. The new high efficiency boilers and chiller are now in place and the roof is getting prepared for the new units by installing the curbs. The design team was able to continue the using the mechanical cabinets, with upgraded motors, fans, coils, etc. and adding terminal units. These upgrades will continue the life of the systems and provide independent temperature control in each of the classrooms. Additionally, the school had a combination of pneumatic and aging digital controls. This project will replace all of the controls, allowing the district to manage energy usage, Co2 levels, outside air and nightly air flushes.

In addition to the Mechanical upgrades, the fire alarm system is being upgraded to provide a safer environment for students and staff.

Phoenix High School | A new greenhouse at Phoenix High School is being constructed to support the school’s agricultural program.

Adroit Construction recently began erecting a new 3,600 square foot greenhouse at Phoenix High School. The greenhouse will be used by students to grow plants and vegetables while learning horticulture skills and practices.

The new greenhouse will enable students to plant and care for flowers, plants, fruits, and vegetables year round. Students are often members of Future Farmers of America, or FAA, and they will display what they grow at horticulture exhibits during the Jackson County Fair. Even if students do not pursue a career in horticulture, the greenhouse will provide them the opportunity to explore the benefits and rewards of gardening.

In addition to a new track surface, the project extended the covered seating and added “sit walls” that retain the slope of the site while providing areas for spectators to sit.

Phoenix High School has a long tradition of success in athletics. The improvements will afford more community members the opportunity to watch local students participate in athletics even during inclement weather.

Dear Families,
I would like to start by sharing that we appreciate and value each and everyone of you. We are experiencing unprecedented times and we know there is uncertainty on what our education system will look like in the coming weeks. I want to assure you, Phoenix-Talent Schools will have a plan for ALL students to access education as outlined in the Governor's Executive Order.
We have online resources for students/families on our website. These resources include district adopted curriculum and supplemental resources. In addition, we will have our staff contacting families on March 30th to set up individualized instruction and assess student/family needs.
We look forward to partnering with you during these difficult times. We understand there are specific concerns for high school seniors and their families, please know we are prioritizing our support in helping students meet graduation requirements.

Thanks to good weather and the diligent, consistent work by Moore Construction, significant framing progress of the rough decking in Sectors A & C has occurred. Framing has also begun in Sector B.

Adroit Construction has nearly completed the concrete pouring. You can also see the first portion of the stairs take shape, that flow into the commons area in Sector D. This area will have polished concrete.

Take note of the impressive steel post and beam construction in Sector C at the first and second floor open hallways; this illustrates the significant windows to be installed soon.

I am pleased to share that Sienna Bauer is a newly minted STATE CHAMPION!
At the Oregon State Championships in Gresham, she ran the 100m High Hurdles in a time of 14.96a. Just how impressive is her time? Consider this: in the entire history of the 4A-school size (dating back to 1978, when girls started to run the current metric distance and 33” hurdle height), Sienna’s time is the eighth fastest ever!
In so doing, Sienna joins a small sorority of prior Phoenix girls State Champions: Maryl Barker (Mile, 880y), Kathy Pete (Discus), Jacqueline Huxtable (100m), Sandy Bean (Javelin), Dani Jantzer (800m, 1500m), Heather Sullivan (1500m), Emma Amundsen (3000m), and the 4x400m Relays of 2015 and 2016.
She is the first State Champion in this event for Phoenix. The other Phoenix girls who have placed at State in the High Hurdles are Renae Perisho (3rd,4th), Norma Pyle (2nd,3rd,4th), Debbie Jacobson (6th) and Kat Cox (8th). Sienna and Norma are the only three-time Phoenix placers in this event.",0.0,"John Cornet‎Track & Field at Phoenix HS, Ore.

I am pleased to share that Sienna Bauer is a newly minted STATE CHAMPION!
At the Oregon State Championships in Gresham, she ran the 100m High Hurdles in a time of 14.96a. Just how impressive is her time? Consider this: in the entire history of the 4A-school size (dating back to 1978, when girls started to run the current metric distance and 33” hurdle height), Sienna’s time is the eighth fastest ever!
In so doing, Sienna joins a small sorority of prior Phoenix girls State Champions: Maryl Barker (Mile, 880y), Kathy Pete (Discus), Jacqueline Huxtable (100m), Sandy Bean (Javelin), Dani Jantzer (800m, 1500m), Heather Sullivan (1500m), Emma Amundsen (3000m), and the 4x400m Relays of 2015 and 2016.
She is the first State Champion in this event for Phoenix. The other Phoenix girls who have placed at State in the High Hurdles are Renae Perisho (3rd,4th), Norma Pyle (2nd,3rd,4th), Debbie Jacobson (6th) and Kat Cox (8th). Sienna and Norma are the only three-time Phoenix placers in this event.",2019-05-19 21:07:01,,

I love this picture from the Pear Blossom Parade today taken by our PHS Marching Band alum, Bailey Hernandez! Great job to all of our TMS and PHS band members! You all did amazing today!

Big shout outs to our percussion and color guard staff, Kim Porter, Joey Larimer, Scott Morrison and Michael Spencer for their work getting the students ready for today!

Special thanks to all of the extra work by Tammy and MacKenzie Weaver to make sure our uniforms were perfect!

And we couldn’t have done this without all of our booster chaperones who are always there for our awesome band kids!

It's official! Phoenix High School increased the graduation rate by 10%!! 87% of our 2018 graduates walked across the stage! We had the second highest graduation rate in the valley--just slightly behind North Medford! We are still working towards 100%, but we are definitely moving in the right direction. Very proud of our students and staff aboard the Pirate Ship!

This courageous 5-year-old has battled Addison’s Disease her entire life, but remains strong and joyful. She is truly an inspiration!

Special thanks to our local anonymous club sponsors, “Friends of Sparrow,” for providing the means that allows these students to experience #sparrowvision.

I wanted to share a very precious moment with everyone. Liam was adopted as the new Sparrow to his very own school today. He attends kindergarten at Orchard Hill Elementary.

Every child desires to be accepted and embraced by their peers. It’s not always easy to feel like you fit in, and being a 5-year-old “big kindergarten kiddo” can be scary. Then you add medical challenges to that, and it can all be very overwhelming. One might wonder, “how are people going to treat me.”
Well, today was a BIG POWERFUL moment for this sweet boy Liam. His peers heard his story, had a glimpse into his medical journey, and their reactions brought Liam to tears. Tears of complete joy, feelings of acceptance, and reassurance that the entire student body was a friend to this little boy.
Students were cheering, some crying, and they were so happy to embrace Liam.

Liam walked over to me, tears streaming down his face, hugged me, and whispered in my ears...”this was a good idea!!”

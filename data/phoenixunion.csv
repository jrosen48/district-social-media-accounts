Thank you for your continued support and trust in Phoenix Union. The health, safety, and wellness of your student remains our top priority.

Although we cautiously allowed sports conditioning this summer, community spread of COVID still far exceeds state and county benchmarks outlining the safe return to school. In order to maintain the safety of our student-athletes and coaches, we have decided to postpone all in-person sports practices and competition until it is safe to do so. The attachment to this email provides more information regarding this decision.

We are also fully aware that sports is not the only important activity that connects and engages our students. Performing and Fine Arts, JROTC, clubs, and many other programs are critically important to both our staff and students. Once state and county health benchmarks are met, we will also consider the safe return of these important activities.

Davis-Wiley heard a song in her head one day. That lyric turned into a book draft, that draft turned into a self-publishing venture and today, she is a published author whose work ‚ÄúDreamcatcher‚Äù is sold in airport bookstores across the country.

Being a part of the International Baccalaureate program at North, Davis-Wiley is in the process of establishing her own publishing house, Nickelberry. Davis-Wiley anticipates using Nickelberry to help other young, aspiring authors find their audience. #ThisIsWhoWeAre

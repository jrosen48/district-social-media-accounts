MECHS will begin Phase Two of our Pandemic Response Plan on September 14th by transitioning into the ""Switch-Back Hike"" or hybrid model. Students will have the choice of returning to campus or remaining in the virtual learning platform. Students will have the ability to switch from in-person or virtual learning as desired. Each Thursday will be dedicated to virtual learning to make the transition smoother. Be on the lookout for more information and details to come! We can't wait to see you back at school.",2.0,"Mountain Education Charter High School

Please see the attached flyer that will be presented to students who are sent home from school (for a Remote Hike). Students presenting signs or symptoms of COVID-19 or that have had a risk of exposure will be sent home to work virtually. Just becuase we send students home does not mean that the student has COVID-19 or that they should stop working in their coursework. We will always encourage the student to work from home until they can return to campus.",0.0,"Mountain Education Charter High School

Shyanna loved MECHS once she transferred because the teachers were all helpful and pushed her to get graduated. Shyanna says that Mrs. Zuidema and her parents are the reason she got to achieve her goals and graduate. Shyanna plans to attend Tennessee State where she will study to enter into the medical field.

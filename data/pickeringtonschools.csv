The annual Pelotonia ride normally consists of a three-day experience that includes cycling, entertainment and volunteerism while raising funds for cancer research. This year, instead of the three-day event, participants have been challenged to set individual exercise and/or volunteer goals to complete whenever and however they wish by October 31.

Some of our team's goals are to ride 45 miles to honor three Pickerington teachers undergoing cancer treatment, ride 25 miles, ride 50 miles, ride 200 miles by August 31 and run 50 miles by August 31.

The sun shined bright for our Pickerington High School North graduation ceremony! Families remained in their vehicles to snap some photos and watch their senior walk across the stage and become a PHSN alum. Many cheered, clapped and honked to celebrate this memorable moment.

While this may not have been the graduation everyone pictured at the beginning of the school year, it was one that we will always remember! Thank you to everyone who made this a special day for our seniors!

Congratulations PHSN Class of 2020! We have been and always will be #PLSDProud of you!

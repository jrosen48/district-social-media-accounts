EUPSchools: Drive-In Internet Access

Just like the drive-in movie theater our school networks have now become drive-up internet access! We have enabled EUPSchools and EUPCommunity WIFI network access at most K-12 school buildings throughout the Chippewa, Mackinac and Luce Counties.

EUPSchools for school staff and students who connect using their normal school network username and password.

EUPCommunity is for all community members to use for access to the internet.

Drive-in, connect, enjoy the access from your car, and drive out. If you need help, information on how to get help is available on our website: www.eupschools.org/helpdesk

Over the next few days we will launch an interactive map with all available public Internet access that we can collect.

However, attendance will be restricted at all events through this weekend, with updates to be announced Monday, March 16 for the remainder of the girls and boys basketball tournaments.

Boys Basketball District Finals Attendance: Limited to parents, legal guardians, and essential administrators.

For those allowed to be present, there will be no attendance charged.

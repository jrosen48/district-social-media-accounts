It is with deep sadness that we inform you of a heartbreaking loss to our PHS school family. Last night, Jackson Kerby passed away in a single-vehicle accident. Our sincere condolences go out to the family and friends of Jackson. Jackson was a friend to many and was loved by his teachers, coaches, and classmates.

During this time, as the school community processes the tragic news and copes with grief, we will offer counseling and bereavement support services to all our students and staff. Trained professionals will be on hand today and in the coming days to help with the needs of both students and staff.

We are saddened by this profound loss to our school family and will make every effort to support our students in their grief.

I hope your first week of Remote Learning went well, I miss you so much! Wanted to update you on a few things that we have been working on for you guys. First of all I would like to start planning to order our Senior Tee Shirts.

Another cool surprise is in the works, but I'm not telling you!! There is going to be a little something for you to do after you finish your individual Senior pictures on September 25th or October 2nd. I know you guys are coming in on two different days. Plan to stay a few minutes after your pictures. I'll be sending more details a little closer to time.

I can't wait until this Covid is over and we can get back to school. You are going to be such a great Senior Class. Thank you for being patient and hanging in there during this tough time.

I love you guys,

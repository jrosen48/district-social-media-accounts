Oh no not again
It is true no school Thursday
Try again Friday

After much deliberation we will be closing school Thursday Dec. 13th for students and staff. The building will be open after 11am for any staff who want to come and work.

Even though I want to be back in school I got many emails, text, and calls with major concerns about side roads, neighborhood roads, and making sure we take care of our student drivers. I thank you for your feedback as we drive a large portion of the county, but do not see every road!

We currently have a crew on campus to clear our back parking lot and our facilities team will be here tomorrow to make sure every area of campus is good to go for Friday.

Main roads are improved
School road and side roads are not
Roads will freeze no school

PCHS will be closed for students and staff Wednesday December 12th, 2018.

Coach Free and I just left campus and driving many of the roads in Guilford County and Greensboro. We take these decisions very seriously. While the main roads are in good shape many side roads and neighborhoods are still very much hard to navigate and in some areas impassable!

Our school roads and lots are one sheet of solid ice. Driving and walking on campus is dangerous. We have two plow crews who will be working the campus this afternoon and tomorrow to ensure the safety of all students and staff. Also, all melting that occurs today will freeze as the lows will be around 18 tomorrow and will not reach 32 until mid to late morning. All these factors considered we think it is best to take one more day to make sure conditions are safe for everyone. As we would love to be in school, days can be made up but accidents have lasting effects. #staysafe",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1874436955988285&id=485635174868477,,0.0,"Snow Day Three Haiku 🤓

All families want what is best for their children, but they don‚Äôt always realize how absences can add up to academic problems. Sometimes they allow children to miss school when it‚Äôs not absolutely necessary.

At the same time, results of a parent survey suggest that families would be willing to shorten vacations if they believe the absences are affecting academic success.

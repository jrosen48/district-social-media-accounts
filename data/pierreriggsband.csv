Braedon Cunningham

After 6 months of no band, freshman Braedon hit the ground running at the high school. He has already shown his dedication to the program by being a member of marching band and signing up for Jazz Band. He is always on time, always on task, and is quick to pick up new concepts. In the first two weeks of school, he has shown up for more voluntary lessons than anyone else, and has a clear goal in mind of what he would like to accomplish with his instrument. He has already impressed the student leaders and myself with his commitment and willingness to learn.

Governor Gymnastics Senior Spotlight

Jasmine Rounds | Senior

Favorite event to compete is Beam

Favorite meet snack is Puppy chow or cheezits

Favorite memory is Team day at state 2019 when all 5 competing girls stuck their beam routines. I wasn't competing, but it was really cool to be a part of the team when it happened and to be cheering on each girl as they went.

Something that might surprise you about me is I actually don't like naps. I feel more tired after taking one than when I was first awake.

Planning to attend SDSU and major in pre-med human biology and do Air Force ROTC

I would travel to Paris. I've always wanted to go there.

My favorite athlete is Simone Biles

The best advice I can give future gymnasts is to make friends with the girls on the team. Not knowing anyone could make practice less enjoyable to go to, so make friends and just have fun.",0.0,"That‚Äôs our drum major! Go Jasmine!

We have one driver and could still use one more!

The Pride of the Dakotas needs you! We are looking for two volunteers willing to donate their time, pickup, and gas to pull our equipment trailers to Minneapolis this weekend as we are performing at the Youth in Music Marching Band Championships. Here are the particulars:

We would load up at 6:45am and depart Brookings at 7:15am Saturday October 12th. We will travel to downtown Minneapolis to US Bank Stadium.

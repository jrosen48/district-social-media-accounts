We have the garden outlined with this tape. Help yourself to the produce and pay the school’s business office what you feel you can. What a wonderful opportunity to teach your kids how produce is grown as welll as getting a fresh and nutritious meal! If you can’t afford to pay anything, then don’t. Currently, we have broccoli, peas, radishes, kale, zucchini and spaghetti squash available. The raspberries and strawberries are nearly ready too. Please know that areas outside of the red and white tape are private citizens’ gardens that they labored in and are not to be touched.",4.0,"Pierz HS CSA Garden

I know this is scary. I know you miss seeing your teachers and your classmates. I know it's disappointing that many of the important end-of-school activities have been canceled. I know there are athletes out there who were prepared to go win state championships on diamonds and fields across the state.

But what you are doing matters. Your sacrifice is keeping people safe. You are protecting people. Someday when you have children of your own. You will tell them about this moment in history and what you did to help the people of your state. Thank you."" - Minnesota Governor Tim Walz",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1597117853773913&id=422361654582878,,0.0,"As we start week two of distance learning, we would like to recognize the sacrifice our students are making everyday. Thank you, students, for giving your best during this difficult time. Gov. Tim Walz said it best during his State of the State address:

""As a dad and as a former teacher, I want to speak directly to our children for a moment.

Here is a ""magic"" trick you can do to excite children about reading or just for fun! Fold one piece of a paper towel and draw something at the front side using a permanent marker. Open paper towel and trace the drawing on the other page. Now turn your picture in something else, get creative and use regular felt tip pens for some colour! Fold it back and drop it in the water! Paper towel will quickly absorb the water and reveal the whole picture

February is “I Love to Read Month” and to celebrate, a terrific event was put on by the Pierz Pioneer Elementary PTO group tonight! With the lunchroom absolutely packed with avid young readers and parents, a night of Bingo was held with each winner allowed to come forward and choose a free book! We had smiling excited children racing to the front to make sure they had a “good bingo” and then choosing their book. One youngster even requested that he get a chance to be a special “caller.” Thanks for the fun event Pioneer Elementary PTO!",0.0,"Another successful Bingo for Books—thank you Pioneer PTO and families for making this such a fun night!

The Pierz Pizzazz Dance Team nailed their Kick routine at Wadena-Deer Creek High School today in the Section 4A Tournament and took 2nd Place, which qualifies them for the Class A State Tournament! Section 4A is traditionally one of the very strongest Sections to come out of from the entire State so this is a huge accomplishment for the team! The Jazz team took 4th and just missed out on a trip to State as the top 3 teams in each category qualify. The Pizzazz will compete at Target Center in Minneapolis in the Class A Kick Division on Saturday, February 15th! #hardwork #dedication photo cred: Katelyn Hoffman!

Rick Grammond is with Lisa Boeder Poster.
February 1 at 7:23 PM ·

The Pierz Pizzazz Dance Team nailed their Kick routine at Wadena-Deer Creek High School today in the Section 4A Tournament and took 2nd Place, which qualifies them for the Class A State Tournament! Section 4A is traditionally one of the very strongest Sections to come out of from the entire State so this is a huge accomplishment for the team! The Jazz team took 4th and just missed out on a trip to State as the top 3 teams in each category qualify. The Pizzazz will compete at Target Center in Minneapolis in the Class A Kick Division on Saturday, February 15th! #hardwork #dedication photo cred: Katelyn Hoffman!

The Football parking lot is North of Halenbeck Hall and you’ll need to walk across the bridge to get there!",8.0,"Rick Grammond

The online registration link is open for you to register your student(s) for the 2020-2021 school. The online registration process takes the place of most of the beginning of the year paperwork. Please take the time to log onto www.teacherease and complete the online registration. Fees at the high school will not be generated until August 7, 2020, so they will not be available for you to pay at the high school level until August 10, 2020. Please email me at agreger@pikeland.org with any questions.

We are working on posting some resources for you to review.

Sometime after July 4, you will be given an opportunity to sign up with your parents to attend one of several orientation sessions that I will hold.

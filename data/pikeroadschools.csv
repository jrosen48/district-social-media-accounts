""Let me tell you about a special young man in our class family named Jose Perez. Jose is a gentle learner who is very attentive. He is one of the sweetest learners that I know and always goes above and beyond.

A few adjectives that I can use to describe him best are goal oriented (SERIOUSLY), prepared, intentional, polite, confident, assertive, ambitious, and responsible.

If ever there was anything that needed to be done in our learning space, Jose would be one of the first to get it done. This is Jose's third year at PRES and his family will be relocating this year; however, I know wherever he goes he will continue to make an impact.

This year with Jose has been nothing short of amazing and I am more than happy to have been chosen to be his lead learner this year.""

""Let me tell you about a special young man in our class family named Jose Perez. Jose is a gentle learner who is very attentive. He is one of the sweetest learners that I know and always goes above and beyond.

A few adjectives that I can use to describe him best are goal oriented (SERIOUSLY), prepared, intentional, polite, confident, assertive, ambitious, and responsible.

Beth,
You are a force to be reckon with when you bring your A-Game on the field. You came in last year willing to fill any spot necessary and at the time we needed a first baseman. You stepped into that position and never looked back. There is a lot of trust that goes into that position. Your team trusts you and I trust you. You’re abilities go beyond the softball field though, you have been involved in more than a normal teenager and you shine through all of it. I pray that you see your true potential like your coaches see and that you keep working hard to accomplish all of your goals and ambitions for life. So happy that you and your family came to Pike Road!

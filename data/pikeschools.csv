At their meeting on Thursday, the School Board approved the Back to School schedule. The school schedule will begin a week later than originally planned in order to give families more time to review their options, allow schools additional time to plan, and also monitor the data trends of COVID-19.

School will begin for students on August 11, 2020 following our traditional in-person learning schedule. In addition, we will offer a virtual school option for parents/guardians who wish to make that selection. Students enrolled in the virtual program will follow the same calendar beginning on the same day, August 11th. Due to our delayed start, adjustments will be made to our previously scheduled Fall and Thanksgiving Break schedules.

If at any time it becomes necessary to pause in-person learning, we will be prepared to move to remote learning.

Out of an abundance of caution, the decision has been made to cancel Eyes on Pike, which was scheduled to be held at Pike High School this Friday, March 13th. The large crowds the event draws and the hands-on nature of the activities presented would make following the CDC recommendations difficult. Although we very much look forward to this annual community celebration of Pike Excellence, the health, safety, and well-being, of our students, staff, and community is our top priority. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your continued support.

Our incredible art educator at Eagle Creek Elementary School, Tina Banks, and her students have been spreading kindness throughout our community in the most beautiful ways. Students made clay roses for the Cancer Center, and created beautiful clay hearts for Wheeler Mission for Women and Children, our friends at the Robin Run Retirement Center, and for anyone who visits the Eagle Creek Trail across from the school. Kudos to Ms. Banks and our ECES students for using their creativity to show our community how much they care.

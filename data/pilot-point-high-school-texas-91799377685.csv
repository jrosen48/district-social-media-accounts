Our students really do care about each other and I watched their eagerness to learn how to treat each other better in class after class.

On Monday, April 6th,, we will be handing out 1 pound of pulled pork per person at the high school pick up and drop off area - ""front doors."" Donations are accepted and all proceeds go to the FFA.

Morgan Wilson is a favorite around here, and there's a very simple reason why--she is a BLAST to pick on. Morgan is a great kid who has a great personality, and she's the type of kid we love having walk the hallways of Pilot Point High School.

Morgan is a senior, and has been very active with our FFA program. She has competed in several different events and has also shown pigs. Morgan played volleyball for two years and is also a member of our Student Council.

She's an A student, who will finish up her high school career with a total of twelve hours of dual credit.

As for her next step, Morgan will be attending Grayson College, where she plans to study either radiology or nursing.

Keep up the great work, Morgan!

One of the reasons we like doing ""Just A Good Kid"" is because it forces us to really sit back and watch our kids. We have a lot of great kids who will sneak right past you if you're not watching closely, and Maripaz is one of those kids. Quiet and shy, Maripaz will never make a fuss about anything and will just plug along and do exactly what she needs to do.

Maripaz is a sharp kid. She makes mostly A's in her classes, and she is involved in our dual credit program, as well as taking AP World History. She is a member of Student Council, and this year she's going to be a part of UIL One-Act Play. She also plays the cello in an orchestra through UNT.

However, her true passion is reading and writing. She loves to write, and her goal is to go to college to study writing and learn to write screenplays and novels.

Maripaz, keep up the good work!

Hope is a senior, and she moved here her junior year. What an addition! She fit right in as soon as she got here. An incredibly hard worker; she's currently in the top ten percent of her class. She plays basketball, where she serves as a team captain, plays golf, is involved with UIL Social Studies and FCCLA, and also serves as the PPHS Yearbook editor.

After high school, Hope wants to attend the University of Kansas and major in secondary education, with a focus on history. After that, she wants to become a history teacher--and she'll make a great one!

Well, he did it! Dravyn, a deal's a deal.

Truth be told, Dravyn is a favorite around here for a lot of reasons. One, he is funny as all get out, and he is incredibly fun to pick on (it doesn't take much to set him off). Most importantly, he's a kid that has really come on the last year or so. He gets along with everyone. He never gets into trouble at all, and he'll always do what you ask him to do. Oh, he'll gripe, but he'll do it. He is honest to a fault and it's really hard not to like the kid a lot.

Dravyn, keep up the good work. We are proud of you!

When you talk about the best of the best around PPHS, McKenzie Watland's name always gets thrown into the mix. McKenzie is a senior, and she is certainly one that we're going to hate to see go. She's sharp, she's a hard worker, and the thing I've always been impressed with the most about McKenzie is that she's incredibly level-headed, fair, and honest. Everyone loves this kid.

McKenzie has had a stellar high school career. She's the president of the National Honor Society, carrying a 4.0. She has 30-plus hours of dual credit, is a member of Student Council, and competes in FFA on the Skills Team. She has also been a cheerleader for four years, serving as a captain for two years.

But the thing McKenzie's most proud of? She'll be the first in her family to attend college. She has just recently been accepted to Ole Miss.

Congratulations, McKenzie!

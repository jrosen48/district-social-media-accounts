Last week, Mrs. Stevens had given him to Mrs Howser for all her hard work this year and being an exceptional teammate! We are so fortunate to have her in our PPIS family!

This week the honor goes to Mrs. Ryan who has done a tremendous job in her first year teaching! She goes above and beating each day and has handled the stresses of being a first year teacher with a smile on her face everyday!

Great job ladies and thanks for all you do!",2018-04-26 11:43:48,,

A letter from Principal Robyn Leslie

Welcome to online learning at Pilot Point Middle School. Please know that I am here to support the parents and students as we venture into virtual learning. Our teachers are working diligently to create purposeful and quality lessons as your student works from home. An entire week of lessons will be updated every Monday morning. As you are assisting your child in completing these lessons, please remind your child to designate a specific area to do their online learning and to take frequent breaks. Feel free to email your child’s teacher with any questions. You may also reach out to me at rleslie@pilotpointisd.com with any questions or suggestions.

(If you are having any technical issues, please contact your student’s teacher. If you do not have the ability to access the online content, please email me, and we will work on shipping a paper packet to your address.)

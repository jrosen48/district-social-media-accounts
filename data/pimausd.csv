Always remember: YOU'RE DOING THE WORK!

.. If you tried to reach a parent all week, and haven't heard back, you're doing the work.

.. If you spent 5 hours trying to broadcast your support sessions live, and still haven't figured it out, you're doing the work.

.. If you attempted to help 50 students, and only 3 logged on, you're doing the work.

.. If you emailed students and offered help, and none of them responded, you're doing the work.

.. If you spent all day learning a new online platform, and you realized it's no good, you're doing the work.

.. If you are concerned about getting students connected to learning, you're doing the work.

Focus on what you ATTEMPTED, ACCOMPLISHED and LEARNED this week. Most of the kids have not connected with a full lesson this week, but I know they are learning so much. The most important lesson they learned is how much their school community cares about them.

I am grateful in the midst of this abnormality, I work with such a dedicated group of educators.

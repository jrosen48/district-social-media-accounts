In 43 years in the sports writing business you meet a lot of interesting people. Here’s another:
I had the pleasure to write about Pine Island MN High School’s storied baseball coach Craig Anderson. When he retired in 2016 after a 36-year stint at Pine Island his record was 505-359. He also coached American Legion and Babe Ruth baseball. His 1995 Legion team won a state championship. Craig received a bushel of honors. Among them was becoming the first Minnesotan to be inducted into the National High School Hall of Fame. But the most important thing he did had nothing to do with baseball. He donated a kidney to younger brother Kevin. “His kidneys were failing and if he was to have any quality of life, he needed a kidney transplant,” Craig said. “I volunteered to give him one of mine and when we found out I was a match we went ahead with the transplant. That’s the least I could do for a brother. That was more important than a baseball game.”",5.0,"Bob Brown

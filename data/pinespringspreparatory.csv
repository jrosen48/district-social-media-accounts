While we await additional guidance that may come from the state, we are busy putting together possible scenarios for what the new school year schedule may look like at PSPA. As a friendly reminder, if you have not yet participated in the brief online survey regarding possible scheduling scenarios for the new school year, please do so by going to https://forms.gle/cdXEWZ8ubsvKFJyU9 .

We have completed our first week of remote instruction and we want to hear from you. Check your email for a link to a family survey. We will use the information gathered from this survey during our planning meetings next week.

On April 10th and 13th school will be ""closed"" so no instruction will be delivered on those days. Assignments that are given over the next several weeks may be graded but will not be recorded in Powerschool. Grades and feedback will be sent to parents but we are awaiting instruction from the state as to how grades will be delivered for 4th quarter. Feel free to log into Powerschool next week to check out 3rd quarter grades.

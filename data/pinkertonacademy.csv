“And now it’s time for the worm himself, Mr. Adam Furgal! Adam has been a dedicated member of the PA Players since his freshman year. He has performed in plays and musicals and served as an officer. The one word I would use to describe Adam (other than “worm”) is FRIEND. So many people across campus call Adam their FRIEND. He has been the glue holding together so many friend groups in our club. Adam is a generous person who so many people turn to when they need a shoulder to cry on, a bit of advice, or a good laugh. In so many ways, Adam has been integral to the identity of our club over the past four years. His friendly face for new members and super polite way of dealing with adults has elevated our club’s profile across the whole campus. It’s hard to imagine the PA Players without Adam Furgal.

“This one makes me very sad. Eliz Herron is the last of a long line of Herrons who have come through the arts program at Pinkerton and each and every one of them have excelled. When I think of Eliz, the word that comes to mind is JOY. If you have met her, you know that she just has a real love of life and spreads joy throughout the 1R hallway (and probably everywhere else on campus). I will so miss hearing the Herron laugh and the inevitable laughter that came from her friends after she laughed about something. Eliz is a loyal friend and a real lover of music and theatre. It’s hard to imagine what my days will be like without Eliz popping into my office with a huge smile and slightly mischievous look in her eye. I know that she will spread JOY all over campus at Xavier and then bring it to her future patients.”

-Matt Cahoon, Club Advisor

Before you settle down on this nice Friday night, give a listen to Elizabeth’s (PA Class of 2020) beautiful voice singing “I Dreamed a Dream” from Les Miserables.

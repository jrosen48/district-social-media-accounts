The Washington State Broadband Office and state Public Works Board have launched a mapping initiative to identify gaps in high-speed internet service and areas of broadband infrastructure needs in order to advance the state’s goal to have universal broadband access in Washington by 2024.

The first step is for Washington residents to perform a one-minute access and speed survey found at broadband.wa.gov. Using the easy-to-follow instructions and a simple link, anyone can complete the speed test at home using any computer or mobile device.

Those with no internet access at their homes are encouraged to visit a local library or drive-in hotspot in their community, or use their mobile device to take the survey and check the “no available service” button to record their physical address. This simple access and speed survey will result in statistically valid data and mapping for decision makers to plot a course for Washington’s ambitious broadband expansion plans.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10158504762491221&id=162424936220,,0.0,"State Broadband Office needs you to help identify low or no high-speed internet service areas.

At this time, the family chromebook check-out form for requesting a chromebook has temporarily been removed from the district website. Due to the large request and time to set each Chromebook up, the form will not be accessible until we can meet the requests submitted at this time.

We will work on distributing all chromebooks that were requested prior to 4:00 pm on March 30, 2020. We will then set up an alternate date and time for chromebook distribution for all requests that were submitted after that cut off time.

Dear Pioneer Families,

I am sure that by now many of you have heard the news that Governor Inslee has closed all private and public schools in Snohomish, King and Pierce Counties.

I want to reassure families that our paramount duty is to ensure the safety of our students, staff and community. We are closely monitoring this changing situation and are continuing to closely partner with our local and state agencies. At this time, there has not been guidance to close schools in Mason County.

Tomorrow morning there will be a conference with state leaders and superintendents, where I expect to receive additional information and direction. I will update families, staff and the community as more information becomes available.

Please feel free to reach out to your school principals or the district office with additional questions.

Great turn out tonight for our annual Family Math Night. We had 329 tonight which is by far the biggest turn out we have ever had. Great evening of math games, food, treats, friends and family.

Good evening Pioneer families,

The first day of school begins tomorrow with doors opening at 8:10 am. We are excited to have all of our returning Eagle students for the 2019-20 school year. Staff have been hard at work getting their rooms and school ready for all of our great kids.

A couple of notes and highlights as we begin the school year.

1. Every Wednesday including tomorrow is an early release at 2:00 pm.

2. Beginnig this year, all changes for the bus must be communicated by 1:00 pm that day of the change so please plan accordingly.

3. As an AVID school all students will be provided a binder and supplies that will be used in all classes. These supplies will be coming home almost daily. Please work with your child to make sure they have these items daily and not left at home or misplaced as it is a big part of their expectations for all classes.

Again, we are excited for the new year and can not wait to see all of you.

It is with bitter-sweet sentiment that we announce some changes at Pioneer Elementary School for this upcoming 2019-20 school year. Mrs. Jodi Schaefer has resigned her position as school principal and accepted another position closer to home. We will miss her energy and support of our students and staff. It is then, with great excitement, that we announce Mrs. Amy Koster, former Assistant Principal at Pioneer Elementary, as the new Principal. Mrs. Koster has strong passions and beliefs for student learning and engagement, developing and strengthening effective teaching practices, and working closely with our Pioneer families and community. She will do an excellent job in serving all our students, staff, and families. When you get a chance, feel free to wish them both success and wellness in their next professional journey. Enjoy the remainder of your summer and we sincerely look forward to seeing all our families and students at Open House Thursday, August 29th and our first day of school, Wednesday, September 4, 2019",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157344161241221&id=162424936220,,0.0,"Dearest Pioneer Community,

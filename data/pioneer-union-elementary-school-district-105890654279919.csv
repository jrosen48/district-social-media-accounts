We have a few weeks left of school and we have all had significant changes in our lives. This week’s Community Connections activity is a COVID-19 Time Capsule. Hanford Parks and Recreation Department posted it to their Facebook page a few days ago. You can print it and fill in the many different sections. When we all look back at this time frame next year, or a few years from now, this Time Capsule will allow us to see where we were and how much we have changed. Keep your chin up!! We are here for you!!



In health and well-being,

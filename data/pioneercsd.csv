People have asked and we do not have any definite answers yet. I’m am so sorry folks. This is out of our control. Lisa- has been in contact with the company. The company did place a hold on our items which was good. Since the school is in a hard close the items can not be delivered there. With the wonderful support of the Delevan Families the order is rather large (thank you) and will need to be sorted. So... we are working out the kinks. Thought this would have been done before today. Again I personally apologize. Please, be patient with us as this has never happened before. Ever. 😉

On March 27th the first grade took a trip to the Boston Children's Museum.

We were able to see a special exhibit called: Money Matters. At this exhibit, the students got to role play as community members being both workers and consumers. They were barbers, grocery clerks, cafe workers, and more. We learned a little bit about the importance of spending our money wisely. We had a fun filled day of exploration.

As you are likely aware, the Unified Government has issued a public health order requiring residents to stay at home. The order goes into effect Tuesday, March 24, as of 12:00 a.m. and remains in effect until Thursday, April 23. To that end, we wanted to extend one more opportunity for students in all schools to check out technology prior to the stay at home order going into effect. This is open to students K-12 who still need access to a device for continuous learning between now and the end of the academic year. Families with more than one student in grades K-5 will be limited to one device per family in order to ensure enough devices are available.

Staff will be available at Piper High School on Monday, March 23 from 10:00 a.m. – 1:00 p.m. for device checkout. If possible, an adult should be present to sign for the device. However, we understand this is short notice and will make accommodations for students who are not able to attend with an adult.

We will provide additional details to the community and staff once we receive guidance from the Kansas State Department of Education regarding the requirements and recommendations of the continuous learning plan.

Trunk or Treat will move inside Piper High School due to weather. The event will open at 6:30 pm and conclude at 8:00 pm. Hopefully, the weather will hold off enough we can still have some fun and students can also participate in the Pumpkin Patch hosted by Piper High School at the same time.

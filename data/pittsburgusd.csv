Since the beginning of time we have taught our children face to face from generation to generation.
Throwing our kids in front of a screen is not part of the natural learning process. We all know this and we all feel it. Everyone is yearning to return to our classroom to interact with real human beings.

Meanwhile, our kids do their best and we have to accept that is their best until we return them to a more nurturing process that gets them ready to be adults.

Our teachers became teachers because of a natural drive within them to prepare younger generations to become successful adults. Teaching in front of a computer is hard for our teachers as well. However, we must praise our teachers for doing what they do well, that is taking a very difficult situation and pushing through to reach and teach our kids and families.

So, a huge thank you to the most amazing teachers and families that are working together to continue our education and get our kids back into the classroom safely.

Here's more info about the tool. To help you find food, Contra Costa County has a new GIS (global information system) mapping tool. It can be used on any mobile device, just like searching for the nearest gas station or cafe on your phone.

The tool, developed by the County's IT Department, incorporates data from the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano, school districts, senior centers, and other food organizations. It was developed in partnership with 211 Contra Costa, the crisis center. Supervisor Gioia’s office also contributed to the map's development.

Reminder, today is Cesar Chavez Day and it is a school holiday. Exception - Highlands has a makeup day today. We know the kids are at home so a school holiday seems odd.
Wondering What is Cesar Chavez Day?
In 1993, Chavez's family and friends established the Cesar E. Chavez Foundation to honor and celebrate his legacy and educate people about his life and work. The Foundation encourages all people, especially youth, to embody his motto, Si Se Peude; It Can Be Done. Chavez's birthday, March 31, is already a holiday in eight states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Michigan, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin and many other localities across the country. During this day of service, students are encouraged to get involved in their communities by identifying issues and working to resolve them. Here’s a link with info to share with kids about what today means and the legacy of Cesar Chavez. https://www.ducksters.com/biography/cesar_chavez.php

We would like to interrupt your timeline to share a POSITIVE story out of Pittsburg, CA.

Abdul Ahmed and his family have owned the Golden Star Market on West 10th street for more than two decades.

Many of the residents who live nearby, rely on the market for their fresh produce, dairy, meat, and more.

During this COVID-19 pandemic, the owners of the Golden Star Market noticed that many of their most vulnerable customers did not have enough food to get them through one week.

They decided to gather their resources and give back.

In one day, they handed out 120 care packages to the children and senior citizens in the community.

We would like to thank Golden Star Market for helping out our community during this time.

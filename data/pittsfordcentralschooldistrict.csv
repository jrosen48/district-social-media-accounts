Jeremiah is an honor student, has been a part of the Mendon Boys Varsity Soccer team since his sophomore year, was named Rookie of the Year his sophomore year, was selected for the All Monroe County 2nd Team his junior year, and will be a team captain this year.

As part of this project, students were encouraged to write letters and cards, draw pictures, and create videos to express their gratitude and support for essential workers.

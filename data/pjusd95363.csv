Dear Parents:
Yesterday, our county public health officer ordered that schools remain closed as a result of the COVID-19 epidemic. As a result, the Patterson Joint Unified School District will be postponing the start of school until September 8th, the day after Labor Day. We hope that by this time, schools in Stanislaus County will be able to reopen at full capacity. If we are unable to open by September, our staff is prepared to continue providing distance learning or a hybrid model of instruction for our students.
A school reopening mailer with more details will be sent to all families this weekend. This information will also be posted to our website, and distributed through PeachJar later today.
We are also hosting an informational WebEx meeting for all families on Wednesday, July 22 at 6 p.m. The WebEx link will be included in your PeachJar communication.
As always, our best wishes to you and your family. Please stay healthy and safe during these difficult times.

Yesterday, our county public health officer ordered that schools remain closed as a result of the COVID-19 epidemic. As a result, the Patterson Joint Unified School District will be postponing the start of school until September 8th, the day after Labor Day. We hope that by this time, schools in Stanislaus County will be able to reopen at full capacity. If we are unable to open by September, our staff is prepared to continue providing distance learning or a hybrid model of instruction for our students.
A school reopening mailer with more details will be sent to all families this weekend. This information will also be posted to our website, and distributed through PeachJar later today.
We are also hosting an informational WebEx meeting for all families on Wednesday, July 22 at 6 p.m. The WebEx link will be included in your PeachJar communication.
As always, our best wishes to you and your family. Please stay healthy and safe during these difficult times.

Even when we follow all of the self-care tips shared this week, there will be times where we just need some extra help… and that’s perfectly okay! If you need help, ask for help. If a friend or someone you know needs help, ask them if you can help or find someone who can. Sometimes that just means sitting with someone who is sad and sometimes it means finding an adult to help when things are really bad.

People tell us all the time that we should get lots of exercise, but sometimes we just feel like sitting on the couch. But did you know that getting exercise actually gives you energy? Exercising at least three days every week will also decrease stress and improve happiness. Getting active outdoors is even better! Nature and sunlight can actually improve our mood and boost focus. So get out there and have fun to take care of yourself!

Did you know your mind needs good nutrition and sleep to stay healthy, just like the rest of your body? Fruit and vegetables may not be your favorite things to eat, but these provide important fuel to help keep you healthy, happy and ready to learn. Find your favorite fruits and vegetables and eat more of those than any other types of food in your meals. Drink lots of water every day and reach for water when you feel thirsty.

Did you also know that going to bed at the same time every night can help you fall asleep faster and get better sleep? Everyone should get at least 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Avoid screen time 30 minutes before bedtime and shut off your cell phones and video games through the night. Good sleep will help you feel happy and energetic throughout the day, so remember to keep a good sleep schedule every night!

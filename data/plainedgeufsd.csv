This was part of a larger event, organized by the Schwarting PTA where veterans read to elementary students, patriotic short stories. The elementary and HS students alike were actively engaged, collectively intrigued, and visibly grateful. The collaboration for this event across buildings and community was truly inspiring. Remember to thank those who served our country, not just today but every day. Veterans Featured: Joseph Tilleli, John Cronin, Stephen Paskor, Ivan Montanez, Kevin Hasson, Michael Kinsley.

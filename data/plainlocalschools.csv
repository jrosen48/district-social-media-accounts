Congratulations to our 2020 ""Ruby Award for Women Helping Women"" winners! Frazer Elementary teachers Jessy Tsoufiou and Maggie O’Brian co-founded the Fierce Females in Fall 2018. The confidence and kindness-building program for fourth grade girls embraces the motto, “Learn, Lead, and Love.” Students participate in service projects and lessons to build confidence in their abilities and make them less troubled by peer pressure and social environments. Professional women from across the country present powerful messages to the group. Emphasis is placed on spreading kindness and the importance of giving back. Daily, the girls empower each other by supporting one another as they work to achieve their goals.

Help us celebrate Jessy and Maggie at our Virtual Celebration of Women event on Thursday September 17th, 2020. Registration for the FREE event is available now at www.bestforwomencanton.org or www.tinyurl.com/virtualeachforequal

2020 GOHS Senior Dancers",13.0,"“When you dance, your purpose is not to get to a certain place on the floor. It’s to enjoy each step along the way.”
– Wayne Dyer

Our senior dance students were not able to perform for their final recital, check out this amazing video that the parents of Brooke Haines put together with director Jackie Blaydes as a special send off for the senior dancers!

Wishing each and every one of you the best!

C&A's Trauma Program Manager Mary Kreitz offers this advice in her blog post to parents of high school seniors in how to deal with the emotions their son/daughter is experiencing.

1. Don’t minimize what your child is going through. It may be tempting to say that, compared to people dying, these losses are trivial. Even if you’re thinking it, don’t say it out loud! Your child’s losses are real. If they think it matters, it matters. This may actually be the worst thing that ever happened to them and it is totally appropriate to grieve for the losses. Acknowledge the losses by saying something like, “I know how important that was to you” or “I know you were really looking forward to that.”

C&A's Trauma Program Manager Mary Kreitz offers this advice in her blog post to parents of high school seniors in how to deal with the emotions their son/daughter is experiencing.

1. Don’t minimize what your child is going through. It may be tempting to say that, compared to people dying, these losses are trivial. Even if you’re thinking it, don’t say it out loud! Your child’s losses are real. If they think it matters, it matters. This may actually be the worst thing that ever happened to them and it is totally appropriate to grieve for the losses. Acknowledge the losses by saying something like, “I know how important that was to you” or “I know you were really looking forward to that.”

Congratulations to our 2020 ""Ruby Award for Women Helping Women"" winners! Frazer Elementary teachers Jessy Tsoufiou and Maggie O’Brian co-founded the Fierce Females in Fall 2018. The confidence and kindness-building program for fourth grade girls embraces the motto, “Learn, Lead, and Love.” Students participate in service projects and lessons to build confidence in their abilities and make them less troubled by peer pressure and social environments. Professional women from across the country present powerful messages to the group. Emphasis is placed on spreading kindness and the importance of giving back. Daily, the girls empower each other by supporting one another as they work to achieve their goals.

Help us celebrate Jessy and Maggie at our Celebration of Women event on Friday, March 20th. Tickets are available now at www.bestforwomencanton.org

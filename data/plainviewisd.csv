The 2019-2020 Plainview Athletic Banquet was scheduled for tonight, May 5th. Unfortunately, we were not able to have this event but nonetheless we want to do all we can to honor our seniors with the video (located in the previous post). Just like at the banquet, we want to hopefully answer any questions you may have (see below).

1. Number of years in a particular sport reflects the number of years the student athlete participated at the varsity level. All student athletes were allowed to check for accuracy before spring break.

2. TOP DOGS - Top Dogs were selected by their peers as to whom best represented their sport as a Bulldog or Lady Dog.

3. Mr. and Miss PHS - This award is presented to the highest academically ranked Bulldog and Lady Dog who participated in 3 or more sports. Our co-Mr. PHS award winners were back to back in class ranking/average.

4. MISTAKES - We hope there aren't any, but feel free to contact the athletic office if there are and we will do all we can to correct them.

We’ve had a couple of questions about food delivery, locations, and whether or not your child has to be present.

Just to clarify:

- - Food is served from 11 to 1 Monday- Friday.

- -We will not be delivering. You have to go to one of the five locations to get food for children.
ASH
PHS
Lakeside
Thunderbird
Hillcrest

- - Your children must be present in order to get meals. Dr.Sanchez state’s in the board meeting students have to be with you in order to get meals. (Please reference board meeting YouTube posted at 1:22:45.)

Further updates will be posted, we are trying to ensure that our students are being served, within the lines of this system not being abused.

Thank you!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10158268154886477&id=209505321476,,0.0,"Good Afternoon!
We’ve had a couple of questions about food delivery, locations, and whether or not your child has to be present.

Just to clarify:

- - Food is served from 11 to 1 Monday- Friday.

- -We will not be delivering. You have to go to one of the five locations to get food for children.
ASH
PHS
Lakeside
Thunderbird
Hillcrest

- - Your children must be present in order to get meals. Dr.Sanchez state’s in the board meeting students have to be with you in order to get meals. (Please reference board meeting YouTube posted at 1:22:45.)

Further updates will be posted, we are trying to ensure that our students are being served, within the lines of this system not being abused.

Good morning,

Our coaching staffs have noticed numerous Bulldog and Lady Dog athletes are contracting a pretty severe stomach bug in the last few days. Our trainer, in conjunction with local physicians, encourages us to make sure that if your child has this to have them drink plenty of Gatorade (or similar electrolyte replacing drink) and add soup to their diet. We don't want any of our students becoming dehydrated in addition to battling the illness. We are going to disinfect our locker rooms/facilities as well.

PHS Summer School students needing to re-test for STAAR EOCs will be testing on the following days:

Monday, June 24 – ELA 1
Tuesday, June 25 – Algebra 1 / US History
Wednesday, June 26 – ELA II
Thursday, June 27 – Biology

Students need to report to their testing rooms at 8:00 am. Breakfast is available to students in the PHS cafeteria from 7:30 to 8:15. We recommend you do not allow your child to bring a phone, MP3 player, camera or game system to school on testing days. A student who has possession of a cell phone or other electronic device during testing risks having his/her test invalidated.

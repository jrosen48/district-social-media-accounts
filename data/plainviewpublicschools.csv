I can't thank everyone enough for all the help running the district tournament. The only person I will individually name is my wife. She planned and lined up help for weeks. She did an outstanding job.

Every wrestler that we put on the mat gave great effort in every match. Crowd was great, accommodations were fantastic, several great matches, things went well.

I had several people tell me that this was one of the best run districts that they have been to over the years. It takes a lot of people to make that happen.

IT'S UP! The online store is up and going! Go to www.nebraskascreenprinting.com. Go to ""Shop"" (on the right-hand side) then go down to ""Plainview Pirates Apparel"". There are 3 sales this time, so you can choose Plainview Pirates Apparel, Plainview Basketball and Plainview Wrestling. The store is open from today until Monday, November 25th at 10:00 a.m. We still have toddler sizes, but have added some items to help you complete your Christmas lists. The orders will be here approximately around dismissal for Christmas break. I will post pick up instructions here on our page when the items arrive, so keep an eye out for that. Flyers will be coming home this week, but are not necessary to place an order. Thank you for your support and your patience!",0.0,"NEBRASKASCREENPRINTING.COM

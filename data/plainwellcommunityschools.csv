CLEANING PROTOCOLS: We will be working diligently to maintain clean and safe school buildings and classrooms for our students. Each classroom and building will be disinfected every 4 hours plus normal cleaning nightly. Wednesday will be used for additional cleaning of certain low traffic / low risk areas but all high use areas will be cleaned daily. All high touch surfaces will be disinfected every 4 hours, this includes desks, door knobs, handrails, bathroom areas, and other classroom/office/common area surfaces. In addition, classroom teachers or support staff will wipe down the students desks every time students exit the room at the elementary or after every period at the secondary level with EPA-approved disinfectant.

So this year an actual doctor administered physical is not required (unless your child did not participate in PHS athletics last school year), BUT the MHSAA is requiring us to collect a 2 page health questionnaire with parental signatures on that form. We have posted it on the school website under athletics (or see link below) to print it/fill out both sides completely and sign where indicated. To view the questionnaire, please visit: https://www.plainwellschools.org/2/Content2/athletics.

Completed forms may be dropped off at the Administrative Office during the summer months, they are open Monday through Friday from 7:30am to 4:00pm or you may mail them to:

Per the executive order from the Governor, starting tomorrow all staff will stay home unless otherwise designated. Based on this executive order Food Service will continue to provide meals for students on the current posted schedule through spring break. The district will also ensure buildings are secure and operating, central office will be closed but will maintain limited designated staff based on need to complete necessary tasks only (financials, bills, payroll, communications). We will continue to work with parents and students as needed online, through email, YouTube, and various other platforms. We will do our absolute best to support you and encourage you and your children to stick to as normal a routine as you can develop over the next three weeks. We are expecting some clarification from the State on Wednesday regarding make-up days and other questions, but this is still a moving target. When we know the answers we will get them to you as soon as we are able. Take care of you and yours. GO TROJANS!!

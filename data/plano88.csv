- Josie the Jaguar from Emily G. Johns School

Superintendent Tony Baker, P.H. Miller Principal Laurel Mateyka and the mascots walked the parade route and joined students and their families as they welcomed in the holiday season. Santa and Mrs. Claus rode in on a Harley Davidson motorcycle and children met them at the Plano Library for pictures and refreshments. Band students from Emily G. Johns School, directed by Mr. Kevin McCammon, entertained the crowd at the historic Plano Depot.

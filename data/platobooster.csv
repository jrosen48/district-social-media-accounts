Starting Friday night on April 10th, Plato High School will be joining schools around the country by turning on our baseball lights on Friday night at 8:20 p.m., and leaving them lit for 20 minutes, and 20 seconds to honor the class of 2020. We want all community members to be aware in the event someone is wondering why our lights are on.

At 8:20 p.m. on Friday night look toward PHS Baseball Field to see the glow of our support for our graduating class of 2020.

Please, continue to follow CDC guidance and stay safe and healthy. We miss all of our students and staff. You may drive by, but do not get out of your cars.

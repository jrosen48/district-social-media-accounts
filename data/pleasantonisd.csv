Happy Monday! This is the last chance for your child to see his/her teacher in person. Below is the Primary schedule for picking up student materials and returning Primary library books for this school year. This will take place next week as a drive-thru event in the front drop off area of the Primary School. When you drive-up on your child’s scheduled day and time, you will look for your child’s teacher table. You will park in front of that table. For safety reasons due to COVID-19, we ask that only 1 adult get out of the vehicle to walk up to the teacher table. Your child’s items will be in a bag ready to go. At the same time, you will need to return any library books your child may have at home. All other adults and all children will need to stay in the parked vehicle. We will also have an area set up with lost and found jackets and sweaters. You may park in the teacher parking area and walk up to look for your child’s lost jacket or sweater.",7.0,"Pleasanton Primary School

The JH UIL team traveled back to Hobby MS this past weekend for a state qualifying meet for academic UIL. Against some serious competition the JH team did great with the following qualifying for state competition in April:

IN Science, sixth graders Samantha Merecka and Brayden Ratliff met the qualifying score, and in 7th grade Science, Shaylynne Pierce qualified as well.

Sophie Zeng missed by one point 6th grade math.

The team will travel back to Medina Valley this weekend for one final shot at qualifying for the state meet.

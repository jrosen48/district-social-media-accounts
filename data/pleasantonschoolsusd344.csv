We have been working on a new scholarship for our seniors for almost a year now. I am very pleased to announce that everything is now in place for the Donald R. Ray and Betty M. Ray College Scholarship. From what I know the Ray´s were near lifetime residents of Pleasanton and owned a small accounting business.

This scholarship covers 100 percent of all college costs including room and board! The scholarship is funded by a portion of the Ray´s estate that has been placed in a trust that will sponsor a multitude of future seniors. The fund should perpetually cover multiple seniors utilizing only the income generated from the fund, therefore never touching the original principal amount.

Mr. Nolan has sent the scholarship application to all seniors and it has a quick turnaround. Be sure to get it filled out soon.

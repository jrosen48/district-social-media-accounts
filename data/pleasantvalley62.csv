This right here is what sets Pleasant Valley school district apart. We will be utilizing a hybrid model this fall. We do not want the students' school supplies to go back and forth between home and school. We also do not want our parents to have to buy two sets of school supplies. So today an army of Pleasant Valley staff members came together to create 500 supply kits by grade level for each of our students to keep at home. Along with Chromebooks these kits have everything from paper and pencils, glue and scissors to white boards and markers to math manipulatives and novels. You name it these kits have it! I can not thank my staff enough for their time and dedication and to my principal Kelly Sue for leading the troops. I can't shout it loud enough #pleasantvalleyproud!",14.0,"#pleasantvalleyproud

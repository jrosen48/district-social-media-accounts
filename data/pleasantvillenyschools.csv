We are excited to start classes tomorrow, Thursday, September 9. Today's orientation sessions were busy and filled with excitement. In preparation for tomorrow's arrival at the schools, please ensure that you complete the Health Screening form before arrival. Information regarding the process has been distributed by each principal. Access to the main MS/HS campus via the country club access path will remain closed for 3 to 4 weeks due to the on-going construction work in the “D” zones on the main turf. Middle School Drive off Ashland Avenue is now open. Looking forward to seeing everyone tomorrow and Friday. Masks up Pleasantville! Thank you for your cooperation.

The Board of Education would like to invite you to view our latest edition of “Inside Pleasantville Schools,” Technology in the District. (Click this link to watch the program: https://youtu.be/xFs4UZ4mEwg)

In this episode, we hear from Dr. Cameron Fadjo, Assistant Superintendent for Instructional Services. Dr. Fadjo takes us through the Tech For All program and how the technology team has grown to support the multiple needs for all our staff, students and families. Dr. Fadjo explains all about the new software teachers and students will be using and the training schedule for our staff and students.

We hope you enjoy our newest concept of communication. While our website is full of information regarding Arts, Athletics and Academics, this new communication program, hosted by PCTV, will highlight various topics of interest that come up during the year which may not be covered by principal, guidance or parent organization communications.

The 4th Quarter midterm grades were sent home last week. If you have yet to view this report, I highly recommend students (and parents) login into Infinite Campus for updated grades.

The final grades entered for the end of the 4th Quarter (May 29, 2020) will determine eligibility for Fall Co-Curricular Activities. Eligibility is based on a student earning a passing grade in ALL subjects at the end of each four and a half week grading period.A student who fails to earn a passing grade in all subjects will be ineligible for co-curricular activities for the entire next four and a half week grading period. Quarter and midterm grades will determine eligibility, not semester grades.

Make sure all of your assignments are submitted for EVERY class (including electives). Please continue to work on ALL assignments over the next three weeks. I am proud of all your work and dedication this past quarter. Keep up the great work! üò∫

This unsettling time is such a great opportunity to build and model resilience for our children.
Here's one of my favorite activities for this:
Explain to your children that each one of us is like a tree. And the challenges we're facing are like the wind which bends the tree.
Trees stand strong despite the wind because of their strong root system (support system): family, friends, pets, their MINDSET, positive thoughts, beliefs, values, etc.
Trees need wind to blow against them because it helps their root systems to grow deeper, which supports the tree as it grows taller.
In other words, the tree welcomes the strong wind because it helps it grow STRONGER!
So similar in life, challenges make us stronger! Such experiences as we're facing these days develop our character and our mindset and deepen our roots.

There are a few reasons. 1. Your response helps us plan how many meals to prepare so that we avoid food waste. 2. Unless we know a student with allergies is coming to pick up food we will not be prepared and could potentially give them an item that could make them sick.

We thank you for your patience and continued support by taking a moment of your time to help us prepare for you and the other students of PLESD.

Pick up Wednesday, 9/2/2020, for the dates 9/3-9/9/2020 (4 breakfast & 4 lunch). No school Monday, September 7th.

There are many unknowns about what next year will look like as we begin school. Our hope is that we will be back to normal with schools physically open.

Dear Plumas Lake Community,

1) Please help us with planning for next year by filling out this Enrollment Confirmation form. https://forms.gle/SvMtaF9rryJT2vmL6 (The form has been fixed for multiple children) This is very important for us to develop our staffing plan for next year.

2) At this point, we are still planning on starting school on August 13. We are beginning to develop multiple contingency plans. It is difficult to plan for an ever changing situation but my promise to you is that we will keep you informed as much as we can.

3) We are cancelling the Summer Enrichment program. There may be some opportunities for a summer program later in July or August. We will let you know more when/if it does become a possibility.

Sincerely,

We will not encourage nor discourage students to walk out but instead, we will ensure that the campus and all students are safe. Teachers will continue to teach until the the nutrition break begins. Both site and district administration will be available to help students find a safe place ON campus to walk out if they so choose.

At Riverside Meadows Nutrition Break begins at 10:02 and ends at 10:17 so most of the 17 minutes will be during the break. We have not heard of any elementary students planning to walk out but have discussed plans if some do chose to walk out.

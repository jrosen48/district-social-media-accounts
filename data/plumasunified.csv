FIRE TRAIN on the #NorthComplex

Union Pacific has moved a Fire Train into the area to assist with fire suppression along the railroad tracks in the fire areas. This Union Pacific locomotive has a water tank car attached with a pump on top that supplies hoses, nozzles and deck guns to help extinguish fires and hot spots on or along the railroad tracks.

This specialty piece of equipment is helpful for protecting the railroad infrastructure as well as reaching remote areas of the fire area.

Good morning Quincy Elementary Pioneer Families,

We were scheduled to sponsor a “drive by, say hi & pick up some supplies” today. Unfortunately, as you’re aware, we’re now dealing with fires and evacuations. Many of our families and staff have been impacted and had to relocate. Therefore, we will be postponing the “drive by, say hi & pick up some supplies” event to hopefully this Monday, from 12:00-2:00 (12:00 K, 12:15 1st, 12:30 2nd, 12:45 Pre School & Special Day School, 1:00 Independent study students, 1:15-2:00 - anyone. If you cannot make these times let us know and we’ll schedule another time). This will depend on the safety of our area determined by our local officials. We will be able to provide an update Monday morning.

How about a big shout out and thank you to all of our firefighters and 1st responders working around the clock to protect our communities!

Please be safe, take care of yourselves and families, and follow the directions of our officials!

Thanks for your understanding. We look forward to kicking off our 2020-2021 school year with all of you….soon!",0.0,"Quincy Elementary

We were scheduled to sponsor a “drive by, say hi & pick up some supplies” today. Unfortunately, as you’re aware, we’re now dealing with fires and evacuations. Many of our families and staff have been impacted and had to relocate. Therefore, we will be postponing the “drive by, say hi & pick up some supplies” event to hopefully this Monday, from 12:00-2:00 (12:00 K, 12:15 1st, 12:30 2nd, 12:45 Pre School & Special Day School, 1:00 Independent study students, 1:15-2:00 - anyone. If you cannot make these times let us know and we’ll schedule another time). This will depend on the safety of our area determined by our local officials. We will be able to provide an update Monday morning.

How about a big shout out and thank you to all of our firefighters and 1st responders working around the clock to protect our communities!

Some of our smaller (first come-first served) campgrounds are now open but with little to no services. Visitors need to bring trash bags, toilet paper, and hand sanitizer. Campgrounds include: Deanes Valley, Meadow Camp, Rock Creek, Silver Lake, and Snake Lake (Mt. Hough Ranger District) plus Conklin, Meadow View, Ross, Crocker and Laufman (Beckwourth Ranger District). Campfires are allowed in these developed recreation sites. Campfires are not allowed outside open, developed recreation sites. Portable propane campfire pits with shutoff valves are a handy substitute, with a valid CA campfire permit (http://www.preventwildfireca.org/Campfire-Permit/).

Reservation options for many #PlumasNF campgrounds may be found at https://www.recreation.gov. See www.outdoorsinplumas.com for other information including fees and site amenities for many of the facilities.

Some of our smaller (first come-first served) campgrounds are now open but with little to no services. Visitors need to bring trash bags, toilet paper, and hand sanitizer. Campgrounds include: Deanes Valley, Meadow Camp, Rock Creek, Silver Lake, and Snake Lake (Mt. Hough Ranger District) plus Conklin, Meadow View, Ross, Crocker and Laufman (Beckwourth Ranger District). Campfires are allowed in these developed recreation sites. Campfires are not allowed outside open, developed recreation sites. Portable propane campfire pits with shutoff valves are a handy substitute, with a valid CA campfire permit (http://www.preventwildfireca.org/Campfire-Permit/).

Reservation options for many #PlumasNF campgrounds may be found at https://www.recreation.gov. See www.outdoorsinplumas.com for other information including fees and site amenities for many of the facilities.

Census 2020",0.0,"Have you completed your census yet?

A census under-count may deprive communities from much needed resources. In fact, it has been estimated that for every person not counted, counties such as Plumas may lose up to $2,000 in Federal funding per year, for the next ten years.

The 2020 Census is currently underway. As of today, 33.1% of Plumas County residents have responded. Unfortunately, this figure is 30% points lower than the state average of 63%. Residents in urban areas have responded well, let's make sure we are represented as well.

Be counted!

We would like to give a HUGE shout out to these wonderful ladies. They have served on the PCO board for many years and have given up so much of their personal time to better our school with assemblies and activities. They are moving on to different opportunities next school year, and will be missed more than they know.
Cassie Lavely (President), Nicole Moulton (Treasurer), KT Clubb (secretary) and Aimee Rolin (Volunteer Coordinator & Book Fair), thank you for all of your hard work, dedication and toughness. It won't be the same with out you ladies. We are sad for our loss of such great, bold women!

Grades 3-6th - Alder Campus....

To mark our transition to summer and to the next grade, we have scheduled times on June 2nd and 3rd for students to come by school to turn in Chromebooks, collect personal items including art projects, and have a brief chat with their teachers. You can find the link for setting up your appointment with your teacher here. Teachers and staff are so excited to see the students!

Please note:
1.) All interactions will take place in front of school following social distancing guidelines.
2.) It is very important that Chromebooks are returned so that they can be replaced with new Chromebooks in the fall, as the leases are up on many of our devices. Turning them in will ensure that students have working devices in the fall, and that parents will not be billed.

This week is teacher appreciation week. During the past few weeks the teachers at QJSHS have gone above and beyond the call of duty to do all they can to provide the supports our students need during this unprecedented time in our world. While the world around us has changed drastically, so has the work world the teachers are living in. The mechanics of their jobs changed with the blink of an eye. Yet the teachers at QJSHS have been unwavering in their focus and efforts to meet the individual needs of our students. Thank you!!! For all you do each day for our students, their families, and our community.

• A Business Owner
• Educator
• A parent now “homeschooling” your kids
• Grocery Store Clerk
• Health Care Worker
• Student
• Recently unemployed
• And anything else… (The only requirement is that you are a Plumas County Resident!)

1. We want to hear your stories during quarantine!! Whether you are thriving or struggling to make it all work your story matters as we collect and document this time in history.

2. Along with INTERVIEWS we want to see PICTURES of your daily life in Quarantine up here in the Lost Sierra. What does a normal day look like working, learning, and living sheltered in place? Snap a picture shopping in a face mask or taking a socially distant walk with your household.

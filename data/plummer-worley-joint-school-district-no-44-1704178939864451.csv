Dear Lakeside Families:

It is my unfortunate duty to report a confirmed positive case of COVID-19 in our athletic department. If your student has been exposed to this person, you have already been personally notified by telephone! We have been in contact with both Marimn Health and Panhandle Health and are working together to follow specific protocols, including contact tracing, as we work through this first encounter. All students and adults who were directly exposed have been asked to isolate.

We will continue to work diligently to protect the health and safety of our students, staff, and community during this unprecedented time.

Earlier today, the State Board of Education adopted a Back to School Framework for Idaho schools – a 46 page document which was prepared by a Governor’s committee that included representation from public schools throughout Idaho.

The framework provides guidance for all aspects of public education but still leaves control at the local level. We continue to monitor the local conditions and level of community transmission as those factors will be significant in our preparations for students to return to the classroom. The School Board, administrative team and other various groups will study the plan in great detail and will be working diligently to digest this new information, define a plan that fits our district and schools specifically. More information will be forthcoming over the next few weeks.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2693517900930545&id=1704178939864451,,0.0,"Hello families:

Good afternoon community,

We know it has been a little while since we have done an update and that is because it has been a blessedly quiet few weeks for COVID-19 here on the reservation.

We currently have 3 cases on the reservation right now and those 3 individuals are the only individuals who are being quarantined at this time.

As we head into the summer months and especially with the holiday weekend next week, please remember to practice social distancing.

Our numbers here on the reservation are looking good, but in Coeur d’Alene, Spokane, and many other places around the country, the numbers are going up again.

We all wish COVID-19 would just disappear already, but in reality, it will be with us for the foreseeable future.

Don’t let your guard down – make sure you are protecting yourself and your family while you are out and about this weekend and in the coming weeks and months!

We want to do something to honor the Senior class of 2020 since they are dealing with a tough situation of the possibility of not getting to have a graduation ( we hope the school district will figure something out). We want to have all the Seniors fill out a form that will have questions similar to a senior night pamphlet and then we will read those on the air to highlight the Senior class of 2020. We will post the questions here on our page and Seniors can copy and paste into a message, answer the questions and send it back to us via messanger. If any Seniors would like to come to the studio we could even record them and we can put that on the air in there own voice. We will do this not only for our St Maries graduating class but also Kootenai and Plummer if someone would tag people from those districts in this it would be greatlt appreciated.

We are allowed to enact the remote learning and educational packets being put in place, and we will continue to deliver meals. School staff is prepared to continue teaching our students remotely through the end of this school year if necessary. Please follow all learning directions provided by Mr. Mitchell and Mrs. Hall.

As the fun and excitement of the holiday season winds down, it is easy to forget the safety lessons children learned in the Fall. Before your kids head back to school, review these winter school bus safety tips with them and share this post to remind others of the importance of #schoolbussafety.

+ Arrive early to the bus stop and dress appropriately for the weather (heavy jackets, hats, mittens, gloves or boots!)

+ Students should wait for the bus several feet further back off the road in a safe place. The roads can be slippery.

+Use the handrail when boarding and exiting the bus to prevent slips and falls on icy steps.

+ Before crossing in front of the bus, wait for an “all clear” from the driver. Cross 10 feet in front of the bus so the driver can see you as you cross.",2.0,"National School Transportation Association

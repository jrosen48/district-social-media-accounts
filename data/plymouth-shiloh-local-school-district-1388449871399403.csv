Dear Parents/Guardians,

With the situation as it is all around, we feel it is necessary to have a ""no change"" policy in place. There is a system that you may use to make deposits in your child's account which is, www.payforit.net . Using this account enables you to check when the student account is getting low and to see what they are spending their money on. If you choose to use this account, you will need to contact us to get their student ID number to set it up.

From this point forward, it will be policy to deposit all money in each student's account. Effective Tuesday, September 8, 2020.

Remember that students in the Middle/High school are able to charge one meal; Elementary students may charge two meals. It is important to send money with your child to pay the charge as soon as you can. It is our goal to work with you to make this an enjoyable experience for your child/ren.

Thank you,

Big Red Weekend Recap:

The Football and Cross Country Seasons finally got underway for the Big Red this weekend but not before mother nature had its impact and made us wait just a little longer. Friday night's season opener was delayed due to lightning and did not kickoff until 8:50 PM however the wait did not hurt the Big Red as they got off to a great start and ran away to a 26-6 season opening win over New London. The Big Red defense held the Wildcats down all night as they did not get scored on until about 20 seconds left in the game. The 1-0 Big Red will take on backyard rival South Central on Friday night at Alumni Field on Senior Night.

The Cross Country teams opened up their season on Saturday at Colonel Crawford's Early Bird Invite as the HS boys team took 10th place as a team led by Levi Robinson's 2nd place finish. The Big Red teams will be back at it tomorrow as they host the Plymouth Invitational at Mary Fate Park starting at 5 PM.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2756170364627340&id=1388449871399403,,0.0,"Athletic News!

There have been a few slight changes to the MS Volleyball schedule recently. Please note the following changes and adjust your schedules accordingly...

Saturday 9/19 at Willard - This was originally scheduled to be a tri match with Arcadia but due to the order that no multi-team events are to be held in one day in Volleyball this will now just be a normal game against Willard. 7th grade will start at 8 AM in their main gymnasium and will be followed by 8th grade.

Monday 9/21 at St. Paul - Start time for this has been moved back to 6 PM and will played in St. Paul's Convocation Center (main gym).

Monday 10/12 at Mapleton - Start time for this has been moved back to 5:30 PM and will be played in Mapleton's main HS gym.

The conference has also decided not to have the end of season tournaments for 7th and 8th grade volleyball due to the mandate of no multi-team events and not being able to compete against more than one team in the same 24 hour period. The conference champions will be determined by final regular season records.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2751682085076168&id=1388449871399403,,0.0,"Athletic News!

Big Red Recap:
It was another busy week for the Big Red Golf team as they are already almost half way through their season. They started the week on Monday at Shelby's Match Play Invite where they fell to Norwalk in the first round and Bellevue in the 2nd round going 0-2 on the day. Then on Tuesday they opened up conference play at New London and fell to the Wildcats by 10 strokes 201-211 and then they followed that up with another close league loss to Western Reserve on Wednesday by a score of 195-199. They finished the busy week on Friday in a tri match against Willard and Shelby losing to both. They now have an overall record of 1-6 in matches and 0-2 in the conference. They will be back at it on Tuesday this week hosting Crestview at Woody Ridge.

Our other teams have been working hard as they continue to prepare for their regular seasons to start. This will be a busy week for the Big Red as the Volleyball and Football seasons get underway with a full slate of games throughout the week.

Fall Picture/Media Day:

Reminder that tomorrow is Fall Sports Picture/Media Day. Please see the time schedule. We plan to take all individual and team pictures that would normally be taken but we do ask that athletes and parents adhere to and follow the following guidelines;

1) Athletes should arrive to the school no more than 10-15 minutes before their scheduled picture time and avoid congregating and gathering around together.

2) Athletes should arrive to the school dressed and ready to go for pictures. There should be no gathering in locker rooms to get ready, put on makeup, do hair, etc.

3) Masks/Face coverings should be worn as much as possible prior to and following pictures being taken.

4) Once the team picture has been taken athletes and coaches should disperse and spread out immediately and avoid lingering around in large groups.

We appreciate everyone's cooperation and we look forward to a great day and another positive step towards having our seasons!!

Big Red Recap:

As the Football, Cross Country, and Volleyball continue to work hard preparing for their seasons the Golf team is the lone Big Red team with their regular seasons underway and they were busy during the latter part of last week. They started off on a positive note defeating Wynford in a dual match on Wednesday at home at Woody Ridge by a score of 191-208. Then on Thursday they traveled to Mohican Hills to take on Northwestern in an 18 hole dual match and struggled on the tough golf course falling to the Huskies by a score of 377-444. On Friday they made the short to trip to Willard for another 18 hole event and again struggled to a last place team finish. The young group will continue to gain good experience as they compete in the Shelby Match Play event today at Shelby Country Club and then will open up conference play tomorrow at New London.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2743723612538682&id=1388449871399403,,0.0,"Athletic News!

Due to the recent decision by The State of Ohio that has cancelled all football scrimmages for the month of August 2020 we have decided to move the start date of Middle School Football practice back a week. First practice will be Monday, August 10th at 3PM. This start date will still allow us to be prepared for our regular season games and will also allow those needing physicals a chance to get them. Sorry for the delay but we believe this is the best course of action for our young student athletes.

Athletic Update!

Thank you to all Fall Sport Athletes and Parents who attended our team meetings last night. As communicated last night we continue to move forward with fall mandatory practices being able to begin on Saturday August 1st and we look forward to getting the fall season started. Since last nights meetings the OHSAA has suspended school vs. school scrimmages indefinitely for contact sports. Therefore, all football scrimmages for both HS and MS football teams have been removed from the schedule. Scrimmages and contests in the non contact sports of Volleyball and Golf remain on the schedule and will move forward as planned. There also have been a few other changes to the fall schedules so updated and current fall schedules are included in this post.

“With Plymouth-Shiloh Schools coming off Spring Break next week, I wanted to share that, though we remain closed, the WIFI is active at the public library and accessible from outside the building. The WIFI doesn't require a library card account and the password is ' Carnegie1908 '. The strength will vary depending on nearness to the building, of course, but it may be an option for your students who might lack home internet.”

We also have a great number of helpful databases available for students of any grade: https://www.mrcpl.org/research/databases-by-topic For resources that require a library card, those who don't already have one can receive a digital card at https://www.mrcpl.org/services/front-desk/get-a-digital-services-ecard.

Message regarding PROM:
At this time, prom that was scheduled to take place on April 25 has been postponed. Prom was to be held at the Plymouth elementary school with after prom taking place at the Shelby Y. Since both the school system and the Y are currently shut down, we are not able to have prom on our selected date. Our Junior class is committed to hosting a fun and memorable prom when the timing is right. The rescheduled date will depend upon the current health status of our community. The health and safety of our students is our number one concern. We are disappointed to postpone but this year's prom will be memorable. There will be much to celebrate when we are able to get together again.

Mrs. Buzard has compiled a list of resources to help parents during the school closure. These resources can help you talk to your child about COVID-19, practice some stress relievers (for kids and parents!), manage anxiety around all the recent changes to our normal routines, and find some fun activities to do as a family, just for fun. We hope these are helpful in some way to you and your family!

A lesson in true leadership for our students:
-Lead by example (to lead you have to show up and be there actively participating from start to finish)

A lesson in true leadership for our students:

He showed up to help when he was called, he left the close parking spots for those that needed them, he knew his place and fell in line to help package and bag lunches, he stayed until the end and helped clean up and even helped take out the trash. I don’t think there are too many other Superintendents that gave up their Sunday evenings to make sure their kids didn’t go hungry this week. A Big Thank You from Big Red Nation!

Re: Student lunch program during shut down

Date: March 22, 2020

Due to the Governor’s “stay at home order” issued today there are going to be changes to our student lunch program. Starting tomorrow we will only be distributing food on Monday of each week. This is in consideration of our employees’ safety and the safety of their families.

The program will continue to operate as the previous week. You will need to register for food pick up each week. We will continue to use pick up points throughout the district to distribute the food. We will attempt to provide each family as much food as possible through this program, however we do not feel we will be able to provide meals for the entire week with only one distribution. Thank you for your continued understanding and flexibility during these difficult times.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2618558621721849&id=1388449871399403,,0.0,"Big Red Family!

Big Red Weekend Recap:

The Winter Sports Season officially came to an end over the weekend for the Big Red with 6 wrestlers competing at Districts. Nick Roberts, Keith Tuttle, Noah Trimmer, Colton Sparks, Jason Swank, and Dylan Van Fleet all made the trip to Napolean High School to compete in the Division 3 Districts on Friday and Saturday. Nick and Colton both came within one match of qualifying for State but unfortunately both fell in tough matches in the consolation semi-final round. Nick would go onto win his finals match and finish in 5th place making him an alternate for the State Tournament while Colton finished in 6th place. This wraps up a terrific season for the Big Red wrestling program. Congratulations to all of our Wrestlers and Coaches on an outstanding season!

From a quality standpoint it is recommended that you buy block cheese and shred it yourself. The anti-caking ingredients used in shredded cheese cause it to have a lower melt quality.

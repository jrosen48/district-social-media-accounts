Students learned about principles of flight, going outdoors to experiment with paper planes and hand-copters. They explored bioluminescence as they used LEDs to create glowing flowers. With the Design Thinking Kit, students came up with innovative products to solve everyday problems - like a book grip to prevent a book from sliding from your hand when reading. Great idea, Charlotte!

They built the ultimate sports complex, reprogrammed robots, and learned ways to protect the Earth‚Äôs ecosystems. Our dedicated Camp Invention Coaches and PPS educators were on hand to virtually connect, collaborate, and answer students' questions.

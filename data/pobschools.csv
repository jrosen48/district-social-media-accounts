You should have received an email from POBSchools about Portal Day. If not, please be sure to check that the District has your correct contact email.

Over the past week, we have recreated two new master schedules for our K-12 in-person and remote learners. This task was a monumental one due to the following factors:

-Students moving to remote instruction across 13 grades;
-Teachers needing remote options due to health issues;
-Alpha-balancing in grades 7-12 after remote students were removed from in-person classes; and,
-Hiring new staff for the additional sections created in K-6, and for K-12 remote sections.

The Portal will open today as follows:
K-4 at 3 PM

You're really in for a special treat with today's message from Principal Murray. As I'm sure you are aware, this year the Drama Cadets were in the middle of preparing for their spring musical production of Disney's Newsies. A tremendous cast, encompassing elementary and secondary level students, had been practicing for months, until everything came to a screeching halt in March. Reluctantly, the decision had to be made to cancel the production, as a result of our need to remain home during the Coronavirus quarantine. As they say, the show must go on - and these talented students, under the direction of the very dedicated, Mr. Olivari, were determined to give their audience an experience they'll long remember. A big ""Thank You"" to senior, Max DeFalco, who is ultimately responsible for creating this most enjoyable video.

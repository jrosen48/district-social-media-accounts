Near the pool, our custodians have placed the paving blocks our eighth-grade graduates created with their hand prints under a recently planted red maple tree.

Yesterday was a great day for a parade at Pocantico! Eighth-graders first visited campus around 10:30 a.m. to make handprints and etch their names in aluminum foil pans filled with cement. The paving blocks will be featured at the base of a newly planted red maple tree on campus. Graduate John Preiser proposed the idea of “sealing” students’ hands on campus since they have been under a quarantine.

At 11:45 a.m., graduates and their families lined up in a parking lot on Route 117. The Mount Pleasant Police Department, the Pocantico Hills Fire Department and two Poco school buses escorted everyone down Route 448. Staff members and families from the community lined up in front of the school to cheer on the parade as it passed. The cars drove down past the firehouse before looping back to campus. They drove through the bus circle for a “graduation drive-out” to wish the 26 eighth-graders good luck in high school.

June 9, 2020

Dear Pocantico Families,

It is with a heavy heart that I have to inform you that absent guidance from NYS, that we will be unable to open camp for the Summer 2020 season.

Camp directors are busily working on finalizing plans with the hope to be able to bring a “virtual camp,” option to our community. We hope to have these finalized shortly.
We remain hopeful that we will be able to open the pool for community use.

I am very sorry to be the bearer of bad news.

We remain committed to do whatever we can to help our students and community in a safe and feasible manner.

Sorry!

Mr. Booth followed up with an electrostatic spray cleaner. The state-of-the-art equipment sprays an electrostatically charged mist evenly onto all surfaces. Because of the charge, the particles in the chlorine and water solution cling to all surfaces.

As part of our celebration of Black History Month, we welcomed Chef Giovanni D’Amour Green of Break Bread Not Hearts to work with middle school students for four days. The entrepreneur and educator held hands-on cooking sessions that focused on plant-based meals. He also shared some of his poetry.

At the beginning of each class, Chef Green asked students to tell him their name, favorite food, family heritage and a fun fact about themselves. When they finished, he went down the line and recited everyone’s name correctly.

In the Feb. 13 sessions, Chef Green and students cooked pancakes, scrambled eggs and home fries made with purple potatoes, chickpeas, green peppers and corn. He shared with children that love is a crucial ingredient in all recipes, and that cooking is a great way to build community.

Also that day, he shared his recipes with the cafeteria staff and set the menu for lunch: grilled cheese; All Yum Autumn Soup; and Sweet Potato, Black-Eyed Pea and Roasted Corn Salad with Grapes.

Welcome, friend! Today, Therapeutic Support Center teacher Mario Suarez started introducing Pocantico’s new therapeutic care dog, Duke, to children and staff. Students learned that Duke wears a bowtie and loves to eat Cheerios and have his belly rubbed. He is a 7-year-old American Staffordshire terrier mix who lives with Mr. Suarez’ family and has a younger and smaller “brother” named Tank. Children learned some of the rules around having a dog in school, such as don’t pet him when he’s wearing his red “do not pet” bandanna, pet him on the back or chest, and respect his personal space. Mr. Suarez and Duke will be making the rounds this week and after the break to make sure Duke meets everyone.

Thanks to the Pocantico Hills School Foundation for providing funding for this exciting new experience!

The Harvest Soup Festival was a big success! Thanks to everyone who helped make the soup. It was delicious!

Students, staff members and parents were busy Oct. 15 and 16 harvesting vegetables and preparing them for the Harvest Soup Festival on Oct. 17. Children in kindergarten through fourth grade picked carrots, squash, beans and other vegetables under the direction of custodian and master gardener Jose Zamora. They worked with Chef Kassie Arcate to peel and mince garlic, and peel carrots and squash. Other staff members assisted children in harvesting the seeds of beans, squash and sunflowers to plant for next year’s garden. Some students helped create carrot-top pesto and garlands made out of marigolds, zinnias and corn leaves. Sixth- and seventh-graders in Family and Consumer Sciences classes collected herbs to make herb butter. Parents chopped onions and other vegetables for the soup.",0.0,"Pocantico Hills CSD added 21 new photos.

Pocantico students identified trees, learned about macroinvertebrates, spotted frogs and turtles and took part in other educational activities as they participated in the Swan Lake Walk at Rockefeller State Park Preserve Friday. The amazing event was a fundraiser sponsored by the Pocantico Hills Foundation, which provides grants for innovative programs that are beyond the school’s budget. Donations and pledges this year will fund a new therapeutic care dog for the school. Therapeutic Support Center teacher Mario Suarez is training Duke for the new role.

The Foundation worked with the park’s naturalists to create 10 educational stations around Swan Lake, which were staffed by volunteers. The Foundation thanks all the parents, teachers, students and staff who took part in the walk. Families can send donations and pledge sheets to the foundation through Friday.

Many families brought traditional food and drink, such as chai tea, samosas, kielbasa, empanadas, sushi and pierogi.

A few dozen middle school students spent their lunch period Wednesday designing Valentine’s Day cards for senior citizens. The activity was part one of the fifth annual Operation Valentine. Part two takes place Sunday, when children will deliver them to residents of the Atria Briarcliff Manor assisted living facility. Students brought in treats from home to share with others, such as cupcakes, Swedish fish and cookies, as they worked.

Eighth-grade classmates Peter and David made cards for a World War II veteran who lives at Atria. “The purpose of writing to him is to recognize his service and Valentine’s Day is a good time to do it, especially for a veteran who doesn’t have any family,” Peter said. Stephanie, also in eighth grade, has participated in Operation Valentine before. Atria residents are very appreciative of the cards. “Just looking at the faces when you give them the cards is really special,” she said.

Congratulations to seventh-grader Maryum, who was the only student who answered every question correctly at the school's 9th annual National Geographic GeoBee on Jan. 24! The next step is for her to take an online geography quiz. The top 100 scorers in New York will advance to the state championship March 29.

“I’m feeling really excited and proud,” Maryum said moments after the winner’s medal was placed around her neck.

The win carries on a tradition of sorts, as her older brother, Fasil, won the school’s bee for three years in a row. He is now a freshman in high school. Last year, Maryum placed second. Only time will tell if their younger sister, Tasni, will follow in their footsteps.

Children’s book author Aisha Saeed visited the school Nov. 6 as part of the Global Read Aloud event. “Amal Unbound,” Ms. Saeed’s second book, is about a Pakistani girl who has to leave school to help out her family at home. After a run-in with a powerful member of the community, she is forced into indentured servitude to pay off a family debt.

Ms. Saeed, who is Pakistani-American, said she is inspired by young people’s courage, particularly that of Malala Yousafzai, a young Pakistani advocate for girls’ and women’s education.

“There’s so much bravery that all of us have within us that we can do to change the world, whether it’s in huge ways like Malala, who won a Nobel Peace Prize, or small ways just in our community,” the author said.

Ms. Saeed spoke with several classes and ate a special lunch with students that Chef Kassie Arcate prepared. She also signed copies of her book.

In preparation for the event, Jolene Morotti’s art students cut out tracings of their hands and drew henna-style designs on them. Ms. Morotti created a bulletin board with them.",0.0,"Pocantico Hills CSD added 25 new photos.

The last day of the 2017-18 school year was one of transition at Pocantico Hills. At 10:30 a.m. last Friday, children walked out to the greentop for an informal moving up ceremony. They sat down behind orange cones with signs that had their existing grade numbers on them. After a signal from Principal Brent Harrington, teachers moved the cones with the grade students will be in next year to the front of each line.

The children followed their new teachers to the classrooms they will be in next year. The youngest students did some coloring while older children found out about class rules and what they will learn. The seventh- and eighth-graders had gone directly to their new classrooms. At the end of the half day, teachers and other staff went outside to say goodbye to students for the summer and wave to the school buses.",0.0,"Pocantico Hills CSD added 55 new photos.

There are only a few hours left until eighth-graders graduate from Pocantico Hills, and they have been celebrating. Two stretch limousines picked them up at school this week and drove them to a class celebration at Grand Prix. At the entertainment center, DJ Kevin spun the tunes while the eighth-graders bowled, ate, danced and hit the arcade. The class held two car washes and sold products through Yankee Candle during the school year to offset the cost of the party. Many of the students have been at Pocantico since pre-kindergarten, and the party marked the culmination of their elementary and middle school experiences.

On Wednesday afternoon, the whole school participated in “Clap Out.” Eighth-graders donned their caps and gowns and paraded around the school as younger students, teachers and staff clapped and wished them well in high school. Congratulations to all the graduates!",0.0,"Pocantico Hills CSD added 91 new photos.

The Pocantico Hills Foundation held a successful event April 20 to raise money for a Makerspace at the school.

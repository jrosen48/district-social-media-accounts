Thank you for sharing your children with us!

It was so great to have the students back! Whether in the building or virtually, their presence is the reason and basis for our campus and the profession as a whole. At one point today I looked down the hallway and saw two students skipping,( in a socially distanced fashion of course) and I am quite sure that my smile was apparent even under my mask!

Drop-off and pick went well and I am sure that it will become even more streamlined and effective as we all learn and get back into our routines.

Please remember to encourage your children to employ safe practices while waiting at the bus stop; mask up and social distance as feasible.

Happy New Year! Pocantico celebrated the Lunar New Year! To start the day, four students who speak Chinese did the morning announcements. During lunch, parent volunteers gave students fortune cookies and lucky red envelopes, plus an ancient Chinese coin that they could wear as a bracelet for good luck. In China, red envelopes are presented as gifts on special occasions and holidays. The color of the envelope, red, symbolizes good luck and wards off evil spirits.

Lunar new year is celebrated in many Asian countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and more.

In honoring these individuals, part of the plan is to exhibit their pictures in a prominent place at Po-Hi which hopefully will be an inspiration to students as they pass through the halls of Po-Hi now and in the future.
The first induction ceremony will be held Thursday, September 28th at 7 p.m. at the Carolyn Renfro Center. Tickets will be $50 per person or $500 for a table of 8. Rich Cantillon, 1976 Po-Hi Alumni, has agreed to head the committee putting together the induction ceremony.
Nomination forms are available at the Ponca City Chamber of Commerce office. Chuck Bowman, 1954 Po-Hi alumni, will head the nomination committee. Plans are to induct 5 – 10 alumni this first year. Deadline for nominations is June 1.

Poland Kids Against Pollution, Poverty and Prejudice club members have been busy weighing recycled plastic film this week!

Did you know that plastic film such as grocery bags can't be recycled through curbside recycling programs and shouldn't be thrown in the garbage?

Instead, bring in the plastic film this week in bins in the hallway near the elementary entrance to the school library. The winning class among kindergarten to fifth grade will win reusable water bottles and reusable bags.

All plastic must be clean, dry and free of food residue.

The following are examples of plastic film that can be brought in: grocery bags, bread bags, case overwrap, dry cleaning bags, newspaper sleeves, ice bags, wood pellet bags, Ziploc and other re-closable bags, produce bags, bubble wrap, salt bags and cereal bags.

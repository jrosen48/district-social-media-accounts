Meet the Pickren boys: Zach, Zayne, Zander, Zavier and Zayd. Last week they began online classes through their enrolled schools, Brigham Academy, Jewett Middle Academy and Summerlin Academy.

The boys' mother, Amanda Pickren, said she spent the summer adding desks, chairs and computers to family's home office, turning it into the eSchool command center you see here.

""So far the e-learning experience has been great -- a few hiccups here and there, but overall better than expected,"" Amanda said. ""(The) kids are staying engaged and actually wanting to do the work.""

George Sapp clearly loves to read. Last year at Spessard Holland Elementary, the fifth-grader racked up an astounding 2,020.3 Accelerated Reader (AR) points.

To put it into perspective, an especially skilled and dedicated reader might earn 500 to 700 AR points in a year. Surpassing 1,000 points or more is rare territory.

We don't keep records at the district level, but our staff suspect that George's 2,020.3 points might be a single-year record for PCPS. George's family said he earned a total 3,161.2 AR points during his elementary school career.

""George Sapp is one amazing young man with such determination,"" said Spessard Holland Principal Melody Butler. ""He's an amazing scholar. We are so proud of him.""

George is moving on to Union Academy this year. We wish him well on his next chapter.

The process of “controlled open enrollment” gives students throughout Florida an opportunity to attend a school other than the zoned school. Parents can apply for placement in any school that still has seats available.

In Polk County, this process took place in April. If you previously applied, were notified and accepted on Parent Portal, then there is no need to reapply. Your child’s seat at that accepted school will remain.

We are offering a second round of controlled open enrollment for two reasons. Due to a miscalculation, more seats were discovered, and we would like to give families an opportunity to apply for these seats if they wish.

For those interested in our second round of controlled open enrollment, we will begin accepting applications at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, June 8.

Thankfully, teacher Ray Cruze (pictured, center) was able to gather some friends and make the best of a difficult situation. They've picked about 200 pints of grape tomatoes, several bushels of bell peppers, and some cucumbers.

School Resource Officer Ed Palmer donated much of the produce to Spook Hill Elementary, so it could be distributed to the local community.

Cruze would like to give a special thanks to the Roosevelt students who planted the crops before schools were closed. He also thanked the many business partners who have supported the Roosevelt Farms program.

- We have reduced the number of schools serving as food distribution sites. Please check polkschoolsfl.com/lunchlocations to see the list of active sites before you head out.

- Children are no longer required to be present to receive meals.

Please note that we have changed our distribution schedule to make the service more convenient for families and also help safeguard everyone involved -- fewer trips out means less risk of exposure for families and PCPS employees.

Also, we have reduced the number of food sites in response to staffing constraints due to the coronavirus. Many of our school nutrition employees are older/have underlying health conditions, so it is not safe for them to be working in certain environments right now.

Don't forget that tomorrow (Friday, April 10) is a regularly scheduled holiday for students and staff, so district offices and schools will be closed (even more than usual lately).

Beginning Monday (April 13), we will transition to a new schedule at our food distribution sites, which will be open three days per week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Due to staffing constraints related to the coronavirus, we also will be operating fewer meal sites, so please check polkschoolsfl.com/lunchlocations before you head out.

We hope you have a great weekend. Please try to stay home, stay safe and take care of each other.

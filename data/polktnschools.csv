A very special group that we will refer to as “Friends of Copper Basin” has volunteered to help with the September Chattanooga Area Food Bank distribution. Without their assistance this food drop would not be possible. We will be able to provide free groceries to the first 250 families. Please stay in your car and form a drive through style line at the gym. Do not line up until after the parent pick up line is complete (3:15). Distribution will begin at 3:30pm and continue until 5:00 pm or until we run out of food. You may pick up for a neighbor or friend but there will be a limit of households per person to pick up. Please help share this date and future dates are expected to be the 3rd Thursday of each month pending volunteer availablity.",3.0,"Copper Basin Elementary School

CBES is proud to introduce our newly hired 6th grade ELA teacher. Welcome to the family Mrs. Harper!

My name is Breane (Bre) Harper and I am 26 years old. I have been married to my high school sweetheart for 5 years and we have a beautiful little girl named Kinsley, who is 2 years old. We love going to church, spending time with our family and friends, and vacationing to the beach. My husband, my in-laws, and myself own the gym Unlimited Fitness in Murphy, NC. We are busy! I have an undergraduate degree in business, but I fell in love with education and knew God had other plans for me. I decided to return to school and was accepted into graduate school at Piedmont College to become a teacher. I have just recently graduated and I am beyond excited to begin my first year teaching 6th Grade at Copper Basin Elementary. Even with the uncertain times, I believe God has placed me in this position for a special reason and I look forward to beginning this new journey. I have a passion for teaching that is unexplainable and an unstoppable determination to reach the heart of every child. 💕",0.0,"Copper Basin Elementary School

Happy Friday! I want to take a minute and thank you all for continuing to motivate your children to learn. This school year is not over even though the building is closed. Teachers will be teaching until May 22. I would have never chosen this scenario but we have been given an opportunity to inspire our students to learn without the extrinsic motivator of grades. Now is the time to teach them that an education is a gift to give yourself. Everything they learn is preparing them for the next level of education. Parents we have asked you to step in and help us and you have exceeded our expectations. Please keep up the good work and continue to help your kids understand the importance of learning. School is not over, it just looks very different. Thank you for all that you are doing to make sure we have students ready to learn once our doors reopen.",0.0,"Copper Basin Elementary School

TGIF Polk County friends! 🌤

If you have time, please share a quick update on what you (and your students) have done this week to stay safe, happy, and healthy. If you don’t have time, you can just send a quick 👍🏻 so I’ll know you are alive and well.

Parents please check-in for the younger ones! I would love to hear what they’ve put in their Toolboxes 🧰 (their brains) and how full their Love Tanks ❤️ (their hearts) are this week?

Please give yourself (and your student) a hand-hug from me! ✋🏼

Thank you and take care!✌🏼💙🤓

P.S. Polk County, TN parents, students, and educators are welcome to join my Facebook Friendship Group and check-in with us weekly or even daily if you’d like! I miss my students terribly and LOVE hearing from you all! 💓

There are so many questions that I am sure you have. Please know that as we move forward, we will supply any and all information that we plan toward.
We are already working on plans to educate students and provide nutrition should we be out of school for more than the two weeks already planned.
Also, County Executive Robbie Hatcher is already working with the Sherriff’s Department, Police Chief Rocky King, and many other individuals, groups, and public officials in the community in planning to provide and help should we be out of school for more than the two weeks.
We will be meeting again Monday to further plan in case we are out of school longer than the two weeks.
We will be sharing any and all information we gather during those plans.
Our major plans moving forward will be to provide education and nutrition to students.
More information on more specific details will be provided Monday after the planning session.

I need for the world to know how amazing this group of teachers are. This has been a full moon, Friday the 13th, coronavirus hoopla, progress monitoring, end of grading period, family engagement event, and how could we possibly forget the winter formal that almost never was week. These people have such a heart for our students that as they saw the current situations developing they took the initiative to plan ahead for what could be. Most of them not only stayed to work the young authors night but then stayed much later putting together packets for the students to use to review in the event of school closing. When we got the call today they were prepared. They had already thought through our students needs and made it happen. Of course there were last minute rushes to get all copies made, log in info cards cut out, and folders packed. That’s when all of our people really came together to help one another. I am blessed to be able to say that I get to work with a team that puts the needs of our students first and has each other’s backs. I love you all and I am so thankful for you❤️",0.0,"Janessa Nipper

Tomorrow is the deadline to apply as a mentor to serve local Tennessee Promise students. We still need 2 mentors to work with students at Polk County High School and 5 are needed to work with students at Copper Basin High School.
Mentors only spend 12 hours ANNUALLY helping students as they transition from high school through their first semester of college. Many of these students will be the first person in their family to go to college, so they need a little extra encouragement! The deadline to register is this Friday, December 6.

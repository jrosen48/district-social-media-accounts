With that said....are you ready to make it rain?

A brief survey link has been inserted below. This survey assesses your level of interest for the two distinctively different learning solutions Poolville Elementary School will offer when we return to school in the Fall.

https://forms.gle/TmNuvDnaFVPfghVZ6

The survey will remain open through Friday, July 17th.

Please participate. We greatly appreciate your time and input.

If you would like additional details, I will host two evening 'Q&A Sessions / Information Forums' for parents. These sessions will transpire in the Elementary School Library. The sessions will review incremental details on each particular plan.

The first session will be Thursday, July 23rd at 6:00 pm. The second session will be Tuesday, July 28th at 6:00 pm.

Thank you Monarchs!

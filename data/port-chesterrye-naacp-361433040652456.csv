Born today in 1930.

“Lorraine Hansberry was one of the most significant and influential playwrights of the 20th Century. Her landmark play A Raisin in the Sun, which opened at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre in New York City, New York in 1959, was the first play written by an African American woman to be produced on Broadway. Hansberry’s account of the struggles of an urban black family was an overnight success, running some 530 performances, and winning a New York Drama Critics Circle Award. It was also earned four Tony Award nominations–Best Play, Director, Actress and Actor. It is generally credited with breaking down the racial barriers to Broadway and ushering in a new era of opportunity for black women playwrights. The play was made into a movie in 1961, with Sidney Poitier and Claudia McNeil reprising their roles and Ms. Hansberry writing the screenplay.”

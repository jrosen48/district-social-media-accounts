This year we decided to bring back the square one art fundraiser to help support the fifth-grade committee!! This is a favorite by many parents as it’s a great opportunity to help boost your child’s confidence by purchasing their artwork as well as creating a keepsake that lasts a lifetime! There are many options available to purchase. And it’s a great time of year as all of the items should be delivered before the holiday break. Think of purchasing for yourselves as well as Grandparents, Aunt’s, Uncle’s, anyone who is special to your child! Please take this opportunity to order the artwork as the originals will not be sent home. Orders can be placed online or submitted to us by the deadline which is November 20th. I know the children worked hard on these so let’s show them our support!! If you have any questions feel free to reach out.

LIPA update - Aug. 17

Statement From the Port Jefferson School District

Earlier this week, the New York State Supreme Court ruled against the Port Jefferson School District’s claim that LIPA breached its promises to never seek a reduction of the assessed valuation of the Port Jefferson power plant. This decision, which follows a nearly four year process, now allows LIPA to go to trial against the Town Of Brookhaven, the assessing authority, and seek dramatic reductions in the taxes it pays to the school district for the plant. While this decision is not the outcome the district was hoping for, we vow to continue to explore our options as we work to protect our school district's financial future and the needs of our community. The district will work to keep the community apprised of any updates on the matter.",0.0,"FYI

1. To try their best
2. To listen to their teacher and
3. To be kind to their classmates!

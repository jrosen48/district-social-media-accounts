Dear Port Washington Staff and Families,

I would like to express the utmost gratitude for the remarkable team of individuals in our district who have successfully implemented and spearheaded the food service program since the initial school closure.

I am proud to share with you that through this program the district has distributed on average 3,289 meals per week to our students:
Week 1: 1,712
Week 2: 2,186
Week 3: 3,280
Week 4: 3,774
Week 5: 5,494
Weekly Average: 3,289.2

The commitment to keep our children fed, as demonstrated by our food service professionals, as well as staff and members of administration, has surpassed expectations.
For more information on the district’s food service program, please see the flyer attached.

Have a wonderful week and stay well.

Dear Port Washington Staff and Families,

I would like to express the utmost gratitude for the remarkable team of individuals in our district who have successfully implemented and spearheaded the food service program since the initial school closure.

I am proud to share with you that through this program the district has distributed on average 3,289 meals per week to our students:
Week 1: 1,712
Week 2: 2,186
Week 3: 3,280
Week 4: 3,774
Week 5: 5,494
Weekly Average: 3,289.2

The commitment to keep our children fed, as demonstrated by our food service professionals, as well as staff and members of administration, has surpassed expectations.
For more information on the district’s food service program, please see the flyer attached.

Have a wonderful week and stay well.

Congratulations to Daly’s second grade students who recently participated in Fun Run, a fundraising event to help Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation move one ‘step’ closer to finding a cure for all children with cancer.

The hallways were full of chants and laughter as the second graders tied the laces of their running sneakers and geared up to fundraise. With the support of their classmates and parents, students walked throughout each hallway on the three levels in the building. For every lap completed, local sponsors donated 25 cents to benefit pediatric cancer through Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation. Each student aimed to raise $5 dollars towards the building’s goal of $400. Collectively, Daly’s second graders raised a culmination of $516.50 so far to donate to pediatric cancer!

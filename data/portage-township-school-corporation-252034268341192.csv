Officer Howard has been a member of the Portage Police Department for five years where he has been assigned to the patrol division as well as serving as a member of the department’s SWAT team. Officer Howard is accredited by the National Association of School Resource Officers’ and has previously worked as an SRO on a part-time basis with PTS. Officer Howard was selected for this position in collaboration with PTS in part due to his ten years of experience working as a youth baseball coach and the positive feedback from his players. Prior to coming to law enforcement Offc. Howard had been drafted as a pitcher by a Double-A Major League Baseball team and has been sharing his skills and knowledge of the game since then. We are excited to have a Portage officer returning to PTS and expect great things to come.",2020-08-26 11:27:35,,

We have made a slight adjustment to the Mobile Meals route that stops on Lakewood Ave, Jacqueline St, Silver Cloud Dr, Brentwood Ave, and Fox Tail Ave. Due to some road construction and closures, buses will arrive at these stops approximately 4 to 5 minutes later than scheduled.

The future is now as AI (Artificial Intelligence) is coming PHS!

We are pleased to announce the expansion of the Porta-Botz! to include VAIC - VEX Artificial Intelligence Competition.
Portage was selected as a high school Pilot-Program based on past Program performance!

In conjunction with our upper level Computer Science classes, our kids will have an experience like none before... to fabricate and program robotic machines to make their own decisions using GPS, Vision Sensors, Fusion Maps, and VEX Link so robots may communicate and work together... solely by code.

Mrs. Becker had a special mission today for her students...Operation Book Drop!! She purchased books for her students that they will read together over Zoom. Today, she delivered those books to her students!! She was able to appropriately social distance deliver to most and for those that she could not see, she left it in their mailbox. Great job, Mrs. Becker! Thank you for continuing to encourage the love of reading with your students!! ❤️📖",2020-04-16 17:09:49,,

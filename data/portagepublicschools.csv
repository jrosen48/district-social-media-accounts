In this image, we see a delightful class of students posed in front of their elementary school. However, if one looks closer one will notice the Masonic emblems on the doors. Was this a field trip? Were these children of Masons? In fact, these students are attending class in the Masonic Lodge that once stood on the north side of Centre Street roughly across from today's Taco Bob's restaurant just east of South Westnedge. This wonderful lodge was actually built on the site of the old Portage Township Hall and Portage Grange building. In the 1940's and 1950's Portage Schools experienced overcrowding so they contracted out the use of the Masonic Lodge as an overflow classroom. Unfortunately, the lodge was demolished and today the site sits empty, waiting for redevelopment.",0.0,"We are loving the PPS history posts from our friends at the Portage District Library.

Hey everyone, this is your Local Historian, Steve Rossio, with another throwback Thursday. Here we see a group of Portage students waiting for the bus outside the Portage Township School located on South Westnedge (no longer standing) sometime in the very early 1950's. What I love about this photograph is that it shows that kids will be kids no matter what the era. At first glance, the students appear to be merely posing for the camera however...look closer. How many well-behaved kids are mugging it up for the photographer...making faces, picking their noses, etc. Now look at the teacher...hard to tell but she appears to be laying down the law on one student. This image shows that sometimes you need to really look at a photograph to understand what is actually going on.",3.0,"Love this throwback Thursday from our friends at the Portage District Library.

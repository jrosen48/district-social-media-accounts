Every child in the district 18 or younger is eligible for the meals. We welcome children even if they do not attend Port Byron Schools, but live in the school district.

Next week we will have two big changes. We will serve 7 meals per bag. Therefore, come to school on Monday or Thursday to pick up meals for the week.

We shattered our goal for the week in one day with 1,715 meals served. What great news!!

Thanks to the PBTA and their friends for the gift certificates. They will be putting certificates in bags again on Thursday.

We are investigating how we can provide meals (breakfast and lunch) 7 days a week for students. It will require some changes on how we fill the bags. One idea is to put three days in Monday's bag and four days in Thursday's bag.

It will take a week or two to order enough food and make the necessary logistical changes. We await the governor's announcement on school closings to put a plan in action. But, in the meantime, we continue to work on a plan and would be happy for some feedback.

We have enjoyed sharing with you the stories of students and teachers discussing our online learning program. There are more to come this week. We have to be honest that some of the youngest students are beyond adorable.

The one constant in the articles regardless of age is the personal touch. Online learning works best when parents provide support in the home and teachers have the opportunity to provide personal communication with the learner. We know from lots of data or metrics that we are performing at an amazing level at this juncture. But, in reality, we simply know from the smiles. That is what we hear and see in the anecdotes.

While we enjoy remarkable success, we have not 'rested on our laurels'. Both buildings are working to increase student engagement this week. We will share their stories in subsequent posts.

The stay at home order from the governor has been extended by two weeks. We are slowly inching our way to the end of the year. Therefore, many decisions will be forthcoming that have been on hold. Everything from the Alumni Banquet to the Sports Banquet will be cancelled due to the pandemic.

We are still holding onto a graduation ceremony for the seniors. We have some ideas, but we cannot operationalize them until we know what is the law for gathering in late June. We promise we will do whatever is possible to make it special.

We have enjoyed putting together the series with students and faculty sharing experiences with online learning. The parents, students and teachers have given us insight on the daily struggles and rewards during the shutdown.

We are hoping that these stories resonate with our readers and instill some ideas to assist those who might still be struggling a little. We also hope that it instills some degree of pride and awe. We would be lying to you if we did not acknowledge a smile or two reading the stories and viewing the pictures.

We have more to come, but we also wanted to share one of the ones we receive via Messenger. We welcome feedback and your stories.

To this end, we have put up some Facebook posts recently highlighting lessons to have students share time with their peers. These posts highlight our efforts to assist students with their emotional and social needs in these difficult times.

Please be patient with us as we work through this new system.
Beginning this Wednesday, April 1, clients will be allowed to visit the pantry ONLY twice a month. You can choose which weeks you would like to visit. However, once you have been to the pantry twice in one month, you will need to wait until the following month to visit again.
We hope you are all staying safe and healthy. Please continue to practice social distancing and help return things to normal as quickly as possible.
Thank you, in advance, for your patience and understanding!",,,

Busy week ahead with big changes on how we feed students breakfast and lunch. Also, it is the first week of using the WiFi bus on a regular basis. Lastly, we have a visit from the Easter Bunny.

The breakfast and lunch program switches to serving a full week‚Äôs worth of meals. We will be open for pick up on Mondays and Thursdays from 10 a.m. - 1 p.m. and from 3 - 6 p.m. We are hoping the change will result in greater participation while making it more resilient in case we struggle with some staffing issues.

The WiFi bus will be making the rounds and we are ready to serve more homes. We just need families without internet to contact us at pbtech@pbcschools.org to schedule a stop.

We are very excited that the teacher's association will be giving out Easter Baskets tomorrow. Besides having great teachers, we are also blessed with teachers who demonstrate the greatest of hearts too!

We have kept our outdoor facilities open to encourage individuals and families to exercise and get some fresh air during the crisis. This decision can only work if residents heed the emergency decree.

Social distancing means that you cannot use the athletic facilities with anyone, but your immediate family. There is no organized games or activities, which violates social distancing. It is critical that citizens heed this warning. Otherwise, we will have to close it.

This is what has occurred in Rochester and New York City after warnings from their respective mayors and the governor. We have had a few instances and have reached out to those individuals personally.

130 students and 260 meals served today!

Busy day with lots of information flowing from Albany on school closures and state budget. The school closure will be through April 15th. This is by order of the governor. This supersedes the closure from Cayuga County that was through the 13th. I suspect it will be a little longer than April 15th, but it is not something that we have control over at the local level.

The state budget information is still being negotiated, but it doesn't look very promising for Port Byron. We will have more information when it become official.

I leave you with an article that will appear in tomorrow's paper. We have so many great people who are focused on our students and community. During the worst of times, sometimes we get to see the best.

Well, not quite, but this is the closest we will have during the COVID-19 crisis. The Arts Lobby in West Building will be open 24/7 as an indoor space for students to have internet access. It is a perfect location with lots of light, security cameras, heated space and, of course, two restrooms.

A table will be set up each day from 10 a.m. -1 p.m. Monday through Friday for meal pick up. There will be a breakfast and lunch bag to go for each student in the school district.

In the next several weeks and likely longer we will be facing challenges that are impossible to fathom as a school district, community, and country. In order to assist the Port Byron students, parents and community at large, we will be relying heavily on Facebook to push out information. We will have at least one post a day to update you on our efforts to meet the collective needs of stakeholders.

We have a couple of favors to ask for in the days ahead. Patience and forgiveness. Patience because we are making it up as we go along and the fact that over time some of our staff will likely be struggling with personal health issues too. Forgiveness because writing everyday and on the fly will result in less than perfect posts.

Lastly, we want to be responsive to your needs, therefore please send private messages to us via messenger or email.

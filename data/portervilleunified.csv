May is Mental Health Awareness Month. In these uncertain times, setting up a bedtime routine which promotes quality sleep is very important to our overall mental health! When we are tired, it‚Äôs harder to regulate our emotions and cope with challenging situations. This is especially true for children who may already struggle to express their feelings. Creating a bedtime routine which promotes relaxation may include a mindfulness practice, a warm bath, a bedtime story and cuddles, and/or sipping a warm beverage. It is also important to end screen time at least 1-2 hours before bed.

The CSU announces plans to conduct a majority of classes virtually at all 23 campuses for the fall 2020 term, with limited exceptions. Campuses will remain open and ready to serve students.

""First and foremost is the health, safety and welfare of our students, faculty and staff, and the evolving data surrounding the progression of COVID-19‚Äìcurrent and as forecast throughout the 2020-21 academic year. This planning approach is necessary because a course that might begin in a face-to-face modality would likely have to be switched to a virtual format during the term if a serious second wave of the pandemic occurs, as forecast. Virtual planning is necessary because it might not be possible for some students, faculty and staff to safely travel to campus.

Thank you to all who have been hard at work making face coverings! We have received more than 2,000 and we are still in need.
Because we are not all the same size, face coverings using our pattern and those alike are a little too small for a few healthcare workers. We ask that when making them, make a few that are an extra 2‚Äù in length and have slightly longer elastic bands as well. We are also asking that some material patterns be gender-neutral if possible. Thank you again for contributing your efforts. We are all in this together!
For complete instructions and delivery information, please visit: sierra-view.com/facecoverings

Thank you to all who have been hard at work making face coverings! We have received more than 2,000 and we are still in need.
Because we are not all the same size, face coverings using our pattern and those alike are a little too small for a few healthcare workers. We ask that when making them, make a few that are an extra 2‚Äù in length and have slightly longer elastic bands as well. We are also asking that some material patterns be gender-neutral if possible. Thank you again for contributing your efforts. We are all in this together!

Due to COVID-19, I'm reaching out to all people interested in joining beginning band next year electronically. Please share this post with all folks that are involved in the lives with a current or future PHASD student that is interested in joining beginning band next year at FGMS.

This link will take you to the band website, where there is a green signup tab to register for band. The earlier you do this, the better. People that register early typically always get their first choice in instruments.

Visit the middle college's open house on Saturday, Feb. 8, at 10 a.m. to noon in room 123 in the Applied Technology Center building on SC4's campus.

The annual Blue Water Middle College Academy Open House is a great opportunity to learn about the program from current middle college students and staff. Drop in anytime between 10 and noon. Bring your questions or one of us will explain the program, if you don't know much about it.

There will be refreshments, and there are also other things to do while you are on SC4's campus that morning. Michigan State University's ""Find Your Future"" event is taking place at the same time in the same building. SC4's amazing Experience Center is also open Saturday morning on campus just a short walk away.

-Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

In an effort to continue the stewardship of Dr. King’s legacy of service, all Port Huron Area middle and high schools will be participating in the 2020 MLK Day of Service through the “Make A Blanket” project. The goal of the project is to spread warmth and kindness through the donation of handmade blankets to local agencies, offering both children and adults some comfort in a time of transition and trauma.

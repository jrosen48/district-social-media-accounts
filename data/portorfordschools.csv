Parents....Just a thought...

In school we practice earthquake drills but it is hard to drill something children have never experienced. If your child felt the earthquake, you might want to simply say ""That was an earthquake. When the ground shakes like that, things could fall off the walls. This is why teachers at school might call out DUCK AND COVER! Get under a table or stand in a doorway to help protect yourself.""

It can be said in a simple matter of fact way not to frighten your child but to help them begin to understand what earthquake means.

We had students who were ready to cross the street that had to be told to wait because of these speeding cars.

We are asking all motorists to PLEASE obey all traffic laws, especially before school and after school hours. Also please be aware of students and staff in the crosswalk.

Families who have students who are not up to date on immunizations or do not have documentation of exemption should have received a letter from our office this past week.

Exclusion Day for students is February 21, 2018. If students are not updated on shots or don't have an exemption certificate on file at our office they will not be able to attend school as of that day until requirements have been met.

If your child needs immunizations, there are options you can take. First, the Pirate Wellness Center is open every Tuesday from 9am - 4pm. You can call Pacific to make an appointment at (541) 348 - 2293. Be sure when making your appointment to tell the office manager what immunization your child needs.

Hello Driftwood Families!!

Tomorrow is the big day for our K - 5 students!! A couple of things...

1) Breakfast will be served at the Legion Hall from 7:45 - 8:10am. If you are dropping off your student for breakfast, please do it there.

2) The front doors of DW are inaccessible due to the construction. If you are wanting to drop off your student in their classroom, please do so using the gate and door by the Play Shed.

3) Our office is located what was before known as the computer lab. The only door you will be able to use during school hours to get to the office will be the bus doors (north doors).

4) At the end of the day, any pick ups must happen by the playshed. We want to keep the bus doors open for bus riders only.

5) Parking for parents at both the beginning and end of the day will be on the street west of the Coast Community Health Building.

Again, please bear with us as we complete our construction. If you have any questions, please feel free to give our office a call at (541) 332 - 2712.

Thanks and see you tomorrow!!

Parents of K - 5 students:

Today, our staff was able to get into our elementary classrooms for the first time this school year due to construction. I am proud to say that it was a day full of hard work from staff, students, and volunteers to get everything moved into classrooms.

However, at the end of the day, it was very apparent to both Mr. Perkins and myself that our staff needed an extra day of work to get classrooms and curriculum prepared for our students.

Therefore, we decided that the start of school for students in grades K - 5 will be Thursday, September 7th.

Tomorrow, we will be contacting families.

Students in grades 6 - 12 will be still starting school on Tuesday, September 5th at Pacific High School.

I thank each and every family for their patience. I know that there have been some bumps in the road, but I truly believe that in the end, the construction that has been happening will make Driftwood safer for our community, staff, and students.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at Pacific HS.

Good Morning Charter Community!!! Having a Positive Outcomes Charter School, Freire Charter School Wilmington, Great Oaks Charter School Wilmington, Newark Charter School, Kuumba Academy Charter School, First State Military Academy, Delaware Design-Lab High School(Design Thinking Academy) kind of morning today.

What an awesome way to head into holiday break!! All SEVEN charter schools had their charters renewed by the Delaware Department of Education (DDOE) with the assent of the DE State Board of Education! An amazing amount of work goes into renewal - great work done by all of our teams!

While 6 of the 7 schools received five-year charters, Newark Charter received a 10-year charter!! Only the second school in DE to do so. Woohoo!!

PLEASE READ: When you receive this form in the stack of paperwork you need to fill out and return to school, PLEASE do not ignore it. Every public school in Delaware will send this home. The purpose is to ensure that educators and support personnel (SLO included!) know where to direct resources and supports for military connected students. It is NOT tied to tracking performance or accountability as a demographic sub-group. It is available in English and Spanish, and if you have questions feel free to contact me at sonya.dyer.1@us.af.mil. Thank you...and please help spread the word!",0.0,"Dover AFB EFMP Family Support

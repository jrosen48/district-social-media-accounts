I just listened to it and teared up. Our Coaches are SO invested in our kids and the kids were all invested in the process.

So what’s the story behind how Post & Hawley picked who the home team is for their playoff game?

There don't use coin tosses anymore. Now a days, Coaches call out a town and you guess if the zip code is odd or even.

When the coaches of Post (13-0) and Hawley (13-0) talked, they picked to play their Class 2A Division I State Quarterfinal game in Sweetwater.

Then to determine who the home team will be, a new odd way: odd or even on the final combined score of Texas A&M and LSU!! Post picked odd and LSU won 50-7 so Post is the home team!

How did that come about? I asked Post Head Coach Michael Pittman and here’s the story",0.0,"Pete Christy KCBD

We will have our first SEND OFF tomorrow for our Cross Country team! It will be early but I know you can still give these great kids a few minutes of your time. Get out of your cars and give them a little wave or thumbs up!! 😁

We will start around 8:25 at the HS. They will walk through the halls and out the back door on 3rd street. They will go to the Junior high and by the elementary. (I am not sure if they will be walking the halls at different campuses but I can find out)
Im thinking after that they will head out on
Highway 84 and towards Lubbock.

Not very many people can run like these kids can and as long as they do. They get up and are running before most of our alarms have even gone off. They deserve 2 claps and a Ric Flair hahaha!

Gold trophies are a special thing! They are EARNED, not given. What a special journey for this team and group of seniors!

Some of the hardest working kids I’ve ever been fortunate to coach! They will forever be remembered for adding HISTORY to Post High School.

Greatness is seen during the season, but is made during the offseason. Our Lady Lope JH and HS basketball teams combined for 70 wins this season! This is a direct result of our kids showing up to summer league and open gyms, and the parents who got them there! Champions do not become champions when they win the event, but in the hours, weeks, months, and years they spend preparing for it.

Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, we are suspending the sale of reserve football tickets. UIL has instructed us to limit the Stadium capacity to half of the total seating capacity. We feel in order to be fair to everyone, seating will only be reserved for the parents of the students participating. All other ticket sales will be at the gate. Away games will be determined by the host school and we will be notified in advance as to how many fans will be allowed in. When we receive the away game information we will let you know how this process will work. The scrimmage on August 21st will be free and we will be monitoring at the gates. I don’t anticipate the crowd level being over half capacity at the scrimmage. I hope everyone can understand the situation that we are in and can be glad that our students are getting to participate. We look forward to a successful season. Go Bold Gold.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3096217843829147&id=578688925582064,,0.0,"Post Antelope Fans

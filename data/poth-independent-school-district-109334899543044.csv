Mrs. Pruski's Art classes have been working on some amazing artwork!

The Shattered Glass Design was done by Art 1 students. They had to reveal an image using Chiaroscuro which controls light and darkness in value.

Art 2 created the Negative Space Collage with Watercolor. Students selected a variety of objects and arranged them to be visually appealing. Students then traced the contours of the shapes. In order to transfer the design, students used natural light from a window to trace onto other sheets. When finished, students painted the negative background space with watercolor.

The chair’s seat had to be a minimum of 16 inches off the ground and the backrest had to be a minimum of 32 inches tall. The chair had to be aesthetically pleasing, comfortable, and easily hold a grown adult for an extended period of time. The only materials they could use were cardboard and glue (adhesive).

Poth Elementary Honors Mrs. Kallies

It’s that time of year when we take a day to honor and remember a great and special reading teacher from Poth ISD.

Mrs. Kallies taught here at Poth Elementary for 30 years. She was a third grade teacher for 20 years and was our reading specialist for 10 years. Many of you may have heard Mrs. Kallies say, “The only way to get better at reading is to practice.” With that thought in mind, we feel that the best way to honor her is to spend the day reading. Open up your books and let your imagination soar as we honor this special teacher. And remember- Reading will take you places even when you have to stay where you are.",0.0,"Poth Isd Poth Isd

A quick reminder of State Laws that ensure school bus safety for students.

🛑If you approach a school bus from either direction and the bus is displaying alternating flashing red lights, you must stop.

🛑Do not pass the school bus until: the school bus has resumed motion, or you are signaled by the driver to proceed, or the red lights are no longer flashing.

🛑It isn’t necessary to stop when passing a school bus on a different road or when on a controlled-access highway where the bus is stopped in a loading zone and pedestrians aren’t permitted to cross.

Let’s do our part in ensuring the safety of all students and making sure they make it home safely at the end of each school day.

Inclusive Schools Week
December 3-7, 2018

Please join POTH ISD in celebrating Inclusive Schools Week, December 3-7, 2018. This annual event was created 17 years ago to celebrate the progress schools have made toward providing a quality education for our increasingly diverse student population and those students marginalized due to disability, gender, socio-economics status, cultural heritage, language preference and other factors.

Inclusive Schools Week provides an opportunity for educators, students and parents to discuss and initiate practices to further ensure schools continue to improve their goal of successfully educating ALL children.

In the next few weeks we will post additional information regarding the various celebration ideas that we will have planned to help in promoting awareness, building knowledge, and bringing about change!

Information below to order a POTH ISD Inclusive School t-shirt. Order due Nov 9th. Order forms can be picked up at campus offices or at the Admin Office.

GAGE SPENCE, a freshman at Poth High School, had a winning weekend at the YCB Fall Classic in Floresville. In his 7th year of showing cattle, GAGE had two wins at this show: Champion Hereford and Champion Brahman!

GAGE likes showing cattle because of all the friends he makes and the many life lessons that have been learned because of the responsibilities that come with this activity. Most importantly, he is building his college fund while doing something he likes! Raising and caring for Flash (Hereford) and Pure Power (Brahman) has been a rewarding responsibility for Gage.

Gage's parents are GARRETT & AMY WIATREK and JASON & ROBIN SPENCE.

There were seven stations in which the students had to follow directions in order to engage in activities that resembled those of what happened in a mission in 1680. The students took a vow of silence as they progressed through the stations.
They did various activities that would take place in missions during that time period. The students ground corn for cornmeal, translated Spanish words, planted and harvested crops, ""cleaned"" the kitchen, slept in a dormitory, and sorted seeds for planting.

Poth ISD is proud to recognize PHS teacher TARA LOEFFLER for her commitment to education.

In June 2018, 523 Advanced Placement Biology teachers joined forces with college faculty who teach in the same discipline to score 259,663 AP exams. The careful evaluation of students' work by TARA LOEFFLER and other highly qualified professionals is one of the most important aspects of the AP Program. A huge part of the AP Programs's success is due to an evaluation and scoring process that reflects the high standards of AP Readers.

Any student that has been in one of MRS. LOEFFLER's classes knows that anything less than MAXIMUM EFFORT is unacceptable. THANK YOU for sharing your love of science and stressing the value of a challenging education for all students.

Mrs. Luna's 7th grade science class conducted an experiment on Forces in Nature. The students soaked beans and then put them in a petri dish with cotton balls and paper towel to moisten them to get them to germinate. The petri dish allows the students to see which way the roots will grow. They determined the roots grew downward with the force of gravity. It allowed the classes to see “Geotropism.”

The “Plaster of Paris” in the cups allowed the science classes to observe the beans sprouting upward to see the effects of Negative Geotropism.

The students also hung them in a closet in a cabinet to see if sunlight or lack of had anything to do with germination. Results to come at a later date!

Poth ISD Science Classes continue to have fun learning activities in the classroom!

Last week Mrs. Loeffler's Chemistry classes learned how to safely use Bunsen Burners in the lab and then completed the lesson with The Flame Test. The Chemistry students learned how this experiment helps scientists better understand the structure of an atom. After this experiment they learned how to calculate the energy in the photons they observed. Mrs. Loeffler said ""I think it’s safe to say that our Chemistry students understand how Math and Science go hand in hand!"" Mrs. Loeffler's favorite comment that she heard was, “How did they think of this stuff?”

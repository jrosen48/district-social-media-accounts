Some three months later, we am pleased to be able to share this song with you now, as performed by the PCS Combined Virtual Choir. Over 100 students in grades 5-12 participated to help bring this performance to life. The students showed incredible bravery, perseverance, and a true love of music.

78,3.0,,20.0,https://youtu.be/EEDoqToODpk,2549250085287538,"Members of the AAK Show Choir recently decided to participate in a ""virtual choir"" project in which students record themselves singing their individual parts at home before sending them on to me to edit into a full choir performance. It has been a big learning curve for all of us, but I am so proud of our kids and their singing that I wanted to share the performance with you.

The piece ""One World, One Voice, One Song"" is one that the Show Choir had been working on since September, but some of the song's lyrics feel perfectly apt for what we are going through today:

So many voices waiting to be heard
So many people with promises deferred
But in the darkest hour your hope is not in vain
Just hold on 'cause the light will shine again
And we'll be one world, one voice, one song
Love is here and this is where we all belong
Closer every day, each in our own way
Till we're one world, one voice, one song

AAK Virtual Show Choir One World, One Voice, One Song",3.0,"Members of the AAK Show Choir recently decided to participate in a ""virtual choir"" project in which students record themselves singing their individual parts at home before sending them on to me to edit into a full choir performance. It has been a big learning curve for all of us, but I am so proud of our kids and their singing that I wanted to share the performance with you.

The piece ""One World, One Voice, One Song"" is one that the Show Choir had been working on since September, but some of the song's lyrics feel perfectly apt for what we are going through today:

So many voices waiting to be heard
So many people with promises deferred
But in the darkest hour your hope is not in vain
Just hold on 'cause the light will shine again
And we'll be one world, one voice, one song
Love is here and this is where we all belong
Closer every day, each in our own way
Till we're one world, one voice, one song

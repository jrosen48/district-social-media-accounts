Last evening the Pottsgrove Board of School Directors approved a change to the 2019-2020 school calendar. The Board unanimously agreed to move the final professional development day of this academic year from Tuesday, April 28th to Friday, May 1st.

This revised schedule will ensure that all students will receive four continuous days of instruction under our Continuity of Education plan.

To re-iterate, May 1st is a teacher in-service day and there will be no educational obligation for students.

Re: School Closure

Dear Pottsgrove Families,

As many of you already know, Governor Wolf has ordered all K-12 schools and programs, public and private, to be closed through the end of the 2019-20 academic year. Pennsylvania Pre-K Counts, Head Start Supplemental Assistance Programs and Preschool Early Intervention programs will also remain closed, and institutions of higher education are prohibited from offering in-person instruction.

While this may not be the news we were hoping for, it will allow teachers and administrators to move forward with our Continuity of Education program that has already begun.

While there are many unanswered questions from this announcement, I can assure you that we will continue our due diligence as we navigate through these uncharted waters.

In the meantime, enjoy the arrival of spring, the warmer temperatures, and the simple joys that they bring.

After providing more than 670 meals to Pottsgrove families this morning, we wanted to update you on some changes to help alleviate some of the concerns we experienced today.

Beginning tomorrow, Wednesday, March 17th, we will provide a combined breakfast and lunch package for the next three days (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday) at both West Pottsgrove and Lower Pottsgrove Elementary Schools from 9:00 am to 12:00 noon. This will alleviate parents having to make daily trips. The hours for Wednesday, the 17th will remain the same at both locations.

As we move forward, we will communicate any changes beginning next Monday, March 23rd as we move forward. Please be assured, we will make sure this service continues for our families throughout the entire school closure.

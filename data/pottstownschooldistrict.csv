Good Afternoon Pottstown Parents,

We are asking for your participation in a very short survey about food distribution. The survey is attached at the bottom of this post or you can go to our website. Simply put, we want to find out if it would serve our community better to provide for five days of food distribution at once or to provide food daily. Your voice matters. Please participate today! Thank you!

Buenas tardes, padres de Pottstown,

Le pedimos su participación en una encuesta muy breve sobre distribución de alimentos. La encuesta se adjunta al final de este correo electrónico o puede visitar nuestro sitio web. En pocas palabras, queremos saber si sería mejor para nuestra comunidad proporcionar cinco días de distribución de alimentos a la vez o proporcionar alimentos a diario. Tu voz importa. ¡Participa hoy! ¡Gracias!

During the food distribution at elementary schools from 3pm to 6pm today, there will be paper packets of enrichment activities for every grade level from Prek-8th grade. There are not nearly enough for everyone.

PLEASE, only take these printed materials if you have no internet access, or no device to access the activities teachers are sending.

Just as we are doing with food, this is based on the honor system. No questions will be asked, but please keep the paper copies for those students who need them.

The walk was held this past Saturday and Ms Hall’s class didn’t just meet their goal, they shattered their goal!!!

They raised a total of $1,606.50 between online donations and those who showed up to walk on Saturday!!!!!

🌹 In honor of today's holiday, we debuted Heart Breaker Trojan Man! Trojan Man Jon was busy today spreading love and joy as he delivered 12 chocolate flowers to 12 faculty and staff members, chosen by the Trojan Men! Each staff member also recieved their own copy of ""The Adventures of Trojan Man!"", personalized and autographed by Trojan Man himself!!!!

After delivering his gifts, Trojan Man Jon also hung out with the Entrepreneurship program who were selling roses and candy in the cafeteria! A great marketing tool Trojan Man is!

To end his day, Trojan Man Jon visited our friends in the Pre-K Counts classroom at the high school for a quick hello during their lunch time!

This year, the Trojan Men of PHS are doing things a bit different! Instead of a Toy Drive, we are going to host a STUFF-A-STOCKING fundraiser for the Pre-K Counts students in the Pottstown School District. We are going to start in the classrooms that our Early Education students go to for their clinical experience and then we will branch out from there.

We are looking to make as many stockings as possible, so we are encouraging shoppers to make their purchases at the dollar store which will help us reach our goal.

There are two ways to donate to our fundraiser...

1.) You can donate $10. This $10 will go towards purchasing a stocking and the eight items shown on the flyer.

2.) You can purchase the items shown on the flyer and drop them off at the high school.

If you have any questions or concerns, please leave them in the comment section and I will get back to you as soon as possible.",2.0,"The Trojan Men are hosting a Stuff-A-Stocking fundraiser!

What was also lost was the place to go on Thanksgiving morning, to connect with old friends, watch a muddy game, and sip down some hot chocolate from the snack bar. Well, we want to bring that tradition back. Join us for our first annual TURKEY BOWL @thealleyonhighstreet.

As I go into my 20th year in education and my 5th as principal I can honestly say this is a really hard job that requires more sacrifice and heartache than I'd ever imagined. Thankfully, it isn't a job, it is a calling. Working with children and guiding children is an honor. Looking at this picture brings me joy. Knowing that I work with people who c are like I do and who share their gifts and talents with Pottstown's students makes me not only proud, but lucky. To the coaches, the teachers, the mentors, the administrators, and the parents: may your school year be filled with success and happiness and most of all, thank you for sharing the same mission to make the world a better place than we found it by guiding tomorrow's leaders.",2.0,"We are thankful for all of our principals, teachers, staff, admin, mentors, parents and students! #PottstownProud

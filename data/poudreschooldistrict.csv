Mr. Rice was a devoted educator who dedicated more than three decades of his life to serving PSD students and families. His 32-year tenure at the district included positions at the former LaPorte High School, Wellington Middle School, Rocky Mountain High School, and Poudre High School – where he served as principal until his retirement in 1992.

It was the district’s great honor to name Rice Elementary School after Mr. Rice in 2007 when the school opened in Wellington, the town where Mr. Rice was born and raised.

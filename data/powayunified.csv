Last night, over 80 students and staff got dressed up and danced to the sounds of J. Soul Productions for the first ever VIRTUAL Abraxas Transitions Prom. As you can see, they had a great time! JSoul Productions is a San Diego DJ who donated time so students could have their annual prom via Zoom. To everyone who helped make this memorable event happen for our students, THANK YOU. üôè The smiles on all our students' faces say it all.

Abraxas High School‚Äôs Transition program in Poway is for young adults with developmental disabilities, ages 18-22. They learn life skills to gain greater independence. They learned about how to dress, how to make fun themed snacks, and many other practical skills to prepare for the big night. Video shared from CBS 8 - San Diego News.

Some information to consider as North Dakotans debate when, or whether, K-12 schools should reopen for the end of the 2019-20 school year. The Centers for Disease Control guidance on avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people is in effect until April 30, at least. Our number of reported COVID-19 infections has been rising sharply; Gov. Burgum has said the infection rate would need to be falling before he would consider lifting his school-closure executive order. The regularly scheduled end of the school year will arrive within five weeks from TODAY for more than two-thirds of North Dakota’s students; in other words, any school reopening for 2019-20 would be brief.

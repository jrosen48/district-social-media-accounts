Dear Parents and Guardians:

As expected, the Governor made his announcement about extending the school closure. All school buildings will be required to remain closed for the rest of this school year. Online learning, child care and food deliveries will remain as they are now.

The Governor shared that the decision on the ability to hold Summer School (as we usually do, not for all students) will come at the end of May as things continue to evolve.

Now that the decision has been made, I am sure that there will be further discussion about the specific date that remote learning will end this school year. We did not observe spring break, nor were we permitted to take off unused emergency closing days. I am sure that many districts will be raising these questions, and decisions to that end will be forthcoming.

In future sessions we look for information from the Governor regarding the budget vote and elections. Remember the school buildings are closed, not school. Our students are being educated each and every day.

Be Well,

Dear Parents and Guardians:

Writing to you with my weekly update. I have very little new information to share with you this week. The Governor repeated today that he will let us know tomorrow the status of reopening the schools. We are hopeful that he will also answer other questions as well such as whether or not there can be summer school for those who need it, when and how we will hold the school budget vote, as well as some other questions that remain unanswered.

The one bit of news today involved the August administration of the Regents examinations. The State Education Department today cancelled that testing. This makes sense as August exams are generally re-takes for June failures. To remind you, students who successfully pass their Regents course this year will get credit for that Regents exam.

Please plan on another message from me tomorrow as soon as the Governor announces the information regarding the rest of the school year and potential for return.

Congrats to Adam, Tyler & Zach !! Adam was selected as Player of the Year and Tyler & Zach as 1st team selections. These 3 players were voted upon by opposing coaches to become selected to the BCANY Section IX All Star team. They led Pine Plains to the Section IX Class C title and finished the season winning 10 of their last 13 games. To be able to coach a team with 3 family members has been a great blessing to say the least, a lot of great memories! For this team to finish the season strong and go out as section champs is a credit to our 6 seniors. Calab, Kyle, John, Adam, Tyler & Zach. Thanks for a great season 🇺🇸🏀🇺🇸",2.0,"Pine Plains Boys Basketball
March 20 at 8:58 PM ·

Congrats to Adam, Tyler & Zach !! Adam was selected as Player of the Year and Tyler & Zach as 1st team selections. These 3 players were voted upon by opposing coaches to become selected to the BCANY Section IX All Star team. They led Pine Plains to the Section IX Class C title and finished the season winning 10 of their last 13 games. To be able to coach a team with 3 family members has been a great blessing to say the least, a lot of great memories! For this team to finish the season strong and go out as section champs is a credit to our 6 seniors. Calab, Kyle, John, Adam, Tyler & Zach. Thanks for a great season 🇺🇸🏀🇺🇸",2020-03-21 06:47:35,,

Today the Pine Plains Central Schools received a strong recommendation from the Dutchess County Executive and the Dutchess County Commissioner of Health that public gatherings not be held in the county until at least the end of April.
In addition, Governor Cuomo has banned public gatherings throughout the state of 500 people or more. That ban is effective tomorrow, March 13, 2020 with no date noted for when it will expire.
Therefore, it is with regret that I must announce that the musical Peter Pan has been postponed until a date to be determined.
We will send a letter tomorrow with details of the other impacts that these actions will have on our scheduled events.
Information regarding the show tickets will be forthcoming from the Stissing Theater Guild.

In addition, Governor Cuomo has banned public gatherings throughout the state of 500 people or more. That ban is effective tomorrow, March 13, 2020 with no date noted for when it will expire.
Therefore, it is with regret that I must announce that the musical Peter Pan has been postponed until a date to be determined.
We will send a letter tomorrow with details of the other impacts that these actions will have on our scheduled events.
Information regarding the show tickets will be forthcoming from the Stissing Theater Guild.

The program of all three districts is under the excellent leadership of Mr. Larry Anthony, who has brought “economy of scale” to the program and innovative thinking to make the program cost effective while creating a more attractive and healthy menu. “Farm to school” programs have been established and efforts to reduce plastics and environmental impact are ongoing.

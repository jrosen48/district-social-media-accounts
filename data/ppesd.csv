Good News! We have access to Sierra Ridge and the District Office and power is restored. We are currently working on clearing enough space to accommodate the work packet pick up scheduled to begin Monday.
I want to give you clarification on the Stay at Home Order issued by Governor Newsom last night and how that effects our plans. In the executive order, it states that K-12 education is an essential function in as much as our obligation to provide meals and keep the continuity of learning moving forward. This means that we will be able to move forward with our plans for distance learning and food service also beginning Monday. Just a reminder that specific information about the times and methods for work packet pick up will be sent out on Sunday.

Dear Pollock Pines ESD Families,

First, I hope everyone is safe and warm. Our current situation is challenging to say the least. The storm has not helped and we continue to monitor the situation and receive guidance from the County Office of Education and the County Public Health Office.

The amount of snow and the power outages have greatly hampered our efforts to provide services during the school closure. We had planned to get staff together to plan work for students and provide resources for families during the outage. We had also planned to provide meals during the outage. The severity of the storm was such that staff could not safely report to work.

At this point, we are in the process of getting access to the schools. Sierra Ridge and the District Office are still without power as of Tuesday, March 17, 2020. We have no estimation at this time of when it might be restored.

I would ask for your patience during this time of uncertainty as we work to do what we can for your children.

I want to thank all of you for your patience and understanding during these past unprecedented few days. I realize the burden that closing the schools creates for families and it is not a decision we take lightly.

I also want to let you know that the three days we missed this week will be made up on the first three days after the Spring Break. These dates are April 13, 14, and 15.

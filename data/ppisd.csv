Kandis Milner is our Teacher of the Year for the 2014-2015 school year. Mrs. Milner is one of the most respected teachers on our campus. Her genuine love for kids and for teaching is seen each and every single day. This year, we created a “brag box” where PPHS faculty and staff members would write something down positive about a teacher, office staff member, or aide. It never failed that each time I opened up the box, someone on this campus was saying something positive about her. Everyone knows what kind of teacher she is. She teaches hard bell to bell. She gets after kids (although she’s very sweet about it). She’s always working with kids, always worrying about kids—and that’s why they love her. They know she cares.

We are incredibly fortunate to have someone of her talents in a classroom because she truly does make a difference. Simply put: she is a remarkable teacher.

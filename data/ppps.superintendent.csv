The name Rufus was chosen for the male pup, and Rosy for the female pup.

The names were submitted as part of a contest for elementary-aged students in Paw Paw schools, and the winners of the contest were Ava Martin at the Later Elementary (pictured with Principal Davison), and Isabella Holbrook and Corbin Anderson at the Early Elementary.

Rufus is the Latin word for ""red"", and is part of the scientific name of the Red Wolf (Canis rufus). Rosy is of course both a name, and an adjective to describe something as both being reddish in color, but also cheerful and optimistic.

We think these are awesome names to remind our elementary students that they belong to the Paw Paw Red Wolf pack, and that having knowledge (like science), and being cheerful and optimistic are great ways to have success in and out of school.

AFS high school exchange student program is looking for host families for students who are coming to our area this fall. Host families provide a bed, food, & loving support. Students come with their own health insurance and spending money. Families of all types; married, single, single parents, young children, no children, can host. Families have the option to host for the school year, semester or just 6-12 weeks. Will you be that person, that family who makes a world of difference in the life of a young person?

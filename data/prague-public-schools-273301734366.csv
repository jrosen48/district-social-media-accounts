TONIGHT, Friday April 10th at 8:20 pm (20:20) we will be honoring our Senior class of 2020. We will turn on the lights at the football field for 20 minutes. Please, remember to maintain social distancing protocols and stay in your vehicle!

High schools across the nation will light up their football fields on Friday, April 10 at 8:20 p.m. for the nationwide ""Be the Light"" Campaign.

The campaign was designed to recognize and honor all of the 2020 seniors and their academic and extra-curricular accomplishments.

The lights on the football field will be on for 20 minutes and 20 seconds, and residents are encouraged to drive by and honk in support for this graduating class of seniors, while still practicing social distancing.

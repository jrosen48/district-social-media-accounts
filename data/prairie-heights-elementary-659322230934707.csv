Fort Wayne TinCaps

Prairie Heights Middle School
April 15 at 1:50 PM ¬∑

Many of you have been asking about the Tin Caps game that would have been today for our students. This is what we know at this time:
All families will get the tickets they ordered as well as their child's free ticket if they earned it.
Once the Tin Caps reopen, it is our understanding that they will accept these tickets at a future game this season.
We do not yet know, at this time, how we will be getting the tickets to families. When we have more information, we will let you know.

Of course, this is all subject to change as we learn more about the current virus situation. Thank you for your continued patience with us as we navigate this ever-changing situation.

THIS IS ONLY FOR LAGRANGE COUNTY FAMILIES...please take the time to fill out a survey from the United Way of Elkhart/Lagrange Counties for information on how your family is doing during this time.

As many of you know, the families of our youngest children are often excluded from any formal community that could connect them to resources during times like this. In an effort to understand how the families of our youngest children are doing during this period of social isolation and continued K12 school closures we would appreciate it if you would share the following link with your families. Our communities cannot effectively support our families if we don't know what challenges they are facing. This will give us a global view of what our families are facing.

Dear Prairie Heights Families:

We were informed of a situation that has led us to recommend that a Prairie Heights Elementary student and a Prairie Heights Middle School student remain at home. The students were not directly exposed but live with someone who has been quarantined due to a possible exposure, but has not shown any symptoms. The State Department of Health was contacted by our school nurse, and their recommendation was to allow the students to remain at school since there were no visible signs or symptoms. However, for precautionary purposes, we have asked the students to remain at home for the next two weeks.

Respectfully,

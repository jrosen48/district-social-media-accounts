Hello! My name is Miss Skeens!

I'm the 8th grade science teacher here at PHMS!

I graduated from Trine University with a degree in Exercise Science in 2017. I started coaching middle school volleyball and high school tennis my sophomore year of college and that is where my love for being around kids developed. After working as a secretary/clinic aide at Fremont Middle School for 3 years, I decided that I want to be in the classroom, so here I am!

I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, going on walks with my dog, and playing some sort of sport. I would like to visit my little brother (he's in the picture with me) at Purdue University more throughout the year and hopefully attend some Big 10 basketball games... fingers crossed!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1655653118155959&id=726171604437453,,0.0,"MEET THE PHMS STAFF

My name is Jenny Hines and I will be teaching 8th grade Special Education. I graduated from Snider High School in Fort Wayne, Indiana and then went to Indiana University. For many years I worked as a librarian at the Allen County Public Library, then I stayed home to raise our three children. In more recent years, I have worked as a Special Education instructional assistant with Northwest Allen County Schools and earned my graduate certification for Special Education at Purdue University – Fort Wayne.

I grew up going to “the lake” with my family, staying in a little trailer near Jimmerson Lake and going boating on Lake James. I many have fond memories of swimming and hiking the trails at Pokagon State Park. My family also enjoys making music, so our campfires usually include a guitar or ukulele. We are also explorers and enjoy all kinds of traveling.

Small Van de Graaff machines like this are used for physics education; this same machine was used by both Ms. Courtright and Ms. McCrea when they were students at PHMS.,2020-02-07 20:21:23,,

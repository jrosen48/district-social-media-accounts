Yesterday Governor Parson in collaboration with the DESE ordered all Missouri Public schools to shut down for the remainder of the school year. Districts are required to continue to provide distance learning during this time through the remainder of the school year. For us this is May 13th. We will provide additional information on how our District will respond to this order moving forward but wanted you to be aware of this recent development.

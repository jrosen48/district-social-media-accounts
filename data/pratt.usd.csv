We will send updates on Monday and Tuesday next week as well. We are excited to get school started.

Parents, we appreciate your support and ask your help on a few items to help us during the pandemic. We do have a mask for a student who needs one, but students will like having a mask they have selected for fit and style. Please help them get acclimated before school--so far, our athletes are rocking it and doing a great job. Those younger students who have visited our buildings have been fantastic. They all show the can-do, Greenback spirit which will be one reason for their success throughout their school careers and after.

Students do need a mask in order to ride the bus. I do ask that if you can bring your child to school it will help our spacing on our buses tremendously. We still offer our bus service as normal (masks required to board and while riding) but any reduction in numbers on the bus will benefit all students.

The National Speech and Debate Association West Kansas district awards were announced by Zoom at 2 p.m. with about one hundred coaches, administrators, and students.
Drum roll...
Both Kahrie Stegman and Colby Barradas earned outstanding awards. Kahrie EARNED THE ACADEMIC ALL-AMERICAN for leadership and academics, one of a handful in our district to win the award. And Colby Barradas will be COMPETING AT NATIONALS in DRAMATIC INTERPRETATION in mid-June, at the first virtual nationals tournament ever.

(Yes, that’s Colby after winning his nationals qualifier position via Zoom!)

Wait for it...

Prince Dauntless and the cast sing “Opening for a Princess” 🤴🏻

Junior Colby Barradas has this to say: “The song ""Opening for a Princess"" really shows the inner personality of Prince Dauntless. This song follows the scene where a princess takes a test to see if she is worthy to marry Prince Dauntless -- and fails! Dauntless, seeing that everyone else at court has a ❤️ love ❤️ interest, is very sad because he doesn't. To make matters worse, since there is a law in the land stating that no other couple can get married until the Prince is married, all the people in the land are mad at Dauntless.“",4.0,"Theatre Kansas

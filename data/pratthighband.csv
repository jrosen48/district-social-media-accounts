Call time for the HS band tonight is 5:45. 7th/8th band students should arrive at the game in time for the 7pm kickoff. At the end of the 1st quarter, MS band students should meet in the band room. Following halftime, they are free to go. Dress warm, preferably in Pratt colors if you can.
Tomorrow, HS instrument decorating is at 1pm in the band room. We play at 3pm in the municipal building. Ugly Christmas sweaters and anything else obnoxiously Christmas-y is encouraged!
If we beat Andale tonight, the state championship is at 1pm in Hutchinson on November 24th. Band members without prior obligations are asked to be at the band room at 10:45 to get things together for the game. We would leave at 11 or soon after. I'll plan a meal stop after the game.

I hope everyone has a safe and fantastic Thanksgiving.

I'm looking to try something new this year during band camp. Since the kids are working incredibly hard both inside and outside, I'd like some help keeping them fueled and hydrated during camp.

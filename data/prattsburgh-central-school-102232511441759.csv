We had a great first day here at PCS. It was awesome to see so many students.

Please help me continue to stress the importance of following the rules we now have. We have to social distance as much as possible, and we have to wear a mask when we can't. Even if students have been spending time together all summer and have not been social distancing or wearing masks, we have no choice in school. You can follow this link to a statement that we will be referring to as long as we have these rules in place:

https://www.prattsburghcsd.org/cms/lib/NY02205377/Centricity/Domain/55/Superintendent%20Statement.pdf

Thanks again for talking to your children about the importance of remembering to watch your distance, wear a mask, and wash your hands.

Finally, we got a lot of the kinks worked out with Operoo, so let me know if you continue to have issues.

It appears that several people did not receive the Operoo message in order to do the daily health screenings. Since school starts tomorrow, we need a quick solution while we determine why people didn’t receive the message from Operoo.

If you were NOT able to sign up with Operoo, please email me at bayk@prattsburghcsd.org tomorrow morning by 6:30 am that your son/daughter has been temperature screened. Remember that anything 100 degrees or higher means that the student must stay home.

Please also include up to date contact information (cell numbers and e-mails) so that we can update our management system.

Thank you for your patience as we put these new practices into motion.

1. Absentee ballots for the school budget vote were sent to qualified voters and are due back to the district office by June 9 at 5 PM. If you did not receive a ballot, please call Roxy at 522-6211.
2. The budget information is available at https://www.prattsburghcsd.org/domain/15. The highlight of the budget is that there is a 0% tax levy increase proposed and we still plan to keep all programs in place for our students.
3. There is also a capital project referendum vote and all of that information can be found here: https://www.prattsburghcsd.org/domain/52.

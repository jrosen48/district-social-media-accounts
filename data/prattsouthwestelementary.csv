Finish the day on a positive note

To help your child feel safe and secure in this sometimes uncertain world, tuck him in every night. This can be a time for you to share your positive thoughts with him. He can also share his hopes and dreams with you. You can sing a bedtime song, or read a story to your child. Make this time a special time for you both.

Provide some responsibility practice

Responsibility can be learned. And the best way to teach it to your child is to give her some responsibilities. Elementary school students are old enough to be responsible for getting up on time, completing assignments and a chore or two, treating others with respect and going to bed on time. Let your child know what you expect, and what the consequences will be for shirking responsibilities.

Empower your child to find answers

Schoolwork is easier when students have a reference library at their fingertips. Set your child up with access to an age-appropriate dictionary, a thesaurus, an almanac or encyclopedia and a world atlas. They can be in book form or bookmarked online. When your child has a question, show him how to use these resources to answer it, until he can do it easily on his own.

Give your child a checklist to encourage quality work

Establishing positive study habits will help your child get the most out of schoolwork. To encourage her to give assignments her best effort, give her this checklist.

Did I complete every step of each math problem? Have I double-checked my work?

Student health and safety are the top priority for schools and families. Good nutrition, adequate rest and immunizations help prevent illness, but one of the simplest ways to keep your child healthy and learning is to teach him effective hygiene. Make sure your child knows to wash his hands frequently with soap, and to use hand sanitizer if soap isn't available. When he's outside your home, remind him to avoid touching items that aren't his.

In these uncertain times, family-school communication is more important than ever. Families need to know who they can turn to with questions. Do you know the name of the school principal?

Teach your child to read textbooks effectively

Your child will read many textbooks in her school career. To help her retain what she reads, encourage her to preview the text by reading the main headings and scanning the pictures.

Then she can read the chapter itself in short sections, making sure she understands each section before moving on.

We do have a mask for a student who needs one, but students will like having a mask they have selected for fit and style. Please help them get acclimated before school--so far, our athletes are rocking it and doing a great job. Those younger students who have visited our buildings have been fantastic. They all show the can-do, Greenback spirit which will be one reason for their success throughout their school careers and after.

Students do need a mask in order to ride the bus. I do ask that if you can bring your child to school it will help our spacing on our buses tremendously. We still offer our bus service as normal (masks required to board and while riding) but any reduction in numbers on the bus will benefit all students.

To build vocabulary, construct a word wall

Help build your child's vocabulary by making a word wall. You'll need index cards, a marker and tape. First, ask your child to help you choose new and interesting words from her books. Have her write one word on each card. Then she can color the letters. Mount 10 cards on an easy-to-see wall. Next, help her make sentences with the words. When your child knows the words well, choose another 10.

Build a thoughtful pause into your responses

Before you answer your child's questions or intervene to correct her behavior or mistake, stop and take a deep breath. The short break will help you avoid answering questions or making decisions your child could answer or make for herself if she had enough time. Pausing will also help you avoid acting or replying without thinking and then having to apologize or change your mind.

Positive discipline strategies teach, rather than punish

Effective discipline doesn't punish children for behaving badly. It teaches and motivates them to behave well. You are your child's primary role model. If you want him to stop yelling when he's angry, don't yell when you're angry. It's also important to help him understand your rules and the consequences for breaking them. Enforce rules consistently, and then appreciate your child's efforts and let him know you love him.

Use expectations to emphasize two key lessons

""Two of the most important lessons children can learn,"" wrote columnist William Raspberry, ""are that they matter and that they are counted on."" A great way to show your child she matters is to set expectations. When you maintain a regular study time, for example, she learns that her education matters to you. When you expect her to act responsibly, she knows you count on her and think she's capable.

Help your child feel capable of doing hard things

Some kids are willing to try hard, even if the work is tough. Others give up before they get started. What's the difference? It's the kids who believe in their ability to succeed who stick with it. Tell your child that she has what it takes to do a good job. Then remind her that ability without effort won't get the job done. Encourage her to work hard to reach goals that she has the power to achieve.

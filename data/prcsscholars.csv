Ms. Levach is from Hamilton, NJ and studied special education and English at TCNJ. When she first applied to college, she wanted to be a writer. However, she soon found her calling with education! Her biggest inspiration is her dad, who has shown her how important it is to be self motivated and have drive to complete anything she sets her mind to. #prcs #staffspotlight",2017-08-08 11:01:39,,

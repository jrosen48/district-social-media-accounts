We want to remind our voters, Preble Shawnee has the lowest combined school property and income tax rates of all Preble County‚Ä¶",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2566941130202739&id=1533781746852021,,0.0,"A paper has been circulating through the community with incorrect information. It states the levy ""would increase property taxes on a home valuation of 100,000 by $375.00 a year."" This is absolutely FALSE.

Property taxes are assessed at 35% of valuation...meaning, only $35,000 of a $100,000 home would be assessed the 3.75 mills.

$35,000 multiplied by .00375 = $131.25 annually or $10.94 monthly.

Please get up to date on the FACTS of this levy. We posted our Levy FAQ's in a post earlier today. Also, you can visit our website for more information. The link is below.

Recently, Preble Shawnee applied for and received a safety grant from the Ohio Bureau of Workers‚Äô Compensation. We were able to purchase additional entry doors for both Camden Primary and West Elkton Intermediate. The grant provided three dollars for every dollar Preble Shawnee spent on the project. With the installation of these doors, visitors now must enter the offices of each building and will not have open access to the building.

Our next focus will be at the Jr/Sr High School. Part of the proposed renovation this summer would be converting an existing classroom near the front doors into a new entrance for parents and visitors. This new office will house the attendance secretary and the School Resource Officer. This will limit access to the building just like Camden Primary and West Elkton Intermediate.

With the addition of the new doors, School Resource Officers in each building, and other safety enhancements, we are providing a safe learning and working environment for our students, staff, and families.

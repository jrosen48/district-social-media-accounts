Our administration, teachers, and parents push our students to pursue excellence with everything that they do at PASCS. Chess Club happens to be one of those enticing yet challenging activities that helps our students build life skills that they can implement not only on the chessboard but also in the classroom. This year’s Chess Club had over twenty-six students, and although Chess Club came to an immediate stop due to COVID - 19, all of our participants are winners and have exceeded our expectations. Thank you all for your interest and dedication during the 2019 - 2020 school year, and please remember this Premier Fun Fact; in life, take your time and make every move count.

This morning we visited Premier Arts and Science Charter School in Harrisburg! PASCS began as a child care center and daycare where parents, students and the staff of Premier Learning Center, loved what the center was doing so much that they worked to continue that mission by founding a K-5 charter school! The original child care center is still operating just across the street from the school!

PASCS provides learning opportunities for students using a back-to-basics, phonics-centered approach to learning. With an early introduction to a second language, the students will increase their listening ability, memory, creativity, and critical thinking. Their Socratic Method of teaching enables students to test the logic and soundness of an idea and begin to fearlessly explore the world around them.",0.0,"Thank you for visiting!

This morning we visited Premier Arts and Science Charter School in Harrisburg! PASCS began as a child care center and daycare where parents, students and the staff of Premier Learning Center, loved what the center was doing so much that they worked to continue that mission by founding a K-5 charter school! The original child care center is still operating just across the street from the school!

PASCS provides learning opportunities for students using a back-to-basics, phonics-centered approach to learning. With an early introduction to a second language, the students will increase their listening ability, memory, creativity, and critical thinking. Their Socratic Method of teaching enables students to test the logic and soundness of an idea and begin to fearlessly explore the world around them.",2019-03-14 20:57:48,,

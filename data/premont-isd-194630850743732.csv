Out of an abundance of caution, the Premont ISD developed a quarantine plan criteria stricter than current CDC guidance. Exposure in a classroom for 45 minutes with a COVID positive individual warrants a 14-day quarantine under the Premont Plan regardless if there was close contact. That was the standard used this week at PECA and it will be the standard moving forward. The district leadership team believes this higher standard protects students, their families, and staff.

Subsequently, these additional state funds are being used to support: increased salaries, new roof at PCHS, technology, new construction, staff lunch initiative, and safety protocols. Improvements made with absolutely no impact on the tax rate.

Rising property valuations, paying down debt, and a tremendous need have created an opportunity to begin discussing significant improvements at Premont Collegiate High School and new restrooms/concession area at the Stadium. This can be achieved with NO tax increase to Premont ISD citizens.

The possible May 2021 $4M Bond election will include improvements at PCHS such as: new/renovated Band Hall, campus/stadium new restrooms, classrooms, library, main office area and campus safety enhancements.

This realignment data reflects the significant enrollment gains throughout Premont ISD. The 19-20 school year has seen a 14% increase in membership.

Communities who invest in their schools thrive. The Premont community has a history of supporting their schools as evidence by the passage of the 2017 Bond Election. Programs currently available to Premont students, high quality staff, and the opening of a new hi-tech safe elementary campus will continue to energize future growth. Congratulations!

Yesterday the Premont Collegiate High School and Jr. High Cross Country teams traveled to Falfurrias for a Cross Country Meet. Each and everyone of their efforts was outstanding. They all ran extremely well. We are really proud of their commitment and dedication. Many of these runners played in the band, a football game or a Volleyball game Friday night, got home really late, and they still showed up Saturday morning to run. Next Saturday these runners will run in San Diego. What a great start to our Cross Country Season. Again great job everyone. #hardworkpaysoff",0.0,"Coaches Cantu is with Aiden Sanchez and 20 others.

The Texas Education Agency has invited Premont ISD to participate in the Teacher Incentive Allotment (TIA) Advisory Committee.
New legislation (HB3) provides additional state revenue to reward highly effective teachers. The Committee’s stared purpose is to create a pathway for Texas teachers to earn six-figure salaries. Last month, Premont ISD educators earned over $288,000 in additional compensation as a result of student performance, teacher effectiveness, and retention.

I have invited Joel Trevino, Gilda Hofstetter, and Natalie Garza to join me in Austin on the committee.

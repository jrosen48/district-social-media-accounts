Meet Tyree B.! Tyree, a senior at MC2 STEM High School, will be moving on to attend Baldwin Wallace University in the fall where he plans to major in English and Psychology. Over the course of the past three years, Tyree says Minds Matter has helped him develop the courage to defeat the college process and given him mentors that are now like family to him. In his spare time, Tyree loves to meet new people, dance, and read. He's even a part of the CSU Dance Team, which he plans to continue in college! Tyree is most passionate about developing his overall self. Once he finishes his academic career, he plans to come back and contribute to Minds Matter of CLE (we sure would love that!). According to his mentors, Andrew and Eric, ""We are proud of how Tyree has risen to the exceptionally high level of performance we've come to expect out of our Minds Matter students. It has been our privilege to share his journey. We see confidence and excellence for you, Tyree, and remember that your world is as big as you make it. Rise above, Tyree.""

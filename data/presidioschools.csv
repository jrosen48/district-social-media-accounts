As many of you know, the Arizona Department of Education, in conjunction with the Governor, have decided to close all Arizona schools from March 16-27, 2020. We understand that this may cause strain to our families and will do what we can to ease the strain. The Board will continue with the meeting scheduled for Tuesday, March 17, 2020, where they will develop policies and procedures related to the closure. Please continue to send any questions, concerns, or comments to Erin Foudy at efoudy@presidioschool.com so that she can compile a list for the Board. The Board will issue a statement after the meeting. We will do our best to keep you appraised of any information we receive from the State. In the meantime, I wish you all a safe and healthy Spring Break.

I hope your new year treated you all well thus far. Due to circumstances beyond our control, Mr. Bretney was not able to join Presidio. While it proved challenging to move schedules around initially, I am happy to report that Mr. Ben Berry, who previously taught 8th grade Social Studies and Writing, has moved to the high school Stats, Physics, and Algebra I position. Mr. Berry taught Physics and Stats at his previous school, so we are excited to have him share his expertise with our high school. I would like to introduce Webb Eliscu, our new 8th grade Social Studies and Writing teacher. Webb comes to us from Tanque Verde school district where he taught 7th and 8th grade Social Studies. He has a wealth of experience and knowledge. Webb has been spending time on campus this week and will officially begin teaching on February 3. We are thrilled to welcome ""Mr. E,"" as he prefers to be called, to the #PresidioFamily.

Happy Saturday!

I hope you are enjoying our wonderful, wet weather! I wanted to let you know that we are on a rainy day schedule today, which means that students will spend as little time as possible outside.

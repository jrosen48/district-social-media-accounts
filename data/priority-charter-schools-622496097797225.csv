We will host an open house on August 20th from 5 pm to 7 pm. This will not be a come and go event as it has been in the past. Each student will be assigned a certain time frame (30 min.) during which they have to come to campus. This will help us to avoid large crowds at once. Invitations, with the time for your family, will be send out next week. The nutrition department will be in attendance to accept application for free and reduced lunches. If your child rides the bus make sure to meet with the transportation department so they can give you the location, time for the departure and arrival time. After school care will be set up so you can sign up your child. We have worked hard all summer and finished some amazing restoration to the campus. We can't wait to show it off to you. GCA has been granted the official STEAM (Science Technology Engineering Art Math) designation. We are very excited for this coming year and will take it one day at a time.

Cade’s School awards ceremony at Temple Charter Academy School. This year of Kinder was so full of up and downs with Cade’s health. We never knew he would have gotten so sick throughout school. But through it all we had an amazing loving teacher Tammy Hobdy Knox who loved him with all her heart and kept encouraging him and teaching him the best that she could since he missed lots of school.
Some how she kept him on task and he grew so much this first year of school. He is so smart and knows so much and I thank the school system for that and his teacher.

I recommend this school to anyone who may need that smaller school environment for their child. It has been a beyond what I expected kindergarten year for Cade. We will miss all the sweet staff that are part of this school. Big hugs and we will have to come visit from time to time.

Even when life is interrupted by a global pandemic, life is still happening. We still have homes to run, we still have to find things we need.

We're not necessarily experiencing it like everyone else. But one thing is for certain; we're all experiencing it. We're living through the same storm, but experiencing it in a different boat.",3.0,"ESC Region 12 was live.

Occasionally, weather forces a delay in the school start time or the entire day of classes has to be postponed. If the weather requires either a delay in start time or a postponement for the day, the announcement is made through our SchoolMessenger® program. SchoolMessenger® allows us to send a phone announcement to all phone numbers we have on record, an email to the parent's email address on record, and a text message to the cell phone on record.

It is very important that parents help all campuses maintain up to date records. If any part of the parent's contact information changes, the parent should let the school office know as soon as possible.

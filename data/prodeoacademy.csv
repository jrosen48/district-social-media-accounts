In line with Governor Walz’s order from Wednesday, March 25th, all Minnesota schools will remain closed to students until at least May 4th, with students participating in distance learning until that time.

Prodeo’s teachers are working diligently to ensure that all families have at least one internet-connected device that students will be able to use each school day. Please contact the school or your student’s teacher right away to arrange a pick up.

Also, a quick reminder that Prodeo Academy will be on Spring Break next week -- March 30th through April 3rd -- so we won’t be providing childcare or food distribution.

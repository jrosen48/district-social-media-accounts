Don’t forget to consider the unique needs each person or pet may have in case you have to evacuate quickly. Update your kits and supplies based on recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control. After an emergency, you may need to survive on your own for several days. Being prepared means having your own food, water and other supplies to last for several days.

Dealing with COVID-19 over the past 6 months has taught that being prepared for emergencies is of utmost importance. Emergencies are not just limited to pandemics, but can also include natural or man made disasters. Plans that are created can and should be designed to deal with many emergencies. Discuss and drill your plans with your family just like we do here in Prosper ISD with our Safety Drills.

Each week we will share resources that will enable you and your families to plan for the unexpected.

The Theme this year for National Preparedness Month is:

"" Disasters Don’t Wait. Make Your Plan Today.""

Week 1- Make a Plan-
Talk to your friends and family about how you will communicate before, during, and after a disaster. Make sure to update your plan based on the Centers for Disease Control recommendations due to the coronavirus.

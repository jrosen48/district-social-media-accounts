Evergreen Elementary School and Cotati-Rohnert Park Unified School District are #SoCoEdStrong!

Last week, Ms. Pilar's 4th/5th grade class was rewarded a very special parade after the students collectively earned 100 life skills points. Ms. Pilar decorated her car with positive messages and drove by each of her student's homes in celebration of their hard work.

Ms. Pilar is a great example of a teacher going above and beyond to connect with her students during the shelter in place orders.

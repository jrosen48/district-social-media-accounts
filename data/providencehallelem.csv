🚨 Attention Students and Parents of Providence Hall 🚨
Herriman City and UDOT are working together to find a solution to minimize back-up on Mountain View Corridor (MVC) due to school drop-off and pick-up traffic. It’s a significant safety concern that we’re working on. We are conducting a traffic study that will recommend a solution and we anticipate the results of the study in the next few weeks. In the meantime, we’d like your help. Please do not pick up or drop off students on the sidewalk along the MVC; this poses a large risk to the students and those within the vehicle.

PHAST has sent out numerous calls for help on the book fair at the Elementary School and Junior High this week. Normally we have no problem getting those spots filled, but this week we have quite a few openings that need to be filled still or we will have to close down the book fair. If you can spare an hour out of your week, we'd appreciate anything you can do to help.

Here is the link to sign up:

Thank you for all your support! The book fair is a big fundraising opportunity for the schools.

The National Honor Society at PHHS is in charge of the Giving Tree this year. It is our goal to try to make the holidays a little bit brighter for those in need. However, we need your help to make this a reality.
The NHS students have decorated a tree in the front office of the high school with dozens of “gift” cards they have made. These cards have an item on them that can be purchased and donated back to the school. Once all the items have been collected, we will deliver them to individuals in the PH community in need. You can do the following to be a part of this great service project:
1. Go to the office and pick a “gift” card off the tree
2. Sign out the card on the card sheet
3. Purchase the item
4. Attach the “gift” card to the item
5. Give the item and its card to the ladies in the front office

The National Honor Society at PHHS is in charge of the Giving Tree this year. It is our goal to try to make the holidays a little bit brighter for those in need. However, we need your help to make this a reality.
The NHS students have decorated a tree in the front office of the high school with dozens of “gift” cards they have made. These cards have an item on them that can be purchased and donated back to the school. Once all the items have been collected, we will deliver them to individuals in the PH community in need. You can do the following to be a part of this great service project:
1. Go to the office and pick a “gift” card off the tree
2. Sign out the card on the card sheet
3. Purchase the item
4. Attach the “gift” card to the item
5. Give the item and its card to the ladies in the front office

Thank you so much! Happy Holidays!",2019-12-03 14:42:46,,

2nd grader Elijah Hartly!!

I'd like to personally thank all the families who have participated in the after school program not only remotely, but the entire year! I'm so happy that we had such an awesome turnout for after school. I've appreciated all the feedback and suggestions to make next year even better. Thank you very much.

Also, a biweekly raffle will be held for students attending summer camp. If you have any questions about summer camp please contact me.

Thank you,
La'Shawna McHenry

Kids Making a Difference: One Mask at A Time
""We‚Äôve all heard that there is potential for a shortage of masks in the medical community. So I asked myself how I could help. I certainly cannot make a medical-grade mask, but I can make something...something that can possibly help while the medical professionals look for answers to this virus pandemic. The masks I am making are soft and washable and even have a pocket for a paper towel liner to create more of a barrier. I believe that this will help many people who are looking for some kind of protection during this uncertain time. I foresee this being especially helpful for seniors and those who are visiting seniors since I know this is an especially vulnerable population.""

In preparation for potential Flexible Instruction Days / Remote Learning at Home due to the COVID-19 (Coronavirus), we ask that all parents/guardians report to Provident Charter School on Friday, March 13, 2020, in order to pick up their student device. When parents/guardians arrive at PCS, they will also have the opportunity to sign the Internet Reimbursement Policy, and to accept responsibility for the school device, which will allow the devices to be taken home. If you already have a pre-scheduled Parent/Teacher conference, please plan to arrive at your scheduled time. If not, PCS will be open for device pickup between 8:00 AM and 3:00 PM.

In addition, the nurse will be available to provide families with medication for those students who need their daily medication.

This dinosaur is hung in the 2nd grade hallway. It was made by 2nd graders. They didn’t know how important their piece was until it all came together.

Our school has so many different pieces working together to make this year an amazing experience for our students. We couldn’t do what we do if even one piece was missing.

So, thank you students, parents, teachers, janitorial staff, aides, health clerk, specialties, administration, cafeteria, title one, tech, secretaries, PTA, and everyone in the community for helping Provost be the best it can be.

Sometimes it’s hard to see the big picture

Often we are so busy working in our own little square of life that we forget to take a step back and see the big picture. And at times our part may seem small and insignificant, but if we could see just how important we are in the grand scheme of things, I think we’d be surprised.

This dinosaur is hung in the 2nd grade hallway. It was made by 2nd graders. They didn’t know how important their piece was until it all came together.

Our school has so many different pieces working together to make this year an amazing experience for our students. We couldn’t do what we do if even one piece was missing.

So, thank you students, parents, teachers, janitorial staff, aides, health clerk, specialties, administration, cafeteria, title one, tech, secretaries, PTA, and everyone in the community for helping Provost be the best it can be. Together we are Provost. #keeplearningfun #provostcougarsarethebest",2020-09-08 16:02:40,,

The survey is also a good chance for individuals to get support for their specific school.

Please take the survey and type in your school’s name at the end.

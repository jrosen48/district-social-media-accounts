Good Morning!
Food distribution will begin at 10:30 tomorrow until noon at the high school. With the weather getting hot we are gonna make the sandwiches and freeze them so they stay nice. If they are still frozen either keep them in the freezer and pull them out in the morning or eat them up. Also looking into changing the menu up for some more variety. ￼Things like pizza bagel bites and cheese quesadillas. I’m running into shortages on certain items like the peanut butter and jelly uncrustables ￼so will just be rolling with what we can. It’s looking more and more like we will be able to do this all summer. We sincerely hope this helps.

L.E.H. & P.R.S.D. Families,

As you are well aware, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to escalate in our area. To ensure the safety and well being of our staff, students, and community the Little Egg Harbor and Pinelands School Districts will remain closed through spring recess. The tentative date our schools will reopen is April 20, 2020. Please note, during spring recess (April 10th-April 19th) food will not be available to families. Refer to the Pinelands website, Food Finder link for resources to assist with feeding your family. Lastly, teachers will not be providing lessons or assistance during the spring recess time period. Students should use that time to catch up on any incomplete work.

Additionally, if you need a Chromebook for your student, we are limiting loaner devices to one per family due to the limited number of devices available in both districts.

Thank you for your patience. Stay safe!

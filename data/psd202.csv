Dear District 202 Families and Staff,

I hope you are all well and enjoying your summer break so far.

As you know, the State Board of Education yesterday released new guidance and direction for local school districts to return to school this fall.

As you might expect, this guidance is very complex and will take some time to fully sort out.

However, it essentially boils down to three key points:
1. In-person learning (that is, going “back to school"") is the priority
2. Essential safety measures must be followed, including wearing masks, washing hands, etc.
3. Plans must anticipate the possibility of more remote learning if/as needed

The good news is, District 202 administration, teachers and parents have been working on plans along these general lines since late April, so we are already moving in this direction and much of our planning is already done or in process.

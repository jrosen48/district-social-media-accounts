READ: ""Dear Class of 2020,"" by Tate McReynolds, a senior at Gig Harbor High School.

http://wiaa.com/Blog.aspx?BID=3

In our latest student story about how the COVID-19 shutdown is impacting students around the state, Tate offers some advice to her fellow seniors:

""We never thought our senior year of high school would end up like this. It could’ve happened anywhere, anytime, but it happened to us. And I’d like to think it happened to us for a reason. We’re a part of something bigger than ourselves now - something we’ll look back on at our high school reunions, and realize that all we’re missing out on now, is the hope for our future. My advice to other high school seniors: Make the most of the situation we’re in, because we’re in it for a reason.""

1️⃣ We’re providing free, live and on-demand AP courses

To support AP students affected by school closures due to COVID-19, students and schools will have access to live AP review lessons, delivered by AP teachers from across the country. Lessons will begin March 25.

2️⃣ We’re developing a new at-home testing option

Because of the challenges created by COVID-19, we’re developing a new at-home AP Exam option. Students will be able to test on a computer, tablet, or smartphone.

We will invest so that every AP student impacted by COVID-19 has the tools and connectivity they need to review AP content online and take the exam from home.

During this challenging time, we will work to give every AP student the opportunity to earn the college credit and placement they’ve been working toward all year while maintaining a focus on the health and safety of our AP community.

Work on a project to improve the 62nd Ave. NW and 144th St. NW intersection by Peninsula High School will resume next week, with crews installing components of the new traffic signal system. We expect to activate the new signal the week of Feb. 17 (Peninsula School District's mid-winter break). We will provide an update when we have the activation date.

There may be alternating one-way traffic along both 62nd Ave. NW and 144th St. NW between 9:15 a.m. and 2 p.m. on weekdays during this work. General work hours are 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on weekdays.

Final pavement work is expected to take place in mid-2020.

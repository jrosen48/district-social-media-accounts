I am excited to announce that the county has met the benchmarks for safely opening schools for in-person learning! The school board met this evening, and we have set our opening date for Wednesday, September 9th. Our teachers will provide students with independent activities to do online on Tuesday (8/8) in order to spend the day making final preparations to safely welcome their in-person students back into their classrooms. There will be no GoogleMeets on Tuesday, September 8th.

Please look for an email from your school tomorrow morning with more details regarding your learning options as we move into this phase of opening schools.

She leads a three teacher, five paraprofessional team who look after 60 children. “We have such a dynamic team here,” she said. “We have a lot of resources here in the Palominas school district.

Essentially, some android users are experiencing a popup when they access the app that asks them if they are at school today, if they are safe, and where they are. According to Edupoint, this is an emergency protocol that should not have been launched. Until we receive word from Edupoint that this issue is resolved, we have disabled StudentVue. ParentVue is not impacted. If your child has an Android phone and uses StudentVue, please make sure that they update the application regularly.

Sosman is an English language learner specialist at Drummond Elementary School, but also has a 6-year-old kindergartner and an 8-year-old second grader at home to support.

“It’s been a lot to juggle and my teacher-student ratio is stellar, but add working on top and it's a lot,” Sosman said.

Sosman and families across the U.S. are discovering what works in navigating at-home learning with their own children while still working either at home or in the workplace. She and other staff in Pattonville provided advice on how to be successful at balancing both worlds in this new era of social distancing.

Their advice boils down to three big steps:
1) Create your new normal.
2) Reach out for help.
3) Take care of you.

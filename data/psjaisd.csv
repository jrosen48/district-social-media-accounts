First launched in the Spring, the PSJA COVID-19 Hotline has now been expanded into a multi-team operation including additional campus nurses and assistance from additional medical experts to serve staff, students, and parents.

“We want to ensure that we are maintaining the safety and health of our entire PSJA Family,” said PSJA Superintendent Dr. Jorge L. Arredondo. “These collaborative measures are intended to streamline the process of identifying, communicating, and preventing further possible spread of COVID-19 cases. At PSJA, we were one of the first in the region to start a pandemic hotline to provide support during these uncertain times, and we recently hired a team of experts to support social and emotional needs of both students and staff as part of our new wraparound services.”

Some signs you can look for:
• No longer responding to calls and texts
• Changes in tone or language when talking, texting, or posting online
• Changes in the frequency and type of content shared online
• Changes in energy levels or appetite
• Increased use of substance abuse

¿Sabías qué PSJA es el único distrito escolar en el sur de Texas que gradúa estudiantes con el sello de doble alfabetización?

En la primaria, los estudiantes aprenden a leer en su primer idioma. Al inicio de 2o grado, los estudiantes reciben dos cursos de artes de lenguaje. Uno en inglés y el otro en español. Así es como los estudiantes aprenden a leer en dos idiomas. Empezando en PK3-5o grado, ciencias y estudios sociales se enseñan en español y matemáticas se enseña en ingles.

En la secundaria los estudiantes continúan tomando clases en ambos idiomas. Los estudiantes toman arte de lenguaje en español y en inglés y tienen opción de tomar una variedad de cursos en matemáticas, ciencias, o estudios sociales en español.

En PSJA sobresalimos en proveer una excelente educación bilingüe que prepara a los estudiantes para un diverso ambiente laboral.

According to Buell Central Social Studies Teacher Stacey Proctor, the project was inspired by a lesson on the ""Homestead Act of 1862"" that taught students about how the early settlers were able to keep over 160 acres of land if they raised livestock or cultivated. Through project-based learning, students were then inspired to find ways to cultivate their own food through a community garden.

“This PSJA Community Garden is open to the entire PSJA district and residents,” said Proctor during a grand opening celebration held Friday, Feb. 7, 2020. “We want students to learn to grow their own food and know where their food is coming from.

Our garden club members gathered the harvested kale and cabbage that they have grown as part of our Farm to School program in PSJA. Thank you to our science lab teacher Silvia Saldivar and Mr. Habraham Lopez for teaching our students how to plant, transplant, feed and water,harvest and pick the vegetables . Students were able to take their vegetables home to enjoy with a meal.

“Gardening adds years to your life and life to your years” 🌸 🌺

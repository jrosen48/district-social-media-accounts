Extended Closure until May 4th
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has ordered the state’s schools to remain closed until May 4th in the continuing effort to slow the spread of the new coronavirus.
PTAA campuses will remain closed until at least Monday, May 4. We are coordinating with other school districts in the county and will reassess the week of April 27th to make any decisions on whether there is a need to extend the suspension further.
PTAA schools have already shifted to remote learning. The learning varies by campuses and consists of online instruction and offline instruction using printed activity packets.
This is a quickly changing situation, and we will continue to monitor information, will assess conditions throughout the week, and will provide the next update the week of
April 27th via our website and email.
Thank you for your support and cooperation as we ensure that all members of the community in PTAA stay safe and healthy.

High school students will enter through the front doors and middle school students will enter through the second foyer (where you entered for orientation). Please have your child exit the car quickly and safely then enter the building. We are asking that parents not walk students in as we do not have enough parking.
Students are expected to be in formal dress-normal Monday attire. If you ordered a blazer and it has not come in yet, we will make note of that.
Remember students must be in their classrooms by 8am. If they are not in their classrooms, they are tardy.

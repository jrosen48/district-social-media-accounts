An opportunity for students to receive help on homework or to have a quiet place to work. It is very relaxed. You may come and go anytime between the hours of 9:00a.m. and 1:00p.m. We provide water and pizza about midway through.

If you need worksheets or tests from teachers, please ask for them or ask if teachers will place them in Ms. Hatfield's mailbox BEFORE Friday.

When?
9:00a.m. - 1:00p.m.

Where?
Ms. Hatfield's classroom, room 306, ALWAYS ENTER THROUGH THE FRESHMAN LEARNING COMMUNITY DOORS. You will not be able to go through the commons.

Who will be there?
Teachers will vary, but most often it will be Ms. Hatfield (English) and Mr. Campbell (Math and Global Studies). While the teachers have their strengths, they are also willing to help you with any other subject.

The Penny War Fundraiser has been in full effect all week! We've already received some great donations!!

How it Works:

Each home room has been given a container for their classroom students to put spare change in throughout the week. We will add up the donations for each class and report them during the afternoon announcements next week. Parents can also contribute cash or check in the envelopes that went home last week! The funds raised will be distributed among the teachers in the form of Amazon Gift Cards on Friday afternoon! Let's help the teachers help our kids by giving back to them what they spend on their students!

The last day to send in change will be Thursday, May 9th and the winning class will be announced that afternoon! The top earning class wins a Pizza and PJ Party for Friday, May 10th!",0.0,"There’s still time to send in donations for Teacher Appreciation Week!

It’s not as easy as one might think. She did some research and discovered La Boriqueña, a super hero created by famed comic book writer Edgardo Miranda-Rodriguez. She eventually got to meet him and share her love for this incredible hero.

Fast forward to today. Our young friend was presenting to her sisters about the impact of this character in her life. She spoke about the importance of her Puerto Rican heritage and how she has learned that every single girl could be a super hero. What she didn’t know is that her parents arranged for Mr. Edgardo to come to her presentation.

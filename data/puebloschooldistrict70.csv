We know it’s not the type of ceremony that our Seniors deserve, and not the type of ceremony that parents wanted, but we have worked diligently to plan and prepare a ceremony that meets local and state health restrictions while still celebrating our amazing Class of 2020.

It’s important to note that we sent out a survey to gather interest in four different scenarios, but shortly after that survey was completed, State Health Department and the Governor's Office changed their guidelines for public gatherings and we were forced to rework our plans. We even went as far as to submit a special variance through Pueblo County Commissioners.

We understand your frustration and angst over the situation. Seniors will be able to take their walk across their high school graduation stage and receive their diploma in front of 4 guests of their choice. The Ceremonies will all be recorded and Rye, PWHS, and PCHS will also have Live-Streaming of the ceremony. Schools will be sending out more information soon.

Dear Staff, Students, Parent and community members of Pueblo District 70.

It is with profound sadness I report on the unexpected and untimely death of one of our District 70 community.

Last night, Pueblo School District 70 learned of the death of a student involved in a tragic automobile accident in the Pueblo West area. The fatality was Jordan Scheinert, a 10th grade high school student enrolled in the District 70 Online School in Pueblo West.
Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of both District 70 students, and to the driver in the other vehicle.
During this time, as the school community processes the tragic news and copes with grief, we will offer counseling and support services to our students and staff.

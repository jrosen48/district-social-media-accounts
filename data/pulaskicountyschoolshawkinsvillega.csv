The report on Shelly this morning is that he is stable but his situation is still critical. The nurse was very direct with Vonnie this morning and said that it is too early to tell how this is going to go. She is only able to call the hospital to check on him once a shift change so the hospital is not bombarded with calls. The updates will be slow in coming.

This tells us that Shelly is not in the hands of doctors, nor in the hands of nurses, nor in our hands, but in God's hands, which is exactly where we want him to be. In fact, it is exactly where he would want to be. We definitely need to pray for the doctors and nurses as they care for Shelly and other patients, but all the time knowing that God is in charge. As this situation goes on, there is the temptation to pray less and move on to other things. Life must go on, but we can still ""pray without ceasing"" throughout the day for Shelly, Vonnie, and family! Stay positive and stay prayerful! I'll give updates as they come.

During the school closure mandated by the Governor to keep students safe, Work-Based Learning/Youth Apprenticeship students are not required to meet the weekly hours for work-based learning.

Pulaski County Schools have had significant progress in the past two years on CCRPI results. CCRPI is the instrument used by the state of Georgia to evaluate schools' and districts' academic performance. CCRPI results were first issued in 2012. The state has changed the standards frequently. This past year was the second year that schools and districts were measured by the same criteria. Pulaski County increased its score from 68.0 in 2018 to 75.4 in 2019 which represents a 10.9% increase. Pulaski County was the eighth-highest scoring district in 2018 in the Heart of Georgia RESA. We have moved to the fifth-highest scoring district for 2019 scores. It should be noted that only four-tenths of a point separated Pulaski from the third-place position in the RESA.

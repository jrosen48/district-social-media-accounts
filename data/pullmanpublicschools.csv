Congratulations to “Prickly Pin-Apples” and “Wait For It” who will be advancing to the state competition at the end of the month!
A huge “Thank You” to all the teachers, parents, and volunteers! You made this opportunity possible for all these wonderful kiddos!
It’s hard to keep track of everyone, so here is a bit of the fun.

2:39pm:

We are in communication with the Pullman Police Department related to police activity on the 300 block of Roberts Street in Pullman. The incident is currently isolated to a residence, and Pullman Police are monitoring the situation closely and do not consider our students to be at risk. Many of our students walk home in that area, so we are working with the police department to have a perimeter in place as a precaution that will divert students walking near this incident. Students unable to get to their home due to the perimeter will be directed to Pullman High School. Bus routes that typically drive on Roberts Street will use an alternate route. Kamiak students that get off the school bus at the Roberts and Yates bus stop will remain at school until parents pick up their child from school or police clear the area. We will immediately let families know if there is an update that might impact students. If you have any questions, please contact the district office at 509-332-3581.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3096099153734424&id=166642170013485,,0.0,"2/20/2020 Safety Alert

2:39pm:

We are in communication with the Pullman Police Department related to police activity on the 300 block of Roberts Street in Pullman. The incident is currently isolated to a residence, and Pullman Police are monitoring the situation closely and do not consider our students to be at risk. Many of our students walk home in that area, so we are working with the police department to have a perimeter in place as a precaution that will divert students walking near this incident. Students unable to get to their home due to the perimeter will be directed to Pullman High School. Bus routes that typically drive on Roberts Street will use an alternate route. Kamiak students that get off the school bus at the Roberts and Yates bus stop will remain at school until parents pick up their child from school or police clear the area. We will immediately let families know if there is an update that might impact students. If you have any questions, please contact the district office at 509-332-3581.",2020-02-20 17:39:32,,

Before school this morning, a group of students started their day in the Wellness Center at Kamiak. Prior to our movement session, students set a goal for the day using SOAR expectations as a guide. Students wrote their goal in a provided journal. After writing, students had 60 seconds at each movement rotation. After lunch, this group will return to the Wellness Center for a midday check in, and an opportunity to write a reflection about whether or not they met their goal.

They enjoyed meeting our Pullman High School staff and learning more about our schools. The exciting culmination of their visit was the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding agreeing to a future student exchange program between Okisho High School and Pullman High School. It is our hope and desire that our students will take advantage of this student exchange program to gain additional knowledge that will enlighten their minds and create lifelong friendships that will help build a more accepting, caring, and collaborative world. ❤️

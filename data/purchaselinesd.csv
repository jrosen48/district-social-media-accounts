On the evening of June 5th our graduating seniors will be lining up at KMI (the former North Elementary in Mahaffey) at 7:45 PM. They will be traveling along Route 286 to the high school for their graduation ceremony. We know that our seniors would love to see signs and balloons along the parade route and members of our community cheering them on their way. People that don't live along the parade route may watch the parade by parking their cars in a safe spot along the way to see the seniors drive by. If there is anything we have learned throughout the last few months, it is that we have an amazing and supportive community that comes together for one another. We can't wait to see all of you on June 5th!

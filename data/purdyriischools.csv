I had to run to get a few groceries today. As I was walking into the store, I saw one of our Purdy students checking out with a cart full of groceries. We were both so excited to see each other!

Asking what they were out doing- “Just buying something groceries for our pastor and his family. I’m going to run them to him now.” This simple statement and act of kindness brought tears to my eyes.

I cannot say how proud I am of our students. Looking out for others when it would be easier to look down and think only of ourselves and our families. This is true #purdyeaglepride.",0.0,"♥️♥️♥️ #PurdyEaglePride

Have you ever asked yourself, “self, what does Dual Immersion mean?”
You’re not alone, it’s a hot topic.
So, in short, Dual Immersion is a form of education in which students are taught literacy and content in two languages, those languages being Spanish & English.
The goal of this program is to help students achieve bilingualism-the ability to speak fluently in English and Spanish and bi-literacy, the ability to read & write in two languages.
Doesn’t that sound fantastic?
We think so.

Have you ever had a Black Hawk helicopter land in your back yard?
Us either, until today!
Our Bobcats had the pleasure of witnessing a Black Hawk helicopter land on our field today. They also had the privilege of sitting in a Black Hawk helicopter and trying on the pilot gear. The experience was beyond amazing.

A BIG thank you to our very own Ms. Perman for making this visit to our school possible.

Also, a HUGE thank you to our helicopter pilots for spending the day with us. You truly made everyone’s day.

What a Friday at Schnell School.
Our first Kindergarten Right Start was filled with amazing Bobcat parents and students. Loved to hear all of the fun learning happening during this time.
TK had their Bobcat Bazaar with Mrs. Bringolf, where they got to cash in their Bobcat Bonuses for all of their hard work.
And some of our brilliant Bobcats took part in our Student Council Elections. So proud of all of the Bobcats that got up to speak in front of the rest of us. They shared their ideas to help make our world(our school) a better place. Little do they know that they already do this just by being a Bobcat. All of their ideas were fabulous.
And that was all before 10:30AM- talk about getting things done😉

Girl Scout Troops 1285 & 2730 of El Dorado Hills worked hard over Spring Break to renovate our clothing closet.

And renovate they did! Look at this beautiful space! They worked on this space from floor to ceiling, INCLUDING building two shelves for organization.

The girls made two beautiful shelves out of palettes that originally carried their Girl Scout cookies. Can you believe that?
So handy and resourceful.
The folding desk they added to the space will make folding clothes so much easier as well.

And what about all of the clothes they collected for our closet? Wow is an understatement.

So handy and resourceful.
The folding desk they added to the space will make folding clothes so much easier as well.

And what about all of the clothes they collected for our closet? Wow is an understatement.

From the bottom of our hearts, Schnell School thanks you TREMENDOUSLY Girl Scouts.
You have transformed the Clothing Closet into a beautiful place.🌷💐🌸🌷💐🌸🌷💐🌸🌷💐🌸🌷💐🌸🌷💐🌸",2019-04-22 19:07:11,,

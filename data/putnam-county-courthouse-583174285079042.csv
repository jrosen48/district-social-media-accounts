Every school day, our teachers, staff, and administration are entrusted to provide a safe and healthy learning environment for each one of our students. Back to School is always a good time to refresh students and staff on safety precautions and procedures. You probably remember practicing earthquake, fire and tornado drills when you were a student.

🛎️Today we will be conducting two safety drills. First, we will have an earthquake drill sometime before lunch.

🛎️The last safety drill will take place this afternoon. We will be conducting a full evacuation drill. What does this mean?
In collaboration with local law enforcement, emergency responders, and other public agencies, we will safely evacuate all students and staff to our rally point. Once all the students and staff have arrived, we will all return to the school to finish the school day.

🛎️Again this is just a drill.

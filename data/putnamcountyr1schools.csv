Good morning, Putnam County R-I Community!

We continue to evaluate and attempt to ensure we are providing an effective, efficient, and safe pick up and drop off opportunities for our buses and parents. With that in mind, the Middle School parking lot (north of the middle school) will be closed Thursday for a slight remodel. Please, plan accordingly.
Our maintenance director, John, and I will be making some adjustments that will allow parents to drop students off in this location during the morning ""rush"" hour. It is our hope that this will reduce the volume of traffic we are currently experiencing. This will adjust the parking situation in the middle school parking lot going forward.

Hey Lady Midget fans!! Fall practice is upon us!! Over the last week and a half of practice, the girls have brought their personalities, traits, skills and characters together to begin the process of building the 2020 Lady Midgets. Each Lady Midget chose a trait that they were going to bring to the team every day.

Today, we fastened those words together in hopes that we will build, brick by brick, something great for you all this season. Hopefully, our team, using the stuff that holds us together, will not separate when we get knocked down...just like this wall. Bring on the season.

As always, our local businesses have made generous donations to our ""After Prom"" fund. We are so grateful to live in such a caring and generous community! We will be posting a list and Thank You to all of our donors in the paper soon!

Thanks to community support, SADD will be paying the majority of the cost of Prime Rib dinners for 130 people. We will also have a hypnotist and great prizes!

Unfortunately, due to Covid-19 we were unable to have our main fundraiser, ""Egg My House"". To help make up for that we will be selling our Midget All-Star cards at Market on the Square the next 2 weekends. If you haven't gotten yours yet, make sure and come see us there! (We will be doing new All-Stars next year, so you will want to make sure you can complete the set!)

By Mrs. Whitworth and Mrs. O'Reilly:

Crazy times call for crazy teachers to do crazy things! Since Mrs. O'Reilly and Mrs. Whitworth couldn't give their 5th graders a 5th-grade promotion ceremony at school, they brought the promotion to them. The kids were given their promotion certificates and a small gift. Some students received reading circle certificates, lifetime reading certificates, and citizenship/flag awards. As you can see by the pictures, the teachers traveled well into the night to see their students. Some awaited their surprises and some fell asleep and were visited the next day. Mrs. O and Mrs. Whitworth now have even more respect for those bus drivers traveling this LONG county far and wide to pick up kids. Thank you, Mr. Tipton, for helping to guide us in our visits.

🎈 HAPPY SCHOOL COMMUNICATORS DAY! 🎈

Making posts for social media is very difficult. While it is an awesome opportunity to post celebrations and make things visually creative, public forums seem to be a place where people often scrutinize and criticize. It is also difficult to word things appropriately for all crowds of people and to make sure you are writing with a lens of positivity and hopefulness (especially in difficult times like these!)

I am SO proud of our school’s output of information on social media and our website. I never get bored scrolling through all of the wonderful things that are posted from our school to the community.

There is NO ONE better for being a wonderful storyteller and advocate for the students and staff at PCR1 than Haley Watt!! 🙌♥️

The Order explicitly states that individuals currently residing within the state of Missouri shall avoid leaving their homes or places of residence unless necessary.

First and foremost, I want everyone to know that I love this state and the people of this state. The people of this great state clearly define who we are in Missouri, and as Governor, I have no greater responsibility than to protect the health, well-being, and safety of all Missourians.

This is not about any one individual person. This is about our families, friends, neighbors, and the entire state of Missouri.

For the sake of all Missourians, be smart, be responsible, and stay home, Missourians.

We were able to snap this picture before we had be home and wanted to give a huge THANK YOU to Arron Duvall with Duvall Roeder and Gardner Insurance if Unionville. We had another successful season at the varsity basketball home games. It was fun to see the crowd sign up friends and for the Community support our club. Often times the FBLA members would bounce from responsibility to another each night of the games. They would help with the band, advertising class, support their classmates cheering from the crowd, cheerleaders would help with banners and then finally carry everything back to the room for the next time. We really do have the best students at PCHS and the best community that supports them. I will admit I missing their personalities while at home. Thank you to all that helped us have another great season with DRG. #itsbetteratputnam #putnamproud #pcfbla

Good afternoon parents of Putnam County R-I students. I know this is an unbelievably difficult time for us all. The board of education and I are committed to keeping families informed regarding the decision making process as related to the COVID-19 virus.

At this time we are working hard to make the most well-informed decisions possible. We are following the most recent recommendations from the Center for Disease Control that schools remain in session.

We are in constant communication with our local health department including a meeting with them and other local officials this afternoon. This will be followed by a special meeting with our Board of Education this evening. We promise to communicate as the situation evolves.

We are committed to the safety of our students, staff, and community while continuing to monitor the situation and keeping you informed.

Good morning, Putnam County R-I Community!

We continue to evaluate and attempt to ensure we are providing an effective, efficient, and safe pick up and drop off opportunities for our buses and parents. With that in mind, the Middle School parking lot (north of the middle school) will be closed Thursday for a slight remodel. Please, plan accordingly.
Our maintenance director, John, and I will be making some adjustments that will allow parents to drop students off in this location during the morning ""rush"" hour. It is our hope that this will reduce the volume of traffic we are currently experiencing. This will adjust the parking situation in the middle school parking lot going forward.

Hey Lady Midget fans!! Fall practice is upon us!! Over the last week and a half of practice, the girls have brought their personalities, traits, skills and characters together to begin the process of building the 2020 Lady Midgets. Each Lady Midget chose a trait that they were going to bring to the team every day.

Today, we fastened those words together in hopes that we will build, brick by brick, something great for you all this season. Hopefully, our team, using the stuff that holds us together, will not separate when we get knocked down...just like this wall. Bring on the season.

Crazy times call for crazy teachers to do crazy things! Since Mrs. O'Reilly and Mrs. Whitworth couldn't give their 5th graders a 5th-grade promotion ceremony at school, they brought the promotion to them. The kids were given their promotion certificates and a small gift. Some students received reading circle certificates, lifetime reading certificates, and citizenship/flag awards. As you can see by the pictures, the teachers traveled well into the night to see their students. Some awaited their surprises and some fell asleep and were visited the next day. Mrs. O and Mrs. Whitworth now have even more respect for those bus drivers traveling this LONG county far and wide to pick up kids. Thank you, Mr. Tipton, for helping to guide us in our visits.

üéà HAPPY SCHOOL COMMUNICATORS DAY! üéà

Making posts for social media is very difficult. While it is an awesome opportunity to post celebrations and make things visually creative, public forums seem to be a place where people often scrutinize and criticize. It is also difficult to word things appropriately for all crowds of people and to make sure you are writing with a lens of positivity and hopefulness (especially in difficult times like these!)

I am SO proud of our school‚Äôs output of information on social media and our website. I never get bored scrolling through all of the wonderful things that are posted from our school to the community.

There is NO ONE better for being a wonderful storyteller and advocate for the students and staff at PCR1 than Haley Watt!! üôå‚ô•Ô∏è

Mason's words of thanks: ""Thanks for everything. I became the person I am today thanks to my mother Casey and father Joel and a special thanks to Cheri Cason and Gerald Medlin for all the help they have given me along the way. I also would like to say thanks to my teacher, Mr. Lindhoff, for always being a big help in class and being a hilarious teacher.""

The Order explicitly states that individuals currently residing within the state of Missouri shall avoid leaving their homes or places of residence unless necessary.

This is not about any one individual person. This is about our families, friends, neighbors, and the entire state of Missouri.

We were able to snap this picture before we had be home and wanted to give a huge THANK YOU to Arron Duvall with Duvall Roeder and Gardner Insurance if Unionville. We had another successful season at the varsity basketball home games. It was fun to see the crowd sign up friends and for the Community support our club. Often times the FBLA members would bounce from responsibility to another each night of the games. They would help with the band, advertising class, support their classmates cheering from the crowd, cheerleaders would help with banners and then finally carry everything back to the room for the next time. We really do have the best students at PCHS and the best community that supports them. I will admit I missing their personalities while at home. Thank you to all that helped us have another great season with DRG. #itsbetteratputnam #putnamproud #pcfbla

As the school year begins, there still may be questions about exactly what school might look like this year. We have created “What to Expect at School” flyers for both our Option 1: Brick and Mortar students and our Option 2: Digital Learning students. We encourage parents and students to refer to these documents as guidance as you prepare for the upcoming school year.

The Putnam County School District looks forward to a new, successful school year as we return to teaching and learning on August 24.

Since implementing our Graduation Initiative, putting in place systems of support, and by increasing awareness around timely graduation, we saw drastic improvements to our graduation rate beginning in 2016.

Mr. Benford has strength as an honest communicator who develops trust with all who work with him. He builds relationships with all stakeholders, especially parents. He is a mentor to students at risk and an advocate who helps students believe in themselves.

Get Plenty of Exercise!

Exercise helps us think better. When we move and groove, our problem-solving, memory, and attention improve. Physical activity is a natural way to reduce stress and prevent anxiety. Experts say that when we move and get our heart rate up, it has a positive impact on how we think.

This is an informative article which helps explain how social distancing, cancelled events and quarantines are a very valuable tool in a community's response to COVID-19.
These efforts ARE NOT about stopping the virus, THEY ARE about slowing its spread so that our medical infrastructure & medical community can better handle the demand. We have some AMAZING individuals who work in the medical field (physicians, nurses, therapist, technicians, etc.). They are looking at endless hours of work, away from their loved ones to support our community. WE CAN HELP THEM by taking some general precautions for a little while. Please SHARE the message, and do everything we can to support those working on the front lines.

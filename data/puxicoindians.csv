With the current outbreak in our Puxico community, Thursday night’s game will be for guests with family passes that have been issued to each player, for each team, and ONLY 50 general admission fans. Our goal is to provide an education and activities for our students in the safest environment possible. If you are feeling ill, stay at home. If a member of your household has a positive Covid test or you are under quarantine, stay home. We recommend fans to wear a face mask while entering and leaving, to sit with your family group, and to leave space between you and other groups of fans. Fans will be asked to sit in the designated HOME and VISITORS sections. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in this matter. We pray that the spread of this virus will decrease and allow us to have more fans in the stands in the near future.

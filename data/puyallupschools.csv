We know today is going to look a little different for each of us, and that's okay! We would love to see first day of school photos of our Owls.

Share in the comments below, or email your pictures to our newest email address: dessieevansphotos@gmail.com.*

And don't forget - you can come by the school tonight between 4-7 to take a back to school photo with our growth ruler!

Happy first day Owls!
We know today is going to look a little different for each of us, and that's okay! We would love to see first day of school photos of our Owls.

Share in the comments below, or email your pictures to our newest email address: dessieevansphotos@gmail.com.*

And don't forget - you can come by the school tonight between 4-7 to take a back to school photo with our growth ruler!

Today was a bittersweet day. It definitely did not feel like the last day of school, but we're used to things not feeling ""normal"" when it comes to anything related to school since March 13th!

A bright spot for today was the Stewart Stars Drive By. Our staff loved seeing those of you who could drive by and honk, wave, and cheer. Seeing your faces made our hearts feel whole again. We hoped you enjoyed it as much as we did!

Thank you for giving this principal so much to be thankful for. I LOVE our Stewart family and will forever be grateful for the love, kindness, and compassion you have shared with me.

Once a Star, always a Star. I will see you again in the fall and promise not to be a stranger. Stewart Stars Shine Bright! How often? EVERY DAY! Shine on and shine bright!",0.0,"Stewart Elementary

The entire NW staff would like to thank our families for a great school year. Your unending support for our students, staff, and school touch our hearts.

We’d also like to thank our PTA for organizing the “Drive In” last Wednesday. We tried to take pictures of everyone who came, so we’re sorry if we missed you!

Our staff were overwhelmed with the turn out. The Northwood community is absolutely amazing. We miss our students and families so much.

We hope to see you soon when the 2020-2021 school year begins!

Have a wonderful summer!

People who practice gratitude have an improved attitude, have improved physical and psychological health, feel more positive, are able to handle challenges more effectively, and are more likely to have lifelong happiness. When you face life’s challenges with gratitude, they become less overwhelming and more manageable, creating a sense of well-being.⠀

- Go outside for a Gratitude Scavenger Hunt, ⠀
- Write a list each day of things you are thankful for,⠀
- Call or send a note to someone you appreciate,⠀

Resilience is the ability to keep trying, even when things are hard. We are not born with resilience; it is something that we learn through each difficult event we encounter. It is a skill that we use throughout our lives at school, in our jobs, in our relationships. Sometimes we challenge ourselves by learning a new hobby like playing the piano or learning to longboard. Sometimes the challenges comes to us, like a school closure and stay-at-home order. Either way, we can use these challenges to learn how to overcome difficult events.

1. The worst thing I can imagine is going to happen.
2. I won’t be able to handle whatever it is that happens.
3. This situation and these feelings are going to continue forever.

Who was bringing up Four Hundred 26 friends

The youngest ones with grins

Who was busy with a fun staff of his own
They were loving and serving all together
Yet they were not alone

Till the one day when they all came together
And they knew it was much more than a hunch
That’s this group must somehow form a family

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, we will be there from 4-6PM to take any new or gently used books you have! The books will then quarantine in the barn before we sort and distribute them to ensure our communities safety.

The wagon in the Pioneer Room at Karshner Center has been a part of the museum since the early 1980’s. The wagon is half the size of a traditional wagon. It is one of the most popular sitting, playing and hands-on activity center in the museum. Preschoolers on field trips have their pictures taken in the wagon, kindergarteners pack the wagon for travel across America on the Oregon Trail during their field trip, “story time” happens in the wagon and lots of dres-up and role playing of pioneers, general store merchants, fur traders wagon guides, school teachers and students all happen in the Pioneer room.

What’s your favorite thing to do in the Pioneer room?
What’s your favorite memory of the Pioneer Room?

Stewart Stars!
Did you know that this week is Principal Appreciation Week? That means we get to celebrate and recognize our amazing principal, Mrs. Dornan. Mrs. Dornan is a brilliant star who finds joy and pride in serving the Stewart community in any way that she can. She is constantly working behind the scenes to make sure that Stewart is a safe and loving place for all who pass through. Here are some special moments that really show who Mrs. Dornan is and what brings her joy (except for that time she had to wear Husky colors).

Please share a special memory that you have with Mrs. Dornan OR let her know what you appreciate about her in the comments below. We love you Mrs. Dornan!",0.0,"Stewart Elementary is at Stewart Elementary.

This week we are learning how plants can be used as natural dyes. We will use nettle, wild rose, hibiscus, red cedar, alder and dandelion as plants of choice. I put together a little handout for the girls to get some scientific method time in.

If you wanted to share this with your homeschooler or even just for fun :) Check out the file.

It would be so much fun for everyone to post their findings!!
Stay tuned.....

It’s April Fools Day, it’s raining outside, and you are stuck in the house with nothing to do… it seems like a perfect day for the Dr. Seuss classic “The Cat in the Hat”.

The book is being read and expertly voiced by Sergeant Rich Scaniffe, who has served with our department for 19 years in patrol and is a member of our SWAT Team. He currently supervises our Mountain Detachment during our swing and graveyards shifts – so if you live anywhere between Eatonville, Roy, Graham, Kapowsin or McKenna all the way to Mount Rainier, he is helping to keep you safe at night.

Sergeant Scaniffe became a deputy because he wanted to make a difference in the community where he lives, and his favorite part of being a police officer is that you are always meeting new people and learning new things.

Thanks so much for joining us for another “Storytime with a Sheriff”. We hope this brings you a little fun and a lots of smiles to start your day!",2.0,"Pierce County Sheriff's Department

Welcome back for another “Storytime with a Sheriff” – who is ready to start the weekend with a walk on the wild side?

Today’s guest reader is probably the most well known police officer in Pierce County, it is our longtime spokesperson Detective Ed Troyer. Detective Troyer has been with our department since 1985 and started his career on patrol working in our west districts from Spanaway to Lakewood and the Key Peninsula. After stints in our narcotics unit and on a federal gang task force, he took the reigns in our media office.

What most people don’t know about Detective Troyer is that he spends almost all of his free time volunteering for children’s charities including Toys for Tots, Charlie’s Dinosaur, Special Olympics, and the Foster Parents Association.

Detective Troyer grew up as a wild child in Tacoma, so it was perfect fit that he chose to share with all of you “Where the Wild Things Are” written and illustrated by Maurice Sendak. Enjoy!",3.0,"Pierce County Sheriff's Department

“I had zero idea of what I was doing.. I honestly had no idea where to start. All I knew was I had something I craved to say.. I wanted to create art that lived on longer than I do. Perseverance and teaching yourself, every day through stress and hard work proves stuff really does progress without you realizing. One minute you're an amateur, knowing nothing, not even the basics. The next you can put pen to paper, write a song, and create art in such little time! It's crazy beautiful.”

Struggling students and their families have a hard time accessing and navigating the maze of public and private services. There may be ample resources in a community, but rarely is there someone on the ground who is able to connect these resources with the schools and students that need them most. Through a school-based coordinator, we bring these local resources into the school where they are accessible, coordinated and accountable. At Communities In Schools, we work with everyone to change the picture of education for the students we serve. We do this by: 1. Keeping kids in school. 2. Doing whatever it takes to eliminate barriers. 3. Never giving up, on anyone.
This is accomplished through this model of Site Coordination.

For starters, did you know that we are a part of a national organization? There are CIS affiliates in 25 states and the District of Columbia serving 2,300 schools. Our national office provides leadership and oversight from Washington DC. Each affiliate utilizes the same model of having a Site Coordinator in a school, but tailors it to meet the specific needs of where they are located!

Together with Aylen's feeder elementary schools (Fruitland, Karshner, Maplewood, and Waller Road), nearly 14,000 non-perishable food items were donated to a local food bank benefiting those in need in our local community. Thank you to all who supported this service-oriented tradition!",2019-11-27 12:30:35,,

Conservationist and artist Becci Crowe, working to help save threatened and endangered species, has an amazing story to tell. Traveling across six continents, including 16 trips to the African Continent and over 47 countries, Becci began networking with conservation experts from around the world and participating in fieldwork. Becci's desire to study her subjects in their natural world has led to adventurous travel to remote parts of the planet where she soon discovered the challenges faced by wildlife and people sharing their environment. Becci has been to Jane’s Chimpanzee Sanctuary in Africa to work alongside Jane Goodall and now serves on the Jane Goodall Institute Board of Directors.

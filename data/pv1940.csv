Before distance learning began, Sanders was in contact with a scientist at NASA. He is conducting hydroponic research to send the first fruiting plants to the space station with the ultimate goal of preparing them for interplanetary travel. He subsequently started an at home/school challenge to grow your own space peppers. The goal of the activity is to have the students grow their own peppers (the same ones they are testing in the NASA labs) using either hydroponics or geoponics. Once the peppers are mature, they will be sent to the University of New Mexico for capsaicin (the stuff that makes peppers hot) level testing. Unfortunately the peppers were not ready for the students to take home, when we left. But, Sanders has been caring for them in the meantime.

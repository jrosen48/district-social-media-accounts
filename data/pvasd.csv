This afternoon PIAA announced a two week pause in required activities for fall sports.

With that in mind we are also going to pause the required timeline for marching band and CANCEL rehearsals for August 10-14, 2020.

At this time I am hoping to resume optional rehearsals on August 17-21 from 3:30-5:30. I will send confirmation for those rehearsals next week.

I will have music and part assignments emailed by Monday Morning. It will include percussion assignments.

If you need an instrument or other equipment from the school, notify me immediately and I will make sure it is put in the main office on Monday afternoon when I am at the high school. (If your instrument is in a locker please let me know which one it is)

Please look at the music and work through it to the best of your ability prior to our rehearsals. This new timeline will be challenging but doable!

Dear Penns Valley Families,

We hope that this finds you all safe and healthy. We realize that this time can be difficult and unsettling for our students and want to offer the opportunity for students to connect with school counselors as the new school year approaches.

We are making school counseling services available for Penns Valley students by Zoom meetings over the summer. This time is offered as a service to support students' well-being and to build resilience and skills to deal with the uncertainty that we are all living through right now. We are offering this resource to interested students and families each Wednesday from 12:30 - 1:00 beginning July 1 and continuing through August 19.

If you are interested in having your child participate, please click the link below any Wednesday between 12:30 and 1:00.

Thank you to the coaches who took time to create videos. All coaches had the opportunity to record videos and submit highlights, which makes this a rather lengthy video... like an hour and forty minutes long! The video follows the seasons, so the fall sports are first in line, followed by the winter sports, and the spring sports.

This video is dedicated to our senior athletes and especially to our senior spring athletes who were robbed of their final spring season. And yes, our swimmers who were about to get in the pool at Bucknell for warmups when they were unceremoniously told to go home due to the coronavirus shut down by the PIAA.

So how does Mrs. Burrows deliver her art lessons during the school closure? Take a look!

I've been creating iMovies for each grade level (K-6, so about 5-7 movies a week) and uploading them to YouTube. From there, I have to post in 14 different Seesaw accounts and my Google Classrooms. When students in K-2 finish, I review them in Seesaw. When 3-6 finishes, they upload to Artsonia. You can publically see some of our students' artwork via the link below along with my YouTube Channel!

We are in the process of developing plans to move from review and enrichment to planned instruction. Planned instruction is formal teaching and learning similar to that which occurs in a classroom setting. Within this process, teachers use planned courses of instruction of new concepts/skills aligned to grade-level standards. This option can vary in forms to include online/digital and non-digital learning opportunities. We will be working in collaboration with our teachers to establish the plan. Please expect to see additional information early next week.

Penns Valley Area School District’s Music Education Program Receives National Recognition

Penns Valley Area School District has been honored with the Best Communities for Music Education designation from The NAMM Foundation for its outstanding commitment to music education.

This award recognizes that Penns Valley Area School Disrict is leading the way with learning opportunities as outlined in the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). The legislation guides implementation in the states and replaces the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) which was often criticized for an overemphasis on testing-while leaving behind subjects such as music. ESSA recommends music and the arts as important elements of a well-rounded education for all children.

Darris DeRemer, Penns Valley Band Director states, “Music in our schools is an essential part of creating well-rounded students who will become well-rounded adults. We aren’t just teaching music skills, we are teaching life skills.”

A big welcome to our newest 5th grade teacher at Penns Valley Intermediate School, Regina! She is a 2019 graduate of Lock Haven University, and is in her first year of teaching! Regina chose this profession because she is passionate about making connections with and advocating for students.

Regina joins the 5th grade team at PVI as a math teacher this year, and is using a rotational style of delivering her math lessons. She has really enjoyed her time at Penns Valley working with her team and 5th grade students.

Miss Beers loves to spend time outside, and particularly enjoys kayaking and gardening. Her motto is “Choose happiness every day”. When asked if she wanted to share anything extra, Regina said “I am so excited to be starting my career and living in the Penns Valley community. Even though I have been here for less than a year, it already feels like home!”

We would like to welcome one of our new PVHS English teachers, Joanna! She has been teaching for five years, and joins the PVASD team this year teaching English 10. Coming from Martinsburg, PA, Joanna decided to become a teacher because she wanted to share her love of English. She also enjoys building relationships with students, with the goal of positively influencing their lives and helping them work to reach their full potential. Joanna hopes to play a small part in helping students to become contributing members of society.

When asked what her favorite English topic was to teach, she chose the novel The Outsiders by S.E.Hinton. Her favorite thing about Penns Valley so far is getting to know her coworkers and students.

Outside of school, Joanna enjoys traveling to national parks, hiking, kayaking, reading, baking and trying new restaurants. Her favorite quote comes from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.- “The time is always right to do what is right.”

Students identified a problem and then were asked to research, build, and test a solution to the problem based on criteria and constraints given.

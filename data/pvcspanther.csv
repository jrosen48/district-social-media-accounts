Whether she is embedded in a classroom or working with small groups of students, Mrs. Martin spends a lot of time sharing her passion for reading and helping students find ways to enjoy it more.

“I hope that my students genuinely understand that I am here for them and that I want to see them grow,” says Martin. “I hope they learn some new strategies and see that their love of reading evolves during their time with me.” 🐾

Recently, she received a note from a student thanking her for being there for her and letting her eat lunch with her.

“I’m not her teacher and I don’t have her in my small groups, so the fact that she’s comfortable with me, chooses to eat lunch with me, and talk to me about things is really special,” says Martin. 💜

Dep. Hanner is a Pine Valley alumna and has been with the Chautauqua County Sheriff’s Office for 5 years. 👮‍♀️

“I want parents to feel comfortable and safe sending their kids to school,” says Hanner. “No one should have to worry about their kids during the day. I want to give parents that peace of mind that I am here every single day that class is in session.”

Although safety is his top priority, Dep. Hanner also helps out in the classroom by teaching students age-appropriate things about safety, law enforcement, and potential career paths.

“I want the kids to feel comfortable if the see a law enforcement officer and know that we can be just like anyone else,” says Hanner. “They look up to us and it makes me feel really good to be there for them and see them start to open up.” 🐾

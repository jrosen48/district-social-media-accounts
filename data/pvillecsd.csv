As soon as we listen to Governor Reynold's press conference we will coordinate with officials with the City of Pleasantville and then immediately send out information to all patrons via email, text, and on our social media with an update on Sunday's plan. Our hope is to hold an event for the seniors on Sunday if it is possible. We have also shared a contingency graduation ceremony date of June 28th at 2:00 pm if we are unable to hold any events for the seniors on Sunday. Fingers crossed!",2020-05-15 10:58:44,,

I am heartbroken to share that Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds has announced that Iowa Schools will now be shut down for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year. Like many of you, I am heartbroken we won't have the chance to get back together with our students and school staff this year.

This is just a preliminary announcement. Look for more updates and information regarding our plans for the rest of this school year by early next week.

Sadly, we also anticipate an announcement will be made today from the various Iowa activity and athletic governing agencies that will officially cancel all Iowa spring sports and activities this year. We also expect a decision will come at a later date regarding summer activities and athletics.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2952994074759271&id=228783227180383,,0.0,"Dear Pleasantville Students and Families.

I am heartbroken to share that Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds has announced that Iowa Schools will now be shut down for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year. Like many of you, I am heartbroken we won't have the chance to get back together with our students and school staff this year.

This is just a preliminary announcement. Look for more updates and information regarding our plans for the rest of this school year by early next week.

Sadly, we also anticipate an announcement will be made today from the various Iowa activity and athletic governing agencies that will officially cancel all Iowa spring sports and activities this year.

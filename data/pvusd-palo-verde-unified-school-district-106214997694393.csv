The Palo Verde Unified School District is seeking volunteers to assist us as we work to sustain our child nutrition and student learning programs. In an effort to develop a volunteer team, the District created a short application/survey to help recruit the support needed to maintain these important programs. The following link will take you to the District's volunteer application/survey. Please take a moment to complete the survey if you are interested in volunteering for the District during this time. The most common activities may include support with packaging and delivering student meals and/or assisting the District with the distribution of instructional materials.

PVUSD appreciates the support of our community.

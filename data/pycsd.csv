Today’s Senior Bow is for the one and only Cami Webber!

Cami has shown tremendous growth as an actor over the last four years, which can be chalked up to her hard work and dedication to her craft. She is someone who decides that she wants to do something or improve in some way, and has no problem putting in the time and effort to make sure it happens. She blew us away this year as Alice Murphy in Bright Star, a very difficult role for so many reasons - Cami worked like a pro, though, and put on an amazing performance. We will miss you next year, Cami!",0.0,"Penn Yan Academy Drama Club

PYA Drama had the honor and the opportunity today to do a “show swap” with Mynderse Academy’s Drama Club! So many local groups perform in the same window as our show that we are unable to ever see one another, making it hard to support one another. This morning, Mynderse made the trek to PY, saw a dress run of Bright Star, and had some lunch with the cast and crew. Then, tonight we headed to Seneca Falls to see a run of their production of Seussical and have some dinner. It was an amazing opportunity, and we want to thank Mynderse for their support, their cheers, and their love! #theatrefamily",0.0,"Penn Yan Academy Drama Club

Today, we need to give a shout-out to all the work that goes on behind the scenes to make our productions a success. Not everyone realizes just how much time and energy goes into the “back end” of our shows. We have already had two set-building days and have spent hours gathering props, furniture, and costumes. Today, we spent 6 hours at our first tech work day, where we had crews working on costumes, light design plots, painting the set, setting up all the sound equipment, and numerous other tasks. That still leaves our “dry” and “wet” tech days (often all-day affairs) and tons of work that happens in patches outside of assigned work time. Fortunately, we have tons of students and adults who are so hard-working and so willing to give their time and effort to make our shows wonderful! Great job, everyone - and THANK YOU!",0.0,"Penn Yan Academy Drama Club

Tonight was the first stumble-through of act I for Bright Star! To those unfamiliar with the term, the stumble-through is the first time actors run through an act in its entirety, putting together all the pieces they have been working on (blocking, choreo, acting, vocals, etc.). It is often very difficult and VERY rough as it is a lot of moving parts coming together at once, but it is useful for identifying needs moving forward. Add to that the fact that it is the first time actors cannot use their scripts at all (“off-book”), and it can sometimes be a recipe for disaster. Tonight’s stumble-through, though, could not have gone smoother - it was abundantly clear how much time and work everyone has been putting in and how professional they all are. We are so proud of them!

This recording illustrates the teaching and learning that took place despite the closing of school buildings. This performance includes band and orchestra musicians from our elementary and middle school levels. The recording process required multiple retakes to get the notes and timing just right.

Zeswitz Music sponsored all of the costs associated with this video production through SkynineCorp so that every QCSD instrumental music student had an opportunity to participate if they wanted to. In addition to Mr. Silvius, teachers Michael Boyd, Lara Cifelli, Megan Edinger, Mike Murmylo, and Rachael Urquhart were a big part of this team effort.

“It's collaborative efforts like this from our music department team, administration, families, students, and community that help keep the passion and excitement of music performance strong at QCSD,” Mr. Silvius said.

Dear Trumbauersville Families,

I want to let you know that QCSD has made an adjustment to the end of the school year for 2019-2020. The last day for instruction will be Thursday, June 11. There will be no new instruction after that day. Between now and then, we look forward to continuing to connect with students, support their learning, and bring closure to the school year. I continue to be very proud of the work of our students and our school community as we have worked through this spring.

Also, tomorrow, June 3rd, we will have a virtual field day! All elementary schools in QCSD will be participating. We will send a youtube link tomorrow morning with the game directions. The activities are designed so that everyone can participate when it is appropriate for your family. The weather looks better for the morning time. Hopefully, everyone can get up, get active, and enjoy field day!

I want to let you know that QCSD has made an adjustment to the end of the school year for 2019-2020. The last day for instruction will be Thursday, June 11. There will be no new instruction after that day. Between now and then, we look forward to continuing to connect with students, support their learning, and bring closure to the school year. I continue to be very proud of the work of our students and our school community as we have worked through this spring.

Operation Safe Stop is a public awareness and enforcement effort to educate the motoring public that passing a stopped school bus, when children are loading or unloading, is both dangerous and illegal.

Police will be monitoring “hot spots,” areas where motorists are known to disobey Pennsylvania's School Bus Stopping Law, which requires drivers to stop at least 10 feet away from school buses that have their red lights flashing and stop arm extended.

That’s considered the Danger Zone -- the area on all sides of the bus where students are in the most danger of not being seen by the driver (10 feet in front of the bus where the driver may be too high to see a student, 10 feet on either side of the bus where a student may be in the driver’s blind spot, and the area behind the school bus).

QV COVID-19 Update",8.0,"The Quaker Valley School District will remain closed until March 30, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At this time, the District has not been given direction from the Governor's Office or the Pennsylvania Department of Education regarding an extended closure. However, given the most recent restrictions regarding social distancing and the closing of non-essential businesses, the District is preparing for a lengthier period of closure. The District is currently planning to, if necessary, begin remote learning on March 31, 2020. More information and details will follow in the coming days.

Quaker Valley's Instruction and Learning Department has gathered resources for students and families to use while school is not in session. These are voluntary activities for students.

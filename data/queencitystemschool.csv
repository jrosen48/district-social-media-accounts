Triangle Senior Makes 3D-Printed Face Shields for Healthcare Workers

TMSA High School Student Aditya Shankar provides free face shields to as many healthcare and essential workers as he can in the RTP area.

He has already provided more than 150 face shields free of charge to those who risk their lives on the frontline to keep us safe against the pandemic.

When the lack of adequate PPE for frontline healthcare workers arose as a crisis, Aditya wanted to be a part of the solution and started to use his resources and skills for good.

Aditya has managed to produce face shields at a cost of $1.65. He needs your help to do more.

Hello QCSS Parents,

I am so excited to announce a (new partnership) (continued partnership) with 1st Day School Supplies! We have collaborated with 1st Day School Supplies to help parents and teachers get the exact supplies needed for next school year without the hassle and aggravation of shopping at WalMart, Target or Staples. I have personally found 1st Day School Supplies to be convenient, easy and hassle free! Plus, the prices are competitive! So, this summer as the temperature hits over 100 degrees and lines at the checkout counter are a mile long... I will have already purchased my school supplies from the comfort of my home! You can make your purchase right now, get started by clicking the link below:",0.0,"Queen City STEM PTO

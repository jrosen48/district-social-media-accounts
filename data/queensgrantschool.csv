If you are like me you have already spent too much money this season so I thought I would share some FREE ideas to bond with family and build lasting memories.

1.Make a gingerbread house - the kids will love eating it and if you make it from scratch, your house will smell amazing!

2. Take a walk or drive to tour the holiday lights nearby.

3. DIY birdfeeder. Let the kiddos find a pine cone. Lather it in peanut butter and roll it in birdseed. Hang it outside the window and sit back and watch!

4. Go caroling at a local nursing home. This will bless the elderly and the kids as well as they experience giving to others.

5. Make popcorn and candy garland and decorate the tree!

6. Night under the stars (or the lights on the Christmas tree!) Have a family slumber party and drag out the sleeping bags.

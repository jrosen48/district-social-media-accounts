This week we created a sensory path on our sidewalk. We included some basic letter and number recognition as well as some physical activity tasks. It's important to keep the mind and body healthy!
You could definitely add sight words and/or math facts like we've done in the past to make it a little more challenging for the older scholars.
We have enjoyed watching people of all ages enjoy this path as they walk by daily.

This can really be use to practice ANY skill. You just write the questions on a sheet of paper inside the egg and VOILA! You have a fun learning activity for any age.
I even used this activity with a group of middle schoolers, many years ago, and they found Algebra problems they had to solve.
Enjoy!

After a very difficult and challenging day yesterday, we have some great news! The New River Valley Department of Health was able to expedite their investigation and contact tracing in regard to the close social gathering in our community this past weekend, and found minimal exposure to COVID-19, allowing RCPS to return to face to face learning as early as Monday, August 31st (Rockin Rs). We are grateful for the partnership with the health department and appreciate their continued and consistent support to our school division. We are also appreciative to our entire school community for their patience and flexibility during these transitions. We will continue with our full virtual Radford platform for the rest of this week, but transition back to the hybrid schedule again on 8/31. In addition, all schools and buses will be deeply cleaned and sanitized for the restart of the face to face learning on Monday.

Enjoy your afternoon!

Good morning,

You are all probably tired of hearing from me! Sorry to flood your inboxes, but after speaking with Jason (our epidemiologist), we both felt it important to let you know we are tracking multiple norovirus outbreaks throughout the district in multiple settings, enough to elevate to epidemic levels.

You have all probably had students out with the classic GI symptoms of nausea/vomiting/diarrhea. It might be a good time to remind staff and parents that ill individuals need to stay home, practicing good hand hygiene is the best measure to prevent the spread of infection, and maybe asking custodial staff to be a little more attentive to disinfectant practices (will also be helpful as flu numbers continue to rise).

Please let us know if we can be of any assistance.

Best regards,

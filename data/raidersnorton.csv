Sheriff E. Grant Kilgore and the Wise County Sheriff’s Office want parents to be aware of the apps that their children have on their phones. “Fifteen Apps Parents Should Know About” recently published a poster that describes how predators target children with intentions to harm or expose them to content not intended for children. We encourage you to know your child’s passwords and monitor their activity on a regular basis. You can also add a tracker app to your child’s phone to keep up with them. We are concerned that children are spending more time on-line for school and other activities and these apps are easily overlooked. If your child has these apps we suggest you delete them to prevent a predator’s access to your family and possibly compromising their security.
We have included a link to a recent news article that has some helpful suggestions for parents to watch.

Hello, during this time I think we shouldn't be looking at the things like death polls and what has been getting worse, we should be looking at more positive things, like how many people have recovered. That's how I've kept going during this time. I get my work done by getting up early, have a good breakfast, and focusing a couple of hours of my day dedicated to getting my work done. Some tips I have for scholars is to give yourself a good motivation, like maybe if you finish a lesson you'll let yourself have a treat at the end, another tip I have is to make sure you get notes down that can help you in quizzes on APEX, and also not procrastinating, put your distracting devices away and focus on your work. Thank you.

Students have multiple opportunities to work with their fellow classmates and build skills around working in a group. While this may seem like a given skill it takes focus and the desire to have productive group time to work in a small group and have deep intellectual conversation.

Teachers work with students throughout the year in building skills around asking probing questions, cultivating the ability to listen to each other, modeling the task at hand and of course creating content that is fun and exciting. Building these skills in each student prepares them for college and the real world.

Parents are encouraged to assist in building this skill at home by creating projects with siblings with clear outcomes and asking follow up questions to their student.

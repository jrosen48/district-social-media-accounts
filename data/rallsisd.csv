Ralls ISD stands with our students, families and community members who have experienced any kind of systemic racism, systemic oppression, or any other kind of discrimination. We are experiencing troubling times in our world and we want to help spread love. We can help shine light on the good in all people and we also want to be the light for those around us by the way we treat one another, and stand for those who are not treated how they should be. Take the time today to talk to your children and have open and honest conversations about seeing someone’s value based on what they’re about on the inside as opposed to judging them based on what they see on the outside. We want to help fight the hate with the love that we are capable of spreading. We love our community and we are here for each and every one of you. #BlackOutTuesday #BeTheLight #JackrabbitStrong #FearTheEars

The 3 biggest announcements for this upcoming graduation ceremony will be:
1. We are now allowed to have an in-person graduation ceremony outside!
2. Graduates will ONLY be allowed to bring 5 guests. Each graduate and their guests will have seats on the football field. We will proceed with a formal graduation ceremony similar to what we have done in the past with a couple of tweaks.

Call a Coach:

Today I called former Ralls football/baseball coach Billy Villarreal. We had a great 18 minute conversation.

Coach V was there with the Jackrabbits 1998-2009.

He told me his highlight in Ralls was the 07-08 football seasons when they got back in playoffs and getting a playoff win.

In June of 2012, Billy V became the Slaton baseball coach.

He got out of coaching in 2014 and now he works for New York Life, helping folks with life insurance and retirement.

He works with a lot of current coaches.

We have kept a strong friendship over the years.

The photo is from a long time ago when we did an I Beat Pete out at Ralls. I told coach he looks like he’s 16 like current principal Miguel Salazar.

Every day I decided I will call a coach and talk to him or her about their family and then their team and what’s going on in the world so I could encourage an encourager.

This isn’t Text a Coach, but Call a Coach.

The art of conversation is being lost. I encourage you to call someone today and touch base and check on them and lift their spirits.",0.0,"Pete Christy features former Ralls AD Billy Villarreal, or Coach V as he is known around here!

We wanted to let everyone know what to do about the Coke selling fundraiser. In the interest of our student safety, we do not believe that distributing drinks in our current health situation as a wise idea. We would like students to either practice social distancing and return any money for drink orders or take any money to the high school for the staff to return. While we know this is not the simplest or easiest option for the fundraiser, we are wanting to make a decision that is best for the health and safety of our students. If we are able to come back to school this semester with enough time to successfully complete the fundraiser, we will attempt this again. We appreciate your willingness to take part in the fundraiser and please feel free to email Mr. Herron (mherron@rallsisd.org) if you have any questions.

Also, sophomore students were able to take the PreACT, while juniors were able to take the PSAT and the ASVAB.

Senior students gathered at the football stadium to take their annual all-class photo, then participated in the Apply 2 College campaign through Education Quest by filling out college and scholarship applications. They also attended a ""Full Potential"" motivational presentation by former Husker Demoine Adams.

Local business leaders, representing a variety of career paths, talked to freshman students about their industry and the jobs available. Students were also able to take part in fun activities during each presentation.

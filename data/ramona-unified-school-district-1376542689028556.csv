Here will be our route for this coming Thursdays cruise. This cruise will be dedicated to all our graduating classes. Gina Helms has put a plan together to show our support and maintain our social distances if you would like to participate please PM her, she will also be posting her plan today. We will meet at Kmart parking lot around 5:45 and depart at 6:00pm. Please be extra careful as we will have a lot of kids along the route and one other thing try to maintain the pace, Jerry will be leading the way in his 49 Plymouth woodie. Looking forward to celebrating and having fun with our graduates. If you have any questions just let me know. Thanks",2020-05-19 18:46:39,,

This morning RHS Freshmen, Emily Grothe and Jennifer Parker competed virtually in the Southern Region FFA Creed Recitation Competition. They recited the creed to a panel of judges on Zoom and then answered three impromptu questions, just as they would have if the competition was in person.

Both girls did an amazing job representing Ramona FFA and the San Diego Section FFA. Emily made it to the finals. After her second round, it was announced that she placed second in the Region and will now move on to California State FFA Finals that will be held on Friday, June 5th!

We hope everyone is well and had a beautiful weekend! As we continue through the weeks that should have been filled with our State FFA Convention and State FFA Judging FInals, we're still receiving word of our award recipients. On Friday evening, we received final results from the CA FFA Scholarship applications.

We are pleased to announce that RHS Senior, Zachary Padilla, was one of only 37 CA High School Seniors (and one of only two individuals from San Diego County) to receive a California FFA Scholarship.

Zach has been extremely active in FFA throughout his 4 years at RHS and even served as this year's 2019-20 San Diego Section FFA Reporter. This, added to his many other accolades, are what made Zach stand out as one of the four individuals chosen to receive a $2,000 scholarship from Zenith Insurance. These funds will be put towards his Undergraduate Studies in Animal Science at Fresno State University this Fall.

""Dear RUSD Families,

In light of the Stay-at-Home order announced this evening by Governor Newsom, the Ramona Unified District Office will be closed starting tomorrow, Friday, March 20th. No student learning packets will be distributed tomorrow, but the materials are still available online. For families taking advantage of the school meal program, we will still be distributing lunches tomorrow from 11:00 am to 12:30 PM at the cafeteria at Ramona Elementary School.

Please continue to check your email for messages from RUSD with updates on the district.

Thank you, and please do all you can to ensure your safety and the safety of your family.

Theresa Grace

Our Dance & Jazz Band Collaboration last night went well for our first attempt at ""Ramona Time Hop"" Swing Night. Thank you Ms. Maehler for coming out & dancing with us. It was fun to see young families & some of our community join us in their 50's attire to learn Swing dancing from our Dance Productions dancers, all to live music played by our RHS Band.",0.0,"Ramona High School Bulldogs

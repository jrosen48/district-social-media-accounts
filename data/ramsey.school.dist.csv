Hello All RHS Students, Parents, and Guardians,
The COVID-19 virus has drastically changed our lives over the last couple weeks. This has also affected our school year as well. Because of this change, the RHS Yearbook Staff is in need of your help. We would love to document some of your home memories during this time. We would like to be able to picture as many students as possible going about their daily lives: watching TV, playing a game with the family, hanging out with siblings and parents, cooking, baking, going for a walk, etc. Although this is not the school we dreamed of, we still want our students to have the best yearbook possible! You are welcome to email them to kwilhelm@ramseycusd.org or have your students send them to her using Remind. Also, we would love some funny sibling pictures for any siblings that are both in high school for our sibling page. Thanks in advance for your help!

Ethan was moved by the enormity of change in our world and in the progression of his senior year. He said he wanted to share something positive with his fellow seniors and with others. Ethan shared his lyrics with classmate and fellow senior, Avery Harper, who took a couple of days to write music to accompany the lyrics from Ethan. Ethan and Avery worked out their song as Avery sang. They brought in another senior, Arielle Winn, to harmonize with Avery. These students are not professional musicians. They are just kids who wanted to help others. Together, they created a very moving song dedicated to the Class of 2020.

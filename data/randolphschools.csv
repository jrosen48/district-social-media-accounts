The Randolph High School Girls Lacrosse team, coaches and booster club decided to forgo their annual fundraising efforts to help bring joy to healthcare workers fighting COVID-19. They proudly donated their entire stockpile of 3,360 chocolate bars which the team had previously purchased to raise money for their program. The chocolate bars were delivered to three area hospitals: Morristown, Saint Barnabas and Chilton Medical Centers. The team and coaches worked with hospital administration to coordinate distribution amongst the frontline healthcare workers.

In a joint statement from the team: ""We appreciate our healthcare workers for the risks and sacrifices they have made to take care of our community. We donated the chocolate bars as a gesture of our gratitude for their acts of selflessness and heroic work. Our hope is that this small act of kindness brings a moment of sweetness to their unimaginable days.""

Thank you Randolph Girls LAX for making this generous donation!

The students made a video to help spread some positivity during the closure. Student athletes Emily Spingarn, Katelynn Oh, Amanda Flynn, and Alexis Shaunessy were all very excited to put together this video with their teammates. “We waited an entire year to play again and now that we are stuck inside we found another way to have a catch. We felt like this was a good way to keep everyone motivated and working so that we are ready for the season whenever that is. No matter if you are a freshman or a senior, we wanted to stir excitement and anticipation for this season. This video was a fun way to build team chemistry all throughout the program. We know that no matter what obstacles occur, there is always time to practice and study the game.”

Great job Rams!

Ironia Elementary art teacher Heather Turner knows what it's like to be a student in one of her classes. She was once a student at Ironia herself. Ms. Turner went from an intelligent, ambitious, and creative young Randolph student to become an equally impactful Randolph educator. She is passing on the legacy of her former teachers and has continued many of the traditions that she experienced in her own classroom.

One of the traditions passed down to her was the Puppet Palooza Showcase. Students spend countless hours working on puppets starting in the 4th grade and then finish their puppets in the 5th grade. The puppets are built from each student’s imagination, guided by the elements of art and principles of design they have learned over the years. The show showcases how students continue to grow from 4th grade into 5th grade.

We are grateful to Ms. Turner for continuing this amazing tradition at Ironia. The puppets are extremely creative and it's amazing to see the transformation over time.

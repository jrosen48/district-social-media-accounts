The RPS leadership team is in the midst of planning a safe, organized and thoughtful re-opening of our schools this September 2020. In order to do so and accurately plan for staff and students we have created a survey and are asking you to commit to a learning model for your child(ren). If you do not respond to this survey, the district will automatically place your child in the HYBRID Learning Model. All Randolph Public School Families will have the ability to change their children's learning model in January 2021.

Please complete this survey by Friday, July 31st.

Families have recently begun receiving P-EBT cards in the mail. However, we have heard that there has been some confusion around activating the card. Please share the below information with families in your school or district to help them correctly set up their P-EBT cards.

To Activate Your P-EBT Card

Call the phone number on the back of the card: Massachusetts’ EBT Hotline, (800) 997-2555.
Create a PIN: Enter your P-EBT card number. It will then prompt you to enter the last 4 digits of your social security number - do not enter the last 4 digits of your social security number.

This is a scam call and residents should NEVER give any personal information (Social Security Number, bank account information, Etc...) to anyone over the phone unless you can verify the the call is legitimate. The Town of Randolph will never call asking for this information.

In addition, residents have reported the number the calls are coming from is the number to Randolph High School.

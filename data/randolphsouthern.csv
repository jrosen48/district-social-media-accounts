A big thank you to all the community volunteers, staff members, and schools who made this year’s Randolph Southern Invitational a success. Even with all the challenges presented by the global COVID-19 pandemic we managed to put on an event that lived up to the high standards set by previous editions of the invitational. Hopefully next year we can get back to running it the way we have in the past. Once again, #thankyou",0.0,"Randolph Southern Athletics is at Randolph Southern Junior-Senior High School.

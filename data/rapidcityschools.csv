On June 22, the Board of Education will be reviewing the RCAS Resocialization of Activities Plan for summer activities. The recommendation at this meeting will be to start Phase 1 of the plan on June 23. This plan is pending board approval along with local COVID-19 trend data. Once the plan has been approved, we will release the plan for families to review in order to guide your decisions as to what extent you wish for your children to participate.

Activities Directors will be meeting with coaches and advisors to put together tentative schedules based on safety measures and guidelines of the plan. Once these are finalized coaches and advisors will communicate directly with families regarding their school’s schedule.

Thank you for being understanding and patient as we navigate through this global pandemic. Our number one priority is keeping our students and staff safe, while seeking to provide opportunities to gradually re-engage in activities.

We want to give a BIG shout out to not only our nutrition services staff, but also transportation and custodial staff that have helped us feed kids during this difficult time. It has not been easy and we're ""building the plane as we fly it"" as some might say!

We are currently providing meal packets to 635 children each day which seems to be the sweet spot as we aren't running out of food, we have minimal leftovers, and we are able to maintain social distancing in the kitchens and while distributing. That's a total of 5,715 meals a week.

We have developed a ""no-contact"" system at our distribution sites where people pull up in their cars, open their trunks, we put the food in the trunk and step away, and they close their trunks and leave. Thank you for your cooperation in this process.

You have likely already heard that Governor Noem wants schools to remain closed the rest of the school year. While I am not surprised by this news, I am certainly saddened by it. Along with the closure of schools, the South Dakota High School Activities Association has likewise cancelled all athletics and activities the rest of the school year.

We will continue with our distance learning the remainder of the school year. As such, we will also continue to monitor and adjust these plans as needed. The last day of school is May 28th. We will share more about how to get personal items from the building in the future.

I am already in communication with the Civic Center to find an alternative date for graduation later in the summer. I hope to share more soon.

For all of the latest updates and information related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our schools, please check out the District’s COVID-19 Information Hub at rcas.org.

I wish you and your families a peaceful spring break.

We have made the difficult decision to cancel the Youth In Art receptions on March 18th and 19th.

This decision does not come easy as we know the children and parents really look forward to coming to the reception but out of respect for our community and the request of our state government that gatherings larger than 100 people be postponed or cancelled, we are canceling the receptions.

We will be honoring the students with social media posts here and on our website and we encourage students and their parents to stop in on their free time to view all the artwork from the local students.",2020-03-13 12:30:04,,

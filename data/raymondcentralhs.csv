‚Ä¢ 2020 UCA HOME CAMP ‚Ä¢

Give a hand for all these athletes hard work & dedication to RCHS Cheer! Not only were they awarded as a team for ‚ÄúSuperior Stunting Performance‚Äù but they learned over 15 different stunts in 2 days!

Also another incredible opportunity was presented to the athletes that they could tryout for the UCA All American Team. They had 12 hours to learn a sideline dance, cheer, & jumps that then would be performed the next day at tryouts!

The All-American Team represents elite cheerleaders who represent USA cheerleaders worldwide. They also get the chance to cheer in London during the New Years Parade with cheerleaders all around the country!
Congratulations: Zoie Stachura, Ellianna LaMay, Grace Mueller, Ellie Hula, Megan Lange & Mallory Hughes for receiving 2020 UCA All American!

Many other awards were given throughout the camp that highlighted athletes performance & characteristics!

Awesome Job RCHS CHEER ATHLETES for giving 110% and we look forward to showing the community what we have been dedicating all our hard work and time on!

It‚Äôs pretty special when multiple communities can unify for good cause. On the mat, competition happened. Off the mat, love and compassion was shown. This truly is what it‚Äôs all about!

What‚Äôs even just as special, is when a community continually shows support for one of their own.

Syd the Kid is sweet, loved, and she‚Äôs a fighter. She has brought together so many people. On Friday, their will be a bake sale where all proceeds will be going to the Kenning Family. If you want to donate items to the bake sale the link is below.

#SydTheKid Your Fight is Our Fight

Raymond Central Community and Wrestling Team Holiday Bake Sale for Syd The Kid",2.0,"Yesterday at the Columbus Lakeview Varsity wrestling tournament, $1,000 was raised for #SydtheKid.

It‚Äôs pretty special when multiple communities can unify for good cause. On the mat, competition happened. Off the mat, love and compassion was shown. This truly is what it‚Äôs all about!

What‚Äôs even just as special, is when a community continually shows support for one of their own.

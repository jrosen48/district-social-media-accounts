Congrats to our yearbook editor-in-chief Kenzi Jones who was named as one of the 11 journalists in Missouri on the All-State Journalism Team! RPHS has only ever had one student on this list before!

The purpose of the All-State Journalism Team is to recognize those students who have proven themselves to be indispensable to their respective school media. Missouri has numerous journalism contests that recognize “bylined” excellence. The All-State Team recognizes those students who are “most valuable players” – those students whose leadership, energy, dedication and expertise make their publications possible but whose main contributions often occur behind the scenes",2.0,"Congratulations to Kenzi Jones!

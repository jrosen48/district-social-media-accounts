Parents and Players,

On Monday, March 9th at 7:00pm any player or parent interested in playing football next year must attend the informational meeting for the upcoming season. Details will include schedule, high school and middle school training information, as well as introduction of staff and mission for the year. There will be a sign up for middle school and high school players during school leading up to the meeting on the 9th. I want to remind all players that if you are not currently playing a winter sport or trying out for a spring sport that they are expected to be in weights Monday to Thursday immediately after school until 4:30p.m. Looking forward to getting started and see everyone there.

We competed at the districts tournament today at Beaver Vu. The boys bowled well all day long. Ian Carpenter had a 615 series. CaseyKuhl had a 598 series. Every boy bowler bowled at least a 200+ game. They tied the school record for high baker game. In the end the boys finished in 5th place overall. Missing going to state as a team by 2 pins. Great season boys.

Girls had a great time and bowled well. Caitlyn Prince has the high series of 516 and (way to go) Makayla Lawson had a 506 series.

Jeremy Easter had the high series with a 418. Casey Kuhl had the high game with a 246. He had a perfect game going into the 8th frame. The boys broke the school record for best single team game with a 1056, and broke the record for highest 2 game series with a 1967. Special shout out to Zach Schueler for his highest game of the year. The boys beat Deer Park 2635 to 2270. This clinches a share of the CHL title as the boys remain undefeated in the CHL. They can clinch the CHL title when they take on Mariemont.

The girls fought hard but fell short. The girls remain in second place in the CHL.

The girls were lead by Makayla Lawson who had a 167 high game and 324 high series.

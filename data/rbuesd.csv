Farmer's Market!
Everyone needs fresh produce. The Jackson Height students got the chance to ""buy"" their own at the first Farmer's Market, organized by Nutrition Director Tina Egan and supported by Pro Pacific Fresh.

Students were given token money then allowed to go ""purchase"". And they were SO excited!

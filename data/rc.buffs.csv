Thank you for your patience and grace as we move forward with our plan to reopen. We are very excited to see students this fall!

East Elementary will have an Open House this year, but it will look a little different than it has in the past.

Preschool and Kindergarten students should bring their supplies to their scheduled time on Tuesday, September 1st.

Students in Grades 1 - 5 will have an open house on Monday, August 31st. We ask that families come to the time assigned by the first letter of their last name. Students will be able to find their classroom, meet their teacher, and bring their school supplies. Please limit those coming to open house to students and 2 adults.
4:30-4:50 - Families with the last name beginning A-K
4:50-5:10 - Families with the last name beginning L-S
5:10-5:30 - Families with the last name beginning T-Z

Class lists will be posted on the main office doors, doors A2, at 5:00 pm today, Wednesday, August 26th.

KSDE received that plan this morning and it has been moved forward to be approved at the KSBOE meeting on April 14th. It is a great plan that will serve kids well. Our Governor's responsible Order: tiny.cc/8fs2lz made this afternoon will not impact our CLP at all. Schools are still functioning expected under the previous order...except in the case that the local Republic County Health Department passes a more strict guideline. GO BUFFS Looking forward to our teachers reaching the lives of children again tomorrow. We love making them smarter, but making a difference in their lives drives us too! Thanks for sharing your kiddos with us! Gonna see some challenges this week, but its gonna be a great week!!!

Although the boys did not get in the medals today at State Cross Country, they gave their best effort in a very competitive race that started out extremely fast. It is quite an accomplishment to even qualify for state. Out of 104 runners Clint Callaway placed 49th running his fastest Wamego course time and after looking at the results he finished ahead of many competitors that had beat him during the season. After the race he commented that he’s really excited for basketball season to start. Hunter Reynolds and Clint are usually right together in races, but unfortunately Hunter battled some cramps in both of his sides hindering him from his usual race performance. Hunter placed 66th, still coming in ahead of several runners. Being just a sophomore this was great experience for Hunter and with his hard work ethics, he will have a successful future in XC. He plans to do some training this winter and is looking forward to being on the track in the spring. BUFF PROUD!!",0.0,"Great work for our entire cross country team this year.

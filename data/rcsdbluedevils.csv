The students watched ""fireworks"" in a jar during a science experiment showing how different liquids react when poured together. We read our weekly paper book, practiced new sight words, explored the -ug word family, and practiced using ten frames. Our Friday activity was going on a house hunt to find objects that started with each letter of the alphabet. Another fun-filled week of learning!!

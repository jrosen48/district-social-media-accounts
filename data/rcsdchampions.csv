As you may have heard, there is a planned PG&E Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) scheduled for parts of Placer County. The PSPS, which may affect power across Placer County, is beginning October 9th at midnight and may continue for multiple days in some areas.

At this time, it does not appear that any of our schools will be affected. We will have school as normally scheduled for the remainder of the week. Should anything change, we will notify our families immediately.

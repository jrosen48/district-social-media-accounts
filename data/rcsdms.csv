About the 2020 Census:

It’s quick and easy. The 2020 Census questionnaire will take about 10 minutes to complete. It’s safe, secure, and confidential. Your information and privacy are protected.

A close contact is defined as any individual who was within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes starting from 2 days before illness onset (or, for asymptomatic patients, 2 days prior to positive test) until the time the patient is isolated. Close contacts MUST QUARANTINE for 14 days. You should monitor for symptoms for 14 days after the last exposure to the infected person. Testing is recommended but a negative test will not negate the 14 day quarantine period.

A group contact is defined as a contact within a school or larger group, classroom or activity but not within 6 feet for more than 15 minutes from the infected person.

Group contacts DO NOT HAVE TO QUARANTINE . It is recommended that you monitor for symptoms and do temperature checks at least 2x daily for 14 days after the last exposure to the infected person.

RUES and RES would like to send a HUGE shoutout to International Paper in Richland, MS, for providing us with our Protective Desk Shields. Our teachers, students, and parents, are very appreciative of your collaboration with us during these uncharted times. It comforts us to know we will begin the 20-21 school year more protected because of the people in the GREAT Richland Community. Mr. Bill and Mr. Art even hand delivered the boards to each teacher’s classroom. Our teachers immediately began assembling the shields along with volunteers from International Paper (all social distancing and masks protocols were followed)! It’s a great YEAR to be a RANGER and a part of the BEST school district, RCSD!

As school closures continue and as the state develops plans to direct resources to the areas of greatest need, the MDE has prepared a brief survey for districts to circulate to families. The survey focuses on devices at home, home internet access, and the quality/reliability of that connection.
Aggregated results from districts will be shared with the governor’s office for planning purposes. Because of the critical nature of these questions – and how the results will shape state policy to address the internet connectivity challenges across the state – It is important that families complete the survey.

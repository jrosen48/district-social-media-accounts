During this time she found her love for children and helping them flourish to their full potential. Being a product of Rutherford County Schools, Suzanne has enjoyed coming back and giving to the school system that gave to her. She has been teaching 4th and 5th grade during her time at Spindale, as well as, heading up the after school Running Club program. Having students understand who they are, who they can be, and achieve their goals is her main focus.

It was great to see our seniors picking up their caps and gowns yesterday. Ray Charles said that ""absence makes the heart grow fonder and tears are only rain to make love grow"". There were smiles, laughs, and tears yesterday, but we are thankful we were able to see each other for a brief moment. The graduation cap is being passed to the Class of 2020, and we can't wait to see you all decked out in your Gold and Blue!

🗣 This afternoon a group of our teachers completed their second module as members of Spindale’s first Teacher Equity Cohort!

During the first two work sessions, our cohort defined equity and identified how we can promote it in our classrooms. They discussed asset vs. deficit based thinking and today they developed their understanding of how their personal identifies and lenses play a vital role in our students educational experiences.

These times of critical reflection, conversation, and professional development, truly allow our teachers to reflect on their practice and move forward with new strategies or ways of thinking!

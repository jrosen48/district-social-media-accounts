Teams are usually between two and four players and requires the use of solid wooden paddles and a perforated polymer ball, similar to a Whiffle Ball, played over a low-slung net.

“This activity allows students to have fun, while fine tuning their motor skills,” said RCS Middle School Physical Education teacher Megan McClave. “It’s a fast growing activity and provides a lifetime fitness option for people of all ages. The students love playing and it’s a great addition to the RCS Physical Education department curriculum.”

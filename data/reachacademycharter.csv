I have been teaching for 16 years. This is my 10th year at Reach.

Reason for going into education:
My grandma was a Kindergarten teacher. I loved when she would take me to school with her. When I was younger, I asked my teachers for extra worksheets. I set up my own school in the basement with my little brother and our stuffed animals. I have always wanted to teach.

Why I love teaching at Reach Academy:
I absolutely love the staff at Reach! I love working with a supportive group of educators who truly care about kids.",2020-05-01 10:18:55,,

Studies show that exercise and being active at least 60 minutes a day can lead to improved focus, better sleep, and improved moods. These three things together can only help your child in a school setting. Being active doesn’t have to be limited to running and lifting weights. There are so many ways that your child can stay active including dancing, walking a dog, or even just playing outside with their friends. As a school we are always looking for ways to help our students succeed in all aspects of life.

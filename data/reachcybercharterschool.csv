We enjoyed pizza, discussed WHY we celebrate NSCW, worked together on a banner and ""I Love My School Because"" placards... Then we hit the tubing lanes! They had a blast racing each other down the mountain, going down in groups, and playing with each other.

With all the great options in PA for education, I want to thank these awesome families for choosing Reach!

Building the Blue Devil Band...
Our band program continues to grow and we're always looking for new musicians! Beginning in 5th-grade, students are able to join the Blue Devil Band program. Yesterday, all of our 5th-grade students had the opportunity to try an instrument in music class.

If your child is interested in joining the band, learn more at a parent meeting being held in the RHS band room with Buddy Rogers music at 6:30 p.m. this Thursday night, September 19th. Please enter through the Middle School Entrance. Students are not required to attend this meeting.

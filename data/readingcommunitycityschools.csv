Speed dating. Not your typical lesson plans.

Reading Middle School language arts teacher Amy Celis designs lessons to allow her students to become engaged and active learners.

Speed dating is a way of having discussions in smaller, rotating partners. There are a series of questions on the desk, and students rotate in an inner and outer circle, so they have a new partner to discuss each question regarding the book.

The gallery walk focused on figurative language. Examples of figurative language were posted around the room, and students worked in partners to identify the type of figurative language, and to explain what it means.

“We typically have great engagement in these lessons - students enjoy the chance to move, and to interact with different members of the class as we attack rigorous skills and material,” Mrs. Celis shared.

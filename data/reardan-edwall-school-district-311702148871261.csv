NATIONAL TAKE YOUR PARENTS TO LUNCH DAY
During this event, parents can visit their children’s school and have a meal with them in the school cafeteria.

The goal of National Take Your Parents to Lunch Day is to learn more about what goes into putting together a healthy lunch. Parents and school officials have an opportunity to open the lines of communication so they can work together to provide kids with the healthiest meals possible.

HOW TO OBSERVE

Come to the cafeteria and for $4.00 you'll get lasagna, garlic bread and salad bar. Don't forget your milk😀

Illinois 5Essentials Parent/Guardian Survey
Please access the link at:
https://survey.5-essentials.org/illinois/?target_name=parent.

The parent/guardian survey will take under 10 minutes to complete. You may skip questions you do not wish to answer, but the survey must be completed in one sitting and cannot be retrieved once it is submitted.

If you decide to take the survey, your identity will be kept completely confidential and your responses will not be linked to you. In addition, school-level reports will only be generated if at least 20 percent of our parents/guardians complete the survey, which can be accessed by visiting https://survey.5-essentials.org/illinois/.

The results will be made available to the public via the State School Report Cards, which will be released in the fall.

You can access general information about the Illinois 5Essentials Survey by visiting https://illinois.5-essentials.org/.

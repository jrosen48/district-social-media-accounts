Uncertain times call for productive measures. If any girl in current grades 6-11 (upcoming 7-12) is interested in trying out for RHS or RJHS Cheer, we will be hosting a virtual try out experience all through Google Classroom!

💙Girls interested will need to comment their school email below or email me at cclark@rector.k12.ar.us.

💙On May 6th, I will upload video material of a dance, cheers, and chant.

💙Girls have until Friday, May 8th at 3:30 PM to “turn in” videos of themselves preforming the material. There will be more detailed instructions posted in the Google Classroom. This can all be done on their phones through the Google Classroom app.

💙Results will be posted by 8 AM, Saturday May 9th.

💙PLEASE share with girls you know are interested.

💙Any questions can be sent to my email listed above. Any girl who is interested in cheering, but does not have access to internet/google classroom will have the opportunity to try out in person when we are able to meet again.

Uncertain times call for productive measures. If any girl in current grades 6-11 (upcoming 7-12) is interested in trying out for RHS or RJHS Cheer, we will be hosting a virtual try out experience all through Google Classroom!

💙Girls interested will need to comment their school email below or email me at cclark@rector.k12.ar.us.

💙On May 6th, I will upload video material of a dance, cheers, and chant.

💙Girls have until Friday, May 8th at 3:30 PM to “turn in” videos of themselves preforming the material. There will be more detailed instructions posted in the Google Classroom. This can all be done on their phones through the Google Classroom app.

💙Results will be posted by 8 AM, Saturday May 9th.

💙PLEASE share with girls you know are interested.

💙Any questions can be sent to my email listed above. Any girl who is interested in cheering, but does not have access to internet/google classroom will have the opportunity to try out in person when we are able to meet again.

At this time, Rector School District will remain open. According to the Governor's Emergency Proclamation, the Governor, in coordination, with the Secretary of Health and the Secretary of Education, have the sole authority to close public school campuses across the state for reasons related to COVID-19.

We will continue to take directives from the Governor and the Arkansas Department of Health as we navigate the COVID-19 effect on Arkansas and our district and strive to keep the safety of our students and staff as our main priority.

We will continue to update the School district Facebook page and send out alerts as more information becomes available.",2020-03-13 17:17:24,,

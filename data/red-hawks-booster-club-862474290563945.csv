Thunder top Hawks in HIT finale

By Adam Clay

Hiawatha never got their offense rolling in Saturday's tournament championship against Nemaha Central, as the Red Hawks fell 44-32. It was the third consecutive year the two teams have faced off in the Hiawatha Invitational Tournament, with the Thunder taking the rubber match after losing in the final seconds a year ago.

Nemaha never trailed in the contest, taking off to a 6-0 start in a low-scoring first quarter that ended 6-4. Up 15-11 at the half, the Thunder doubled their output in the third quarter, stretching their lead to 30-18 at the end of the frame.

Hiawatha found themselves down by double digits in the fourth and resorted to fouling to stop the clock, but between converting free throws and offensive rebounding, Nemaha was able to sustain their lead and close out the third-seeded Red Hawks. The Thunder's Laura Mackey scored a game high 18, while Courtney Brockhoff led Hiawatha with 12 points, including 3 three pointers. Hiawatha now sits at 6-5 and Nemaha moved to 12-1.

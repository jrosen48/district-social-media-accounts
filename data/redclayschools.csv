Joined by Senator Chris Coons, Meyer commended McKean, a 2019 Unified Champion Banner School, for its success in unified sports and its longstanding commitment to inclusivity.

As part of this inspiring event, principal Brian Mattix led a Q&A where students had an opportunity to learn more about Meyer, including how she overcame challenges earlier in her life to become a five-time gold medalist in swimming.

Thank you to Senator Coons, Lucy, Special Olympics Delaware, and McKean for this memorable day!

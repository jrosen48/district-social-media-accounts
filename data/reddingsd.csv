Congratulations to Katherine Conway, our Middle School Teacher of the Year from Sequoia Middle School. Ms. Conway embodies the art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge. Each day is better than the last due to her amazing attribute of self-reflection. She is always improving her teaching by asking herself what worked and didn‚Äôt work. Katherine has been a leading force in changing our school culture to be a tighter knit community with a positive feel.

Tricia Tompkins and Kim Wards 4th & 5th Grade Classes at Bonny View School participated in a Book Tasting today Wednesday, December 18th.

What is a book tasting you ask? It is an opportunity to preview books and come up with a ‚Äúmust read‚Äù list of books. The students preview the cover, read the back cover, read a few pages, then fill out their menu and rate the book. The students have discussions at their group about the book and share what they liked or disliked about the book they ‚Äòtasted‚Äô. At the end of the experience, they write a reflection about the book tasting.

They also are served yummy snacks and hot apple cider to enjoy during their book tasting experience. What a fun way to find a few good books to read over the Winter Recess!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1514528792029157&id=175971695884880,,0.0,"Book Tasting 2019

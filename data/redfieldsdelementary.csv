Are you celebrating May Day? Friday, May 1, 2020 is almost here!

In the 19th and 20th centuries, people welcomed the first of May by gathering flowers from the end of April’s showers and arranged them with pretty paper and small gifts like candy. They hung them on the door of people they cared about, both friends and neighbors, to welcome the warm weather. Modern May Day celebrations include ringing the recipient’s doorbell and running away without getting caught or the recipient gives the giver a kiss!

How can you make your own May Day basket? You can use many things as your container! Plastic cups, paper bags, jars, whipped topping containers, cottage cheese containers, or even a green plastic strawberry container all work! Cover them with pretty paper and punch holes on each side. Run ribbon, twine, string, or pipe cleaners through each hole and make a handle. Fill your container with candy or flowers.

During this time of social distancing, make someone’s day by leaving a May Day basket on the step of people you know and even those you don’t know.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1579333638883435&id=538851699598306,,0.0,"Weekly Challenge

This information should be released before July 1, 2020. Each individual school district will have some responsibility to take these orders and develop a plan appropriate for their school community.

The Governor has signed this morning an Executive Order closing school for the remainder of the year. The wonderful, committed professionals in this district are working to ensure our students are still supported and engaged in learning during this extended closure. There is still much to sort out in the Executive Order and how it will impact our students and staff. We will be working over the next few weeks to meet the requirements of the Executive Order and doing what is in the best interest of Redford Union students.

Next week is still spring break for staff and students. Please prepare and expect to hear more about our plan the week of April 13th. Thank you for your patience and support. Be well and stay healthy!

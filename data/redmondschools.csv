Linda Seeberg, Executive Director of Academic Programs shared this about this team of instructional coaches:

“Our instructional coaches have played an instrumental role in helping our schools successfully navigate the development, implementation and ongoing improvement of distance learning across the district. They have worked tirelessly to serve teachers, principals and district leaders and have been the primary developers of the systems and strategies that allowed us to serve kids and families over the last three months.

Chronic absenteeism is a nationwide issue that we are also dealing with in the Redmond School District. Our goal is to bring awareness to the issue and greatly reduce the number of chronic absences in our schools so that we can provide as many opportunities for success as possible.

Some important things to know:

• Children chronically absent in kindergarten and 1st grade are much less likely to read at grade level by the end of 3rd grade.

• By 6th grade, chronic absence is a proven early warning sign for students at risk for dropping out of school.

• By 9th grade good attendance can predict graduation rates even better than 8th grade test scores.

Mike has lived in Redmond since he was 5 years old and most recently has been the Redmond School District Superintendent since 2012. He shares some of his story:

“Growing up in Redmond included a ton of cool things; one of them was clearly the fair. I began showing beef cattle in 4-H at age 10 and then moved into showing dairy cattle through my high school years. I joined FFA as a sophomore and had several projects including swine and equine.
I am proud of the way we have kept the Fair simple and honoring the youth that work hard on their projects.

Due to the layout at Globe Life Field and social distancing, we were not able to have the time-honored tradition of Board Members handing out diplomas at the ceremony.

Instead, we will be hosting a special second photo opportunity for our graduates TONIGHT - Tuesday, June 2 - from 6-7 p.m. in the Red Oak High School Cafeteria to have your photo taken with the full School Board or an individual Board member of your choosing. These photos will also be mailed to you.

We are continuing to work through details on social distancing with stadium personnel before announcing the number of tickets allotted to each grad. We can share that there will not be a charge for parking during graduation, but the stadium bag policy will be in effect.

We are planning a Graduate Pick-Up day later in May to include programs, transcripts, tickets, instructions, and other items and will send that information as soon as the date and time are decided.

All of the events will be livestreamed at TeachersCan.org/events, unless indicated otherwise there. And get some sleep , because your schedule of events starts at 7:30 each morning, including tomorrow. You don't have to be a teacher to participate, but we are doing this specifically to pay tribute to our awesome Texas teachers.

“The event was canceled, but it is vital to honor these moms and dads who were nominated by their children,” stated Superintendent Brenda Sanford. “The nomination letters were touching, heart-warming, emotional, and full of love. We couldn’t be prouder of our students and their outstanding parent nominees.”

“To our parents, ROISD is an amazing district because of your caring attitude, love of your children and support of their education. We can’t do it without you! exclaimed Sanford. “We also want to thank our students for all their amazing entries – showering their parents with love and appreciation. Finally, thanks to the staff and campus administration for facilitating the process, and Mrs. Donna Knight for spearheading this amazing award program. We celebrate each of the winners.”

On behalf of the Board, district and campus administration, congratulations!

When I tell you it all still feels like a dream. I'm for real. It still feels like a dream.

I am getting inducted into the State of Texas Hall of Fame March 28, 2020. My Dad was inducted in 2002 and I remember going to his ceremony thinking how cool is this. Now it's my turn. We have talents, gifts, dreams, and goals and we don't know how they are going to manifest. I knew I could win the Olympics but I didn't know what was going to happen after that. I have been able to touch so many lives. The young and the experienced, black, brown, white and all the colors in between. Those who have a lot and those who don't have enough. Throwing the shot put has allowed me so many opportunities to encourage others. God gave me this gift that's not popular but it's effective and I'm so grateful! More information to come.

Red Oak HS has two ladies that are at or near a milestone, or two, that we recognized tonight.

First, sophomore point-guard Breanna Davis. Breanna is a two-year varsity player and captain this year who recently reached the 1,000 high school career point milestone. She is averaging over 15 points per game along with substantial numbers in steals, assists and rebounds. Congratulations Breanna.

Next, junior forward Aniyah Johnson. Aniyah is a three-year varsity player and captain who has already reached the 1,000 high school career rebound mark and will very soon reach the 1,000 career point mark. She averages just under 10 points per game, and 9 rebounds per game this year, along with 3 blocks per game. Congratulations Aniyah.

The world's attention was focused on Ritter, a three-time Olympic qualifier, as she set an Olympic record and tied her American record with a jump of 6-feet-8-inches. Ritter defeated the reigning world champion Stefka Kostadinova in a jump-off and won the United States a gold medal in women's high jump for the first time since 1956.

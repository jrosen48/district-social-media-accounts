Today we were informed by Department of Public Safety, to go into a soft lockdown due to an incident that happened nearby in Red Rock Village this morning around 10:45 a.m. The person of concern was in custody, but as a precautionary, we went into a lockdown at the request of DPS. All students were safe and continued with classroom instruction as usual. The soft lockdown was only for 5 minutes before DPS informed us it was safe to lift the lockdown. If you have any questions, please contact the office.

In an effort to provide a safe and secure learning environment at our school, we would like to inform you that Red Rock Elementary will be performing a planned lock down practice drill on Thursday, November 14 at 9:00 AM.

School administration, with the support of Pinal County Sheriff's Office and Avra Valley Fire Department, are conducting these drills to practice our Emergency Response procedures. The drills are to ensure that students and staff are aware of our outlined procedures, including, where to report, what to do, and how to respond as a school.

These drills also help us to understand where our gaps in protocols are so they may be addressed and improved upon.

We encourage you to talk with your children and discuss with them what their classroom protocols are and see if they have any questions that we can help them with. Please feel free to contact the school with any of your questions.

The Redtail DOGS are providing a pizza afternoon snack to each of the pods throughout the remainder of the year. First up is 5th grade and we need some fellow DOGS to help out! We should only need 4-6 people to help out so we can plate quickly. A great opportunity for any dads of 5th graders to do something fun for/with their student(s)!

December 20th @1:45 PM

Meet at Redtail at 1:45 PM and we'll start plating pizza slices. (We'll either meet in the lunchroom or the 5th-grade pod. We're still waiting to hear where they would like us to be.) There's an all-school meeting that the students will be coming back from around 2:15 and they'll grab a plate on their way to their classroom.

We should be all done and cleaned up by 3pm. Email Redtaildogs@gmail.com with any questions.",0.0,"Redtail, we are in need of 3 more dads to help make Friday’s pizza party a success! Please, like and share this post! Let’s get the word out! Thanks!

“Blizzard of Wishes” is back again for the holidays! How does it work? Classroom teachers will be asked to share items that would help support their classroom. The ideas will range in price from $5-$20 and could include markers, craft materials, electric pencil sharpener, books, gift cards, etc. (The lists will differ depending upon what each individual teacher needs to help them create the best learning environment for their students!)

The “Blizzard of Wishes” ideas will be posted in your child’s cluster during the upcoming conference nights in November. The specialist teachers will have their wishes near the main office. Please look for the display and look through the list of wishes. If you find an item you would like to donate for a holiday gift, please take the slip of paper with you. You can deliver the classroom gift during the week of Dec. 16-20. After conferences, the “Blizzard of Wishes” will continue to be available until winter break, but will move to the main office.

We are at the half way point of the big Read A Thon fundraiser. Please, if you haven't already, register your student(s) at http://www.getmovinfundhub.com/ and share their fundraising page. Statistics show that students with a shared page raise almost 2 time as much as those who don't share the page. The Get Movin' Fund Hub site does NOT sell or use your personal information for any reason, so it is 100% safe and risk free to sign up. You can share your student(s) page via Facebook, Twitter, Email and text right from their page - it's very easy!!

The kids have earned their first incentive of a freeze pop party and are just over half way to earning the PL water bottle incentive.

The actual Read A Thon will be on Friday, October 11th.

Thank you for your continued support of the Read A Thon and all fundraising efforts at Redtail Ridge. We truly appreciate it!

We are at the half way point of the big Read A Thon fundraiser. Please, if you haven't already, register your student(s) at http://www.getmovinfundhub.com/ and share their fundraising page. Statistics show that students with a shared page raise almost 2 time as much as those who don't share the page. The Get Movin' Fund Hub site does NOT sell or use your personal information for any reason, so it is 100% safe and risk free to sign up. You can share your student(s) page via Facebook, Twitter, Email and text right from their page - it's very easy!!

The kids have earned their first incentive of a freeze pop party and are just over half way to earning the PL water bottle incentive.

The actual Read A Thon will be on Friday, October 11th.

Thank you for your continued support of the Read A Thon and all fundraising efforts at Redtail Ridge. We truly appreciate it!

Keri Kuboushek and Stephanie Williamson

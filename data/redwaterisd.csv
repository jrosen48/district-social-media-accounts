Tanner noticed a distressed preschooler, who wanted to remain on the bus due to the rain. Tanner used the bus driver’s umbrella to walk the student to class, where all was well and both were dry and stress-free. Tanner proves that there are no small acts, only acts of kindness that make a huge difference in the recipient’s life. The faculty and staff at Redwater Junior High are proud of Tanner for being an example to all. #rwdragonproud #RJH",2019-09-03 18:10:57,,

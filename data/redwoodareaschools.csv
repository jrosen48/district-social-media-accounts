Hello Redwood Falls Community!!! Thought this would be a great time to add some cheer to our community!

Each week print and color or draw and color a picture in keeping with the theme of the week. Then hang it in your window or somewhere on your house/yard to make it visible from the road.

Other families can drive or walk around to see how many pictures they can find while keeping our social distancing practices - maybe we will be able to share a little wave along the way! The more people that join, the more fun this will be!

I entered Miss Rohling's classroom to a magical interaction between peers.....One glance around this classroom and these students were working together with amazing compassion, helping, teaching and working together--there were smiles, laughing and conversations happening with each other.

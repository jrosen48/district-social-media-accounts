We have LIFTOFF!! This week we celebrate Education Specialist Danielle Webb and Redwood City School District preschools and teachers!

Ms. Webb helps teachers identify the needs of children and their families. Her detailed classroom observations help teachers identify children’s specific learning needs and how to best meet those needs. Additionally, Ms. Webb supports teachers work with families to create a preschool-family partnership for each child’s physical, intellectual, social, and emotional development.

Congratulations to Ms. Webb and Redwood City School District preschools and teachers for creating such an insightful and collaborative learning environment!

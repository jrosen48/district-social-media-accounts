At its monthly meeting yesterday in Fairfield, the Maine State Board of Education approved the ""Site Application"" for the new Sumner Memorial High School new building project. The Board unanimously voted to approve the current Sumner location as the site for our new grades 6-12 facility. This is a major milestone and puts on the next track of our journey, the Concept Design. Although we have completed a substantial amount of work toward our Concept Design, there is still work to be done. The next Building Committee meeting will take place on December 18, starting at 6:30 p.m. at the District Services Facility.

Hi there everyone! Boosters wants to make sure that the students who were nominated by THIER coaches for our scholarship are getting them done and turning them in. WE DONT NOMINTE THE KIDS. They would have received an application from our A.D. You have one more week to do so. You can always take a snap shot and send over fb messenger if you run into problems. Unlike other scholarships, this is not an acedemic scholarship. You had to be nominated by a coach.
So get them turned in!

Hi there everyone! Boosters wants to make sure that the students who were nominated by THIER coaches for our scholarship are getting them done and turning them in. WE DONT NOMINTE THE KIDS. They would have received an application from our A.D. You have one more week to do so. You can always take a snap shot and send over fb messenger if you run into problems. Unlike other scholarships, this is not an acedemic scholarship. You had to be nominated by a coach.
So get them turned in!

TODAY'S TEACHER RECOGNITION'S - 5/5/20

An important message from

Timothy Jenny, Superintendent, Remsen Central Schools:

Instead of nominating one teacher, I would like to recognize our entire teaching staff. During this unprecedented time, our Remsen teaching team has worked tirelessly for our students. Our school buildings may be closed, but our teachers are teaching like never before. They deserve recognition for the tremendous teaching challenges they are working to overcome each day. Most importantly, our team is doing everything they can to ensure that all of our students continue to soar to success.

Good morning! Today's lesson is a time lapse because it would take too long to do it live. I went grocery shopping on Wednesday and had a big pile of cardboard to recycle. I didn't notice all the colors until I had it all in a pile and I was thinking how pretty it was. Haha! I am the self proclaimed queen of recycled art. All of my reflector tape art is made from garbage, thrown out pieces of scraps from NYS road signs. And you can often find me picking out of piles of junk people are throwing out for old wood scraps to make signs with, or old windows. I love making something beautiful out of something that was intended for a landfill. Plus, I dont like buying art supplies because they are really expensive! So today's project is garbage art! I love masks, I have a collection of them. So, I made a mask out of my recyclables. Maybe I'll do more after this dries a little! Just be very careful with any sharp objects you use, nobody needs to get hurt right now!",0.0,"Jodi Anne Richard

Here is today's time lapse for our art lesson on OP ART. OP art is the coolest, we will talk more about it at 9:00. But, please watch this before so you can have a better idea of what we will be doing. Or, watch it later, or watch it 10 times or don't watch it at all. That, my friends, is the beauty of art. You make your own rules and if you choose to make art, that's cool. If you choose to just look at art, that's cool, too. Or you can take a nap. We are living through a pandemic and we will all deal with it differently. For me, making these videos has been an important key to my stability. But, to be honest, I haven't felt really motivated to make art in my studio. Just can't find it in my soul right now. And, that's ok. Maybe I will, maybe I won't.

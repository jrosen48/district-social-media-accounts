Munir Gomaa was in the spotlight last Saturday, April 20, as his school put on a huge event called ""From Sinai to Salt Lake City: A Bedouin Fair"". Renaissance Academy received a TCLP Project Grant to sponsor the fair which helped build awareness and understanding of the Bedouin and Arabic culture and language. Over 400 people attended the fair and participated in many hands-on activities including making Bedouin bread and cooking it over a fire, getting painted with Henna, trying on Bedouin clothing, interacting with animals (goats and camels), dancing, drumming, eating, and even climbing a 24ft. Mt. Sinai climbing wall. It was a great success and everyone has had enthusiastic things to say about it. It is the biggest event the World Language team has sponsored at Renaissance, and Arabic language students from two other high schools also came to support the event.

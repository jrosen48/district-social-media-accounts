We gave educators almost no notice. We asked them to completely redesign what school looks like and in about 24 hours local administrators and teachers ""Apollo 13'ed"" the problem and fixed it. Kids learning, children being fed, needs being met in the midst of a global crisis.
No state agency did this, no so-called national experts on curriculum. The local educators fixed it in hours. HOURS.
In fact, existing state and federal policies actually created multiple roadblocks. Local schools figured out how to do it around those too. No complaining and no handwringing - just solutions and amazingly clever plans.
Remember that the next time someone tries to convince you that schools are better run by mandates from non-educators. Remember that the next time someone tells you that teachers have it easy or try to persuade you that educators are not among the smartest, most ingenious people in society.

Due to the severe weather and poor road conditions, area schools are closed. As on all Snow Days, students should complete one day of the Home/Snow/e Learning packet that was sent home this fall. That means a reading assignment or home reading, a math work, and writing an essay.

Friday's Annual Ski Day/Home Learning school day is still on - winter weather won't stop that!

Parent-Teacher Conferences scheduled for today will be moved to the same times next week on Thursday, February 20, which will be a half day of school. If you need to reschedule your conference, please let your child's teacher know on Tuesday so we can adjust your time.

We understand many students were very excited about Valentine's, so Valentine exchanges will still take place next week by class when it fits best in their schedules. Elementary students should bring their Valentine's on Tuesday to be stored until their class exchange. Preschool/Kindergarten will celebrate on Wednesday.

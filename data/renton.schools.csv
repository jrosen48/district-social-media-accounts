The organization discriminated against Donley who before becoming an educator served as a first lieutenant in the Korean War.

Sixty teachers stood in solidarity with Donley, and walked out of the event. Later, Donley and the Renton Education Association, the teachers union, filed a complaint against the organization with WA state, which was successful, resulting in the Eagles losing its liquor license for three weeks and forced to issue a formal apology.

The incident also launched a state-wide discussion in 1967 about whether organizations that hold a state liquor license could discriminate on the basis of race.

Mr. Donley, who in 1963 was only the second African American teacher hired in Renton, went on to become assistant principal at Hazen High School.

During his two-year apprenticeship, Ronald earned over 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training, 15 tuition-free college credits, a nationally-recognized journeyman's certificate and lifelong mentorship from industry professionals.

The AJAC apprenticeship program helps teach high school students to work with tools and high-tech machinery, connects them with a company looking for highly-trained employees, and possibly a long-term career in aerospace and advanced manufacturing in Washington State. It’s one of the many ways Renton School District is helping students make good choices and be ready for many options after high school.

Don't Stand So Close To Me - A PSA From the Newcastle WA Police Department

April 21 at 5:47 PM ·

Hey everyone!

I wanted to share this fun (but important) project that I was involved with recently. I was asked to help put together a PSA for the Newcastle Police Department about the importance of social distancing.

Newcastle's Police Chief, Jason Houck, penned a fresh set of lyrics to the classic Police (appropriate, right?) song ""Don't Stand So Close To Me"", and my wife Gigi and I contributed a few lyrical suggestions and edits before sending it off to YES' bassist Billy Sherwood, who recorded the vocals and put together the audio in just a few hours. Lastly, a local videographer, Thomas Stone, shot and edited the final video.

We think it turned out pretty good--let us know what you think! And remember to stay safe out there.

See you soon,

Amazon’s Future Engineer program will make the donation to two Seattle-based nonprofits with the aim of helping a more diverse group of students find work in science and technology.

The Pacific Science Center will get $1 million to invest in its flagship Science on Wheels program, which brings traveling workshops, exhibits and live stage shows to students throughout the state.

Washington STEM, a Seattle-based advocate for diversity in tech and the sciences, will use its money to help more students from low-income and rural communities as well as students of color and girls and young women gain access to tech education.

By 2030, 70 percent of all family-wage Washington jobs will require education beyond high school, including certificates and apprenticeships. Two-thirds of those jobs will require STEM skills.

Classroom grants were provided for science, music, art, literature, drama, and even specialized clubs and activities like material for an after-school knitting club and field trips to regional cultural events.

The grants were provided by Renton Schools Foundation, Joy Poff Fund for Education and Families, Harper Engineering Children’s Need Fund, and Renton Regional Community Foundation.

More than 27,000 voters cast their ballot, with more than 70% approval for the School Construction measure to build a new elementary school and make improvements at nearly every school in the district. Both of those numbers are historic firsts for Renton Schools.

On behalf of all Renton School District staff, students and families, here’s a message of thanks from Renton Schools Superintendent Damien Pattenuade.

In 2006, as Sounders club's majority owner Adrian Hanauer was working to create a major league soccer team in the Seattle area, he approached Renton School District administration to discuss leasing Renton Stadium to become the home for the new major league team. The proposal included taking out the track at the stadium to expand the field to MLS league standards. It would’ve also meant having our high schools sports teams play games elsewhere during the major league soccer season. Renton School District could not agree to the requirements.

⭐️⭐️Tonight Austin Simon was named the Kansas FFA STAR in Agribusiness!⭐️⭐️ This is one of the *three* highest awards a Kansas FFA member can receive from the state level. To say we are proud is an understatement. During National FFA Convention last fall Austin was watching the National Star Awards presentation and turned to me and said, “Hey, I can do that!” I said, “I know you can,” and- you guys- HE DID!

We are so proud of him, not just because of this award, but more importantly the person he is. Hard working, honest, dedicated and funny! Congratulations, Austin!

Fast forward to 1:32:00 in the video below to see Austin’s interview about his project!

This award is in addition to and separate from the State Proficiency Award he received earlier this week!

Congratulations also go to Laura Doll for winning the South Central District proficiency award area of Ag Mechanics, Repair and Maintenance, as well as being named this year's South Central District's STAR in Ag Placement. Way to go, Laura!

To top it off, the Renwick Chapter was one of just 14 - out of the 42 chapters in the South Central District - recognized as a Superior Chapter on the district level. These chapters will move on to the state level competition. We are #RenwickProud of all Renwick FFA members and their sponsors - Cheyenne Holliday and Cody Holliday. Join us in offering them our congratulations!",2020-05-19 13:21:40,,

Novel studies are an integral part of curriculum.

To ensure books are in her students' hands, Bonnie Sheahon St. Mark's School applied for a $300 Renwick Education Foundation teacher grant for hardback copies of the classic novel, Tuck Everlasting.

“I have taught for 11 years with paperback,” she noted. “Twenty-five hardbacks could be used in the classroom and would last forever. Old paperbacks could be sent home for homework or makeup work.

Ted Anderson, Language Arts instructor at Andale Elementary, will be delving into new novels thanks to a $576.86 grant from Renwick Education Foundation.

“I have 51 current sixth graders and for most of my novels, I have around 20 serviceable copies,” Anderson wrote in his grant application.

“Most of our vocabulary thinking skills that don’t come from our Pearson program appear in novel units,” Anderson noted. “We teach a lot of vocabulary, word usage and inferencing during novel studies.”

Keep reading and enjoy those books, students. Thanks to REF for helping the story of learning continue.",0.0,"Renwick Education Foundation

“Our welding helmets are old and are in need of an upgrade,” the teachers noted in their application, adding that darkening welding helmets offer additional comfort and ease and are also safer because of “welding flash.”

Ear plugs and gloves will also guard against noise pollution and burns thanks to the $954.40 in grant funds.

“With more and more students engaged in the welding classes or CAM, it is important that we are confident in our students’ safety,” the teachers added. “The use of adequate safety gear is a priority that needs to be maintained.

The Garden Plain Elementary STEAM students will keep soaring – thanks to a grant from Renwick Education Foundation.

The $975 grant will allow for a continued account in “Whitebox Learning,” which is a complete standards-based applied learning system that allows students to build, analyze, and simulate their designs virtually, before building their physical models.

GPES teacher Tia Jones has utilized the system while teaching a Flight and Space unit.

“Whitebox Learning Gliber 2.0 gives students the ability to virtually greate a glider, then using their unique design, students compete virtually against the designs of their peers.
“The program offers a plethora of data that students must check and maintain specs given. It provides an engaging, realistic process topped off with a virtual airshow.”

Dear Rescue Families,

We trust this message finds you well and also enjoying this beautiful weather.

We know that the Governor has suggested that public schools may start the next school year as early as July, but we would like to clarify that there have been no directives from the State regarding start dates. Rescue Union's 2020-2021 school year calendar is posted on the District website and the first student day of school will be Tuesday, August 11. We are not considering changing our start date unless the Governor mandates a change. All El Dorado County districts are maintaining their August start dates.

We will continue communicating with you as we learn new information. We thank you for your support and partnership.

Most sincerely,

Dear Rescue Union Families,

We hope this message finds you well. We know that school closures present many challenges to our community. In these uncertain times, please know that our commitment to you, and to your children, is unwavering, and we look forward to having our students return to school just as soon as it is safe to do so. Although we remain hopeful and optimistic that students will soon return, it is important that we prepare for the possibility that our schools could be closed for quite some time. Attached is a letter outlining our new distance learning plans in the event that we are faced with long term school closures.

In closing, these are certainly unprecedented times, and on behalf of all of us in the Rescue Union School District, we want to acknowledge the struggles that many of our families are currently facing and offer our heartfelt sympathy and support. We are an amazing and resilient community, and we know we will emerge even stronger on the other side.

Dear Rescue Families,

El Dorado County Office of Education and El Dorado County Public Health continues to work closely with each district in our county to provide our staff and families current communication regarding school closure. As a county, we remain unified and collaborative. For this we are grateful.

The Press Release attached provides you the latest information regarding school closure. If you have difficulty opening it, you will also find it on our Facebook Page and our Web page. Please remember we do not take school closure lightly and it is our top priority to have our schools open for students just as quickly as is safely possible.

We thank you for your continued support and patience. We will communicate with you in the next week regarding additional learning opportunities for our students over the length of school closure. We will also continue providing meals for our students at the three locations.

In collaboration and concurrence with all El Dorado County schools and the El Dorado County Office of Education, we will be closing all Rescue Union School District schools and suspending all extracurricular activities beginning Monday, March 16 through March 20. We will notify staff and families at the end of the week about any closure status for the following week.

In an effort to ensure the best possible care for our families during this time, we will continue to provide lunches, and a breakfast for the following days, to any of our children. We will run a ‚Äúpickup window‚Äù in the Pleasant Grove bus loop, each day, from 11am to 1pm. During this time, parents may drive up, and as long as our staff identifies at least one of the children in the car to be a district student, all kids that are present in the car can be fed.

Welcome back and happy 2020!

We trust you all had a wonderful Christmas and holiday season and are ready for the second half of the school year.

Attached are ""20 Tips For a Positive New Year"" that one of my favorite authors, Jon Gordon, sent out this past week. I thought I would share them with you as well as with our staff. They are great reminders for us all as we journey through the first year of a new decade!

Also, do not forget that we have two more community outreach meetings available regarding our school bond measure that will be on the March 2020 ballot.

* The first opportunity to meet is January 16, in Room 18 at Marina Village at 6 pm.
* The second is Monday, January 27th, in the library at Pleasant Grove Middle School at 6:00 pm.

We hope to see you at one of these important meetings.

Most sincerely,

Welcome back and happy 2020!

We trust you all had a wonderful Christmas and holiday season and are ready for the second half of the school year.

Attached are ""20 Tips For a Positive New Year"" that one of my favorite authors, Jon Gordon, sent out this past week. I thought I would share them with you as well as with our staff. They are great reminders for us all as we journey through the first year of a new decade!

Also, do not forget that we have two more community outreach meetings available regarding our school bond measure that will be on the March 2020 ballot.

* The first opportunity to meet is January 16, in Room 18 at Marina Village at 6 pm.
* The second is Monday, January 27th, in the library at Pleasant Grove Middle School at 6:00 pm.

We hope to see you at one of these important meetings.

Most sincerely,
Cheryl Olson, Superintendent",2020-01-05 21:15:30,,

Not sure how to engage your ever-changing child without screen time? Consider going old-school with a family game night this weekend! This doesn‚Äôt have to be a big, over planned, lengthy affair. Spending time as a family builds stability, rapport and trust (games just make it more fun!) It gives parents a chance to model positive sportsmanship, good attitudes and be silly. Just grab a game and go! My favorite places to look for family games are thrift stores and the clearance sections at Target. Here are some of my favorites:
Apples to Apples Junior (4th - 7th)
Snake Oil (Middle School - Adults)
Monopoly (3rd - Adults)
Uno (Kinder - 100+ years)

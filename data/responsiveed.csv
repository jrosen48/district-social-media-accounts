This years class had 17 graduates. Sounds like a small group. But now consider each graduate had a vehicle loaded down with family members. When their car got the the front of the lines, graduates got to take their turn and walk across the stage to fan fair. Most standard graduations have signs and the screaming family members.

One of our Quest students, Sophie Stephens (rising 11th grader) attended the UALR Civil Engineering Camp (June 16th-28th) and led her project team to victory in a bridge building competition during closing ceremonies. The students attended classes and field excursions educating the students in all that goes into the field, including math, 3D software, presentation, geography, machinations, transportation and municipal services over the 2 week course. Sophie learned so much, made great friends and recommends the courses offered by UALR's EIT Summer Residency Camps.

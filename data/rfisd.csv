The sounds, feelings, energy, and emotional response that music brings didn’t go away. Only the platform changed.

It’s only our platform that will change as teachers. After music went through all of its changes it actually became more accessible, more integrated and more important to everyday life than before.

• Is it a neighbor who mowed your lawn when you were sick?
• What about a family member who always encouraged you to do your best?
• Maybe it was your friend who comforted you during a difficult time in your life?

We all have someone who has gone above and beyond to show us kindness; someone who shifts our perspective, helps us through painful moments or inspires us to be kinder in our daily lives.

TO CELEBRATE RAK WEEK, SNAP A PHOTO OF THAT PERSON AND SHARE THEIR STORY WITH US IN THE COMMENTS!

If you can’t get a photo of your 'one', share a photo of something that represents their amazing qualities.

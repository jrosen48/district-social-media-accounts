Veterans Day is observed annually on November 11th and honors military veterans; those who served in the United States Armed Forces.
Veteran's Day means freedom, sacrifice, and honor for those who served in the military. It also means to give thanks to those who served.
While many realize that Veterans Day, which always falls on November 11th, is a day to honor our Veterans, few realize the historical significance behind the day.
Veterans Day originated as Armistice Day and marked the end of hostilities of World War I that occurred at the 11th hour on the 11th day of the 11th month. Therefore, the day is always recognized on November 11th, regardless of the day of the week the 11th falls on.

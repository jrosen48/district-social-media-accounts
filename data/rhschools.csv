Per Gov. Cuomo’s executive order, counting of ballots began at 5 p.m. The process, held in the Rush-Henrietta Senior High School gym, was completed by 10 p.m. Election inspectors trained by the Monroe County Board of Elections participated in the counting of ballots.

Voters also approved Proposition 2 (bus purchase) 4,818 to 1,204, an approval rate of 80 percent. Proposition 3 (capital reserve) also was approved 4,774 to 1,225, likewise with an 80 percent rate of support.

Three incumbent members of the Board of Education were re-elected. They are Jennifer Laird (5,029), Douglas Rivers (4,979), and Diane McBride (4,884).

These are unofficial results. The Board of Education will certify the results at its next meeting.

We thank the community for its continued support!",2020-06-16 22:22:25,,

Today we will get to know some of our students. Each spring, 12th graders at Rush-Henrietta Senior High School make important decisions that will help guide their future.

Rush-Henrietta band director puts together ‘virtual concert band’",7.0,"Senior High School band director Scott Cannan has been learning some new skills! He put together a virtual concert piece using complex audio and video editing software, and the results are spectacular! Cannan contacted more than a dozen other music teachers, and they provided the various parts - several of them playing multiple instruments. Joining Cannan from Rush-Henrietta are Brett Chipman, Sean Joseph, David Kluge, and Heather Mate. Cannan edited all of the submitted recordings into a performance of ""Salvation is Created."" This is a wonderful example of using this time to learn new skills and find ways to stay connected with others!

Welcome to the Superintendent’s Challenge!

To encourage students to remain actively engaged in a variety of learning experiences, Superintendent Bo Wright will be posting different challenges that appeal to all ages. These challenges will ask students to explore, think, write, and connect (safely) with others. Students - or their parents - can post a picture or description in the comments to show how they are handling the challenge! (There may even be a surprise for those who participate!)

Challenge #1: Make up new rules to a favorite board or card game and teach it to your family. What game did you choose? What new rule did you create? Did it make the game more fun? Tell us about it in the comments! Let's see what you can come up with by the end of the day on Thursday, April 2!",0.0,"Don't forget to share those game rules with us today!

Universal Prekindergarten students in the afternoon sessions at Good Shepherd were treated to a special weather presentation by 13-WHAM Meteorologist Scott Hetsko on Tuesday, Feb. 25. He talked to them about different kinds of weather and even made a cloud in a bottle to demonstrate how clouds form. The classes were amazed by videos he showed of past blizzards in Rochester and were eager to share what they like to do in snow. They were a little disappointed to learn that today’s weather was going to be more wind than snow!",0.0,"Rush-Henrietta CSD added 19 new photos.

Tuesday, Feb. 25, marked the 100th day of school in Rush-Henrietta! There were many celebrations at our elementary schools, including Fyle Elementary, which marked the occasion with fun, engaging activities throughout the day. Teachers planned 100-themed activities such as building a tower out of 100 cups and creating bridges with 100 toothpicks and 100 marshmallows. Fyle also won a beautiful 100th day lawn sign from Card My Yard, which was set up to welcome students in the morning. Everyone had a blast getting great class photos with the sign as well as with the special 100th day photo booth. It was a great day filled with fun, learning, and laughter!",0.0,"Rush-Henrietta CSD added 62 new photos.

In the seven years that Parker has been bowling, he has had five career 300 games! In fact, two of those games have happened this season on the varsity bowling team. A 300 means that the bowler has bowled 12 strikes in a row—a perfect game.

As a freshman, Parker broke the Rush-Henrietta bowling record with a 764 series, and was named to the All-Greater Rochester and first-team All Monroe County Boys Bowling teams. After this last match of the 2020 season, he now holds the new record with an 805 series. Shown here with coach Brian Usselman, he has led the Rush-Henrietta bowling team to two victories at the Section VI Buffalo Invitational tournament. Overall, Parker has held a 228 bowling average through hard work and dedication to the sport.

Way to go, Parker!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1217010218492346&id=240572629469448,,0.0,"For Rush-Henrietta Senior High School’s Parker Hoyt, bowling is more than a fun game.

In an effort to process absence notes more efficiently you will now send absences notes in one of the following ways:

Written note – Written notes from parents or doctor notes should be delivered to Mr. Boyce or Ms. Chance’s office. Teachers will not be responsible for collecting absence notes. Be sure your student understands this new procedure.
Email – You may find it more convenient to send an absence note via email. If you are able you can also scan doctor notes into an email and send to the school. The email address for sending an absence note is attendance@richardsisd.net

Absence notes should include the students name and the date/s of the absence.

As a reminder please get absence notes turned in as quickly as possible. A student’s absence is considered unexcused until an absence note is received. To prevent your student from having unexcused absences be sure to send a note every time they miss school (partial days included).",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=803515186440823&id=591889344270076,,0.0,"TO ALL PARENTS/GUARDIANS OF RICHARDS ISD STUDENTS:

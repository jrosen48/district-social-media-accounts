Howell County Health Department is now scheduling back to school immunizations for the 2020-2021 school year. We encourage parents to get students scheduled now for the summer months. Waiting until the end of summer when appointment slots are already full may mean missed class time for an appointment after the start of school. We are also spacing immunization appointments out through May and June to decrease waiting room congestion.
Students entering kindergarten will be required to be up to date on their Dtap, Polio, MMR and Varicella. Eighth graders need to have a current Tdap and Meningococcal and Twelfth graders will also need a Meningococcal booster depending on the age they were with their previous dose.
For an appointment or questions regarding vaccinations or Missouri requirements, please call to speak with a nurse. We do ask that you bring a current immunization record to your appointment.

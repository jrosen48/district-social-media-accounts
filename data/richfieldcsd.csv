Last year, both science classes created rockets that they launched using baking soda and vinegar. This year was a little different because Miss Wallace was not able to be with her class to watch her students create and launch their rockets😢 HOWEVER! Many of her sixth grade students and their families helped make and launch their rockets at home!! Thank you to the 6th graders and their families for helping and sending the pictures and videos of the rockets! (Videos will be posted separately on this page)

May 23 at 7:58 PM ·

Please mark your calendars and join us as we celebrate the class of 2020 next Friday, 5/29 beginning at 6:00 p.m. with a village parade!

Seniors will be meeting at the firehouse and will be following the fire truck(s) on a short route through the village and ending at the school.

We hope to fill the parking lot with parents and staff members, and the streets with our supportive community members- appropriately socially distancing from inside our cars.

As students progress through the bus loop in their cars, we have a little special something planned.

Seniors, staff and community members are encouraged to decorate their cars, make signs, etc.

Let’s do this up great so our seniors can add this to their list of 2020 memories!!

Attention Senior Students, Parents, and Family Members...

We have received many questions regarding graduation.
While we have not made any ""formal"" plans for this, as we are waiting for a directive from the Governor, we HAVE been working on a few things to show you how much we care!

1. We have ordered 2x4 ft banners of each senior's senior photo for the lamp posts to line Main Street. These will likely be up by the end of May.

2. We have ordered lawn signs (one for each parent- max 2 per family) of each senior also. These will likely be available by the end of May also.

3. We have a preliminary, socially distant appropriate, graduation plan in the works. We will share more specifics about this as we are given more specifics from our Governor. Please be assured, YOU WILL BE RECOGNIZED!!

4. Last, please remember this... ""The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance."" ~Alan Watts

Dozens of students from across the region attended Women in Tech camp at MOBOCES today. The MORIC Model Schools team puts this event on for area 4th-8th grade girls. Today's special guest was WKTV Newschannel 2 Meteorologist Jill Reale , who showed the girls how to develop a forecast and use a green screen! Jill is also a fitness instructor and led the girls in a couple of dance routines during the day! It is safe to say they had a great day. Thanks, Jill! #techcamp #steam",0.0,"Madison-Oneida BOCES

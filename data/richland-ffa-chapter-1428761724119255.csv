Dairy farmers have been faced with a period of exceptionally low milk prices while the cost of their inputs has remaind the same or increased. This period has caused many dairy farms to sell their cows and farms that have been in their families for generations.

The 10 Gallon Challenge is simple. There is a surplus of milk on the shelves which is driving prices down. The challenge is to purchase 10 gallons of milk from a local grocery store and donate to a local food pantry. Our donation is benefitting our local Good Samaritan.

We are directly challenging the following FFA groups (but encourage everyone to join the challenge):

Stoutland-FFA
Willow Springs Ffa
Crocker Ag Ed
Waynesville FFA
Couch FFA

Lets make this go viral and spread to FFA chapters across the nation to support dairy farmers and our local communities

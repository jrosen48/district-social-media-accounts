The Richland School Board is pleased to announce that Dr. Shelley Redinger, a veteran educator with deep roots in the Richland School District community, will be the district’s next superintendent.

The Board hired Dr. Redinger, who has spent the past eight years as superintendent of Spokane Public Schools and has served in that role in two other districts, during its June 23 board meeting. Board members say they are excited to have an educator of Dr. Redinger’s caliber taking the helm of the district beginning Aug. 1.

“Shelley checks all the boxes of what our community told us they wanted in the next superintendent,” says Board President Rick Jansons. “We found her to be warm and a good listener, with a track record of success in the districts she previously led. She is an innovative leader, who builds trust through authenticity, sincerity and humility. She has demonstrated the ability to collaboratively implement change for continuous improvement.”

Community members Jenny Rodriguez and Emily Lippes stopped by our Nutrition Services office this morning and handed checks totaling $2,000 from themselves, Ms. Rodriguez's partner Brian Lawenda, Mrs. Lippes' husband David and Ted & Tina Miller to Field Supervisor Wendy Marske & secretary Julie Soderquist for our Super Hero Lunch Fund covering negative meal account balances at our schools. The ladies said they were inspired by the recent donation of Richland Councilman Phil Lemley.

On top of that, a check for $500 from a community member and bearing the simple note of ""Re: lunch debts"" came with our mail delivery today.

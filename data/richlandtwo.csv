And last week, our staff presented a $2500 check and 2500 N-95 masks to Principal Stacey Franklin. He was blown away by the generosity of our church!

To inspire, to inform, and to learn are Kromuel Alcantara's goals as he continues his program being an international teacher from the Philippines here in the United States. He earned a Bachelor's Degree in Secondary Education major in English from the University of Southern Mindanao, Philippines, a Master's Degree in Language Teaching-English, and is currently pursuing a Doctorate in Education major in English in the same university. In his tenth year of teaching, Mr. Alcantara will be teaching 7th Grade English Language Arts at Summit Parkway Middle School.

Messages like this, about our awesome Bethel-Hanberry Elementary crew, make it all worth it.

""I just had to take some time this evening to tell you about your amazing staff. Because my children insist on eating lunch from home I gave it no thought of getting the lunches provided by the district during this closure. One of my neighbors encouraged me to get it anyway to help me not have to prepare lunches every day. I have always been blessed to work from home, but working from home with [four children] was no picnic. I started going and it became my daily getaway driving to the school. Mrs. Helen and Mr. Carl were exceptional sights to see every day. For me they provided more than lunches. They provided friendly adult conversation, smiles in their eyes behind the mask and a laugh. They were doing more than their job, they were instilling kindness in a way the world could learn from at a time like this. These people have been my front line heroes, my essential workers and I appreciate them so much!""",4.0,"Richland School District Two Nutrition - Sodexo

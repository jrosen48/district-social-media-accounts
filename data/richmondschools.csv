Had the privilege today of attending my nieces Graduation Moment today! I used the word ""Moment"" because that is what it was.

But it was her ""Moment"" and our ""Moment"" to see her go across the stage and receive what she worked so hard for. Her parents were there, her grandparents were there, her family were there, others who influenced her were there, and the staff of Richmond High School were there.

In all her glory she was given a Moment to share this great accomplishment with the people who cared and supported her through the journey.

Was it perfect? I have to say yes it was, given the restrictions placed on schools it was perfect! The staff worked tirelessly to make it perfect. The staff rallied around these high school graduates like they were their own children.

People seem to always head to the computer when they are unhappy, we need more people sharing why and what makes them happy about a person, place, or thing.

Perfect Circle Credit Union generously donated Fire 7 tablets to help out with some of our students who do not have devices for get extended learning done. Thank you so much to PCCU. They had planned to sponsor a field trip for us this year, but when plans changed they still chose to back us. They are phenomenal! Mrs. Plank will be distributing these devices to some families on Monday after they are set up. Calls will be made to the families who are receiving the tablets. @weRrichmond #fairviewlions

P.S. I can't believe that some come with Mrs. Plank's face as the wallpaper. :)",2020-05-01 18:18:19,,

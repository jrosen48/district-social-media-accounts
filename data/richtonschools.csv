Next week is Teacher Appreciation week! As many of us have recently realized, teaching students is a hard job, and we're working with just a few. The Richton Dispatch would like to recognize all the great teachers we in the county. Teachers work hard throughout the school year, as well as preparing lessons on breaks and over the summer. Teachers help students work through life lessons, not just classroom instruction. And many teachers keep up with students long after they have moved on from the class. It takes a big heart to step into the classroom, and while they do not expect praise, they certainly deserve it. We'd like to show Richton and Perry County teachers how much they mean to their students and how much they are appreciated.

The safety of students and test center staff is our top priority. We have rescheduled the April 4 national test date across the U.S. in response to concerns about the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19).

All students registered for the April 4 test date will receive an email in the next few days informing them of the postponement and instructions for free rescheduling to June 13 or a future national test date.

The parade included a “float” about their books and a blurb that was read over the hall intercom containing a summary, question hinting to the solution (ending of the book), and a call to action in order to persuade the second graders in attendance to read their book.

During the unit, each group read the assigned book, completed a “job” (predictor, summarizer, vocabulary finder, or question generator) for each chapter, held a book discussion, and then evaluated each member’s performance of their job for each chapter.",4.0,"Mrs. Hudson's Class is with Janna Freeman.

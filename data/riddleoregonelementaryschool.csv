If you are uncomfortable sending your K-3 student to school, please let us know at registration (August 17 and 18) and alternative learning options will be provided. Grades 4-12 will be through distance learning and will be more comprehensive than last spring. Daily attendance will be required, and grades will be traditional letter scale. The State has allowed us to do some limited, in-person instruction for students with critical needs, in small cohorts, for a limited time each week. We will be delaying the start of school until September 14th so that our staff can get everything set up. We will be reviewing our status monthly to determine if in-person re-opening is possible.

It is so encouraging to see all the student work returning to our schools. This is just a ""Riddle Reminder"" for students to write their names on their work so teachers can give credit for late work or extra credit assignments. Additionally, for the supplemental work, we'd like to provide feedback to our students. We are here for you. Please contact your teacher if you have questions about any of your assignments. We are here to help! We also like hearing from our students. Win-win!",0.0,"Riddle School District

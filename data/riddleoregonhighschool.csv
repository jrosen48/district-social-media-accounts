Grades 4-12 will be through distance learning and will be more comprehensive than last spring. Daily attendance will be required, and grades will be traditional letter scale. The State has allowed us to do some limited, in-person instruction for students with critical needs, in small cohorts, for a limited time each week. We will be delaying the start of school until September 14th so that our staff can get everything set up. We will be reviewing our status monthly to determine if in-person re-opening is possible.

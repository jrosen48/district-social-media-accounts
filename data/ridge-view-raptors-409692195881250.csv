Calhoun County is currently classified as a COVID ""hot spot"". Because of this, our school in conjunction with Calhoun County public health, have decided to implement the attached precautions for this weekend's JV volleyball tournament. Please get this information to your fans, JV volleyball players, and coaches immediately so that they can come prepared.

These precautions are only for the JV tournament in Lake City because of the smaller gym and the limited potential for social distancing. If your varsity team is playing in Rockwell City, masks are strongly encouraged but not required. The middle school has a much greater seating capacity and the opportunity to social distance is much greater.

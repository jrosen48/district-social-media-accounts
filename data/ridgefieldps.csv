Greetings Faculty and Families,

There were many special events this week, I feel privileged to have been a part of them. This week ended with a beautiful culmination of the virtual RHS graduation. If you are not a parent of a Senior, you can still enjoy the moment by watching the video here: http://ridgefield-hs.stageclip.com/

I have made a point to grab an extra cup of coffee this week in Ridgefield to get to know the community a bit. Ridgefield is a special place.

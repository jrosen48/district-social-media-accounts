Is your child interested in participating in a Ridgeline sports team? Cross Country running is a sport in which teams and individuals run a race on open-air courses over natural terrain such as dirt or grass. Whether your child has a passion for running, or just wants to get in shape for another sport, cross country is a great sport that pushes the body to its limits. 4th Grade races are 1 mile, middle-school races are 1.5 miles, and high school races are 3.1 miles, so in order to prepare, we will run anywhere from 1-6 miles at practices. Practices will be both on and off school campus. Races will typically take place on Saturday mornings, but could be another day (the schedule is not yet complete).

If your child is interested in participating or even just trying it out to see how they like it, please use the google form to sign them up. Please contact Coach Toussaint with any questions: btoussaint@ridgleineacademy.org

""Some people saw the title and thought, “Yeah right. There’s just no way. You haven’t been to my house. You don’t know my kids.”

""I am just one of the latest work-at-home dads who is amazed at just how much activity, noise, and energy can be expended by my co-inhabitants. Who are the co-inhabitants? Two daughters (7 & 13), 5 sons (ages 5 months – 11 yrs), 1 wife (can’t put her age, it’s a violation of the code). That’s eight other people. Noise is the default. Not having some quiet time is not an option either. Otherwise, I’m really gonna lose my mind.

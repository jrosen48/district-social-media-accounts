Today's highlight is Abigail Penhorwood. Her skills lie in her ability to make innovative and novel text-to-text connections. Her connections and anlayses provide fellow readers with new layers of understanding.

With so many cancellations of activities and events, it could be easy for our members to focus on what they won't get to experience. Luckily, Ridgemont students are using their new found time to discover hobbies, learn new skills, and help those around them! We have decided to highlight what our students have been doing to make the most of the time that they have been given!

Gage, Linkyn, and Prezley Furer have been using the Ridgemont ag department's Ultimaker 3D printer to make medical face shields for essential workers in our community. They are going to donate these masks to the Ridgeway Fire Department and are hoping to be able to donate to other local organizations.

On one particular play, she secured the rebound but in doing so encountered an opponent bouncing off of her and innocently falling to the floor. This Gopher, while grasping the live ball took a step to bend over, offer a hand and help up the uninjured but shaken girl to her feet. Then, simply handed the ball to their point guard to take up the floor and start the offense. Sure...... did she travel? I didn't blow the whistle......I saw more than that extra ""step"".

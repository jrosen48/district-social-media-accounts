Puffy Sidewalk Chalk Paint

1 cup flour
1 cup water
1 tablespoon dish soap – just about any dish soap will work.
5-10 drops food coloring or washable paint

How to Make Sidewalk Chalk Paint
In a large mixing bowl stir together the flour and water until there are no lumps.
Stir in the dish soap to the flour mixture.
Add food coloring of your choice of color until the desired color is achieved.
Pour the mixture into your squeeze bottle.
Give the kids their new sidewalk paint and let them have fun!
Use up the paint on the same day you make it, this recipe doesn’t save well… it will explode if you leave it closed.
If you are making multiple colors, make each color in a different bowl or one at a time and pour into the bottles and then make the next color.

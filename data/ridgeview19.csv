He works hard to know staff and students. Mr. Hutley wears many hats throughout the day and year. He is eager and willing to learn new things and tries to share that with staff. He helps teachers and staff problem solve situations and then does what is best for students. Mr. Hutley is an awesome principal at Ridgeview Elementary! We appreciate him!""",2019-10-23 13:49:16,,

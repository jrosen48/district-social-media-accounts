This year, of course, the film festival had to move the show online, and it debuted on June 2nd on YouTube. While nothing compares to the experience of seeing a film on the big screen, the silver lining is that the YouTube page has gotten more than 3,000 views in comparison to the 180 viewers typically present in the audience at the theatre.

Like many other treasured events in the district, these concerts were canceled due to the extraordinary times we are facing. Through any crisis, we must find a way to continue moving forward. While our music teachers miss experiencing their art with their students in the classroom, they have adjusted their instruction for remote learning. Below is one example of what this looks like.

Under the direction of Mr. Bourque, the entire RHS choir is featured in a video performance of ""Baba Yetu,"" which would have been performed in the April 2nd concert. The film was edited by choir member James Harkins.

Please enjoy this amazing video! We are certain it will lift your spirits.

Ridgewood High School ""Baba Yetu"" Virtual Choir",10.0,"One of the highlights of the year for our high school music students is being able to perform their spring concerts at West Side Presbyterian Church, a beautiful venue to showcase their hard work and talent. Like many other treasured events in the district, these concerts were canceled due to the extraordinary times we are facing. Through any crisis, we must find a way to continue moving forward. While our music teachers miss experiencing their art with their students in the classroom, they have adjusted their instruction for remote learning. Below is one example of what this looks like.

Under the direction of Mr. Bourque, the entire RHS choir is featured in a video performance of ""Baba Yetu,"" which would have been performed in the April 2nd concert. The film was edited by choir member James Harkins.

Please enjoy this amazing video! We are certain it will lift your spirits.

It reminds us that we are not a nation of data, but one of thinkers, creators and innovators; that we suffer defeats and tragedies; and that we can rise from these setbacks to face each day courageously.

Please join us for an ""An Evening with Dianne Grossman"" tomorrow at 7:00 p.m. in the George Washington Middle School auditorium. This event has been generously sponsored by the Village of Ridgewood Fire Department.

Dianne Grossman, founder of Mallory's Army®, will be providing two student assemblies for 7th and 8th grade students at Benjamin Franklin Middle School and George Washington Middle School.

Bergen County Mosquito Control Spraying

Dear Parents and Guardians,

Weather permitting, Bergen County Mosquito Control will be spraying early tomorrow morning, October 2, to reduce the number of nuisance and vector mosquitoes in our area. County officials feel that this spraying is a necessary intervention. They plan to be finished by 6 a.m. but have given themselves a two-hour buffer in the event of unforeseen circumstances that may arise.

I know this news is the cause of some concern. If you feel it is necessary to delay your child from coming to school tomorrow due to the timing of the spray application, please feel free to do so.

I am sorry for this delayed notification, but we were just informed of the spraying on Monday when schools were closed.

Thank you in advance for your understanding during this unusual circumstance.

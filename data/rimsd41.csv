Today, the Riveters organized and boxed up our donations from our I Support the Girls Drive and Bra Haha. Our goal was to get 1000 items to donate.

At the end, we counted 449 bras and 12,991 feminine products. We are overwhelmed by the support from our Rocky community for this project! The Riveters are excited to make our donations to the Thurgood Marshall Closet and the Rocky Resource Room! ❤️💛

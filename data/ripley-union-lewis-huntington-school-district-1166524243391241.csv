Welcome to our new STAFF SPOTLIGHT feature! We'd like to introduce our new Cedar Unit Manager, Glenda Huff. Glenda started her OVM career with our Home Health team in 2018. Her favorite thing about working at OVM is ""taking care of the patients and providing the care they need."" Outside of OVM, she adores spending time with her family - especially her 10 grandchildren and 1 great-grandchild.

Welcome to our new STAFF SPOTLIGHT feature! We'd like to introduce our new Cedar Unit Manager, Glenda Huff. Glenda started her OVM career with our Home Health team in 2018. Her favorite thing about working at OVM is ""taking care of the patients and providing the care they need."" Outside of OVM, she adores spending time with her family - especially her 10 grandchildren and 1 great-grandchild. Although she lived briefly out -of-state, Glenda says Ripley ""called me back"" and she values being able to live and work in her hometown community. #healthcarehero #OVM",2020-06-05 16:10:46,,

In all the hoopla of graduation celebrations, there's one individual we neglected to honor. Nigel Royal (on the right and pictured here with his classmate Montrez Mcgill) has been visiting OVM since he was a small child. In addition to his weekly visits on behalf of the Ripley Bee, Nigel would regularly assist with church services and Bible Study. He and his family provided presents to many of our residents during the holidays and would entertain them with a Christmas concert each year. Over time, he has developed special friendships with several members of our OVM community and his frequent drop-ins will be missed. We wish this young man the very best and appreciate all he has done to enrich the lives of our OVM family. Good luck and thank you, Nigel! #Classof2020 #OVM #RULH",0.0,"OVM - Ohio Valley Manor

However, I would like to announce the winners of this year's Alumni Association Scholarships:
$500 - Jacob Castle
$500 - Carly Wagner

Congratulations to both recipients and to the Class of 2020. You will have memories like no other.",2020-05-16 19:31:20,,

We were so pleased to have many students interested in competing. All of the interested students were amazing, deserving students. We sincerely wish we could send them all! To choose the two representatives, we looked at students' language arts and spelling performance for the first three quarters of the school year. All students were high achievers and truly deserving, but we had to narrow it down to only four. So, without further delay, we are thrilled to announce that Mallory Spiller, Bryston Tharp, Anshika Singh and Kenny Graves will be competing in the Ohio State Fair 4-H Spelling Bee on August 1, 2020.

ATTENTION Parents of Elementary Students!!
As we wrap up the last two weeks of packet/online learning... please know that the teachers, staff (and Mrs. Marshall) greatly appreciate every single effort that our families, and especially our students, have taken to continue school assignments from home. It has been such a unexpected ending to a year that was supposed to be #bestyearever! I hope you can think back on all the good times with a big smile!",0.0,"RULH Elementary School is thinking about all the good times.

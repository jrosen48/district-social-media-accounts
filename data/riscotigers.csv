The superintendents of all New Madrid County Schools: Risco, Gideon, Portageville and New Madrid County R-1 have collaborated and decided to follow the federal guidelines and extend our closure through April 30, 2020, with the current plan to return Friday, May 1 if possible.

We will continue feeding students with a Monday and Wednesday pick up time (between 11:00-12:00), resuming April 6th. We will also be providing a variety of educational opportunities for students during this time. You will recieve more information towards the end of the week about our online learning platform.

Again, there is no higher priority than the safety of our students and community. Although there are no reported cases in our county, the rising number of cases surrounding us is concerning. We will continually update you with the most recent information and changes.

Sincerely,

The superintendents of all New Madrid County Schools: Risco, Gideon, Portageville and New Madrid County R-1 have collaborated and decided to follow the federal guidelines and extend our closure through April 30, 2020, with the current plan to return Friday, May 1 if possible.

We will continue feeding students with a Monday and Wednesday pick up time (between 11:00-12:00), resuming April 6th. We will also be providing a variety of educational opportunities for students during this time. You will recieve more information towards the end of the week about our online learning platform.

Again, there is no higher priority than the safety of our students and community. Although there are no reported cases in our county, the rising number of cases surrounding us is concerning. We will continually update you with the most recent information and changes.

Sincerely,
Dr. Amy Baker",2020-03-31 12:24:05,,

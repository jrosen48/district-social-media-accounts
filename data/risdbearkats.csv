A friendly reminder: Students will be taking their state assessments during this week.

Please have your child get plenty of rest, arrive on time to school, eat breakfast, and encourage a “can do” attitude. Remember, NO electronic devices are permitted during testing.

Thank you for supporting this important event as these state assessments are an essential component of your child’s overall performance record.

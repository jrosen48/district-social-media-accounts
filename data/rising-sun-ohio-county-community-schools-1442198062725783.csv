March 4 at 10:05 AM · Evansville, IN ·

With the CASPA opening rapidly approaching, we want to introduce you to some more faces of UEPA! First up, Ashley Vecchiola! A Rising Sun, IN native,
Ashley got her Bachelor’s in Biology at Northern Kentucky University.

What made you want to be a PA?
I loved the flexibility of the career, since I am interested in multiple specialties. I also really liked that the career allows for more interactions with patients.

Why UEPA? Or what makes UEPA different than other PA Programs?
UEPA felt like the right choice for me since the very start. I love that this program is striving to create not only competent providers, but also compassionate and empathetic providers, as I feel like these are very important traits that providers often lack. Also, our professors and faculty are very invested in us, our well-being, and our success.

We are so grateful to have Ashley in the UEPA Family! 💜 #pastudent #physicianassistantstudent #futurepa #futurephysicianassistant #paschool #family #physicianassistant @ University of Evansville Physician Assistant Program",0.0,"University of Evansville Physician Assistant Program is with Ashley Vecchiola at University of Evansville Physician Assistant Program.

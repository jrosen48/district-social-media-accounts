Please don’t make your kids sit at the kitchen table and do worksheets all day because that is NOT what they are doing all day at school. Take this time to develop social and emotional skills. Here is a great list of activities to do with your children. So many of these activities are beneficial for physical, social, and cognitive development!

We at JDCF are taking the Covid-19 precautions very seriously. We have cancelled our upcoming indoor gatherings and we are following CDC protocols to protect ourselves and our community.

But we do have something valuable to offer those feeling trapped indoors! We invite you to practice social distancing while enjoying one of our preserves that are open dawn to dusk. Take the kids to Horseshoe Mound Preserve and experience the Children's Adventure found there. Grab the dog and head down the Galena River Trail to Buehler Preserve. Pack your binoculars for a morning birding expedition to the Valley of Eden Bird Sanctuary. Enjoy a picnic in the prairie at the Wapello Reserve. Learn about native trees on a self-guided tour at Schurmeier Teaching Forest. View the mighty Mississippi River at Casper Bluff. Over 700 acres await!",0.0,"Jo Daviess Conservation Foundation

Thank you for a wonderful start to the new school year!
We recognize that learning in a remote environment is a new normal for some of you. We realize that you may have been experiencing problems with videos playing inside of Google Classroom. This is a problem that is easily fixed by following these steps on your Chromebook.

1. Click on the video assigned.
2. Click on the 'play' button in the center of the video. IF it does not work or does not play, then move your cursor to the top of the screen on the upper right-hand corner. Click on the download button. (This is a small icon with an arrow pointing down)
3. This will begin to download to the bottom of the screen.
4. After finished, you will need to click ""Show In Folder.""
5. Find your video and play it.

We are confident that once your child is shown how to download the videos, they will become instant pros!

As always, if you are experiencing technical difficulties contact your child's school.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1685654741605625&id=367798316724614,,0.0,"Hello Remote Parents and Students,

Even though we have 58 Kindergarteners, we have 6 Math Teams with around 10 kids in each group (those who work quicker may have more, and those who need more support have less than 10), which makes for better learning opportunities for our students! Here is one of the groups breaking apart 8 into different parts and writing number sentences to match!

For those wondering how we do this:

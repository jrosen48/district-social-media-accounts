We took last week off for the holidays, but this week we're back with our next top 15 favorite project, in celebration of our 15 years in business! #RiverdaleGradeSchool was completed in 2010 in partnership with Mahlum and Riverdale School District.

The pre-existing Riverdale Grade School was designed by renowned Portland-based architect A.E. Doyle, and #Bremik worked closely with the project team and community during design to determine if it would be more economical and sustainable long-term to renovate the building or to start from scratch. After much deliberation and many conversations, it was determined that it would be better to build a new school.

To honor the grade school's architectural heritage despite starting anew, a lot of attention was given to replicating some of the unique features of A.E. Doyle's original design. The final building achieved #LEEDGold certification and boasts 24 classrooms, a media center, administrative offices, and a 4,000 SF multi-purpose room.",0.0,"Thank you for the great work!

The rating for the District’s general obligation limited tax debt (GOLT) has been upgraded from Aa2 to Aa1.

The strong credit rating is the result of several factors including the District’s strong financial operations and reserves that are based on robust fund balances and liquidity with little exposure to Illinois’ pension funding challenges; Limited debt and pension burdens with no plans for future debt obligations; and forward looking financial planning combined with a moderate institutional framework.

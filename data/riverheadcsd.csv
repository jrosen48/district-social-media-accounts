“I encouraged students to not be afraid to experiment, express themselves and be creative through the song building process,” said Crespo. “A lot of my students have excelled using GarageBand.”

We ask that every family and business in the Riverhead School District take 20 seconds to recognize our senior athletes by flickering their lights on and off and by making as much noise as possible by yelling, ringing cow bells, blowing air horns, or honking car horns, so the athletes can feel the love of the community. The school district will also be posting a tribute on Social Media at 20:20. Please share with all family and friends. Thank you! #ThisIsRiverhead",2020-04-30 20:11:34,,

The project was formed after Peconic Bay Medical Center put out a call for photos to present to their patients and staff. Studio photo art teachers Jo-Ann Dellaposta and Selena Pagliarulo saw this as a perfect opportunity for students to contribute to a good cause while honing their skills.

“Through this project, students were able to use the photography skills they learned in class to show their gratitude to those most affected by this pandemic,” said Pagliarulo. “Hopefully, their efforts have brightened someone’s day.”

The students sent their photos to their teachers, who then had them printed and sent to Peconic Bay Medical Center.

Those in grades K-4 are working on a variety of creative interdisciplinary projects.

Among the lessons, kindergartners have created drawings inspired by the work of author Mo Willems, first graders designed “Under the Sea” collages that highlight the elements of art and space, second graders worked on contour line drawings, third graders drew their bedrooms after taking a virtual field trip to Van Gogh’s Museum, and fourth graders created mixed media self-portraits with a focus on proportion.

“It is so important for students to remain engaged in art,” said art teacher Melissa Haupt. “I am so proud of their creativeness, resolve and love of art.”

A Riverhead Middle School staff member has self-notified the district they have tested positive for COVID-19. As we noted yesterday, the Department of Health will initiate any close contact tracing and notification.

With the increase in testing, the district anticipates additional positive of cases within the Riverhead Central School District community. As our district buildings have been closed since March 13, moving forward, the district will no longer be sending out notification for individual cases.

Please remember to heed the advice of health professionals, including:
• Washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
• Avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth
• Staying home when you are sick
• Covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue and then throw the tissue in the garbage
• Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces
• Maintaining social distancing by keeping at least six feet between you and others when out in public

The student-led initiative aims to promote social skills and inclusion by empowering students to ensure that no one is excluded socially from mealtime bonding. Students were also encouraged to reach out to peers who may not have a playmate at recess. To head up the mission, the school appointed team captains – students who were charged with making sure that no one at their lunch table or during recess felt alone. The day culminated with a library lesson on social isolation and tolerance.

“Students shared stories from their past that were heartbreaking,” said library media specialist Amelia Creedon. “We want school to be a place of learning, but also a place of love.”

“Here at Pulaski, we don’t want any student to feel left out, lonely or invisible,” added Principal Patrick Burke.

Throughout the day, the guidance department encouraged students to share kind words by writing them on Post-it notes that were displayed throughout the school. Similarly, at the middle school, students were given Post-its to write positive messages to their peers and place them on their lockers.

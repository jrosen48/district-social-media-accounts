Christian works tirelessly with his River Road kids and goes above and beyond to make visiting Athletic Trainers comfortable and have what they need when they visit River Road. Christian is also a great father and husband, taking care of his wife and 5 kids. Christian has not only had to take care of his own athletes during this time of COVID-19, but also himself sustaining a knee injury of his own that required surgery. Christian has and always will do all he can to take care of his own and any athletes that are playing at River Road that needs his assistance. Christian has also been involved with getting his athletes back involved with strength and conditioning, etc., now that the athletes can get back to working out. Christian is a gentleman and professional that we could all aspire to be more like.

As you are probably now aware, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered all Texas schools to close for two weeks. The order takes effect from midnight March 20 until midnight April 3. River Road ISD leaders are busy adjusting plans we had already begun developing for next week. Those plans will include opportunities for students who need meals to receive them and providing continued instruction for students at home through paper and online platforms. The governing body over school districts, the Texas Education Agency, has instructed schools to continue with instruction for students, but obviously it will look different than ever before. With the announcement of this executive order, many things are unclear for school districts like RRISD, but we are seeking guidance from the state and we will be communicating more info in the coming days as it becomes available.

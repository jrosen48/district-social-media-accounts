If you have already turned in your child's Chromebook you do not need to worry about this post.

We would like to extend an offer to our Bulldog Families to use the school Chromebooks over the summer of 2020. In order for this to happen we will need for you to acknowledge that you have the Chromebooks and verify that you understand that you are responsible for any damage or loss of the Chromebook or its parts. Please check your email for access to the form to submit student names, family contact information and select that you understand about damages and loss.

We will be having a drop off night in Carson on Wednesday, May 27, 4:00 p.m. - 6:00 p.m. where you can drop off any library books and Chromebooks. We are looking at other nights and locations for drop off other than food distribution so stay tuned.

Any Chromebooks not returned by Monday, June 1 or have not submitted the form to keep the Chromebook, will be locked and become unusable.

Any questions can be directed to Mr. Meek, jmeek@riverside.k12.ia.us.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3622893801059127&id=561398313875373,,0.0,"Riverside Students & Families!!

Riverside Community School District

Will we be offering Driver Education this Summer?

Yes--the district will offer Driver Education this Summer-we are waiting for final guidance from the Iowa Department of Transportation and Iowa Department of Education. We are told that this joint guidance will be distributed soon.

Will we have Prom, Spring Sports, Club Activities, or Summer Sports?

Due to the extended closure, the earliest we would start sports or other activities would be June 10, 2020. Spring sports have been cancelled by the Athletic Associations for this year. We will not schedule any summer sports, summer workouts/practices, activities until we have guidance that indicates we can resume these activities safely.

Even though learning has looked different over the last four weeks, opportunities have still been provided for students. Because of this, the State of Iowa has approved or forgiven these days, and the days moving forward.

We will plan on ending the school year on the regularly scheduled dismissal date of May 22, 2020. Our focus will then switch to planning for our students' return.

The original plan that the seniors came up with was a hybrid graduation on May 17 at 2:00 pm. For this option, graduates/family (Graduate plus 2 parents/guardians) would drive up to the school and be ushered into the school and across the stage per Governor Reynolds social distancing guidelines. The ceremony would be broadcast live on Facebook and the radio. We would also record the graduation for a video at a later date. Thank you for completing this survey. We will compile data, and make a graduation decision by May 4, 2020.

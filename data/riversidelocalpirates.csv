She is on track to single handily sew over a hundred by Friday. Xienna says sewing is a huge stress reliever, especially now, because she can DO something meaningful.

Lady Pirate Dora Bryant #9
Daughter of John Bryant and Hollie Pope.
Words from Coach Phelps:
Dora has played softball for Riverside since Junior High. She has fought through some adversity, but has come back strong this year and I am happy to have her on the softball team. Dora will be playing infield this year for the softball program. I look for her to be a strong leader for the younger girls and I have no doubt she will be awesome at it. I wish her all the luck in her future goals and I am happy that I have had the pleasure to get to know and coach Dora!

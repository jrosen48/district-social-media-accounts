We are still in need of current Senior picture and baby pictures for the Senior Slideshow. An Infinite Campus email was sent out last week with a link to the list of who still needs to submit photos.

This Slideshow is extremely important to the graduation process this year and it does not share photos with the yearbook. For more information, please contact Jaime McIntyre at jaime.mcintyre@riversideschools.net.

Also, the Senior Class Council is putting together a Senior Showcase to feature what is next for our graduating class. Want to feature your student's next step? Whether it is college, trade school, the military, or the workforce, we want to celebrate it. Send details of their next step to Rhs.seniorshowcase@riversideschools.net.

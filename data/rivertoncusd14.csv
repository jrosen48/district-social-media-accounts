The Blended Remote Plan released on Monday, July 13 is tentative, fluid, and subject to change. If there are
changes, directives, or new developments from the Illinois or Sangamon County Department of Public Health
and/or the Illinois State Board of Education, our plan will be adjusted accordingly. All changes will be
communicated to families through email, social media, phone calls, and through print media. As we have learned,
our plans could be adjusted at any moment, and everything is day to day. As of now, we are planning on enacting
our Phase 4 plan to begin the school year with students on Monday, August 17.
You can find our full plan on our website at www.rivertonschools.org.

Are we doing parent/teacher conferences like has been discussed before school starts?

Parent-Teacher Conferences will be scheduled before the first day of student attendance on Thursday, August 13 and Friday, August 14 for ALL three schools. Scheduling will be set up through Skyward. Parents will have the option of an in-person conference or a virtual conference. At these meetings, we encourage students to attend along with parents to meet teachers and get set up for success through all phases of learning this school year. This will be an opportunity to gain clarification on what in-person learning will look like in the classroom and to gain knowledge on how to navigate remote learning, should we need to move back to that. This will also serve as a meet your teacher opportunity, as we will not be able to do this in our traditional format. We encourage students and parents at all three buildings to attend. Please be on the lookout in the next week for information on signing up for this.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=4023643777710040&id=379448938796227,,0.0,"FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION

A couple of reminders about parking at RMS:
1. TRAFFIC IS ONE WAY!
2. We have added 4 visitor parking spots (YAY!) in front of the school. Please do not park your car in front of the building without being in a parking spot. This is the fire lane.
3. When picking up in the afternoon, do not park on the curve. This interferes with bus traffic. Please start the line by the light pole by the softball field. The busses do not leave until 2:40. You will not have access to the front of the building until the buses depart.",3.0,"Riverton Middle School

As we look forward to Friday's Homecoming game we are equally excited for the all district pep rallied planned for Friday afternoon.

Buses will load from the elementary school and leave for Correctionville at 2:30 PM. At the close of the pep rally buses will depart from Correctionville for their normal routes. (Expect students to arrive home a few minutes earlier than normal.)

IF YOU PLAN TO PICK YOUR CHILD UP IN CORRECTIONVILLE AFTER THE PEP RALLY, YOU WILL NEED TO EMAIL YOUR CHILD'S HOMEROOM TEACHER BY FRIDAY, AT 11:30 AM.

In the event of inclement weather the pep rally will be cancelled as we cannot guarantee social distancing indoors for all of our district students and staff.

As we have over the past few weeks, we will continue to provide meal services and learning resources for our students. We will have more details on how this will look soon. In the meantime, we wanted to update you on the governor's decision and how it will affect our schools, students and families.

Again, thank you for your patience and understanding as we have navigated this very challenging and uncertain time in the River Valley community. Please continue to practice social distancing and stay at home as much as you can to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community.

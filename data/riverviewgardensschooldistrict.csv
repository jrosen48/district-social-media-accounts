Understandably, students, parents and staff have a lot of questions about how school districts will navigate COVID-19. The webinar was designed to answer some of those questions. Here are six key takeaways:

1) Students, parents and staff should proceed as if everyone will return to school buildings for instruction in the fall.

2) Because this is an evolving situation, students, parents and staff should always be prepared for the possibility of school closures and remote learning.

3) COVID-19 trends over the summer and guidance from public health officials will dictate how school districts proceed in the fall.

4) All districts, including RGSD, have established new cleaning and building entry procedures to account for COVID-19.

5) All districts, including RGSD, are securing masks and gloves for the fall.

6) All districts, including RGSD, are finalizing comprehensive plans for all possible outcomes. As we get closer to the fall, RGSD will share the relevant plan.

Dear RGSD Community,

Today, is officially the last day of the 2019-2020 school year. It was a year to remember! Our district faced unprecedented obstacles due to the coronavirus pandemic. In a matter of days, students, parents and staff had to adjust to full-time remote learning. Our district also had to bridge the technology gap in our community and break barriers to basic needs. During the closure, we distributed thousands of assignment packets and healthy meals to our families. We also shared vital information about emergency resources with the community.

This school year was challenging. However, wherever you find challenges, you will also find heroes committed to overcoming those challenges. The teacher who delivered books to a student. The secretary who passed out meals to families. The parent who became a substitute teacher overnight. And the students who remained excited about learning through unthinkable circumstances. Remember the heroes of the 2019-2020 school year.

I’m disappointed that schools have canceled. It breaks my heart for all seniors who won’t get to go to prom, finish their athletic careers, say good bye to teachers, or walk at graduation.
I’m asking you parents to send me their senior pics post em on this thread because I want to honor them on Today in St Louis.
If you can, have them shoot a shout-out to friends or their school and we’ll include it.
Thank you

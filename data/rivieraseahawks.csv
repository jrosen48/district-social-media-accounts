As you know, we are in the peak of flu season. I urge you to be diligent with hand washing and disinfecting all hard surfaces in your homes. If your child has complaints of headache, fever, body aches, they need to be seen as soon as possible to be tested for Influenza B and be started on therapy as soon as possible.
I also want to ask that if your child is running fever, please do not medicate them and send them to school. They need to be seen by a physician first to rule out any contagious illnesses. If you have any questions or concerns, please, do not hesitate to call my office to discuss.

I just wanted to share a few highlights of this year’s volleyball team’s accomplishments! So far, the ladies have been performing extremely well, for only a month into the season. We started off in early August a bit slow, but immediately picked up the pace and started playing the way we know we can. Tournament season has come to an end and we have done quite well. In the Woodsboro tournament the ladies took 2nd place overall, losing to 4A Alice high school. In the Banquete tournament this year, we faced some tough competition beating Odem, and Beeville. We eventually lost Consolation to Annapolis Christian Academy. I am super proud of the girls and the way they have been playing.

The Freshmen and JV girls are competitors and are coming along great. The future of Riviera Volleyball looks Awesome!

We take on Benavides tonight starting with the Freshmen at 5 in Eagle Country. This is our only game this week, but pick up again with a Home Game on Tuesday versus IWA at 5 pm.

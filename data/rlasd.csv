Recently, the Red Lion Area School District has been recognized in the Pennsylvania School Public Relations Association’s (PenSPRA) 2019 Excellence in Communications Contest!

This year, over 230 outstanding entries were submitted for rigorous judging, and of those entries, we have received the distinction of being awarded two: the Award of Excellence for the “Real Learning for Life” video and the Award of Merit for the annual “At A Glance” publication. These awards are a reflection of our district and made possible by the passion, dedication and support our students, staff and community show every day.

The Red Lion Area School District can confirm the existence of a law-enforcement investigation involving two employees, both of whom have tendered their resignation and are no longer employed by the District. These matters do not relate to any threat of violence and there is no security concern regarding persons or facilities. As always, the safety and security of our students and staff are our primary concern.

We are cooperating fully with the York Area Regional Police and are continuing to conduct our own parallel investigation of these matters. Since this is an open investigation, the District cannot comment any further.",2019-10-04 15:15:21,,

For the teachers who are giving their all to teach all students, for administrators and supervisors who are juggling so many moving pieces, for every support staff member for keeping things going, for all parents who are managing remote learning tools or getting students prepared for in-person learning each day, and for the students we care so much about, let’s do whatever we can to bring out the best in one another. We are all trying to make the best of a not-so-ideal situation.

Please take some time to share words of encouragement or recognition in the comments to help lift the spirits of teachers, administrators, support staff, parents, and students. Mention specific people that have made a difference for you. Keep those positive comments coming to boost us into this new week!",2020-08-31 21:57:10,,

1. Seniors, you are special.
You've successfully completed 13 years of school, even if the last year was quite different than others. You've worked hard, you've accomplished many things, and we (all Roane County citizens) are extremely proud of you.

2. Seniors, you are supported.
Every teacher, principal, community member, and school peer that you have been in contact with over the years has been in your life for a reason...either to teach you a good lesson or a lesson from which you have learned how to handle a situation differently than someone else. As you move forward after high school, you have a community of cheerleaders wishing you the best of luck and watching to see what you do.

Let’s recognize and support our seniors as they adjust, adapt, and thrive! The images and words have been shared straight from our students. Their words are their own, and the world is now theirs!",0.0,"Roane County Schools TN added 8 new photos.

Happy school lunch hero day to all those who help feed the kids! The second half of this semester has looked a lot different. Our staff has greeted the adversity with a smile, hard work, and figuring things out as we go, like most of everyone else. The changes have been challenging at times, but these ladies and men have made it happen! Typically school lunch hero day would revolve around the cafeteria staff. I want to make sure this year that the bus drivers, student support staff, teachers who have volunteered, all our food vendors, and delivery drivers get the recognition they deserve as well. We could not continue our nutrition program at this capacity without them! A big shoutout to Mike Barber, the Coordinated School Heath Director, for these awesome shirts!

Here are the pretraced designs available for Grab and Go. If you have seen something on our page that you liked and it is not listed here, please contact me as we may be able to get it for you.
We have decided to temporarily reduce pricing for the canvas art in an effort to help everyone during this unfortunate time. During “social distancing” adult designs will be $15 for Grab and Go and children’s designs will be $10 for Grab and Go. I have also started adding some Easter designs (bunny, chicks, eggs, and cross) and Graffiti Name Art-they will be available in the next day or two. ❤️❤️
This pricing ($15/$10) includes your pretraced canvas(or ceramic) and paint-if you need brushes Please contact me ahead of time and I can include those in your kit for an additional charge￼.
Ceramics (bisque-that does not need to be fired) Will also be available at $15 per piece (sorry I cannot discount these)￼.
I will be adding some wood projects to the “Grab and Go” art kits in the next few days so stay tuned￼!!",11.0,"If you are looking for something fun for the kids, check out Painting Parties Plus with Rose Molley for contact-free pickup of art supplies and pre-traced designs. #supportlocal #shoplocal

This is a follow up to 7th grade's recent study and Project Based Learning of DNA and Genetics. The Ladd family is from Roane County, and we would like our community to help bring awareness to this rare disease. With awareness comes a cure. If you would like to help, there is a t-shirt order form attached and all MMS students took one home today as well. T-shirts are $10. Proceeds will go to the Kennedy Ladd Foundation.

Roane County 4h horse club had an excellent day at the State Horse Bowl and Hippology contest yesterday! Our junior team made huge gains from last year both in their knowledge base as well as in their ability to work as a team . Amazing young ladies!
This was a first time for our junior high team and they were able to secure a reserve championship in the horse bowl. Again these kiddos worked hard and did amazingly well. So proud of everyone!
Thank you to our parents who came and waited the day out until the very end supporting all of our kids as well as consistently bringing the kids to practices and also practicing with them at home. A big thank you Ms. Kym and Ms. Kayla for your help preparing the teams. Looking forward to next year! More photos to come :)",0.0,"Roane County 4-H Horse Club

Marching Band certainly looks different this year. Due to COVID-19, there are many precautions, including:

Temperature checks at the beginning of each practice.

Students bring their own water bottles

Most practices are held outside and social distancing is required

If inside, students have to wear a mask if they are less than six feet away from one another

Personal belongings are stored six feet apart

Students have to take their instruments homes

Equipment that has to remain at school is sanitized after each practice, including music stands

Mr. Schmitt and Mr. Sanchez are proud of their students for their cooperation. On the practice field at Patrick Henry, it says ""Not today Covid, not today.""

Marching Band certainly looks different this year. Due to COVID-19, there are many precautions, including:

Temperature checks at the beginning of each practice.

Students bring their own water bottles

Most practices are held outside and social distancing is required

If inside, students have to wear a mask if they are less than six feet away from one another

Personal belongings are stored six feet apart

Students have to take their instruments homes

Equipment that has to remain at school is sanitized after each practice, including music stands

The STAR Council is made up of students from Patrick Henry and William Fleming High Schools whose mission is to help our homeless students.

During the pandemic, Roanoke City Public Schools has continued to support our homeless families. Thanks to your donations, we have recently paid for hotel rooms, as well as purchased clothing, hygiene items, and medication.

Additionally, the Help the Homeless Fund is helping to prevent families from becoming homeless. To date, the school system has spent $38,082 helping 254 homeless families (578 students). The fund pays for things like an utility bill or rent to prevent evictions. The funding is being used to fill the gaps after all other community resources have been exhausted.

With 553 students identified as homeless this school year, the STAR Council will continue to raise money and awareness. If you want to help, please check our Help the Homeless webpage:

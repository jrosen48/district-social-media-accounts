Update on Nate...

There is a small amount of blood in one of the creases in his brain that is causing the limited use of his left arm (which frustrates him terribly). His vision is blurry, another frustration. Doctors are hoping that blood will absorb soon. We’re still in ICU. He has slept most of the day.

His labs came back. His hemoglobin is 6.9 and his platelets are at 80. Blood doctors are looking towards a red blood cell transfusion....

Still a waiting game- his brain has to be healthy enough in order to begin the next phase of testing. Testing to figure out why all this happened. Doctors have a really good hunch as mentioned yesterday, but the bone marrow test has not been done- looking for that maybe later on in the week.

Thank you, again. I’m hearing from people from North Carolina to California. And the special favors called in to this place.... astounding. ❤️",7.0,"#prayfornate

Nate doesn’t understand the progress he has made, but Grant started to explain Nate’s status from last night to tonight....
Then Nate lifted his left arm, and Grant said, “Hell yeah!!” Grant continued to explain that last night Nate couldn’t even wiggle his toes on his left foot while in transit. Grant was very enthusiastic about the change in a 24 hour period.
He’s making progress. He feels like it is little, but Jody and I see that it is much larger. Right now, Nate is alert and more like himself. His headache is really bad though.

I just have to brag on my school! My custodians, lunchroom workers, office staff, nurse, support personnel, and teachers are all working so hard each and every day to keep students safe while helping them learn. We are delivering meals to classrooms, preparing meal kits for virtual students, cleaning and sanitizing everything more frequently, teaching in person students and virtual students, and helping parents who chose virtual instruction as they help their children. We are loving our children and helping them feel safe. These are difficult times for all, but I am so proud of my staff for being a light!

I cannot resist bragging on my Special Education teachers and Parapros in Roanoke City Schools! We knew some of our parents would not feel comfortable sending their children to school and would choose virtual instruction as their learning option. We also knew this would be extra challenging in providing support but my teachers and parapros have worked so hard everyday to be there to support their students. From working late to video individual lessons to scheduling real time Zoom meetings during the school day for face to face instruction, they have all demonstrated their love and commitment to our students this year.

Coach said the men had a good week of practice and are ready to go against the Beauregard Hornets. To my understanding there are tickets remaining in case you haven’t purchased yours yet. Tickets must be purchased through Gofan. Check out the link on the previous posts made the other day on this Facebook page. Tickets “will not” be sold at the gate.
I love it when a plan comes together. This weeks meal was sponsored by Electrical Technicians Incorporated. Give Ole Timothy Smith with E.T.I. a call for all of your electrical, mechanical, and machine shop needs. They do it all. 706-881-6397 You’ll be glad you did.

Did one of my favorite brain wake-up activities with my Chemistry kids today. I tell them putting the puzzle together is like science. You are given all these odd pieces and they have to fit together. THEN, new information is learned and it has to fit in the picture too. I love seeing how some “see” it in seconds and some have to be guided. We talked about how they felt frustrated and how sometimes you have to look at data from other people to get going on your own. #hhs #classof2022 #everyonehadtheirowncopy #becausecovid",0.0,"#bealight #handleyfamily

There’s no words to describe how special this moment was at Handley High School this morning. With it being my senior year, starting school has been a bit more emotional and scary not knowing what my last year will look like. But no matter what the future holds, I know that administrators will do whatever it takes to make this year memorable for us. They take our ideas seriously and bring out the leader that’s inside all of us. I am so thankful that I was given the opportunity to lead a prayer alongside my fellow classmates and our teachers before starting this year off. In a world full of darkness and evil, Handley High School is A LIGHT!",3.0,"This shared post is from one of our Seniors, Maggie.

I could not be more pleased with the first two days of the 2020-21 school year. I want to thank the faculty and staff at each of our schools for their work in making sure we had a great start. A special thanks to our three SRO’s & the RPD for their extra support with school traffic. My favorite part has been seeing students back in our schools for the first time since March 13th.

Yes sir. It’s that time of year again. It never ceases to amaze me how people step up to support these kids. This weeks meal is sponsored by former Tiger Viondi Pate.
Vee we can’t tell you how much we appreciate you thinking of us and supporting these kids. The “Theme” this is year at Roanoke City Schools is “be a light”. You sir have shown exactly what that means. Thanks again brother.

Yes sir. It’s that time of year again. It never ceases to amaze me how people step up to support these kids. This weeks meal is sponsored by former Tiger Viondi Pate.
Vee we can’t tell you how much we appreciate you thinking of us and supporting these kids. The “Theme” this is year at Roanoke City Schools is “be a light”. You sir have shown exactly what that means. Thanks again brother. We haven’t been able to do our normal fundraisers for the year but we know that all will be taken care of because we trust the Lord will provide for the kids regardless of the situation. Go Tigers!!!!",2020-08-20 18:27:07,,

During the past seven years, he has been the assistant principal. Mr. Cole is well-prepared for this position having had Mr. Foster as his mentor. I will add that Mr. Foster gave him the strongest endorsement possible for this job. We both felt that he was the best person to help navigate HHS through the COVID-19 pandemic.

KES families,
These are our supply lists for this year. For a hassle-free option, Knight-Enloe offers parents the option of paying the cost to cover the supplies listed, and the school will then purchase the items for the entire school year. You may stop by the school anytime this summer if you would like to go ahead and pay and let the school purchase them. This option will also be available at Orientation, but there may be a delay in getting the items at that point. Our summer office hours are Monday - Thursday, 7:30 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.

We also welcome any donation of these items. If you want to partner with Knight Enloe and are able to donate to help families who can't afford school supplies, we welcome these donations. We are looking forward to a great year!",0.0,"Knight Enloe Elementary School

Then he hit him with a 20 gauge sledge hammer!!!!! ” I think Evan and I were probably more excited than Cason, and Cason was excited!!!😂😂 Take a kid hunting because killing your first bird only happens once, and neither of us will forget it!!🦃🦃🦃🦃🦃",0.0,"Look at our kids!!!

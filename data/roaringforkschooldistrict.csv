Tanner was born in Glenwood Springs and lived in Missouri for 7 years before returning to the mountains. Tanner graduated from the Roaring Fork Schools ""Ready for the World"" Program, and was referred to us by Julia Lang, his teacher in that program. He loves being at work, and when he's not working he loves camping and ATV riding with his family. Welcome aboard Tanner!",0.0,"Check out this great spotlight on this Ready for the World graduate!

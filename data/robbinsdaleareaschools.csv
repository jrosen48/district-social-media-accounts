The Golden Valley Police Department (GVPD) continues to have additional officers on duty and has more than enough resources ready to handle regular 911 calls and any other incidents should they arise. The Department continues to work with other agencies and monitor the situation. The GVPD will update the community again later tonight.

The GVPD also wants to remind residents of the extended city-wide nighttime curfew consistent with Governor Walz’s announcement of the curfew extension for Minneapolis and St Paul. It is in effect from tonight at 10 pm until Tuesday at 4 am, and again from 10 pm Tuesday, June 2 until 4 am Wednesday, June 3. Thank you to all residents for observing the curfew over the weekend.

As always, the GVPD relies on residents to help be its eyes and ears. Please call 911 for any emergency services and to report suspicious activity. You may remain anonymous.

We have hundreds of incredible people working around the clock here at WOODCHUCK USA. They're working hard to get millions of face shields into the hands of our doctors, nurses, and medical professionals on the front lines. Today we wanted to take a minute to highlight one of the front line heroes on our team, who is pushing in true ""Beast mode"" fashion to help save lives.



Our team has already shipped millions of face shields across the United States to our amazing front line care providers. These production numbers continue to climb each week as it remains our teams sole priority to get these life saving supplies into the hands of our front line providers.

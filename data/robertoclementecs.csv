If you have kids in need of breakfast and lunch this summer, simply text ""FOOD"" to 877877 and you'll receive a message with the closest location where they can get free summer meals.

***Theres no paperwork to fill out, no income requirement to meet. They just feed the kids. It‚Äôs really that simple. They serve kids 18 and under. As long as they can eat table food, they can eat with this program.

No Kid Hungry has access to information about tens of thousands of groups serving free meals nationwide as part of the the U.S. Department of Agriculture‚Äôs (USDA) Summer Food Service Program.

Copy and paste this. Don't share it, your status could help someone in need that doesn't want to speak up and ask for help. We all need a little help sometimes.

Make sure to congratulate Christopher Garcia and Roman Paniagua for an amazing job in goal!

Scoring one goal each were Marlon Cordova, Elvin Uruchima, Joel Fernandez, and Christopher Garcia.

Scoring two goals each were Christian Reyes, Javier Reyes and Guillermo Tavarez.

There were two MVPs for this game- Christopher Garcia for his diving saves in goal (he looked like a real pro!) and Emily Encarnacion for showing the boys how it's done on defense! She was scared to play at first, but within a couple of minutes she was in her groove. She won the ball each time she challenged another player!

Everyone did a phenomenal job!

JV will play their last regular game of the season next Thursday at 7:30 against the same team. It would be great to see both students and staff there to support our team.

What a tremendous season this has been for our first annual indoor soccer program at RCCS! Woohoo!!!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2197370096950030&id=114834385203622,,0.0,"Wow!

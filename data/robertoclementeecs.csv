We are excited for the First Day of School! Your teachers can't wait to see you in the live Google Meets today. The first live Google Meet is at 9:00 a.m. Please check the Class Dojo Page of your child's teacher and your child's email.

You may be feeling nervous or unsure and that is normal. We are starting our school year in a way that is new for all of us. We will work together and have a great day!

If you have tech issues please let your child's teacher know. They will contact the main office staff and we will either provide you with information you may need or refer you to our IT department.

Thank you!

The Senior Class of 2020 my first, first grade class at D231, I believe. The beauty of FB is that I have continued to watch them grow through the years. I loved hugging on them, fixing their boo-boo’s, and getting to know their families. I MISS THEM!

I can’t help but note how many are choosing to go into nursing and other fields of medicine.

I feel like I’ll be in good hands as I/we grow older, and need medical attention (hopefully not, but it will be good to see them succeed).

Influenza is still making its presence known here at RMS. Please, keep sick kids home! Kids need to be fever free, vomiting free, diarrhea free for 24 full hours, WITHOUT MEDICATION, before returning to school.

Kids Health offers really good advice on when to keep kids home. District 231 does require that all children with fevers, vomiting and diarrhea be home until their symptoms are gone for 24 full hours without medication.

So, I saw this idea at an Emergency Medicine Conference this weekend. Thought I would try it out and share the results. This is what happens to a hot dog when a button battery is placed inside for only two hours. Now, imagine this being the inside of your child/infant/toddler's stomach or intestine. Within only a few hours it can cause a perforation (hole) within the stomach lining. So here's the PSA, if you have a child that has swallowed one or you are concerned may have swallowed one, go immediately to the ER. Please, keep out of the reach of children, along with toys and electronic devices which use these batteries. Please share.",0.0,"Great PSA

School Nurses Are My Superheroes!

We asked a bunch of real people, from kids to parents to school nurses themselves: ""What do school nurses do?"" The answers might surprise you!

The folks at Found Sound Puppets bring these answers to life by transforming everyday school supplies into puppets that animate the audio in crazy ways.

From dealing with diabetes to helping tackle community health challenges, school nurses are doing more than ever before to keep students healthy, safe, and ready to learn.

Share this video now and help spread the word about the importance of school nurses!

School nurses are on the front lines of health care, making a difference in the lives of our nation's children!

Hi Parents!

Just wanted to let you know that we are still seeing new cases of Influenza B. It seems late in the school year to be dealing with this, but it is still around. Common symptoms are high fever (100-103), cough and cold symptoms and occasionally vomiting and diarrhea. If your child has these symptoms, please contact your doctor for direction. Students can not return to school until they are fever free for 24 hours (without medication).

If you have questions, please contact me in the health office.

It truly is becoming that time of year when we are starting to see illnesses in the school district. Fevers, cough and cold symptoms are probably the most prevalent right now. We do have positive cases of strep in our buildings. Rochelle Hospital is reporting positive cases of influenza.

Kids Health offers really good advice on when to keep kids home. District 231 does require that all children with fevers, vomiting and diarrhea be home until their symptoms are gone for 24 full hours without medication.

Impetigo is highly contagious and very easily spread. It is usually treated with an oral antibiotic or a topical antibiotic cream. Initially, impetigo may look like a pimple or bug bite.

If you have friends, parents, children overweight and brands such reads as follows:

This is not dirty, or developed for lack of hygiene!! In this brand is known as Acanthosis-Nigricans.
You can go on the neck, face, forehead, armpits, between the legs and other body parts. It is a Mark On The Skin That Signals High Insulin Levels in the body.

It tends to be confused with a smudge of dirt or grime but this actually indicates that the body is resisting the insulin produced by the body.

As a result, the pancreas produces more insulin and eventually you could get to develop diabetes (Type 2).
May disappear with simple lifestyle changes of life and a moderate weight reduction (in many cases).

If you know someone, adults and children that present this, do not waste any more time inbox us, remember that a detection in time can prevent diabetes.

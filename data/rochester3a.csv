Dear Parents and Staff:

The Route 29 Campus, which houses Rochester Junior and Senior High Schools, was placed on lock down this morning at approximately 8:45 a.m. The lock down was declared after an Illinois State Police K-9 Unit arrived on campus to conduct a routine search of the premises. As a precautionary measure for this type of search, the buildings are placed on lock down in order to insulate all students and staff as the dog teams assess our facilities. The lock down lasted approximately 70 minutes.

There was no accompanying threat to this lock down situation. This effort involved collaboration among the Rochester Police Department and the Illinois State Police. Our School Resource Officer assisted district staff and the State Police as part of the search.

Our students and staff did a great job working through the search this morning. We are grateful for their cooperation and partnership as we work to ensure the safety and security of our students and staff.

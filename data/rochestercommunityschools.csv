School is back and so are our Uplifting Moments of the Week!

Shortly before school started, Delta Kelly’s 3-5 CI classroom was without a teacher. With our first day closing in, Ms. Benham offered to teach both her K-2 students and the 3-5 so they wouldn’t be without a teacher! She has done wonders already connecting with families and creating a clear schedule with lots of great hands on experiences for learning. Our families are truly grateful!

Here she is last May with Ada giving her socially distanced one on one math help. The love our Special Ed teachers have for our kids knows no limits!

Adding the SmartMusic Program to the Rochester Community Schools, MI curriculum will help budding musicians learn their craft in school and at home!

Band and orchestra teachers and students have digital access to thousands of music selections in the SmartMusic library--from any location.

When an individual student practices using the SmartMusic program, a full band or orchestra plays along, allowing them to learn not just their part, but how it fits into the whole.

Additionally, students receive instant feedback. Correctly played notes light up in green, and problem spots are red, so students can concentrate on those elements.

To enhance our district band and music programs, the Rochester Community Schools Foundation is collecting donations through its Support A Project program.

A: According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), face shields are not an alternative to masks or cloth face coverings. Respiratory droplets and aerosol can still enter around the sides and bottom of the face shield, so they are less protection than a mask. For those wearing a mask, face shields offer an excellent alternative to goggles for eye protection.

Masks and face coverings should: cover the nose and mouth, below the chin; fit snuggly but comfortably, against the sides of the face; be secured with ties or straps; and allow for breathing without restriction.

3. Monday is the day we'll distribute our first printed work packets. They'll arrive at bus stops along with the free meals. Printed work packets are only for those families who have limited or no Internet or extenuating circumstances, AND who have communicated their need for a packet to their child's teacher or school.

January 29th, 5-7 pm - RHS Library

RHS is hosting a scholarship workshop on January 29th from 5-7 pm in the library. Tyler Kaut from CC will be here to help everyone apply for the CC Scholarship. The plan is to have applications submitted before leaving. In order to do this, those attending will have to have already applied to Centralia College and received their student ID and student email. That process is simple but has to be done by January 23rd to ensure you receive the new student info in time.

If you are even slightly considering CC as an option for next year, just apply and come to the workshop...you might be surprised and receive a great scholarship that will help you make up your mind. The link for applying is below.

You are welcome to come to the counseling center if you need additional assistance as well.

There has been a suggestion made on Facebook for flashing lights to be added to the crosswalk in front of Rochester Middle School to increase the safety of our students on dark mornings. Unfortunately, despite numerous effort by the district, we have not been successful in securing approval for safety improvements to the crosswalk area, due to strict state highway regulations. If anyone has any contacts at the Department of Transportation that may be able to assist in this matter, please call the District Office at 360-273-9242.",2019-12-03 18:56:52,,

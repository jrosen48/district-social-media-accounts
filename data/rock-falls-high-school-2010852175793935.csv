Library Spotlight: There are now 3 book drops conveniently placed throughout the school for students to easily return textbooks and library books without any contact. All books are quarantined for the currently recommended full 72 hours before being able to go to the next person. We are masked and wear gloves when handling the books. We ❤ our students' health and want everyone to enjoy our books and ebooks. More on a whole new place to get ebooks to come!!

The library, while not open to drop in students or study hall, is still a busy busy place!! The library is the go to place when classrooms get an unexpected cleaning. In addition, any student who needs to work with his/her aide gets plenty of space to work and talk out the lesson while staying masked and every table is thoroughly cleaned after each use. RFHS is dedicated to everyone's success and health at school.",0.0,"RF Rockets Spotlight

There is complete buy-in to everything we are asking them to do on a daily basis and this is a credit to all of our families.
I also wanted to update everyone after our first week of school. Due to the new expectations from the Illinois Dept of Public Health we have had to send some students home based on their symptoms presented at school. However, I can report that, as of today, we have had zero confirmed cases of COVID-19.
This is a tribute to all of our students and staff following the protocol our Re-Open Team established prior to the start of the school year.
Please review the attachment from the IDPH so you are familiar with the policies we have to follow on a daily basis. If your student is suffering from any of these symptoms and they are new and not explainable, do not hesitate to keep your student home.

Have a great weekend!!

For many of the college and high school coaches we work with, the unexpected shutdown has given them the gift of some downtime. The most successful coaches are using it as an opportunity for growth - both personal and program. We have compiled a list of areas that could improve you as a coach and/or your program. If each coach on the staff would choose 2 or 3 different things and become an “expert” on those areas and be able to share it with the rest of the staff, think how much better we can become.
Here are just some examples from 4 categories:
Organization - Practice Planning - End of the season banquet
Technical - Skill progression and terminology (7-12) - Rules of motor learning
Relationships - Getting players to accept roles - Developing confidence in players
Leadership - Setting team behavioral standards - Positive traditions

They have decided that all students have the right to participate in any Extra-Curricular activities during the 2020-2021 school year. This means that if you choose the Remote Learning Option for your student(s) they will be able to participate in all sports/activities.

If you have already filled out the survey with the understanding your student could not participate in any sports/activities and would like to change your response, you will need to contact the main office on Monday at 815-625-3886. The office is currently closed today, Friday, July 24th.
If you haven't completed the survey, please make sure to provide your responses by Wednesday, July 29th by 9:00 am.

I hope this does not create more confusion, but this is a very fluid situation and we are trying to provide our best plan when we have the most up to date information.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2656995667846246&id=2010852175793935,,0.0,"I wanted to update you on new information that was shared with us on July 23rd from the Illinois State Board of Education.
https://www.isbe.net/Documents/Fall-2020-Learning-Rec.pdf

They have decided that all students have the right to participate in any Extra-Curricular activities during the 2020-2021 school year. This means that if you choose the Remote Learning Option for your student(s) they will be able to participate in all sports/activities.

If you have already filled out the survey with the understanding your student could not participate in any sports/activities and would like to change your response, you will need to contact the main office on Monday at 815-625-3886. The office is currently closed today, Friday, July 24th.
If you haven't completed the survey, please make sure to provide your responses by Wednesday, July 29th by 9:00 am.

I hope this does not create more confusion, but this is a very fluid situation and we are trying to provide our best plan when we have the most up to date information.",2020-07-24 13:27:30,,

2020 yearbook update: In a typical year the book is completed by early June and delivered in July. This year however because we did not want to leave out last week's graduation, the book will be finished later this week and delivered mid-late August. We apologize but we felt it important to include this special moment for the class of 2020 which missed out on so much. Once books are received we will reach out to graduates to get the books handed out or even delivered if possible and we will make decisions regarding how to deliver books to the rest of the students once we have a clearer idea of what next fall will look like when we return. Please check back on social media in August for details. Also because of the chaos, we did order extra copies for those who did not make the final deadline. Those extra copies will be available for sale after ordered books have been delivered to students/parents. #RFRocketspride",0.0,"RF Rockets Spotlight

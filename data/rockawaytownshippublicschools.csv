RTSD is capable of rapidly sanitizing environments.
Above and beyond our rigorous daily cleaning measures,
we are using state of the art Electrostatic Spraying Systems.
These systems provide fast, efficient, and thorough coverage over a wide range of surfaces.

And the solution used in the sprayer (Bioseque Botanical Disinfectant)
Kills Norovirus in just 4 minutes as well as 99.99% of Viruses, Bacteria, Fungi, and Mold, while still being a botanically derived US EPA registered Biodegradable disinfectant containing no harmful chemicals, chlorine or phosphates.

RTSD will use these tools to disinfect all district locations regularly and as an immediate response to any potential outbreak, because the safety and security of our students and staff comes first.

We just completed Hoosier Hysteria and created a wax museum to showcase our efforts to our school and community.

Hoosier Hysteria is a multi genre project fourth graders complete each year here at RCCA. Anticipation can be felt from the beginning when the student picks out his or her famous Hoosier all the way until he or she dresses up as the individual and gives a two to five minutes speech for students, staff members, and families. During this project, students write a research paper, create a timeline, write and memorize a speech, create a display and then finally present their Hoosier in a wax museum style showcase. This is a highly challenging but rewarding project that pushes even the shyest fourth grader to step up and show what he or she knows!

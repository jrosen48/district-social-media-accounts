Today the Governor announced a mandatory 3-week closure of all schools across the Commonwealth. Given the Governor’s pronouncement, the Rockland Public Schools and offices, including Rockland Daycare, will be closed through Monday, April 6th, 2020 and will plan to reopen on Tuesday, April 7th, 2020.
Throughout the crisis, a free, bag-lunch will be being served Monday through Friday at the “Mainstreet” entrance of RHS/RMS between the hours of 11:30 am and 12:30 pm Monday through Friday. Please share this important information.
Finally, senior administration and faculty are working quickly and thoughtfully to develop a district-wide, comprehensive “work from home” plan for all students and parents. Our goal is to minimize the negative effects of the loss of teaching and learning that is occurring during this crisis.

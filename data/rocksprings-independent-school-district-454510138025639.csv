We will remain in the home based learning model until May 4th as mandated by Governor Abbott.
We will continue our food service, although new guidelines state that we can only feed whenever we were going to have school. Therefore we will not be sending home food for the weekend any more.
We are still following our school calendar and will observe our days off for our staff and students.
We are moving to be 100% online for all of our students with their work.

Working from home? Here’s a great tip in case you need to scan a document. iPhone users: go to “notes” and hit the little camera button. It will ask if you want to scan a document. Lay out the pages you want to scan and it will save them all as a PDF file! So easy and helpful if you depend on using a scanner like I do!

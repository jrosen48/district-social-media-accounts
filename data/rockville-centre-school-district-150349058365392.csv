With the help of SSMS teachers, Kori Miller and Jamie Ambruzzo, students showed support by raising money for the thousands of animals suffering. Students donated money and wore animal print or South Side attire. The money will be donated to World Wildlife Fund Australia. The goal is to raise enough money to adopt a Koala and supply it with proper care. Many parts of Australia have been battling wildfires since November and students are passionate about helping.

Mrs. Brooks’ Fourth grade class received live crayfish to observe as part of their Next Generation Science Curriculum this week at Riverside School. Students will be conducting experiments that test what crayfish eat and if they can detect the presence of food in water, as well as how they react to external stimuli. The students observed what they arrived in, and how to put them in their new environment within the classroom. Today, students created a list of rules for the Humane Treatment of the crayfish and will also experiment with food coloring to observe a crayfish breathing under water. All of these observations will help students generate ideas for their upcoming writing piece titled
“A Memoir of a Crayfish”. This will be written from the perspective of a crayfish.

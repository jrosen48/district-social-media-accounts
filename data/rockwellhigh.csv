(1) Glad to have Misty De Farias back! Her schedule is Monday through Thursday and then she will work from home on Fridays for the remainder of the school year.

(2) Students, please get to classes, on time, and do the work. No teacher wants to purposefully flunk any student, so help them help you.

(3) Schedules can be changed so just get a form from Misty Dipo. We want to help you all be successful, so help us help you.

(4) Seniors and those Juniors hoping to graduate early, we will be talking to you to make sure everyone is on track. Beside 26 credits as required by the state and our board, there is the state's civics test, a portfolio of best work, a service hours narrative, and a 5-year plan for after graduation that all need to be checked off.

(5) Lastly, please start mentally preparing for state testing coming soon. You can do hard things and you just need to do them the best you can.

Hello Rockwell Families and Friends!

I'm reaching out to all of you in hopes that someone might be in a position to help one of your students out. I wok with CIEE an exchange program for high school students. We have a boy from Poland named Michal that attends Rockwell. We are in need of a new host family for him.

He is really into photography and video editing. He loves learning new languages, He speaks Polish of course 🙂, fluent English, a bit of French and basics of Russian.
He likes tennis and swimming.

If you would like more information on how you can help this young man with one of the most amazing years of his life please send me a message, call me, or email me.

Thanks for your help!

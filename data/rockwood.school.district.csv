Rockwood has 191 school buses. Transportation Director Mike Heyman said officials will only be training about 35 drivers at a time, so they can maintain social distancing during the classroom portion.

""Our school bus drivers need to keep their skills sharp,"" said Heyman. ""Drivers have not been behind the wheel since March, and they need to practice safe driving techniques so that when in-person school does resume, students can be transported in as safe a manner as possible.""",2020-08-21 10:03:08,,

The students ranged from kindergarten through fifth grade.

“The kids were asking, ‘Do you remember what spot was mine? Where do I sit?’” Crites said, with a laugh. “It was emotional. The parents were coming in and hugging me and thanking me for doing this. It feels like yesterday that the kids were here.”

Crites said some of the students’ favorite memories included cookies around the holidays, scavenger hunts in the school and playing pretend at stations around the classroom.

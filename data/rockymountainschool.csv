RMS staff and parents,
As many of you are aware, State Superintendent Hofmeister called an emergency board meeting this afternoon of the state board of education. The state board just voted to cease school and school activities for all public schools in the state of Oklahoma until April 6th.
In the next few days, I will be giving you additional information concerning such items as meals for students, community supports, and guidance on continuing your child’s learning during this time.
I appreciate the continued support of Rocky Mountain school. We are blessed with a wonderful community.

Today, we visited several Smithsonian Institute Museums - The Castle, Air and Space, American Indian, Natural History, and American History.
We witnessed the final drive of the Rolling Thunder - hundreds of thousands of motorcycles drive through DC to bring awareness for POW and MIA and veterans who have not received fair treatment.
We got lunch from the food trucks and enjoyed eating on the lawn of the National Mall.
We visited the Washington Memorial, the Holocaust Museum, Air Force Memorial And 911 Memorial.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2385097994845864&id=1014461341909543,,0.0,"Sunday, May 26

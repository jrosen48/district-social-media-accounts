Merk Field is ready for Graduation tonight at 8:30. Gates will open at 7:30 for invited guests. Here are a couple of reminders:
1. If you have symptoms, stay home and watch on Facebook Live (we will go live at 8:15)
2. Please wear a face mask as a sign of respect to others
3. If you will be sitting on the field, bring your chair. (Wagons will be allowed to transport chairs)
4. You MUST enter with your entire group. If you are sitting on the field, enter through visitor’s side gate, if sitting in the bleachers, enter on home side.
5. Please practice social distancing while entering, during the ceremony, and exiting the stadium
6. REMEMBER: we have done our best to make this event memorable for our Seniors. Much of this was pulled together in the past 10 days. It may not be perfect, but we have tried our best.

We are having a special fundraiser to support Coach Roten and his family as they are at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston with sweet Annalee. She sailed through her surgery like a champ on Monday but she will have a long recovery ahead of her that will require continued hospitalization. We would like to show our support as the Rogers Eagles family and community to help offset some of the financial burden in the months ahead of them. We will have Down Syndrome Awareness silicone bracelets available on Friday to wear proudly to show our love and support for this precious baby and her family. If you would like to purchase one please see one of the coaches, Mrs. Bertha Harris, or a school administrator. They will also be available for purchase in the school offices, administration building, and Fieldhouse. The bracelets will be $3 each, but any additional donations are welcome! ...........

In an effort to help our community, the Rogers CYC (community wide Christian Youth Club) group is organizing an event where people can donate any clothes / shoes that your kids have outgrown or don't wear anymore and then we will make these items available to families that may need them. First Baptist Rogers has graciously donated their facility to host the event. Drop off for donated items will be THIS Friday (August 11) from 2:00 - 4:00 pm at the fellowship hall. The items will be for sale ($.25 - $1.00) on Saturday from 8:30 - 11:00 am at the fellowship hall. Any items not sold will be donated to other local organizations. If your kids have outgrown their last year's clothes, they may be able to fit someone else. When Eagles help Eagles.....Everyone wins! The proceeds will help fund the CYC Wednesday after school program, which last year served about 50 kids per week at NO COST to them.

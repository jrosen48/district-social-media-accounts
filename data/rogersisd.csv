Thank you for all of your support over the past couple of weeks while students at the elementary, middle school and high school took their STAAR tests. Unfortunately, the results will not be available until after we are out of school for the summer.

However, we have decided to offer a STAAR Reveal day for each campus so students (and parents) can find out how they did on the tests they had to take. THIS IS COMPLETELY VOLUNTARY for both students and teachers. If you don't come on this day, the results will be mailed home at a later date.

SAVE THE DATE!

HS STAAR Reveal will be Tuesday, June 5th from 11:30 am - 12:30
MS / Elem will be on Tuesday, June 19th from 6:00-7:00 pm (more parent-friendly time, since these guys can't drive)

We hope to see you there.

Here is a link to a short video from the state that explains more on the scoring and what it means for your student. (Scroll down for the video.)

Today around 2:00 pm, I received a report from our Middle School Principal there was a fire in the downstairs boys' restroom at the middle school. A student had gone to the restroom and reported the fire to a teacher, whose classroom is right beside the restroom. The teacher accessed the situation and quickly grabbed a fire extinguisher and put out the fire, which turned out to be the toilet paper roll. Through investigation, the Principal was able to determine which student had been in the restroom prior to the student who reported it. We will follow the Rogers ISD Student Code of Conduct in dealing with the student discipline. There were no students or staff injured and property damage will be assessed soon. Thanks to an aware student and a quick-thinking teacher, a potentially more serious situation was avoided.

We want to make you aware that on our middle school GT field trip today to Austin, our bus was involved in a very minor collision. While driving down the highway, another vehicle drifted toward our bus and side-swiped the bus. The other vehicle then pulled away and left, without us being able to get a license plate. The were no injuries to the driver or any of the students or teacher. The bus has a little paint on it from the other vehicle, but no damage that would affect its safety or drivability. We reported the situation to law enforcement and continued on with the field trip. We want to be proactive in reporting the situation to parents, so rumors don’t turn it into something more than it actually was.

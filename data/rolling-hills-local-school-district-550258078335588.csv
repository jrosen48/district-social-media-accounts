WHAT THEY MISS ABOUT THEIR SENIOR YEAR: What I miss about Meadowbrook is being around friends, still learning something new every day and the staff. Meadowbrook staff has definitely been great to me, they have all helped in so many ways and have taught me never to give up on something you truly believe in. Especially Mr.Baker, he always tried to help me be my best! To all the staff, I’d like to thank you all for making my high school experience so much fun!

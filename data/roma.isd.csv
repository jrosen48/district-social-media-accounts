“We are so happy to have secured this extra funding and really have to thank Mrs. Cruz for her leadership in helping to secure and manage these funds, as well as her work with our principals to identify areas of need that can most help our teachers,” said Roma ISD Superintendent Carlos Guzman. “Usually we are only able to give our teachers $100 for supplies so this $300 increase is a huge help.”

In all, through the grant, the district will provide teachers $171,200 for digital supplies this school year.",2020-08-06 14:46:44,,

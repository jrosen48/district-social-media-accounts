I have taught kindergarten at West Central for 14 years. About 8 years ago, I began going through my class photos at the end of each year to find pictures of the graduating 6th-grade students that I taught. I make copies for them and invite the 6th graders to visit my classroom during the last week of school. They always have fun reminiscing about their days in kindergarten, and I really get a kick out of what they remember about being in my class. I'm sad that I won't be able to have that reunion with this year's 6th graders.

If you’re up tonight, you may be able to catch a glimpse of the biggest and brightest moon of 2020.

Sarah Brown, Astronomy Teacher for Rome High School, shared:

“Bringing us a literal silver lining in these dark times is the night sky’s brightest object of 2020, the Pink Supermoon. Named such for a pink flower blooming in the spring (and not indicative of the moon’s color), the pink supermoon will be most easily visible between 10:30 pm and midnight tonight, April 7th. Tonight’s moon is called a supermoon because the moon is near perigee, its closest point to Earth. As such, it can appear approximately 30% brighter than when it is at its farthest point. Take a moment tonight to wander outside for some night-sky viewing!”",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1436954993142622&id=174327529405381,,0.0,"Knowledge at Night

Anna K. Davie Celebrates African Americans and the Arts!!!

Educators and students at AKD gave a nod to the past with a special Black History presentation at the school.

Students dressed as influential African Americans and offered the crowd information about their contributions to Black History. From dance numbers to poems recited by the students, attendees were offered an experience that gave them an overall idea of how Black History is such a large part of who we all are today.

Guests were also treated to soul food-inspired dishes in the school cafeteria after the event.

Please enjoy these photos from the night's festivities!

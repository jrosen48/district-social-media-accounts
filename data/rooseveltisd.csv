Due to the closures caused by Covid-19, the High School Yearbook will not be delivered in the spring. Instead, we have had to move the delivery date to the Fall. This means that those yearbooks that have been ordered will be delivered after school starts next year. Also, we have decided to not raise the price of the yearbook. This will allow those who have not ordered yearbooks to order them through the summer until we sell out. That price will remain at $45.

COVID-19 has deeply changed our daily lives and has prompted Governor Abbott to close schools through May 4th, 2020. Because of this, it is with sadness that I inform you that the RHS 2020 Prom, scheduled for May 2nd, has been cancelled. This is a decision that was difficult to come to, but I believe that it is correct and prudent at this point in our lives to make this decision.

This ranking is for all HS in the state regardless of enrollment.

The Center uses free and reduced lunch numbers as well as standardized test scores to figure out each school's rank. We scored 111.19 overall with a percent rank of 93.18, and a letter grade of A.

Thank you to everyone who donated to this year's annual food drive. The amount of food that was brought in was beyond words. The generosity of the RHS students, staff, and community is overwhelming. We were able to box up over 100+ boxes of food for distribution. We are extending the food drive through this week as long as boxes are available (please call RHS between 8:00-3:00 to check on availability).

Thank you to Jesse Waterman and the RHS Student Council for organizing and boxing up the food this weekend. Thank you to Cathy Erickson and the RAPS BOE for the Family Fare gift cards to go along with the food boxes.",0.0,"Great job, we have a very generous RHS family!

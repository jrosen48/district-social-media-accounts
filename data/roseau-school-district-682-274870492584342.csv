Under our posts, we would love for you to share a picture of you/your family taking part in that day's theme. If you complete and share an image of yourself participating in one of our weekly ideas you will automatically be entered into our live drawing on Friday -- WINNERS will receive a FREE spot in any Community Ed class of their choice when we resume (hopefully sooner than later!).

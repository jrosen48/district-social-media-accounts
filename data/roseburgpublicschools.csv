About six of the fir trees on campus have begun to show signs of wasting, and several more were damaged in last month’s snowstorm.

The sidewalk that is used as an approach to the school from Harvard Avenue is not in the area of concern so it will continue to be accessible. The play areas under the trees will be closed until the hazards are removed.
Professional tree service operators will be employed in the near future to remove the wasting trees and to prune hazard branches and weak tops on other trees as needed.

Dear families and community members of Roselle School District 12,

It is with tremendous honor and pride that I begin my superintendency in Roselle. As I enter my twenty-third year in education, I have had the privilege of serving the communities of Palatine, Naperville and, most recently, Elmhurst. Along the way I have worked with dedicated and committed educators and families, all striving to provide the best educational opportunities to students. I am looking forward to the same type of collaboration in Roselle!

My role as “Mom” continues to be the most important, even as my three children have moved into adulthood. My experiences as a parent have shaped and informed me as an educator, and keeping that parent perspective in mind has served me well when working to serve our students.

I am looking forward to getting to know our families and community members over the next few months. I know that August will come quickly, and I look forward to having our students back and continuing on our “Path to Excellence.”

Sincerely,

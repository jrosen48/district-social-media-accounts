Good afternoon Parents and Students. I hope you all have been enjoying our SEL Bingo activity today in recognition of National SEL Day. Feel free to continue the activities over the weekend and share pictures. I completed an activity in all 5 domains today.
1) Took a nature walk with my son and dog.
2) Asked my family members what they are grateful for.
3) Ate a healthy salad for lunch
4) Wrote down three words my friends would use to describe me.
5) Checked in on an elderly neighbor by leaving her my contact information in case she needs anything.

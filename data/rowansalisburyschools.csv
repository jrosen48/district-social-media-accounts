As we look forward to welcoming students back to school Monday, we ask for your patience and flexibility.

We recognize that there will be adjustments that need to be made to some student schedules and transfers. Until these adjustments can be finalized, we ask that you check the parent portal in PowerSchool after 2 pm on Friday to confirm the school where your child will need to report on Monday – this is very important!

We are implementing extreme safety measures to keep our students and staff safe, so it is imperative that this schedule be explicitly followed on Monday as we account for each student.

Please look for a welcome message from your school on Sunday evening.

You may contact your school that is currently listed in PowerSchool to answer your questions, concerns and to make adjustments if at all possible.

We thank you again for your patience in working with us as we open this historical new school year.

On Friday (March 27, 2020) NC Governor Roy Cooper issued a ‘Stay at Home’ Executive order for North Carolina.

I want to reassure our families that our free nutritional meals will continue to be distributed on our bus routes and at our school site locations by our school bus drivers, school nutrition team and staff. They put themselves on the front-line every day, and for their safety, I ask that you please practice social distancing and washing your hands before receiving meals.

We miss our children, and it’s hard to not hug them. But for now, we will just leave a meal and smile.

Make us all proud by continuing to read together. I encourage you to contact your teacher if you need our help.

It was RSS ""Trunk or Instructional Treats"" for Rowan-Salisbury teachers and assistants as they enjoyed a fun afternoon of sharing and receiving great instructional resources to use in their classrooms. They even received a few sweet treats and popcorn along the way.

Dressed up for the occasion, teachers moved from trunk to trunk capturing all kinds of treasures to take back to their schools. - AND all in the fun spirit of Halloween.

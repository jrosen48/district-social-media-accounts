我是您的學區總監Julie Mitchell博士，與您分享有關新學年的重要信息。
我們很高興將在8月10日開學日歡迎所有學生回來學校。確保所有學生和教職人員的安全和福祉仍是我們的首要任務。

在這瞬息萬變的時代，我們的員工將繼續致力於為學生提供創新的學習方式和協助他們成功。
我們正在設計學習方式選項，讓您有機會選擇最適合您和您孩子的學習方式。
我們將繼續遵循洛杉磯縣公共衛生局的最新指南，其中包括
保持社交安全距離，經常洗手和使用消毒洗手液，配戴口罩，不共享材料並減少聚集在任何一個區域（在任何時間包括在教室裡）的學生人數。
我們正在開發的學習計劃選項具有靈活性，能夠隨可能發生的任何狀況改變或更新。

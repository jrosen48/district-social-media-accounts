Last week we sent out a Technology Request Form for every family in our district to fill out. If you haven't already done so, please click here to fill out the request form: https://forms.gle/jeVvtZ1p9UVQmD758. We would also like to clarify information regarding the availability of a district owned hotspot. The hotspot can ONLY be used for a device that you request from the district. NO PERSONAL DEVICES such as a personal laptop or cell phone can access the hotspot. Also, the district has a very limited supply of hotspots due to a nationwide shortage at this time. If you already have internet access at home, we ask that you don't request a hotspot so that we are able to provide hotspots to families without Internet access. Our Chromebooks can connect to your home internet. If you would like to update the request form, please fill out the request form again.

Thank you for your continued cooperation through these challenging times.

Please email mark_malone@rimsd.k12.ca.us if you have any questions.",2020-07-27 13:10:26,,

The CDC is the Center for Disease Control and Prevention which gives guidelines for the United States. The local Health Department is an organization that give guidelines to each County. The CDE is the California Department of Education which gives guidelines to school districts.

A reminder that meal and packet distribution is today. We have moved to a curbside delivery model so please stay in your car following the traffic pattern at each of the 3 elementary school sites. When it is your turn to receive meals and or packets, we ask for you to follow county guidelines when rolling down your window by having on a mask/masks for pick-up. Should your car have a trunk or hatchback we ask that you pop it open and staff will place the food directly in the back. Should you not have a trunk or hatchback we will leave the food next to the car. Please wait until the employee has moved 6 feet from your vehicle before opening the door to collect the food. Meal and packet distribution will remain on Wednesdays from 11:00 to 1:00 until May 27. There will be no meal or packet distribution after May 27, 2020.

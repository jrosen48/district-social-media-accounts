These will count as attendance days, so we will not be making them up at the end of the year. Our first day of student attendance will now be Monday, August 24th.

It's a pretty good day to be a Tiger. Thank you ROWVA. Today, and every day. Together we'll get through this and come out stronger on the other side.

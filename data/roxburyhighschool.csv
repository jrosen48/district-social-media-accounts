Message from Roxbury Superintendent Loretta Radulic

Due to continued power outages and road closures, we are going to delay Roxbury Public Schools for tomorrow Monday, March 5th.

At this point, we have one school without power in the district, Nixon elementary school. In addition, the HS will have reduced lunch options due to power issues in the kitchen area. We have plans in place to make accommodations in both situations.

We will be receiving updated information from the police, DPW, OEM and JCP & L by 5pm this evening.

If you don't hear from me, plan on a delay for Monday. Details for Nixon elementary students and HS students will be send out by the principals this evening.

Our thoughts are with all of those without power. Have a good afternoon.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1155722531197945&id=204852292951645,,0.0,"ROXBURY SCHOOLS ANNOUNCEMENT 3/4/18:

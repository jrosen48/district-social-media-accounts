In honor of Giving Tuesday today, Rox-THON is asking you to consider making a donation. Not only will we continue our mission of funding the new Valarie Center and family care in Goryeb Children's Hospital, and pediatric cancer research through Four Diamonds, but we also plan to allocate a portion of these proceeds to assist with PPE and/or providing meals for health care workers within the Atlantic Health System. If you are able, we ask that you help support these individuals in a time of need. Our efforts will continue through our event, which has been rescheduled to be virtual on Friday, May 29th.

Let's all create a picture or poster of those who have helped us during this Flexible Instruction time and hang them in our windows to show our gratitude so when people are out taking a walk they can see how strong Roxbury is as a community. Feel free to take a picture too and send them to goodnews@roxbury.org. #RoxburyStrong #AtTheRox,2020-03-25 09:20:40,,

I see some posts about educational sites to visit, and I just wanted to let all the parents out there know that I've been compiling lists of just that. As the HS Librarian, I've been focusing on the older kids, but I have added elementary resources as well, and I will continue to add as I find more. Please check it out, and if any of your kids need help with anything, feel free to reach out to me or any of the other fabulous Librarians in our district. Click on the Flexible Instruction link and navigate to Online Educational Resources. There are tabs for Arts, Cultural, and Elementary. But have your kids check out the whole site, there's lots of research help and ways to get eBooks as well. Hope everyone is coping through these tough times! I'm at rcaivano@roxbury.org

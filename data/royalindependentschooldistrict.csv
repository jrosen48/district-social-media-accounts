Respect his feelings. Teach him to view his mistakes as learning opportunities. And help him develop good study habits. When studying is routine, it's easier to deal with increasing workloads.

One effective way for your teen to prepare for the ""serious"" reading required in the upper grades is by reading things that are fun. The more your teen reads, the better and faster she'll read. To encourage pleasure reading, establish a family reading hour. Discuss your teen's interests, and help her find books and articles about them. And if she wants to watch a movie based on a book, have her read the book, first.

Experts agree that it's important to monitor and limit your child's recreational screen time. One way is to think about the times you rely on TV or screen devices as babysitters for your child, and to come up with alternatives. For example, if you turn on a screen to occupy your child while you make dinner, try doing some advance meal preparation. Or invite her into the kitchen to help you cook instead.

As winter break nears an end, help your child gear up to go back to school! Together, set some new learning goals. Make a new activity schedule that includes enough time for homework, reading and playing, too. If you need to, reestablish a reasonable school-night bedtime and revive a family reading time. And be sure to remind your child that school is important and you expect him to do his best.

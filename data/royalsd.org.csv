Today, I’m making the hard decision to extend the closure order through the end of the school year.

To families: I know that it’ll be difficult to find a new normal at home. But we must put the health and safety of our community first. And the past three weeks have shown that we are up to the challenge.

To educators: I know this is no small feat. We have 150 years of experience with our traditional learning model. We can’t make that up overnight.

I’m asking our students and our educators to be flexible. We all have our students’ best interests at heart.

I’m encouraged by the work our school districts are already doing, from serving over 2 million meals in three weeks to providing childcare for people working at the frontline of our state’s response.

We must continue to be proactive in our response to COVID-19. Listening to, and acting on, the best available science will continue to save lives.

We’ll get through this together.

Some students learned this first hand as they were given candy but there was not enough for everyone. The students had to solve the problem to make things fair. The solution: The students said, ""We will share ours, as that is only fair."" Other students found out that just because one person might need special help in a situation, does not mean the whole class needs that same type of help. What is important is that students get the help THEY need which makes it equal but not necessarily fair as some may have to do additional work to learn something. Finally, May Students of the Month Awards, A/R Point Awards, and Runner Awards were handed out for the Month of May.",2019-05-31 11:46:22,,

We certainly were not disappointed as each grade-level performed their own musical with grades K-1 performing in the morning and another concert featuring grades 2-3 was held in the afternoon. This allowed for more seating space and parents to come and go as needed as many needed to come from work to see their child's performance. Overall, the audience was quite impressed with the quality of the performances.",2019-05-06 12:16:53,,

The Royal High School Class of 1969 is planning their 50th class reunion.

Here we are 50 years down the road from our Royal High School graduation. WOW! Mark your calendars for July 13, 2019. The Royal City Summerfest parade and celebration are scheduled that weekend in Royal. They have offered to set up a table somewhere in the park area for us to gather and visit. If you are interested in riding in the parade please contact Patti George (Selzler ). We have a room secured for 7pm at Chico’s Pizza Parlor in Moses Lake to gather for dinner. The closest hotel to Chico’s is probably Ten Pin Inn & Suites beside the bowling alley. The goal of this reunion is simply to gather and reconnect so no elaborate plans have been made. Please pass this announcement on to any class member that you may have contact with. The email address list from 10 years ago is not working for me.

Also, check out Royal City Summerfest on Facebook to see what other activities are happening that weekend.

I hope to see many of you there.

The Royal High School Class of 1969 is planning their 50th class reunion.

Here we are 50 years down the road from our Royal High School graduation. WOW! Mark your calendars for July 13, 2019. The Royal City Summerfest parade and celebration are scheduled that weekend in Royal. They have offered to set up a table somewhere in the park area for us to gather and visit. If you are interested in riding in the parade please contact Patti George (Selzler ). We have a room secured for 7pm at Chico’s Pizza Parlor in Moses Lake to gather for dinner. The closest hotel to Chico’s is probably Ten Pin Inn & Suites beside the bowling alley. The goal of this reunion is simply to gather and reconnect so no elaborate plans have been made. Please pass this announcement on to any class member that you may have contact with. The email address list from 10 years ago is not working for me.

Also, check out Royal City Summerfest on Facebook to see what other activities are happening that weekend.

I hope to see many of you there.

You may be aware of the MOMO Challenge that has recently been in the news. In our schools we are not aware of any students actually watching or spreading videos but we have had some kids who have heard about MOMO and are talking about it. We don't want to bring awareness to it if students don't know about it but we don't want to ignore it either. It’s something our staff are watching closely.

Whether the MOMO Challenge is real, a hoax, or just a creepy character, it does remind us all of a few things: Know what your kids are doing online and on social media. Set parental controls on devices. Talk with your child about online safety.

Here is some additional information about this topic. With everyone aware and working together we can ensure this doesn't become a major problem in our community.",,,0.0,"Parents,

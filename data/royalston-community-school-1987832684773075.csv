Dear Parent/Guardian,



As you may be aware, the Athol-Royalston Regional School District is planning for a full reopening of school this fall. This means that students will return to school as close as possible to the normal date in late August.



In order to ensure the district can meet safety regulations put forth by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, we must gather information on each of your children. Please fill out this survey using a new survey for each child who attends ARRSD schools by no later than July 30, 2020.

BREAKING: A victory today in the Senate as we passed a bill to require DESE to waive the MCAS requirement for this academic year!

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, you may know that I was a strong and vocal opponent of high-stakes standardized testing.

In addition to waiving MCAS requirements for this academic year, I firmly believe that we must suspend the high-stakes nature of the test for the next six years at minimum.

The seismic impact of the current disruption in learning will be felt for at least that period of time.

Today is a good first step, but we must go further. What happens next year and in the years after is still unknown. The provision to cancel MCAS must now be considered by the House.",0.0,"Senator Jo Comerford

Athol/Royalston families. I encourage you all to take these meals Mon-Friday. Every child under 19yrs in our town is eligible to have these meal. If you have little one at home you can take meals for them as well as your school age children to age 18 yrs. The schedule for pick up is running like a 2 hour delay for elementary. So if your elementary bus usually stops at 7:45, then it will be 9:45. High school and middle school routes will not be running but those meals will be available on the elementary route, so check times to see when we will be in your area.
This is what we handed out today for breakfast and lunch.",0.0,"🍎 🚌 ❤️

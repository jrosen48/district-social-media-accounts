Middle School students will once again be receiving laptops for the 2017-2018 school year. More information will follow regarding the distribution dates for the laptops in early September.

The district will be offering families Protection Insurance Coverage on laptops to protect against items such as damage and theft. The cost for the coverage is $50 per device per school year.

Many families incurred repair bills in excess of $300.00. In a few cases, the repair bills exceeded $900.00 due to the multiple times the laptop was damaged. The insurance payment of $50.00 may be paid at the time of distribution, by check, M.O. or cash.

While coverage is not mandated, I strongly urge you to save now for the $50.00 fee for insurance that all families are offered. This will ensure you will not incur these repair bills later.

Please continue to check your email periodically for further notices from the Middle School.

I have very sad news. It is with a heavy heart, I am emailing to let you know John Arietano, our assistant band director, has passed away, just today. I am canceling percussion ensemble for this Saturday morning (tomorrow). I will be sending your child an email cancelling the rehearsal, but will not give a specific reason, only to check with their parent for more information. I know it is late and many students may not get the email. I will be at the school at my normal time along with counselors (beginning at 9am) if anyone would like to speak with me or a school counselor. Our number one priority is your child. Please speak to your child about John, all of our kids loved and respected him.

I will share the information regarding condolences when it becomes available.

Thank you,

Getting Started With Trauma-Informed Practices

Rocketoons
June 28, 2019 at 2:25 PM ·

“If you’re fearful, if you’re anxious, if you’re distracted by something that has happened to you, you literally can’t learn. Your brain shuts down. So it’s essential to give kids social and emotional tools to recover from the challenges they have experienced.

Take actual classroom time to work on the building blocks of how to perceive your emotions, how to talk about them, how to get along with other people, how to take a moment and become calm when you need to, how to express your needs so that others can meet them.”

“If you’re fearful, if you’re anxious, if you’re distracted by something that has happened to you, you literally can’t learn. Your brain shuts down. So it’s essential to give kids social and emotional tools to recover from the challenges they have experienced.

Take actual classroom time to work on the building blocks of how to perceive your emotions, how to talk about them, how to get along with other people, how to take a moment and become calm when you need to, how to express your needs so that others can meet them.”

Good morning Rockets,

You may or may not know that today was supposed to be ""student count day."" It is a day that the state uses to help determine funding for each school. Because of the snow day, count day has been moved to tomorrow, Thursday, February 14. We are aware that some will be missing due to plans to extend mid-winter break. If your son or daughter is going to be missing for any reason tomorrow, PLEASE do us a favor and call in to your child's school to report the absence. When absences are ""reported"" by parents, it gives us a window of time to still count them as students.

Thanks a ton for your help with this.

Sincerely,

Steve

As we look forward to starting full practices this week (positive thoughts for the weather) a few reminders to share with all who will be at the fields this season:
No smoking on the fields or within the parking lots. This is a school policy and we are occupying their space.
No dogs on the fields during practice times or games. This includes old dogs, young dogs, big dogs, and little dogs.
Please throw trash in trash bins. We have them staggered around the facility.
We do have a lost and found. So if you misplace something check in with us at the clubhouse it may have been returned here.
Playing is for the kids. Spectating is for the families and friends. Coaching is for the coaches.
Please have a whole lot of fun this Spring and cheer enthusiastically for ALL players.

I graduated from Grand Valley State University where I was a Physical Education major.

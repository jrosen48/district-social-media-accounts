The Parent Guide to At-Home Learning offers tips for how to prepare students for the at-home learning environment. The guide also includes a Google Classroom parent’s overview video. Presented in English and Spanish.

At-home learning is new, different, and temporary. We eagerly await to resume instructing, guiding, and encouraging students in-person on our campuses.

Printed take-home packets will continue to be available at our curbside breakfast and lunch distribution sites for students who would prefer printed materials or who may continue to have limited access to devices or the Internet.

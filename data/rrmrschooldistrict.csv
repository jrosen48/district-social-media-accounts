Cameron Johnson ROCKED her All-State audition today!! She‚Äôs the first person on the list which means she was the best clarinet to to be chosen in Hampton to play in the All-State band. 24 clarinets auditioned at Hampton, 1 gets accepted into the orchestra, 9 accepted into the band. Statewide, approximately 232 clarinets audition for All State, only 84 get accepted. Basically, it‚Äôs a HUGE deal Cameron made it and for the 3rd year in a row! She is so deserving of this opportunity and we are so proud of her! Tell her congrats if you have the chance!",0.0,"RRMR Band Department

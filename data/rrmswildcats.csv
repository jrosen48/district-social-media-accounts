The River Ridge Middle School Student Council would like to THANK YOU for placing an order for the 2019-2020 Spirit Wear. We had an overwhelming response to this event. The total number of items ordered 847! Thank you for making our first attempt at a school wide order a HUGE success.

We spoke with the print company on 12/11/2019 to see when they would have our order ready. They are hoping to get it to us by 12/19/2019 but cannot guarantee that the full order will be ready. This is due to the large number of items along with all of their other holiday and regular orders.

We apologize for any inconvenience that this will cause. We know that some of you are wanting to use them as holiday gifts we will do our best to get your orders to you ASAP.

To ensure that we do not run into this time crunch next year we will send the order forms out in October. We were not expecting (but are very appreciative) to have the number of orders that we did this first year.

With Many Sincere Thanks

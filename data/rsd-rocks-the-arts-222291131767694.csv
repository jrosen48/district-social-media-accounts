Atlas and P. Jean meet for the first time! 💛 I started this animation two weeks ago with one idea in mind- make a 60 sec. animation for Black and Afro-Latino kids to SEE themselves being awesome in claymation! I wish I had a cartoon that looked like me while growing up- a cartoon, a picture book character, a movie, a puppet, a stop-motion... ANYTHING. That never happened for me as a kid, so I’d like to change that in some way 🌈. Discovering what I can create during quarantine has sent me on a new and exciting mission— Izzy’s Clay House pledges to be a place where BIPOC kids can SEE THEMSELVES navigating the real and imaginary world with POWER, whimsy, magic, and a bit of claymation! A space for ALL kids, big and small. 💛 .

Hey, Red Knights! It's the start of Poetry Out Loud season, and I was hoping that maybe a few of you POL veteran alums would like to help an old teacher out...
If you have the time, send me a short video of yourself talking about what participating in Poetry Out Loud has taught you, or how it has benefited you in your life beyond the walls of The Castle, or anything else you'd like to say about the Poetry Out Loud program at RHS.
I'm trying to get my juniors INSPIRED to recite, and I would love your help!
Here are the options you can use to send me your clips:
1. Use the QR code below or this link: https://flipgrid.com/10996254 on your phone to create a video directly in my FlipGrid
2. email your video to me at: sechlep@readingsd.org or
3. DM me your video here on the FB!
Feel free to share this post with other Red Knights who were POL kids, too!

Hey, Red Knights! It's the start of Poetry Out Loud season, and I was hoping that maybe a few of you POL veteran alums would like to help an old teacher out...
If you have the time, send me a short video of yourself talking about what participating in Poetry Out Loud has taught you, or how it has benefited you in your life beyond the walls of The Castle, or anything else you'd like to say about the Poetry Out Loud program at RHS.
I'm trying to get my juniors INSPIRED to recite, and I would love your help!
Here are the options you can use to send me your clips:
1. Use the QR code below or this link: https://flipgrid.com/10996254 on your phone to create a video directly in my FlipGrid
2. email your video to me at: sechlep@readingsd.org or
3. DM me your video here on the FB!
Feel free to share this post with other Red Knights who were POL kids, too!
Thanks in advance! ❤️ you all!!!",2019-10-24 15:33:44,,

Hi again everyone! It seems there was a major error in the original obituary that I did not catch when it was given to me to post, so for that I am sorry. With permission from the original author, a team of us got together and made some changes. Again, if you could please share this, it would be much appreciated. The original post I made was deleted.

I want to express my deep gratitude to each of you during the end of this year. Since early in my education career, I have looked to John Wooden and his pyramid of success to help me lead. You took his two cornerstones and ran with them. Your ""industriousness"" and ""enthusiasm"" during this time became, pardon the pun, infectious. You took on the challenge to change how you do your job and made the best of a bad situation. Your hard work and willingness to change astounded me and I want to say THANK YOU!

GYSD is the largest youth and civic action event in the world.
It aims to engage K-12 youth with community service.

Many people across the Flathead Indian Reservation have
been isolated due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so this year’s
event aims to boost community morale and increase
community engagement – while following social distancing and stay at home orders. In short, we are making a book to
showcase the creativity of community members.
We want to see what creative projects you have been working on since school has been out! Submit pictures of your creative expressions for inclusion in a community morale-boosting book.
Any K-12 youth are encouraged to participate!

Contact project coordinator Megan Ahern at (406) 270-9614
or ahern@mtcompact.org. She will send you a media release
form, and you just need to sign it and send it back along with a
picture or scan of the creative project you want to showcase.
Please note that submissions will be included in a book that
will either be published in hard copy or online!

March is Women's History Month. To honor our amazing Native Women, we will be posting a prominent Indigenous Woman everyday, both past and present.

Day 23 goes out to Jillene Joseph, an enrolled member of the Gros Ventre people of Fort Belknap, Montana. No matter where you go in Indian Country, you've probably heard Jillene's name (or laugh 😊), or you've heard of the Native Wellness Institute, in which she is the Executive Director. Jillene founded the NWI in 2000, but has been serving Native communities for over 30 years. ""I was born to be positive and I am making darn sure that I'm leaving that legacy for my children and every life that I touch and touches me.

The Native Wellness Institute is happy to announce our schedule for the first week of our Native Wellness Power Hour! This is our response to the global pandemic and many people have put their minds together to make this happen.

The Montana Office of Public Instruction is not recommending that we close schools at this time. Therefore, our schools will remain open at this time. From the meeting, we were told the only way schools could be closed is by the Governor, by the County Health Department or by a local school board. If a local school board was to close a school, those days would most likely need to be made up. The Governor could cancel school and shorten the school year if he chooses.

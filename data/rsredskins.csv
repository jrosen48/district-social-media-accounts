That's a wrap on Summer Pride 2020. These young men and women showed resiliency and flexibility in the face of an ever changing situation and it will make all the difference in their individual sports. I'm proud of the coaches who helped this summer make this happen. It wasn't easy and required more effort to help our kids get better and make up ground coming out of quarantine. I don't buy into the negativity, I'm excited to see what these young men and women do this school year. We've started to adopt the fight and mentality of not being victims. We don't GET TO play or HAVE TO play anyone. They HAVE TO PLAY US! It's not longer why us? It's #WHYNOT us? Great summer, Redskins! Let's get after it! #rUShvseverybody #EAT #EarnIt",0.0,"#WhyNot

Four years ago we started a scholarship in her memory! This scholarship is awarded to a Rush Springs Senior each year. This scholarship has nothing to do with academic or athletic achievements, this scholarship is all based on character; the kind of character that makes a difference! This scholarship is awarded to a student who sees those kids others don‚Äôt, who is kind, compassionate, and a light in their hallways and community!

It is a great undertaking and quite impressive for such a small district. They asked me if I‚Äôd like to volunteer.

Well, we arrived this morning hoping to punch a few tickets to State, but we fell short. Couldn‚Äôt be more proud of this group over the past month, grinding and competing to get better. They are laying the foundation for the future of Rush Springs Athletics, and now it‚Äôs time to take this new strength and turn it in to explosive power on the track, diamond, field, and court.

We still set several PR‚Äôs today!

Deadlift
Kenton Jones 290 (+15)
Kade Worden 385 (+20)
Haygon Jennings 260 (+15)
Caden Moore 425 (+20)
Matthew Aucoin 235 (+10)

We still have one more meet on Monday with our girls headed to girls state in Dickson!

Every day is a great day to be a Redskin!

2nd hour experienced WWI first hand, with a battle and a discussion after about the experience and how it relates to our current unit. We even had a stalemate at the end.

It has taken 2 full nights of uploading (country wifi does not like winter weather in case you were wondering) but I finally have the Lil Skins action shots from last weekend in a gallery. You can purchase action shots through the link below. They're 2.00 per image and the download will be sent directly to you once the purchase is complete. And don't forget I love tag backs on the social media ;)

Also just a reminder: we'll be doing half of the Lil Skins team photos this Saturday the 8th and the other half Thursday the 13th and I can't wait!!! <3

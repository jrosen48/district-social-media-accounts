Take a look at what one of our students, Kailey-Anne, created! Great job, and thank you for sharing it with us!

If you want to participate, the full challenge is below. Send us pictures of what you create!

""My challenge to you all if you are up to it is this: I have heard rumors that toilet paper is a hot commodity so I’m guessing that you may find and empty cardboard roll or two around your house. I would like you to create something positive using at least one empty cardboard tube. This can be something that creates beauty, kindness, or is helpful. Let’s see how creative we can be. Use your imagination and make sure all materials used are appropriate (meaning don’t use your mom’s necklace or your siblings cherished item). Think along the lines of recycling, or craft materials you already have. The idea is to have fun and think out of the box.""",0.0,"https://www.facebook.com/112197110129912/posts/228115665204722/

Football Update for RSU 18 Munchkins

Messalonskee Youth Football
August 10 at 3:45 PM ·

Hey all! Just an update that we still plan on having a season, but not what we tradionally do. We will most likely be offering a flag footall program of some sort. The Kennebec Valley Youth Football league is meeting this week to discuss this and more updates are to come when we know more. The season would not start for our program until beginning of September after labor day. We have already been informed that Augusta is not going to be playing football outside of their community this year. Before any official decision is made, our program will still need to consult with the high school coach, athletic directors, Superintendent, oakland rec etc to make the best informed decision. We still need permission to use facilities for practice, games and a lot of other considerations that are currently being evaluated. Thank you all so much for your patience as we will know a lot more in the coming week. Please share, and GO EAGLES!",0.0,"Vanessa Doyon shared a post to the group: James H Bean PTO.

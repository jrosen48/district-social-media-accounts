Message from Superintendent Chris Downing Re: School Closure

Schools will be closed starting Monday, March 16th and will remain closed through Friday, March 27th. I wanted to communicate this news to you as soon as possible so you may begin planning for child care and other concerns that will be raised by this decision. On or before Thursday, March 26th, a decision on a potentially longer closure will be made based on the facts available at that time.

This closure is in response to the call by medical professionals to implement practices of social distancing and is not the result of any suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 in our community,

Thank you for your continued support of our students and our schools. More information will be mailed out tomorrow.

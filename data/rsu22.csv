Good morning from RSU 22,

This morning meal deliveries will occur throughout the district. Once again due to the weather being warm, we want to inform families that dairy and meat items will require refrigeration. You can expect our final meal deliveries of the school year on Friday June 5th and Wednesday June 10th. On Monday June 15th, Leroy Smith School will open as our summer meal pick up site. More details will come.

Just a reminder that online Parent Focus Groups will be hosted next week to share perspectives about your family's remote learning experiences.

The schedule is as follows and we hope you can join in:

Good morning from RSU 22,

This morning meal deliveries will occur throughout the district. Once again due to the weather being warm, we want to inform families that dairy and meat items will require refrigeration. You can expect our final meal deliveries of the school year on Friday June 5th and Wednesday June 10th. On Monday June 15th, Leroy Smith School will open as our summer meal pick up site. More details will come.

At the beginning of the pandemic, we all learned about the millions of pounds of 2019 fall harvest potatoes in the U.S. that were going un-sold to restaurants and schools that had closed. There were news reports that most of it would have to be scrapped and buried. Thanks to the mobilization of all of our food partners and creative thinking, most of 2019's crop has been saved and shared with the broader community through programs like ours. We thank all of you for your patience with the bags of potatoes we have been distributing this spring and summer that have less than perfect contents at times (who knew how bad a rotting potato can smell??) and hope that you've been able to ""edit"" out the bad ones and still make delicious meals with the rest (boiling, broiling, baking, smashing, sautéing, frying...). The great news is that the majority of those potatoes have not gone to waste, and you all helped with that. And also, the fall 2020 potatoes will be harvested soon and made available fresh this September! Bon appetit!",0.0,"Youth Full Maine

Hi Everyone! We have a SCHEDULE CHANGE ALERT starting this week for our Dayton, Saco, and OOB distributions, by a day each, but we're continuing distributions everywhere each week as usual. (Biddeford stays the same for Tuesdays.)

TUESDAYS, BIDDEFORD: curbside at BMS 10:30-noon, plus Bus Route 1 neighborhood route

WEDNESDAYS, DAYTON: curbside at Dayton Consolidated, 10:00-11:30 a.m.

THURSDAYS, SACO: curbside at Fairfield school: 11:30-12:30 p.m.

FRIDAYS, OLD ORCHARD BEACH: curbside behind Loranger school, 11:30-12:30 p.m.

We'll keep on distributing every week through the summer - this is just an adjustment to line up with each town's school meal distribution schedule.

You may have heard about the romaine lettuce recall. We want to ensure we have time to take the right measures to obtain romaine from safe growing areas. Therefore, we will NOT be serving our entree salads this week only. We will use this time to work with our food vendors to obtain romaine from safe fields when we return from Thanksgiving Break.

After attending a produce training at the US Dept of Agriculture last year, I’m glad to know they have already determined the growing area affected by this E. Coli outbreak. As you may remember, last November it took weeks upon weeks to determine the source, putting all romaine farmers in America in true devastation.

Please take the time to check any romaine you may have in your house and toss any lettuce grown in the Salinas, CA region. All romaine will say on the packaging where it was grown. Romaine grown anywhere else is perfectly safe to eat. 🥬

Happy Sunday,

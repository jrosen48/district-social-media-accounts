I made a woodworking breakthrough today. I've been frustrated for years by my inability to cut a board square. I made a great bench hook in my RSU 24 Adult Education woodworking class, which has helped me make good straight cuts, but the hope has always been that I'd eventually make straight cuts freehand.

I started out with nine boards to cut. I used the bench hook for the first three...then I started the next couple of cuts with the bench hook, then finished the cut freehand. For the last four cuts, I made the whole cut freehand.

I knew-because my teacher explained it- that I'd have to learn to lock my arm and elbow in a single plane, but today, I felt it actually happen.

Yes, I could have cut all this lumber in 20 minutes or less with a chop saw, but I wouldn't have this sense of satisfaction and achievement.

Thanks to my wonderful teacher, George Deans, and to RSU 24 Adult Education for making this proud moment possible.

The word Reiki is made of two Japanese words - Rei which means ""God's Wisdom or the Higher Power"" and Ki which is ""life force energy"". So Reiki is actually ""spiritually guided life force energy."" Come and align yourself with this healing energy. It is not massage and no touching of a body is needed to do Reiki on another person who is fully clothed. Both classes are needed to complete Reiki Level 1. Class size is limited. Please bring something to drink and your lunch.

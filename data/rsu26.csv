As part of the construction of the track/football complex, we had to remove the existing press box. However, we have found a use for the actual press box and will utilize it as the new Boosters Concessions down at the soccer-Field Hockey-Baseball-Softball area.

In order to make the building functional for what the Boosters provide, it will need some construction inside the building. This would include:

Closing in the walls where the studs are exposed
Adding both closed and open shelving for storage and counter space for appliances and serving
Removing one of the inner petition walls to open up the main serving area

Two to three people with a handy skill set would be more than enough and may take 2-3 days to accomplish. I will have Climo Electric come in and provide adequate electricity to meet their needs. All materials will be provided and will be on location.

Operation Breaking Stereotypes (http://ow.ly/CUti50zVD7c) has been in Orono Schools, Old Town Schools, and Indian Island School helping students develop their self-awareness, kindness, and leadership.

This year Operation Breaking Stereotypes students from Orono Middle School and Leonard Middle School believe that we need to see our common humanity, but we also need to stop and listen and be aware of who each person really is — not the labels and expectations that the world puts on us, but the raw, open, beautiful qualities each of us carries close to our hearts. Please watch this video and let these students inspire you to begin creating your new, open, and connected world.

Thank you to Nathan Manaker, OHS graduate and current student at Emerson College, for creating this “window into identity”!

SOUTHBOUND traffic from College Avenue to Bennoch Road will be ALLOWED at all times.

NORTHBOUND traffic heading from Bennoch Road to College Avenue on Stillwater Avenue will be PROHIBITED from 7 AM until 5:30 PM during the construction effort. Traffic will be ALLOWED from 5:30 PM - 7 AM.

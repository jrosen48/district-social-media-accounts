It looks like a good percentage of RSU #4 is either without power or without internet and from what I am hearing a good portion of our teachers are facing the same challenge today. So, that being said let's look at today as a ""make-up"" day! Work on the work you already have, check in through email/seesaw/google classroom if possible, and just breathe.

Hopefully this weather will go away and we can enjoy the weekend. Take care of yourselves and each other!

I am reaching out today to let you know that beginning on Monday, we will start Phase II of our Educational Plan. This means your students will be engaged in new learning activities with their teacher. I ask you to be patient with us and most importantly with yourselves as we attempt this. It is new to all of us and the best analogy I can think of is we are building an airplane while we are trying to fly it. Our staff has done an amazing job of trying to put this together to meet everyone's needs and I want to commend them publicly for all of their hard work.

Below is a video from Mrs. Martin and information that is a general overview of what we are doing. If you need support please don't hesitate to reach out to your child's teacher(s) or principal for help.

Lastly I want to give a big shout out to all of our Food Service staff, our bus drivers, and the volunteers that are working together to provide meals. The work they are doing is amazing and I want them to know how much I appreciate it.

Good Morning Everyone,
I wanted to reach out this morning and thank you all for the emails I have received regarding the change in food service. I appreciate the feedback and also the understanding that we are just trying to do what is right for our communities.

Given that, beginning this Friday, in addition to the bus runs, we will be adding the option to pick up a lunch at Central Office (971 Gardiner Road in Wales) from 10am-12pm on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. I am hopeful this will help to alleviate some of the concern I received with the bus runs.

As always I appreciate your patience and understanding as we navigate some difficult times.

Take care of each other,

Good Morning Everyone,
I wanted to update all of you that beginning tomorrow, we will be changing our lunch distribution. On Wednesday, our buses will run their elementary routes beginning at 10am. They will stop at their regular stops and wait to see if someone comes out. Please keep an eye out. Our amazing bus drivers will be doing their run twice so if you miss them the first time please keep an eye out for their second stop. This will be happening on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. I wish I could give you approximate times but at this point where this is the first time we are doing this I just cannot. Feel free to check out our website for stops along the route so if your child doesn't normally take the bus, you can meet them at any of the bus stops.

Thank you all for your patience and understanding as we navigate this ever changing situation. We are a strong community and I know that together we will get through this.

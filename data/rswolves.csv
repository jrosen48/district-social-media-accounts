Starting on Monday, June 8, our drive-through food service will resume but will be located at the Primary School. This service will be available to any school-age children. K-6 students who are enrolled in Summer School will receive free breakfast and lunch inside the building. We will share more details about the drive-through service before June 8.

The Reeds Spring School Foundation has awarded $250 scholarships to three high school students to help offset the costs of dual-credit courses.

Congratulations to RSHS students Loric Arnold, Brooke Davis, and Jacqueline Durant.

Dual-credit courses allow students to earn both high school and college credits. This gives students a head start on college and helps save them money because dual-credit courses at Reeds Spring High School cost much less than at a college.

Reeds Spring High School offers nearly 20 dual-credit courses, which add up to more than 50 hours of college credits.

The Reeds Spring School Foundation will award more scholarships in August.

The district is offering families the opportunity to retrieve any personal belongings that students still have inside of our buildings. This will occur on Monday, April 27 and Wednesday, April 29. The times are from 10:30 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. and 5:00 - 6:30 p.m.

For grades K-6, staff members have placed all student belongings in bags and they will be handed out in a drive-through line at each building. We also ask that you please return all library books at this time.

For grades 7-12, students may enter the building to clean out their lockers. They must first check-in at the front office. We will only allow a small number of students to enter at one time.

If you are unable to visit the schools during any of the times listed above, we will offer another opportunity at some point in the summer.

We are making an adjustment to our meal distribution program starting on Monday, March 30. To ease the burden on families driving to get meals each day, we will begin serving the meals only on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. We will hand out two days worth of meals at a time, so we are providing the same amount of food.

The times remain the same: 10:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. at Reeds Spring Middle School, and 10:30 a.m. - 11:30 a.m. at our remote locations, which are the Kimberling City Shopping Center, Indian Point Chamber of Commerce, and Cape Fair Eagles Lodge.

Also, we want to get an accurate count of how many people still need this service, so we are asking that you please register again. The sign-up form can be found on the link below, or you may also sign-up over the phone by calling 417-248-7008.

During a time when there are more questions than answers about COVID-19, the Rosedale Union School District leadership team is planning for all kinds of possibilities for the return to school in the fall of 2020.

Will students return on staggered schedules to accommodate the need for social distancing?

Will teaching be a hybrid of distance and in-person learning?

Will some prefer only distance learning?

How might social distancing requirements influence transportation and school lunch programs?

As you might imagine, it is an incredibly complex and constantly changing environment. As part of that process, RUSD wants to hear from parents and community members so that we can best meet your individual needs.

Please take a moment to fill out this short survey by May 27th.

Norica, we can’t express enough how proud you have made us throughout your journey, from our hometown (North of Philippines) to Dubai & now in Bakersfield. I see you literally work hard, adapting to the culture, and coping with the changes. At school, I have seen you work hard and balancing your studies and helping our family. Despite you are a month late with the 2019-20 school year, yet you still manage to be one of the honor students. You’re such a talented daughter and we are sure you will continue to excel with your given path. What you learn now can be used for the future so don’t stop exploring and do what’s right. You are good enough to face high school life.
We’re all here to support you big sister, AIM HIGH! Love lots

Love,
Daddy, mommy, Johnny baby!

With warmer temperatures ahead of us, the Rosedale Union School District will be adjusting meal distribution times to limit heat exposure to our employees providing meals. Starting tomorrow, May 5th, Grab’N’Go meals will be provided to children ages 2 to 18 between 10:30AM and 12:00PM Monday -Thursday.
Thank you to the Rosedale Community for your continued support.

Over the past several weeks, it has never been more evident that together, we are #RosedaleStrong❤️ Everyone working together for the greater good of our students, and community is certainly our superpower! ✨💫

In an effort to give back to those in need during these uncertain times, we have collaborated with Trek Imaging to create a fundraising t-shirt displaying our new motto, #RosedaleStrong❤️

The Rosedale Union School District has a long history of assisting families with referrals to the Golden Empire Gleaners Food Bank. When called upon, the Gleaners quickly meet the needs of our families seeking assistance. With each sale of our #RosedaleStrong❤️ t-shirt, 100% of the proceeds will go directly to the Gleaners.

We hope you will consider purchasing our fabulous new swag!!! ☺️

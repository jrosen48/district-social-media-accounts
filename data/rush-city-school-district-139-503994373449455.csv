Just a Reminder:

The first couple of weeks of in-person school will focus heavily on building relationships, making connections, and learning or remembering how to ""do school."" This is especially important for our primary learners as school is still very new to them. At this time, distance learning lessons will be different. Distance learners (DLs) will not need those same skills but will need e-learning skills. Full distance learning lessons will launch (six digital lessons per day) starting on Sept. 17th. This also allows time for DLs to get their devices if they have not and troubleshoot their technology. DLs will also be contacted by their teacher regarding other items they may need to pick up, such as math book consumables and handwriting paper for younger students.

Lots of flexibility will be allowed as we all, school and families, settle into this new normal.

You should hear from your teacher by Wednesday at the latest. Feel free to join the morning getting-started zoom with Mrs. Kurvers!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=965293223986232&id=503994373449455,,0.0,"Hello Jacobson Distance-Learning Families,

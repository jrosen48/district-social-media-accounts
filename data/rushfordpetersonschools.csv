Due to the likelihood of rain Friday morning and the fact that we have to be outside for strength and conditioning we are moving Friday's lifting sessions to tomorrow (Thursday!). The times will stay the same: Boys 7-8 am and Girls 8-9 am with the extra session at 10:45. I know this is a little late notice, but I hope everyone can still make it.

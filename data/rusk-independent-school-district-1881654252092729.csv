Rusk ISD Community,

On Wednesday January 16th during the morning bus route a student was allegedly heard making a threatening statement. The campus Administration was notified immediately by transportation and the student was escorted to the office shortly after arrival. As soon as the student was thoroughly searched and questioned the campus took appropriate disciplinary action. Law enforcement was contacted and an investigation is currently being conducted. I want to thank our Transportation Department,Campus Administration, and the Rusk Police Department for their quick response and continued dedication to provide a safe environment for our students.

I want to remind and assure everyone that any threat made against Rusk ISD and it’s students will not be tolerated. Individuals who make threats will be dealt with immediately and the disciplinary action taken will be to the maximum extent allowed by law.

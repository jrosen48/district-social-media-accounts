**OUTAGE ALERT**

An #UnplannedOutage occurred this morning after an ALDOT tractor mowing the right of way destroyed the main fiber cable pedestal providing service to the areas of Seale, Hurtsboro, and Hatchechubbee.

We understand a social media post and call was made by Russellcsd stating that the service could take up to two days to repair. We have reached back out to them as this will not be the case. Due to the severity of the damage, the restoration is taking much longer than normal, but we expect to have the schools restored by this afternoon and the remaining homes and businesses restored by tomorrow morning. Our dedicated technicians will work hard to get every customer back online as quickly as possible. *Please view updates via this post as we have them.*

Due to the outage, we are still taking calls however because of this outage, we have a unusually high call volume.

As we begin the school year in a remote learning environment, we know that students will have different needs for support due to technology access. It is important that parents make teachers aware of their household’s technology needs during the first week of school.

Remote learning is intended to provide flexible access to instruction. Students may login to their Google Classroom at any time to access lessons and learning resources. Students may also work at their own pace to complete and submit assignments by the stated deadline. In the event that a live lesson is scheduled for student support, the teacher will communicate the specific time for that lesson based on information communicated by parents.

We appreciate your support, patience, and flexibility as we begin this year. Please reach out to your teachers and schools if you have any questions.

May 1st is National Principal’s Day! Let’s take a moment and wish Mr. Michael Kilpatrick happy and blessed Principal Day. Mr. Kilpatrick sets high expectations and he empowers the faculty, staff, and students at RCHS to achieve those expectations. He arrives early and stays late. He is a game changer, an influencer, educator, mentor, highly skilled instructional leader, and he has a heart of gold. We love you, Mr. Kilpatrick.

Friday was a busy day in 3rd grade! Students presented their Cereal Box book reports and commercial! It was exciting to hear what books their peers read and how they created a cereal from it. Then they tried to persuade us to buy it with a 30 second commercial add. They even included a game on the back and a special prize inside in relation to their book. Students were also required to include characters, setting, and a summary of the book. It was a great time to review Author’s purpose as well. I am SO proud of all of their hard work!

Federal funds that pay for road construction, school programs, healthcare needs and a variety of other services that make the quality of life better in Northwest Kansas are distributed on the basis of census results. That's just one important reason everyone who lives here needs to be counted in the 2020 U.S. Census! Please make sure your rural friends and neighbors respond. They can do it by phone at 1-844-330-2020, online at 2020census.gov or through the mail.

More than 70 percent of Kansans responded to the census in 2010 before census takers began their work. The state's current response rate is 65.4 percent. After you've responded, think of five people who you could call and remind or offer assistance to and make sure they respond as well. Let's all do our part to bring that number up! #CallForTheCount #KansasCounts",0.0,"If you’ve not filled out the census yet please be sure to do so soon. Every single person counts ☺️

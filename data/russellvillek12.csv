I seriously cannot wait to celebrate the sweet class of 2021, watch the M100’s debut halftime performance of “Happy Together,” and cheer on our Golden Tigers under the Friday night lights! I have all the love in the world for these students! 🥰🐯🖤 #mindsetmatters #cantmaskourexcitement #makeeverymomentcount #itsGREATtobeaGoldenTiger",2020-09-04 17:59:15,,

Great first day @RussellvilleK12 thus far. I even got to walk into school with my girl for the first day of her senior year. I began superintendency the year she started K. Hard to believe she’s a senior. Sure do love this girl.
Our faculty and staff are amazing btw. They have worked extremely hard in order for us to get to a point where we could start safely and continue with a strong academic program.

As state leaders continue to work on options for remote learning when/if that becomes necessary, the Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE) has partnered with the University of Alabama to conduct a statewide school technology survey to determine specific technology needs.

The purpose of this survey is to build a statewide database that shows Internet connectivity and Internet-enabled digital device availability for students throughout the state.

Whether a student is attending school in a traditional classroom setting, virtually, or a blended version of traditional and virtual, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE TO FILL OUT THIS SURVEY since the answers will be used to inform decision makers as they expand remote learning capabilities this school year.

The deadline for completing the survey is Friday, July 31, 2020.

As most of you know our players normally get a breakfast before workouts and a lunch at the conclusion of workouts but because of COVID-19 we aren’t able to feed our guys in June.

That’s where Kevin Touchtone of Pilgrims of Russellville stepped in. For the month of June our kids will now get 2 granola bars for breakfast and get 2 PB&J sandwiches for lunch to go with their protein shakes

Yesterday was HORRIBLE! I’m not going to lie!
I cried most of the day. Anxieties were really high.

They had to go back to pretty high settings on bipap and they left it there over night to give his lungs more time to rest.

We had a good night... Jagger rested well. He needed it after the night before.

Much better day today.
His blood gas is better.

He has air movement in his lungs again.

They got a sample of Sputum and the cultures are growing staph and there is a signal for candida present in current Karius, so they have made his meds more specific and hopefully that can prevent the need for more invasive procedures.

They are starting TPN for nutrition.

They are going to try and wean him one setting today on bipap and leave it until late this afternoon to see how he tolerates.

His lungs are very sick!

We need your prayers!!!

We loved seeing everyone and being able to be together (6 feet apart) today. We have missed everyone so much and can’t wait to get back to normal. #TeacherAppreciation2020",2020-05-11 22:48:55,,

Class of 2020

While the last part of your senior year did not go as you may have planned, it’s moments such as these that creates the most memories, opportunities, and most importantly growth.

Grow from this experience, use it as fuel to change yourself for the better, the society for the better and change the trajectory of your life towards bigger and better things.

The class of 2020 is a special group and the Quarantine of 2020 will only add to that legendary status.

The time of 8:20 pm was chosen as a significance to it being 2020 in military time.
We also ask our community to participate by turning on your porch lights tonight at 8:20 pm for 20 minutes so we, as a community, can show our Hope in a better tomorrow. I challenge RHS Football, Softball, & Tennis to turn on their lights for 20 minutes as well and other schools in our area to do the same.

RHS Parents and Students,

Today, Monday, April 6, 2020, you can expect a phone call, email, or text from your 3A block teacher.

Teachers will be asking several questions such as:

How are you?
Are you hungry?
Do you have internet connectivity?
Do you have a digital device?
What is the best way to communicate with you?

These questions will help us as we begin virtual learning of critical core content. We will also be providing supplemental enrichment materials for many of our content areas. This information will go home in packets or will be sent virtually through Google Classroom and posted online.

If you do not have a digital device or internet capabilities, please come by the RHS front circle to pick up your critical standard packets between 10 AM - 7 PM on Monday, April 13th.

If you have questions, feel free to email or call the main office. We will be checking messages daily and will do our best to respond within 24 hours. The main office number is 256-331-2110.",4.0,"Russellville High School

For almost two years I have worked in a school system where our safety (staff and students) has always been the top priority. I am so thankful for every administrator in Russellville City Schools! When I drove home from church tonight I saw that many of them were working late hours at the board and at their respective schools. This is unchartered territory for our schools. Be kind in your judgements and grateful that we have such champions working (and living) right here in Russellville. As a parent, I am so glad that I can keep my own babies at home. But as a teacher, I have a hard time letting go of your babies and their well-being. They all become such a huge part of my life and I am certainly going to miss them over the next 3 weeks. Our prayer is that a little time apart saves a lot of lives and keeps us all well.",2.0,"We are blessed with the best at RCS!

PROUD is an understatement of how we feel towards our students, faculty, and staff at RHS this week!

Yesterday, our 11th-grade students participated in an ACT Bootcamp to help prepare them for the BIG test. Students set goals, reviewed information, and got fired up for the test. The day ended with an ACT Pep Rally starring many students including members of the ACT 28+ and 30+ Clubs.

Today, 9th and 10th-grade students took a Mock ACT, 11th-grade students took the real ACT, and 12th-grade students participated in our first RHS Adulting Day.

We have heard numerous positive comments from our students and presenters about Adulting Day 2020. We had a phenomenal lineup of presenters that were prepared to help our students manage the transition from high school senior to adulthood. Students learned about insurance, banking, finances, interview tips, safety, college study skills, and more.

Avery is one of our new GTB volunteers! Avery is very involved in drama and music activities in our community. He also enjoys playing piano and guitar. This afternoon, he and his new Little enjoyed hanging out and building some things with the the ""Imagine"" building set and hitting a few licks on the guitar.",2020-03-04 17:57:22,,

Mrs. Parrish' first graders are working on decoding skill 1. Decoding skill 1 teaches readers that if there is just one guardian consonant following a vowel in a multi-syllabic word, the consonant will move on (""run"") to be with the vowel on the next syllable (""one must run"").

The past 2 days in science of technology, students took on the role of petroleum and chemical engineers by designing a solution for cleaning up an “oil spill.” Yesterday, they created their mini oceans with the pollutants and oil. Today, they budgeted their play money to purchase supplies to clean up the oil spill. They had a 15 min time limit to use their purchased supplies to clean up their oceans (with the oil and pollutants) and to document if their clean up methods were effective or not. This was probably one of my favorite labs we’ve done so far and the kids had a blast! #MakeADifference #NoMatterWhat Russellville Middle School Russellville City Schools",0.0,"Mrs. Lee's Science Class

WHY IS THE CENSUS IMPORTANT??

A full and accurate count is critical for Alabama’s schools because many of the federal programs that support public schools, their students and families distribute money to the state based on statistics. An undercount or drop in Census numbers for Alabama will mean less funding allocated to the state and – as an extension – to your schools.

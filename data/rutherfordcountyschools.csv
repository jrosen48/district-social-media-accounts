August 10, 2020

An MTSU program will enable high school students to take courses this fall that will introduce them to the study of nutrition.

One of the classes is “Nutrition across the Life Span,” which typically is taken in the sophomore year. Students take the exam in May after completing the high school class, and students who pass receive credit for MTSU’s “Principles of Nutrition” class.

The other class, “Nutrition Science and Diet Therapy,” typically is taken in the junior year. This class can be taken for dual enrollment and aligns with MTSU’s “Nutrition for the Health Sciences” class. As well as offering free college credit, completing dual enrollment classes may help students qualify for graduation with honors or distinction.

As with the first of every new school year, a few adjustments will be needed and made over the first few days.

We wanted to provide a quick update regarding Kiddom, the learning management system currently used by RCS. According to Kiddom, the issue this morning causing long wait times was caused by the number of students logging in for the first time, also known as provisioning. This caused a delay for all users in accessing the platform. We have shared our concerns and expectations with Kiddom and will continue to problem solve as issues arise.

Thanks again to everyone — employees, students and parents — for working together and being patient as we launch the new school year.

The scholarships are intended for those who are planning to further their education at a university, college or technical school.

Help us stop the ""summer slide""!

Summer break is typically a time for kids to relax, play, and embrace the freedom having almost no responsibilities. With school being canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic, “summer break” started much earlier in 2020 than in years past. All this extra free time can lead to summer slide, which is when kids lose some of their academic proficiency during summer break, and that can create hurdles to learning when they go back to school.

This year for Literacy Day of Action, United Way is hosting a drive to collect new or gently used books and other educational resources that children need during the summer months to help prevent summer slide. Join the effort now through June 16 by either donating in-person or purchasing from our Amazon Wishlist!

Parents will receive the survey via phone and email, but the system will only accept one response per method per household. Once a response has been recorded via one of those methods, the other options will no longer accept additional responses.

Again, the survey will begin Tuesday and repeat on Wednesday for those who have not yet responded. Thank you for participating.

The First Team Air Rifle club at Stewarts Creek High School finished first in the Tennessee regional qualifications for the JR. Olympic Match.

The team — Logan Chapman, Zachary Parsons, Jared Redito, Anthony Lamantia and Abby Highfill — has now qualified for the National Jr Olympic Match this summer at Camp Perry in Ohio.

Head coach Joel Payne will be requesting funding from the 7th Brigade to help with expenses of traveling to Ohio for the national event. There are no seniors on this year’s team and as good as they’ve performed, Payne expects them to be that much better a year from now.

The regional event was recently held at Montgomery Bell Academy in Nashville.

This is James Evans with Rutherford County Schools.

We want to let you now that we are releasing schools today two hours early because we want to ensure all buses complete the routes before dark. Again, we are releasing schools two hours early today, Dec. 10, 2019, to ensure all buses complete their routes before dark.

Schools will work with parents until all students are picked up.

Just to be clear, two hours early means you should take your child’s normal dismissal time and move it back two hours. For example, if your school normally releases at 2:30, it will release at 12:30 today. The same applies for bus stop times.

Thank you for all you do.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2565910373524079&id=1054439958004469,,0.0,"Hello parents,

Rutherford County Schools

More than 6,500 fourth- and fifth-graders representing every elementary school in Rutherford County cheered on the Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders men’s basketball team in their season-opening 119-61 win over Maryville.

Five hundred teachers, administrators and chaperones joined the students and bused over to the Murphy Center from their respective schools.

Halftime featured a game of musical chairs that started with one student representing each of the elementary schools, while a second student from the schools gathered in the tunnel to greet the Blue Raiders as they returned to the floor for the second-half of play.

It is the fourth consecutive year the Blue Raiders athletic department has hosted Rutherford County Schools.

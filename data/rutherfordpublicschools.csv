After choosing a multiplication sentence to “illustrate”, students then used cotton balls to create the factors and arranged them in arrays on a winter mitten that was posted on a Bulletin Board outside their classroom.

Should a one-session day be called because of inclement weather, students in 4-6 will be dismissed at 12:20 p.m.

It is imperative that your children know the procedures you expect them to follow upon leaving school.

The “Connect 5” system will notify parents by contacting phone numbers and/or email addresses currently on school records. Each Pierrepont Family received a “Connect 5” call earlier this year during our test run. If a phone or email contact has changed and the school has not been notified, the system will not be able to alert you to an emergency closing. Please keep the office informed of any changes.

Rutherford High School student, Kerry O’Keefe, is working with the Rutherford Public School District to educate students about the importance of recycling. Miss O’Keefe is currently working towards the Girl Scout Gold Award and has created activity books, posters and displays for students throughout the district.

At the Kindergarten Center, Miss O’Keefe created visuals to help remind students the importance of recycling and are displayed in our Multi-Purpose Room. As students learn about responsibility throughout the month of December, students are encouraged to be responsible when it comes to disposing their lunch waste while at school. Thank you Miss O’Keefe for the visuals to help make our students responsible citizens of Earth!

December Word from the Principal

It is hard to believe that we are in December already! It has been a very exciting time here at RHS with a successful fall season. The members of our National Honor Society competed in the annual Rutherford vs. Becton spelling bee on the day before Thanksgiving. Rutherford once again defeated Becton to start the holiday weekend off on a high note. Our band and choir students have been working extremely hard preparing for their Winter Concert, which will take place at 7:30 PM on December 12. December 20 will be a half-day and RHS will be having a holiday music assembly. We will return from our winter break on January 2. I wish all a safe and joyful holiday season and a happy new year.

It is hard to believe that the first trimester at the Kindergarten Center has come to an end. It is amazing to see the growth in each student since their very first day. Students have made new friends, explored various art mediums, created and repeated musical beats, explored new languages, and engaged in numerous team building activities.

The second trimester is just as exciting as students begin to apply many of the foundational skills in new ways. Writers are transitioning from labeling drawings to writing across pages, readers are applying letter/sound associations to decode new words and mathematicians are demonstrating number sense through 100.

This has already been such an exciting time of new opportunities and growth and we look forward to all that is to come.

Students at the Kindergarten Center have been focusing on gratitude during the month of November. Expressing thankfulness and appreciation for both the big and small things throughout the day has been encouraged and will be going forward. We are appreciative of the kindness of the Kindergarten Center families during the annual food drive. This is one of several acts of community service done at the Kindergarten Center. Our partnership with the RPD to feed the Humvee as a culminating activity is an exciting way to recognize the kindness of our students and their families.

The Kindergarten Center appreciates all of the continuous support by our parents as the district’s youngest learners are beginning their academic journey. On Tuesday, November 12, parents/guardians were invited into classrooms for a hands-on experience of what the day is like for their child! This engaging and exciting day was well attended. We look forward to a continued partnership as this journey continues!

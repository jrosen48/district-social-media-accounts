Hello All,
It's hard to believe this week wraps up the 2019-20 school year! It's been a super fast year of all things new for me, and ended in a very unique fashion! Truly an extremely memorable year for us all! With that said, I couldn't be more grateful to be a part of such an amazing team who has demonstrated high levels of collaboration and resilience. Thank you to everyone for welcoming me into the RMS and RHS school family, as this is where I plan to stay for a very long time! I love my role as School Counselor, the students, and working with each of you. As I work this summer to prepare for next year, I always welcome suggestions and input from you. Hope to see some of you at graduation this weekend! Wishing you a healthy, safe, and happy summer!

We are thrilled to offer NTI support and tutoring to your K-12 students. The attached flyer can be sent out to all teachers and families in your districts. We realize that some students need help when their teacher may not be available.

Thanks to a partnership with WKU, we have hundreds of tutors volunteering to help your students. We are treating this as a “phone a friend” opportunity, rather than a structured tutoring session. All help will be provided via Zoom. If you have a student who needs help and doesn’t have access to Zoom, please let us know. This service will start Thursday/Friday of this week, so feel free to send the information out to your parents and students now.

It's been a very long 2 weeks. I'm so grateful to work for a school who came together today to participate in a Wave Parade"" for our students. It was a long ride trying, our best to cover as much area as possible, but it was the best 3 hours I've had in 2 weeks!! Ryan and I got to do this together!!! Coach had his whistle out... LOL!! I miss my co-workers, students, and my normal routine life. Driving around today seeing their smiling faces with excitement, was so delightful! My eyes wanting to water a little bit thinking about these little people being home. Just wondering if they are all healthy, eating good, staying inside, getting help with their NTI packets, and having something to do. I'm so grateful for this day! It was great!!! I can't wait to see them inside our school again, hopefully sooner than later. Best day I've had in 2 weeks! Love my SES fam!!! #SESROCKS #WELOVEANDMISSOURSTUDENTS

This is an additional week of closure from the original announcement. We understand that the return date could be amended again to a later date, but both school systems wanted to provide timely notice of this additional week of closing as announced by the Governor and the Kentucky Department of Education Commissioner this afternoon. We understand that this continues to present challenges for our students and families, but with the help of our community partners, we will get through this challenging period in our lives.

Both districts will continue to provide food service options throughout the time that students are away from school. Please check each district website for additional information if needed.

On Monday, Feb. 10, Russellville Middle School hosted a Family Night for parents to engage with teachers by asking questions and gaining insight into the process of teaching and learning that is taking place there. They are in their second year of Summit Implementation at the middle school, but there are still components of the curriculum that sometimes parents or community members need to interact with to fully understand. The 6th and 7th grade teachers teamed up to become experts of summit learning to share some of its components with parents to help them better understand what their child is being taught. Family night was also an opportunity for parents to see projects that students had created during the 2nd and 3rd nine weeks of the school year. The 8th-grade teachers also held an informational meeting with parents about the 8th-grade trip to Washington D.C. in the spring to review logistics and fundraising ideas. Overall, this night was a success, and the staff is hoping for another great turnout next year!

The Deep Dive program is a Senior project facilitated by Superintendent, Bart Flener, to guarantee that all Russellville Independent School District Seniors accomplish “Russellville READY!” status which in turn demonstrates their 21st Century skills and the fact that they possess the requirements to be college or career ready. One group’s project goal was to help the Life Choice Pregnancy Center by donating money to support mothers who need assistance and supplies for their children. The members of the group were Rian Saul, Jasmaine Loving, Destiny Daniels, Robert Barnett, Sok Vanna, Eliyah MCarley, and Brandy West. Their goal was to present a competition between the RHS Panther Den classes. The class that donated the most money received an ice-cream sundae party as a reward. The winning class was Ms. Jesse Nugent’s with $60 total! Overall, this group made over $200 with the donations they received.

On Monday evening, Dec. 16, the Russellville Twenty-first Century Building was filled with festive decorations and delicious food. Superintendent, Bart Flener, was excited about the opportunity taken to show appreciation and feed the RISD Transportation, Facilities, and the Food Service Adult Team Members. These folks work diligently each day to provide for our students! #ComeHungryLeaveFull was the theme for the evening, and it appeared that the task was accomplished. Kelley Paul was instrumental in planning, decorating, and setting up the event. Under the Direction of Trevor W. Caldwell, approximately 14 Russellville High School Choral students began the evening’s entertainment with selections of God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen, Good King Wenceslas, What Child is This, and Carol of the Bells. Administrators and Board Members served the meal! Mr. Flener shared words of appreciation to the hard-working staff. Once the meal had ended, everyone was encouraged to attend the RMS/RHS Band Concert in the deGraffenried Auditorium or the basketball game in the gym.",0.0,"Russellville Independent Schools added 8 new photos.

Related Arts teachers at Stevenson Elementary are largely responsible for the “job well done” as they held their annual Christmas Title 1 Parent Involvement Night on Thursday, Dec. 12, in the gym. It is always a joy to see students and their families participating in “fun” ways of continued learning. SES parents and students got their “bucket drumming” on with Coach Davenport, they enjoyed making crafts with Mrs. Lowery, shared music time with Mrs. Blythe, and the SES Power Jumpers performed for the crowd and honored the Veterans at the end of their presentation. Of course, refreshments were served. Principal, Robin Cornelius said, “We had a huge turnout, and we received some very good feedback from our families”.

Stevenson Elementary had a great “Careers-R-a-Treat” Trunk or Treat on Thursday, Oct. 31. The cold weather brought everyone inside, but didn’t dampen the fun! Special thanks to all the local businesses and community helpers that participated: Electric Plant Board, Cash Express, First Southern Bank, Auburn Bank, US Bank, Logan County Public Library, Russellville Fire Department, and Dr Elizabeth Gilliam. Thanks to our guests and our candy donations from our families, the students received many, many treats.

On Monday, Oct. 28, the students at Russellville Preschool Academy participated in a fun-filled morning of Autumn surprises. The students gathered in the halls anxiously awaiting to board the Russellville READs Bookmobile to hear the story, “There Was An Old Lady Who Wasn't Afraid of Anything”. While on the bus, the students were informed that they were all going to be able to take home their very own copy of the book! This treat was made possible by the Russellville READs Literacy Grant. The students also received some apple cider and popcorn on the hay bales as another way to celebrate fall. The last surprise in store for our Preschool Panthers was a full-sized pumpkin patch on the lawn, and they were encouraged to pick their favorite pumpkin to take home. Thanks is expressed to Preschool Director, Mrs. Michele McCloughan, her husband, Bob, and the staff of RPA for their hard work in creating this experience for all of our students. #ittybittypanthers #RussellvilleREADs2.0

""The Champs""... RHS Class of 2020 scored the highest ACT Composite in school history...

...and in doing so, landed Russellville Independent Schools as the 21st best of 169 school districts for overall ACT Composite scores in Kentucky!

Congrats to the Champs!

From Ben Bruni:
Two years ago Russellville HS’s ACT score was ranked 207th of 228 High Schools in Kentucky.

This year RHS’s score ranked 42nd.

...an improvement of 165 spots.

Never doubt the ability of a hungry and talented faculty and staff!

At Stevenson Elementary, we have added a new vending machine. It's not the typical vending machine, ours dispenses books! Let us introduce to you to “Inchy”, The Bookworm Vending Machine. Our vending machine is made possible by the Russellville READ's grant that our school district was awarded. Students receive tokens to use to get free books from the vending machine. Tokens are earned by reading books in conjunction with our Accelerated Reader program. On Monday, Sept. 3, our very first token earners spent their tokens and received some incredible books! We are so proud of our students, and they are very excited about earning tokens this school year. Be on the lookout for another vending machine that we will spotlight that is housed at Russellville High School! #RussellvilleREAD's2.0

On Friday, Aug. 30, Russellville Jr/Sr High School kicked off the start of a new year with a celebratory Pep Rally. Brendan Farlee pepped up the crowd before the festivities began. High School Assistant Principal, Coach Quarles, welcomed students and recognized all sports players. The football players were then cheered on for their game to be played later that evening at Rhea Stadium against Glasgow. The Cheer Team took over and performed an exemplary routine which was followed by a series of audience participation games led by Jocelyn Morris. The pep rally ended with a volleyball tournament between selected staff and seniors. It was a close game, but the staff gloriously won with the final score being 30-25. This Pep Rally set the tone for what we hope to be a great year for the Russellville Panthers!

On Friday, August 8, the Russellville Middle School Lady Panthers softball team had its first game of the season. However, this was more than just a game; it was the honoring of a former coach, sister, and mother who inspired the hearts of many. Ashlee “Cocoa” Collier was a ""kind and fierce soul"" with a ""heart of gold"" who was deeply loved by her softball family. Loving words were written by Tonya Davenport as Cass Whitescarver read them aloud for the crowd to hear. The softball team had a flag created in her honor, and it was lifted high that night above the softball field as a prayer was led by Chris Penrod. A moment of silence was shared among her family, friends, and team. “Cocoa” certainly would have been proud as the Lady Panthers secured the win against Bowling Green. She will never be forgotten #NobodyBetter

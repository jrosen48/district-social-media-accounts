Last night, the Red Wing City Council voted to close the Red Wing Waterpark for the summer of 2020. The Council cited the inability to assure the proper safety of guests and staff as well as not being able to properly train staff with social distancing in place.

We know how much the community values the Red Wing Waterpark, so it’s being closed only after exhausting every effort. But we assure you, we are going to come back stronger than ever in 2021!

Those who already purchased season passes will be contacted in the next week or two in regards to a refund or possibly having the season pass get pushed into next summer.",9.0,"Red Wing Water Park

Can we start something fun here in Red Wing and work together on another community project?

Many you have probably read the children’s book or heard the song “Going on a Bear Hunt.” Let’s work together to put Wingers around town (in your window/lawn/car window/etc.).

1. These are visual signs of encouragement for our RWPS students in a difficult time.
2. Red Wing families can go for a drive or a walk and do a “Winger Hunt!” What a great way to get a break from the house while still being safe.

You can hang shirts, jerseys, a printed logo, chalk your sidewalk, paint your window... be creative. Then report back and let us know how many Wingers you saw! #wingerpride @ Red Wing, Minnesota",7.0,"Let's see how many ""Wingers"" we can get!

We are sorry to say that we have been advised to cancel our upcoming 9th-12th grade choral concert on Monday, 3/16, due to the COVID-19 outbreak. It is certainly less than ideal, but we are acting in the best interest of our students and audience members. In lieu of the performance, we will be live-streaming each of the choirs during their class time through the RWHS Choir's Facebook page. The students have worked very hard on their music, and this will provide a way for them to share it with you.

The schedule for the live stream is listed below:

9th Grade Choir: Friday, 3/13 - approximately 2:15 p.m.

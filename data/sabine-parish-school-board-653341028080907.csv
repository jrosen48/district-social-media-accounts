Dear Seniors,
In honor of you, here is my senior picture from 1979, 41 years ago, Negreet High School. I know you are disappointed that your senior year has been cut short. My heart goes out to you all, but we are still planning on proms, athletic banquets, and graduation ceremonies as soon as it is safe. Your principals want you to have these experiences and so do I. We are proud of you and your accomplishments and understand your disappointment. Your senior year is a milestone, and the decisions you make from this point on will impact the rest of your life. You all are in a unique position to learn from this national crisis and to build your life around what is good, productive, secure and right; because through this, you have learned what really matters! Count your blessings, realize you are a blessing, and continue to be a blessing to someone everyday!

The monetary donation will help us purchase a software to track required health screenings and produce a video to help our school community transition back to school comfortably. The disposable masks will come in handy when students forget their cloth masks and the mounted touchless thermometers for our entry ways will make entering our school building much more efficient. Thank you so much for supporting the health and safety of the faculty, staff, students, and entire community of Sackets Harbor Central School District. #patriotsperservere",2020-08-11 15:56:03,,

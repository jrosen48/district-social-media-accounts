Our Sage International PTO organized our 4th Annual Thanksgiving Feast on Thursday. This year for middle and high schoolers, meaning they fed 600 folks between students, staff and families. As the pics show, this is only possible due to our generous, supportive parent volunteers - from donating food, to time on the serving crew, to cleanup. Yum!",2019-11-23 10:39:17,,

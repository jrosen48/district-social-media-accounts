Earlier today Section XI announced that all sports will be postponed until January 4, 2021, due to the Pandemic. This decision was made in conjunction with the Athletic Council and the Suffolk County Executive Board. Student athletes, please remember that this is not a cancellation this is a postponement. The Athletic Office will be working over the next several months toward the goal of providing our student-athletes with interscholastic athletics at the start of the new year. If you have any questions please email me directly at ebramoff@sagharborschools.org. Let's go Whalers 2021!!

Winter sports are in full swing. We still have two fall sports competing for State Championships. The following girls will represent the East Hampton/Pierson/Bridgehampton varsity swim team at the State meet at Ithaca College. Jane Brierley, Julia Brierley, Darcy McFarland, Sophia Swanson, and Pierson's very own Kiara Bailey Williams. Our girls volleyball team will be competing at Glens Falls this Saturday at the NYSPHSAA Final Four. Good luck to all the girls. Let's go Whalers!! Let's go Bonackers!!",2019-11-21 13:58:19,,

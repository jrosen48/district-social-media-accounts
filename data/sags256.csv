St. Anne Schools Families,

Good afternoon. At this time, there are NO reported cases of COVID-19 in our area and Illinois public schools in our area are still open for business. Even so, it is extremely important for schools to finalize plans in case we are forced to close due to this virus. As a result, St. Anne schools will have an early dismissal tomorrow, Friday, March 13, 2020 to allow our faculty and staff necessary time to plan for possible future emergency school closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. St. Anne High School will dismiss at 11:05 a.m. and St. Anne Grade School will dismiss at 11:25 a.m. tomorrow, Friday, March 13, 2020. At this time, we plan to be in a regular session on Monday, March 16, 2020.

We appreciate your flexibility and understanding regarding this situation and as always, we will update you with any new changes.

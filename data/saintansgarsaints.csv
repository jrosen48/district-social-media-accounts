Let Evening Come
By Jane Kenyon

Let the light of late afternoon
shine through chinks in the barn, moving
up the bales as the sun moves down.

Let the cricket take up chafing
as a woman takes up her needles
and her yarn. Let evening come.

Let dew collect on the hoe abandoned
in long grass. Let the stars appear
and the moon disclose her silver horn.

Let the fox go back to its sandy den.
Let the wind die down. Let the shed
go black inside. Let evening come.

To the bottle in the ditch, to the scoop
in the oats, to air in the lung
let evening come.

Let it come, as it will, and don’t
be afraid. God does not leave us
comfortless, so let evening come.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2834550239998872&id=1511781695609073,,0.0,"Positive messages, Part 3

As you may have heard, Governor Reynolds announced yesterday that schools in Iowa should remain closed through April 30 in response to the COVID-19 crisis. While we are disappointed knowing that it will be several more weeks before we see our students, the safety of our community and state comes first.

Our board will review the options outlined by the Iowa Department of Education for continuing learning during the closure, and consider which is the most appropriate path forward for our students, families, and staff. It is our hope to announce a specific plan by April 10, 2020.

We know that you have many questions. Rest assured that as soon as we have more specific information about how we will move forward with learning, we will share it with you. I’m committed to ensuring that every student in the St. Ansgar Community School District receives the education that s/he deserves.

Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions.

As you may have heard, Governor Reynolds announced yesterday that schools in Iowa should remain closed through April 30 in response to the COVID-19 crisis. While we are disappointed knowing that it will be several more weeks before we see our students, the safety of our community and state comes first.

Our board will review the options outlined by the Iowa Department of Education for continuing learning during the closure, and consider which is the most appropriate path forward for our students, families, and staff. It is our hope to announce a specific plan by April 10, 2020.

We know that you have many questions. Rest assured that as soon as we have more specific information about how we will move forward with learning, we will share it with you. I’m committed to ensuring that every student in the St. Ansgar Community School District receives the education that s/he deserves.

Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions.

Best,
Michael R. Crozier

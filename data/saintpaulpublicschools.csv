The leading recommendation is that SPPS will plan to start the school year in distance learning for all students.

Per the MDE guidelines, SPPS will also offer a 100% Virtual Learning School for students PreK-12 who prefer the option of distance learning throughout the entire 2020-21 school year. This option is available regardless of the district's decision to return to school in an in-person, hybrid or distance learning scenario throughout the school year. Register now at https://www.spps.org/Page/39770.

There are still many details to be worked out in the coming weeks and we expect to have a final plan to share with our community in early August. Please visit https://www.spps.org/reopen2020 for the latest news and updates.

July 30 Update to SPPS Fall Reopening Plans",208.0,"We understand that you may be feeling anxious about what the start of a new school year will look like. SPPS is grateful for the guidance we received today from Governor Tim Walz and the Minnesota Department of Education (MDE).

The leading recommendation is that SPPS will plan to start the school year in distance learning for all students.

Per the MDE guidelines, SPPS will also offer a 100% Virtual Learning School for students PreK-12 who prefer the option of distance learning throughout the entire 2020-21 school year. This option is available regardless of the district's decision to return to school in an in-person, hybrid or distance learning scenario throughout the school year.

I have always loved working with and learning from others. I also had many excellent teachers throughout my K-12 years that inspired me.

Answer: There are so many amazing things about being a teacher that it is hard to narrow it down to just one thing. One of the best parts is seeing students achieve at levels that they previously didn't think they could. Of course, that is a different spot for nearly every single student. Students can easily see who is genuinely willing to help them grow into young adults, rather than just improve a test score. On a daily basis, it's often hard to know if you are really making an impact. When students swing by your classroom just to say hi, send an email or a handwritten letter or card or stop by just to see how you are doing and what my current classes are studying, it provides me with extra inspiration and really motivates me to want to improve my teaching.

Answer: The best part of my job is working with my EL students in groups and watching them as they grasp a concept, such as using compare/contrast language in their writing. It’s especially inspiring when they can relay what they just learned to another EL student. It’s so exciting when our new-to-country students produce language for the first time, seeing how proud and accomplished they feel. Another great part of my job is collaborating with colleagues who willingly share their expertise and welcome me into their classrooms.

Also, I believe the Parent Teacher Home Visit Project is one of the best initiatives to come out of our district in a long time. We get to visit with our students and families in their home environment, where the focus is not necessarily on academics but rather on the hopes and dreams they have for their children.

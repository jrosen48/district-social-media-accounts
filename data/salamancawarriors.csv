Earlier today Governor Cuomo provided some additional guidance regarding the reopening of schools across New York State. While we await written guidance, I believe it is appropriate to provide a summary of the governor’s comments.

* We should receive written confirmation by Monday, August 10 approving or requesting revisions to the July 31 Salamanca reopening plan.

* At least three parent centered and one staff centered forum will occur by August 21. Details about the time and format will be forthcoming.

* Schools will likely need to provide more guidance and formalize a process to have students and staff Covid tested.

Throughout this crisis the Salamanca community of students, parents, faculty and staff have risen to meet these unprecedented challenges. I am confident that this level of spirit and engagement will continue as we move towards our schools reopening. As planned, parents can expect individual contact beginning next week to better understand your needs and concerns.

We are excited to be able to offer your child some summer opportunities! You do not need to sign up for sessions just click on the link for the grade level your child is going into.

These 30 minutes sessions will review items your child has learned this past year—some of it will be games to review key skills your child needs to be successful in the next grade level. For each session your child attends their name will be entered into a drawing for $10 to Tony’s Ice Cream.

We will pull a total of 10. These will be pulled at the end of summer school.

Be sure to log into PowerSchool and check out the activities available this week.

We are excited to be able to offer your child some summer opportunities! You do not need to sign up for sessions just click on the link for the grade level your child is going into.

These 30 minutes sessions will review items your child has learned this past year—some of it will be games to review key skills your child needs to be successful in the next grade level. For each session your child attends their name will be entered into a drawing for $10 to Tony’s Ice Cream.

We will pull a total of 10. These will be pulled at the end of summer school.

It is disappointing for me to share that the latest executive order from the governor is forcing us to change our plans for your graduation ceremony. Our Superintendent has spoken directly with the Governor’s office and has been told that the planned ceremony is in direct violation of his latest order. Both the Governor and Department of Health directives explicitly forbid in person and indoor graduation ceremonies.

We will continue to work hard and plan for a special graduation ceremony later this month. However, the ceremony scheduled for Saturday June 13th is being postponed. I will keep you posted with dates, venue and details through email and automated calls. Thank you for your understanding and I look forward to seeing you at the parade tonight.

The Salamanca City Central School District have setup several hotspot points located around the school district to assist families with internet access. District school buses have been parked in the following locations to help ensure all students can keep learning; this will allow families to park near them and use the Wi-Fi. The locations are:

• Fenton Insurance Agency
• Salamanca High School Parking lot
• Allegany Community Center – ACC
• Prospect Elementary
• Steamburg Community Center
• Indian Park – RC Hoag Drive

Each bus has instructions listed in the window outlining how to connect to the Wi-Fi hotspot.

Families of SCCSD students that are experiencing technical difficulties with their student devices should send an email to helpdesk@salamancany.org – this will allow one of our technicians to assist in your needs.

What is Sources of Strength ?
Sources of Strength is our high school’s suicide prevention program. As a group we thought sharing out some positive messaging during these uncertain times would be a healthy way to boost our fellow peers. You may find a lot of scary information through many different avenues regarding COVID 19. As a result of this you may find an increase in anxiety and possible depression. Know that you are not alone during this time. It is important to rely on HOPE, HELP & STRENGTH. Each one of us has our own strengths that have helped us get through tough times in the past.

We will provide an update and a forum to help you understand the impact. Stay tuned for more details.

Wow, what a week! Today Boundless Connections and Strength Solutions delivered the last face shields in an order of 450 for Olean General Hospital. We've been running our printers, (and our people) 24 hours a day to get them the shields they need.

Boundless Connections has been able to up their capacity thanks to the collaboration of all our partners, Dream It. Do It., Portville Schools, K-Bar knives, Salamanca Schools, Cuba Schools, Olean Schools and many individuals that are contributing parts, including Olean High student Byron Ring, Ann Tengulund from St. Bonaventure University, and Ryan Mikolajczyk from ASK Chemicals in Alfred.

We are also very much indebted to Olean High student Nolan Hurlburt for not only printing out the headbands, but his diligence in troubleshooting our printers and improving the quality. His contribution has been huge.

Thanks also to the individuals who are donating to this effort!",22.0,"This is what a Warrior does!! We’re always glad to lend a hand #WarriorNation

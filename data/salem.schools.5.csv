College volleyball, here she comes!

In her time at SHS, Kylie had 611 kills, 644 digs, 100 aces, & 84 Solo blocks. She currently holds the record for most career kills. She is the 5th name to be added to the “500 Digs Club”, the 2nd name to be added to the “500 Kills Club”, and the ONLY name to be on both lists. Pretty good for someone who had to sit an entire season due to an ACL injury!

I personally( Ms. Cary) want to thank the team that I had to do this journey with, I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you to the families who participated in the meal program.

The Cafeteria Staff would like to thank all of the bus drivers for all of their hard work and making sure everyone received their meals, the aides for all of their help as well.

We send a special Thank you to Amy Thetford, Gail Shaw, Brenda Levey Holly Hanks, Kate Geraghty and Kathy Fleming for their dedication and being here everyday helping with the meal preparation. We had lots of laughs but there were some days that was not so much fun. We did it and we Rocked it!

Day of the Dead is an Aztec holiday and often confused to be Mexico's version of Halloween, as it begins on October 31 and ends on November 2. However, it has nothing to do with Halloween. Day of the Dead is a celebration of expression in many ways. Not only is it dedicated to remembering and honoring those loved ones who have passed, it's centrally focused on the artistic expression of the living through the creation of sugar skulls, costumes, cooking and other tokens and offerings.",0.0,"Salem Central School added 28 new photos.

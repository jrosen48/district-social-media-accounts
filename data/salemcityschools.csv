As the current group of Salem High School students enter the building each morning, the young men and women cannot help but notice the towering steel structure on the front of the school.

Crews have been working non-stop since school abruptly ended in March and, as a result, they have made significant progress inside. Much of the work has now shifted outside so the inside of the building can be a great place for learning. One of those newly constructed areas, is the Cosmetology Lab that was built by City of Salem workers.

Like Salem's others five schools, the high school has been welcoming 25 percent of its student enrollment per day this week.

As the first week of school continued today in Salem, more students were able to return to the classroom for the first time since last spring. At West, new Principal, Amanda Gibson, was very proud of the enthusiasm her staff and students exhibited.

Group B attended school this Tuesday, Group C will arrive on Wednesday and Group D on Thursday. Group A students opened the week on Monday.

At this time, 28 percent of Salem's nearly 4,000 students are participating in 100 percent virtual learning from home.

Volunteers packed the necessary school supplies for the 2020-2021 school year in a new backpack and also provided a pair of new sneakers for each child, identified to participate in the event.

They will receive the items at a ""Drive-Up Back to School Bash"" at Bethel designed to allow the families to pick-up their items safely while practicing physical distancing.

This is the fourth year that the event has been spearheaded by Bethel Baptist Church, and the first year that members were joined by Restoration Church.

While school has been out this summer, construction crews have been holding court at Salem High School from one end to the other.

Inside the building, a new sprinkler system has been installed and brand new high efficiency boilers and chillers have been installed to improve the heating and cooling of the building.
In addition, new wiring for internet, phone, alarms and other essential services has been run throughout the facility.

Crews also have been painting, removing old carpet and installing new LED lights.
Outside, construction of the new firewall is well underway and the footprint for the new 10 classroom addition is now visible. Critical roof upgrades are also in motion.

Along with these improvements that are part of the official renovation project overseen by G&H Contractors, the Salem Street Department’s talented workers are making excellent progress in the new cosmetology learning area.

Just before the COVID-19 outbreak forced traditional learning to move outside of our schools, the good folks from FedEx made a generous donation to the Diesel Technology Program at Salem High School.

Derek Southerland and some of his co-workers from the valley’s FedEx Freight Shop worked to fill a void at Salem High School. They convinced FedEx’s corporate office to give the school a lightly used 2005 Kenworth T300 truck.

Southerland had been inside the school in the past serving as a judge for SkillsUSA competition. During those visits, he told instructor Derek Wray how impressed he was with Salem’s students. The hope is that the knowledge and hands-on experiences will lead to future apprenticeships, as well as full-time jobs after graduation. #SampleSalem",0.0,"Salem City Schools - Salem, Virginia added 16 new photos.

Salem High School students took part in the SkillsUSA Diesel Program competition today at the high school.

Industry support for the Diesel Equipment Technology program in Salem was once again outstanding as FedEx Freight sent its regional technician trainer and a diesel technician to judge. In addition, Carter Machinery and Berglund Automotive also sent technicians to evaluate the students, while Highway Motors in Roanoke attended the event to discuss career opportunities in the heavy truck industry.

The winners from today will advance to the Virginia State Contest at the Berglund Center on April 24 and 25.

The School Board officially recognized the 2020 Virginia Teacher of the Year Tuesday night by unanimously passing Resolution 249 to honor Andrea Johnson. The Salem High School English teacher was named the Division’s top teacher back in the spring.

Her whirlwind fall began on September 5 when she was named the Region VI Teacher of the Year, but that was just the appetizer. On October 7, she was put all of Salem in the spotlight when she was named the Virginia Teacher of the Year in a special ceremony in Richmond.

Salem City Schools have now produced four regional teachers of the year since 2009 and two State Teachers of the Year since 2016. Here’s a link to the resolution.

The Salem Forensics team won its 14th straight VHSL State Title the last Saturday in March in dominating fashion.

The championship competition was held at Clover Hill High School near Richmond and Salem defeated E.C. Glass 41-22 in competition that included a total of 21 schools. Salem captured the team championship largely because the Spartans won 7 out of 10 individual titles. Since 2004, this program has produced a staggering 78 individual state champions.

Some truly got a taste working inside a bakery or restaurant, while others had their breath taken away while climbing over 100 feet off the ground on a Fire Department ladder truck. Thanks to all of the business folks who generously gave their time for our students.

In addition to the real world job shadow participants, 55 seniors took official college visits and another 20 took organized field trips to Virginia Western or Jefferson College.

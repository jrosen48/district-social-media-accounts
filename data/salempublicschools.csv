This is a shout out to Salem Public Schools and the volunteers that are distributing healthy breakfasts to children who would normally get them at school. Every day these volunteers are here, even on this gloomy, rainy day. A big thank you for serving our community's youngest members. We gave them a little chocolate love on this gray day but think everyone needs to give them a hand!üëè #salemstrong #salemMA Destination Salem, Massachusetts #weareallinthistogether North Shore Community Development Coalition Kim Driscoll #chocolateisessential #thankyou",2020-05-01 14:13:07,,

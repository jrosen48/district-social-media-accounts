CONFESSION...

Becoming a certified teacher was not easy for me. Although my pride will take a huge hit after this, I vow to be vulnerable.

I failed my praxis exams multiple times. I felt drained, defeated, and at times, helpless.

But I didn’t give up !

I thought about my students and how much they needed me to be their change agent . I thought about some of the hard times that I faced growing up and how they were dealing with some of those same things and needed an example of hope.

So I kept trying and passed those exams! I had know idea that all of accolades and accomplishments would be on the other side of the story. I was just a young man that wanted to see others become successful . 8 years later my heart remains the same.

Went back to my Alma Mater to share my story and give back 1k in scholarships ....

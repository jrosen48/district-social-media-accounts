We're highlighting one of our projects from 2019 - the renovation project at Salem High School. Construction was ongoing while school was in session, so the project had to be completed in five phases.

During the phases of construction, nearly all of the existing structures within the 370,000 sq. ft. school received some renovation. The school hadn't been updated in nearly 50 years since it was first built, so this was a very important project for the Salem School District.

Monterey Park School is providing each Scholar an opportunity to take on The Great Kindness Challenge this whole week. Each student has been given a ‚ÄúPink‚Äù challenge sheet that gives many ways students can show kindness. We also invite families to join in the fun and pick kindness acts to do for others. Our Student Council has planned a full week of student activities during lunch recess for all students. Today our Student Center was welcoming students to color a quilt that will be put together to create one giant quilt as we are all connected as one! In addition Kindness Grams were available for students to send to each other and staff. It was a blast and Monty our Eagle Mascot joined the fun. #SCESDShines",0.0,"#SCESDShines

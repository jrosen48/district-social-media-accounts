This is to inform you that we were notified today that one of our staff members tested positive for Covid 19. That staff member was not present at school for the first two days and had no exposure to our students this week.

We worked this afternoon with the Pennsylvania Department of Education and the Department of Health on this situation. Our first priority continues to be the health and safety of our students, staff, and community. Because of this, we are closing school tomorrow, Wednesday, September 2, 2020 out of an overabundance of caution and to make sure we are taking all the necessary steps to ensure everyone's safety.

We will continue to work with our state and local resources tomorrow and thoroughly clean our school building as we have been doing.

The book highlights a local farmer’s market. It takes readers behind the scenes of the busy market, to three farms where the owners and workers complete the tasks necessary to ensure fresh local produce on market day. All of their efforts culminate in a fresh, locally sourced meal by a chef at a neighborhood restaurant. Reminding us that behind every food we enjoy, at home or at a restaurant, is only possible due to the hard work of farmers throughout the year to grow plants and raise animals.

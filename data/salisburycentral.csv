We are announcing Region One Unity!

We are united in our quest to provide all of the support we can to our students, staff, and families in Region One.

We are asking staff, students, parents, and community members to place any kind of heart (paper, fabric, wood, etc.) on any place that can be seen by others-- your mailbox, inside of your car, your home-- so that everyone who sees a heart will know that our region is very strong. We are showing our strength in so many ways.

It's pretty simple. When you then leave your home for food or take a safe walk in the neighborhood, you can smile, when you see the hearts, knowing that we are all in this together.

If you like historical fiction take some time to read Unbound by Ann E. Burg. This is about a little slave girl who is called up to work in the Big House. Grace has trouble not saying what’s on her mind. One day Grace says too much and the family must go into hiding. Written in verse this is a quick read and oh so good!",2019-07-23 13:39:20,,

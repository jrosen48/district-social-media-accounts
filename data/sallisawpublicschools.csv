This evening our school board met to discuss items in preparation for the impending state-wide teacher walkout.

There are two items of note...

1. In order to assure that we have as many days of instruction as possible the academic calendar has been amended to ADD a day of school on Friday, March 30th. This day was originally slated as a parent/teacher conference day during the morning hours. Parent/teacher conferences will still take place this day, however, they will be adjusted to the afternoon hours.

2. Realizing the state of current issues in public education raises many questions and concerns we will be hosting an evening for the community to come to have their voices heard and questions answered. This public forum will take place at the Sallisaw Middle School campus on Monday, March 26th at 6pm.

As always, we want to ensure an open line of clear and honest communication and we feel that this public forum will aid us in accomplishing this goal.

Thank you for your support of our schools, teachers, and most importantly, our students.

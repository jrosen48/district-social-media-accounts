Good Morning,
I am asking all students going into seventh and eighth grade to check their Chromebooks and chargers to make sure they are running and set for September. If you are having issues with your Chromebook or charger, please call our office at 518-358-6650. We will help you out. All students will need their Chromebooks and chargers for the first day of school.

Sixth-grade students will receive new Chromebooks and chargers during Orientation on August 28th.

If you are a new student to our district you will be receiving a Chromebook and charger. We will be contacting you directly over the next few weeks to set up a time to receive those.

Any student who is transferring out of the district will need to turn in their Chromebook, case, and charger to avoid being charged for these items.

Any student going into 9th grade will need to turn in their Chromebook, case, and charger from the middle school. You will receive a new one in High School.

If you have any questions please call our office.
Thank you.
Stay safe, stay healthy.

If you are having issues with your Chromebook or charger, please call our office at 518-358-6650. We will help you out. All students will need their Chromebooks and chargers for the first day of school.

Sixth-grade students will receive new Chromebooks and chargers during Orientation on August 28th.

If you are a new student to our district you will be receiving a Chromebook and charger. We will be contacting you directly over the next few weeks to set up a time to receive those.

Any student who is transferring out of the district will need to turn in their Chromebook, case, and charger to avoid being charged for these items.

Any student going into 9th grade will need to turn in their Chromebook, case, and charger from the middle school. You will receive a new one in High School.

If you have any questions please call our office.
Thank you.
Stay safe, stay healthy.

At the end of each sports season, the NYSPHSAA honors those teams and individuals that excel in the classroom. Those student-athletes, teams, and schools work very hard throughout the year and deserve to be recognized for their academic success. To receive team recognition with a certificate, the team’s average GPA for 75% of the roster must be greater than or equal to 90.00. Individual students with a 90 or above GPA will be recognized as Individual Scholar-Athletes.

Congratulations again to the team as it is truly a team effort to achieve this award and to the following individual scholar athletes: Joryan Adams, Myranda Collette, Delanie Deshane, Olivia Moulton, Lindsay Martin, Karli St. Ann, Kamea Thomas, and Talynn Wylie",2019-12-07 10:58:51,,

From the Illinois Department of Public Health: Among Illinois high school seniors, past 30 day e-cigarette use is significantly rising while cigarette use is declining. In 2018, 8.4% of 8th grade students and 23.1% of 12th grade students reported using e-cigarettes. Using e-cigarettes puts youth at risk for addiction and other health consequences, but unfortunately, 40% of 10th and 12th graders said there is low- or no-risk of harm when using e-cigarettes.

As you know, the solar eclipse on Monday is an event that does not happen very often. As a district, we have purchased ISO-certified glasses so our students can experience this event. Teachers will provide instruction to students on the importance of only viewing the event with the glasses. They will stress to students that under no circumstances should they ever look at the sun without the glasses. I would encourage you as parents to emphasize this to your child ahead of time.
Students are NOT required to participate. If you would prefer your child to stay indoors during the time that the eclipse is occurring, please e-mail me immediately the name of your child and the school they attend at coxp@saltfork.k12.il.us. I will compile a list of students who are to stay indoors and make sure it gets to the appropriate principals and teachers.
We want this to be a memorable event for students. However, you the parent have the ultimate say in whether or not you want your child to participate.

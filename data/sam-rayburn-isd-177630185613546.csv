We are looking forward to the 2020-21 school year that will begin on August 17th. Even though final decisions have not been made at the Texas Education Agency concerning all aspects of opening the school year, we do want you to know that each parent will have the option of choosing traditional in-person instruction or remote online instruction if you are not comfortable with the traditional setting. Remote instruction will consist of recorded lessons, assignments, projects, and interaction with teachers online and/or by phone during a specific time frame. In the next two weeks, each family will be contacted by a SRISD staff member via phone to gather information in order to properly plan for the upcoming year. Please be assured that our number one priority is always the health and safety of our students. Thank you for your continued support of Sam Rayburn ISD.

The Ocean of Hope Scholarship
Amanda Mauppin was a fifth grade student at Sam Rayburn Elementary. She was a bright, caring, and courageous little girl who battled a rare form of cancer for four years. During this time, she consistently portrayed strength, hope, and a positive attitude. She never complained of her many struggles, but focused instead on being respectful and caring to others. Amanda exhibited amazing strength during her battle which took her life in February of 2012. This application is due by May 22nd and will be announced at our outdoor graduation and scholarship ceremony on June 1st.

Our PreK and Kindergarten Roundup didn't go as planned this year. We truly missed getting to meet all of the new children who will be joining us at school next year. While not the same, we did create a short video for parents and children to give them a little peek into their classrooms and an opportunity to see their teachers who can not wait to meet and love them! Our video is posted on our elementary website under the Students tab. A link is also provided below.

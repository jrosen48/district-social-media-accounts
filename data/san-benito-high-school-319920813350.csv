San Benito High School Speech Therapists Natalia Silva-Sepulveda and Brianna Teimoorian, along with Transition Teacher Breanna Brooks and support staff have created a set of popsicle stick icons as visual support for students during distance learning. They have made sets for teachers, administrators, and are working on making enough for our instructional aides as well - who push into Zoom classrooms. The visuals come in handy while working 1:1 with a student or with a whole class. Ms. Brooks utilizes the mute and unmute icons daily with her students.

For students who need support, they are able to see the icon and match it to one of the icons on the screen. For example, if a student has a difficult time navigating to google classroom, the teacher holds up the google classroom icon, the student is able to visualize the icon and locate it on the screen without additional prompting!",0.0,"San Benito High School staff are finding innovative ways to support students.

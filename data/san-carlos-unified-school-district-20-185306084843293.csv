This quarantine has us all scattered, but that does not mean we cannot keep in contact!

I greatly miss & often wonder about the wellbeing of my students/children!! This social distancing is tough, and I sincerely miss the classroom vibe!! I miss talking with, joking with, laughing with, sharing with, and learning with our children.

I pray that each & everyone of you all are healthy & doing well!
Like many things in life....'this too shall pass'....and we will all be able to see one another again!.... until then....stay hone,keep up on your assignments, be nice to one another, and know that you are all thought of & missed dearly by the SCMS staff!!

I am so blessed to have such dedicated leaders on our admin team and I truly appreciate everyone going the extra mile in this strange new way we've been forced to educate our students.
Some have quickly become pros at this as they have been meeting regularly with their staffs daily using Zoom and WebEx.

Look what's coming up next...don't miss Stepsisters!

Everybody knows the Brothers Grimm’s most famous fairy tale. But what if they told it from the wrong point of view? Stepsisters tells the totally-true-and-not-at-all-made-up version of the little cinder girl. When Drew and Beth are thrown into the dungeon for conspiring against the throne, these stepsisters, who are not wicked, evil and certainly not ugly, are forced to tell their fellow prisoners the real story of what happened with Cinderella. Part flashback, part story theatre and all high-octane musical comedy, the story unfolds in ways the Grimm tale never did.",0.0,"Don't forget to get your tickets!

Hello San Juan Island School District Community!
The Special Services Department would like to improve communication, collaboration, and knowledge about the “on-going” activities in Special Education with a Special Education Quarterly Newsletter. Our intent is to highlight special education laws, class activities and innovation within the special education classes and more importantly to recognize student accomplishments. The newsletter will also highlight student’s creativity through their works of art, poetry, science, and community activities. It is the hope of the Special Education Team that the newsletter will assist in further strengthening community relationships and staff collaboration with each other and the San Juan Island School District families. We look forward to hearing your feedback!

Media should work for you & work within your family values & parenting style. When media is used thoughtfully & appropriately, media can enhance daily life. But when used inappropriately or without thought, media can displace many important activities such as face-to-face interaction, family-time, outdoor-play, exercise, unplugged downtime & sleep.

By creating a Personalized Family Media Use Plan, you can be aware of when you are using media to achieve your purpose. This requires parents & users to think about what they want those purposes to be. The tool below will help you to think about media & create goals & rules that are in line with your family’s values.

Dear neighbors, every year at this time I forward you a survey that is used statewide by coalitions like the San Juan Island Prevention Coalition (on whose board I sit) to gather information about what community members know about drug and alcohol use and abuse, and laws regarding use, on the island. We need several hundred people to complete this survey . . . and that is hard to do.

It is so easy to get an email appeal like this and skip over it. The survey will take no more than 10 minutes. (It took me closer to three!). You may skip any questions and you may feel you do not have many answers or knowledge. But please take the time and help us anyway.

The Community Survey captures our local San Juan Island attitudes about teen alcohol and drug use, as well as prevention programming. This data helps to inform our coalition’s strategies, as well as the state strategies.

This is an annual requirement for our funding, but more importantly, knowing the opinion of our community helps us to make informed decisions, and to help us better communicate the prevention work to the community. Last year, we were 100 surveys short of our goal, so please help us get the word out and meet our goal. Thank you.

Here is information about this year’s Youth Heritage Project (YHP), a fabulous one-week, (free to the student or teacher participants), field school opportunity taking place on the Tacoma waterfront this summer. Tuition, housing, meals, and transportation during the week is provided free of charge to participants.

YHP is a great opportunity for students and teachers to experience hands-on preservation, building, planning, maritime and architecture fields taught be professionals working in these disciplines. It also exposes island students to students living in different environments from all across the state. Off-island experience is always good for building confidence and perspective.

Participation is not contingent on a student and teacher going together. Interested students and teachers apply independently. The deadline for applying is May 31st.

The decision by the San Juan Island School District Board of Directors on whether or not to move the sixth grade from the Friday Harbor Elementary School to Fri-day Harbor Middle School will be postponed until the regular school board meeting scheduled for April 26, 2017.

At the January 18, 2017 special school board meeting/public hearing, the elementary staff made a presentation to the board in favor of the move, citing supportive research in pedagogy and issues of crowding in the elementary school. The Board is requesting information on the impact to the 2017-2018 school year budget before making a final decision. The decision process is compounded by the uncertainty of state funding to be received by the district in the next two years. Additional information is needed for district staff to provide a clear financial projection to the board.

If there are further delays by the state legislature in approving a state budget, this decision may even be pushed back to a May special board meeting.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1405598602825130&id=134847409900262,,0.0,"Decision on Sixth Grade Transition Postponed until April Board Meeting

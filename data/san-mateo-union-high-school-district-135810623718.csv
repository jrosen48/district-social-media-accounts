Noises Off is one of the great comedic plays of all time.

We join these theatrical people at the final dress rehearsal, again a month later, and at the end of the show's run. We not only get to see their play hilariously deteriorate, we get to see their backstage antics and insecurities, their character flaws, and their attempts to sabotage the play and each other. Join the Mills community in this legendary play, called by the New York Times: ""The greatest farce every written.""

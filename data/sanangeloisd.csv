* A good writing and device space, like a desk or a table with a comfortable chair – a bed is not a good working space.
* Plenty of good light – like a table lamp or natural lighting from open windows.
* Minimize distractions as best as you can – create blocks of quiet time.
* Plan the week on Monday with progress checks every evening and plan forward for the next day.
* Create a daily checklist of assignments to help your child be accountable.
* Set an alarm to wake up and start the day.
* Eat breakfast and schedule breaks for lunch.

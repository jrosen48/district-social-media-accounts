Hi, I'm Susie and I am so grateful to be able to continue working as the homeless liaison during this critical time for vulnerable students -- although it can be hard and sometimes sad to navigate this new world of work. Currently, I am at my home that I share with my wife who is an elementary physical education teacher, our grumpy cat, Indiana, and our relatively new puppy, Bella. Bella is definitely the happiest about the situation! Our house is small so I am often navigating Zoom meetings with Amber creating exercise videos, games, and connecting with her kids nearby. I appreciate the opportunity to get a better view of her work and for her to see mine. Ultimately, I feel that we are incredibly lucky to be healthy and working; and this, like all things, will pass.

Full letter and other details are at https://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/he/hn/collegereqsinformation.asp.

Juniors and Seniors now is a great time to do some College searches! As you are prepping for Dual Credit class click on any college to go directly to the site! While you are there look at your potential majors, look at grad plans, look at housing, do your research! I challenge you to look at 3 and compare. If I do not have a college on here you are interested in please comment and I will get the link added.

Also remember to have notifications on for the Sands Dual Credit Band. If you do not have that, please let me know that too!

Today the governor has closed schools for the remainder of the year. Here is the announcement on school closures.

Governor Closes Texas Schools through End of 2019-20 School Year
Gov. Greg Abbott issued several executive orders today, including one that closes all Texas schools for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year, as it ""would be unsafe to allow students to gather."" He noted that teachers are permitted to visit their classrooms as needed to conduct online instruction or clean out their classrooms, but should follow social distancing guidelines. Abbott said to expect more information from Commissioner of Education Mike Morath about the closures and about conducting graduation ceremonies. The statewide stay-at-home order remains in effect until April 30. Additional announcements will be made April 27.

We will continue to do ""Home Based Learning"" until May 15th and continue to follow the protocols we have in place.

1A Senior Celebration spotlights Kaylee French from Sands High School!

Honors:
Basketball - District Champs her Senior Year for 1st time in over 10 years, Area Champs & was 1st Team All - District;
She has been a Regional Qualifier in Pole Vault, Tennis and XC throughout high school career. She has made it to state in golf and OAP. She is the senior Class President and has been a Varsity Cheerleader all 4 years. She is also a member of NHS, STUCO, FFA, BBQ team and participates in UIL.

Favorite thing to do in and out of school:
She LOVES all the things that she have been able to participate in, but basketball and OAP are her favorites. She was really starting to enjoy the BBQ team before season cut short or finger-crossed just postponed. Outside of school she loves to bake, journal, and TIKTOK!

Best thing about being from a 1A town:
The graduating class of 2020 at Sands is 6 kids. Each one is amazing! She loves being part of this close knit group, the love and support she receives from her teachers and the 6 man community, and the ability to participate in it all.",0.0,"Texas 1A Fan

Together we can slow the spread just by staying at home! If you must go out, stay at least 6 feet away from others, and disinfect frequently touched surfaces like countertops and doorknobs whenever you return.

Keep germs away by washing your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. To keep from spreading germs, avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth and cover a cough or sneeze with your elbow.

If you haven't heard yet the Governor just shut schools down until April 3rd with a tentative start date for April 6th. We must continue to educate our students through distance learning between now and then. We will take next week to plan and develop a plan with our teachers that will give students the best opportunity to become successful with their learning. Once we have a plan set we will be in contact with you to let you know how this will work and what the expectations will be. In the mean time enjoy the time with your families and stay safe.

If you haven't heard yet the Governor just shut schools down until April 3rd with a tentative start date for April 6th. We must continue to educate our students through distance learning between now and then. We will take next week to plan and develop a plan with our teachers that will give students the best opportunity to become successful with their learning. Once we have a plan set we will be in contact with you to let you know how this will work and what the expectations will be. In the mean time enjoy the time with your families and stay safe.

Thanks,
Wayne Henderson

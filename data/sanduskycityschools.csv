Even though we don't have a performance tomorrow evening, we are planning on doing some recordings during rehearsal tomorrow to show you some of what we've been up to at Band Camp this year.

We have also made the difficult decision to officially cancel our New Orleans Trip. Noteworthy Tours is working on refunds for our families and the BPO, and we will get those to you as soon as they are ready. We are grateful for our awesome relationship with this Sandusky-based business, and look forward to our future adventures. Thanks to everyone for riding out this process with us.

It is our hope to be able to do something meaningful and fun for the current Seniors and Juniors this spring as the global health situation will allow.

Dear SHS Band Alumni,

After careful consideration, we have decided to cancel our Alumni Band performance with the SHS Marching Band for Fall 2020.

The COVID-19 pandemic has really put an uncertain twist on our schedule this year. We just don't know what the fall is going to look like, and we would hate for you to make all the necessary arrangements to visit us just to have the event cancelled at the last minute.

We cannot safely lend out school instruments or equipment to Alumni. This would create health and safety issues for our Alumni and current students.

There may not be available, socially-distanced seating afforded to the Alumni Band. We will have a seating challenge at a regular game, let alone adding another 30-50 people to our group.

We look forward to seeing you in the Fall of 2021.

Stay safe and healthy.

During these crazy and uncertain times, I would like to take a minute to pause and Congratulate Ms. Mariae Broome for being accepted into the National Association for Music Education's 2020 All-National Mixed Choir.

Mariae participated in the Ohio Music Education Association All State Honor Choir this past January which qualified her to audition for this National-Level group as a FRESHMAN.

For sports-minded people--she has made it to Nationals, and has been recognized by a committee of music educators as being one of the top choral singers in the country.

The 2020 All-National Honor Ensembles program is scheduled to take place at the Gaylord Palms Resort & Convention Center in Orlando, Florida, November 5-8, 2020.

If Covid-19 stops this program from happening, it will not diminish the fact that Ms. Broome was selected for this prestigious ensemble and that we, as a community, are so immensely proud of her.

Today is National #2and7Day! Sandusky High School athletes visited the 5 Elementary buildings in Sandusky City Schools to read to every 2nd grade student in the district. We are able to do this thanks to the amazing 2nd & 7 Foundation who provides the platform and the books! Together we worked to tackle illiteracy reading and learning from the awesome Hog Mollies!

These are just some of the photos....... I will post all the rest of them soon!

Thank you to the teachers for letting us invade your classrooms and thanks to Bus 11...for driving us around all day! YOUR THE BEST!

We are watching a storm system Wednesday night through Thursday night that is currently expected to bring a good dose of cold air, wind, and a little precipitation to the Panhandles. The current forecast track for the system keeps most of the moisture south of the Panhandles, and therefore keeps rain/snow chances low. That being said, the area could see brief rain turning to snow, but accumulations are expected to be light, if any. The one exception to this is in the far northwest combined Panhandles where 0.5"" to 2.0"" of snow is possible.

There is some potential for this storm system to slow down, dive further south and strengthen more than currently forecast. In this case, rain/snow chances would increase with increased wind and colder temperatures.

Stay tuned as the forecast is refined!",0.0,"US National Weather Service Amarillo Texas

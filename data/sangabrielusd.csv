First comp of the season was a success! Brought home some hardware from the Canyon Springs Field Tournament yesterday in Moreno Valley. 3rd places for band and color guard (out of 5), but the definite highlight of the night was percussion bringing home 3rd place overall! This is not an easy feat to accomplish for a 1A band, but they beat out all other schools in 1A, 2A, 3A, and 4A! First three places were separated by only four points, and the top two bands were 6A!

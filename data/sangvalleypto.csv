Dear students and families,
Good afternoon! This is a follow-up to the email that you received earlier today from Mr. Meadows. I think many of us expected schools to remain closed, but it was still difficult to receive the news from the Governor last Friday.
It has been incredibly rewarding to work with a staff that has adjusted to the new demands of remote learning and staying connected to our students. We will continue to do our best to support the students and families of this school community.
Attached is information regarding the end of the year. Please read it carefully and let me know if you have any questions. Please continue to communicate with your child's teacher and stay safe and healthy. We miss you and look forward to having students in our school once again!

Dear friends,
As we all know, Illinois has closed schools temporarily in an attempt to control the spread of COVID 19. We believe this is the right decision, but also understand that it may present challenges to families in the communities we serve. We'd like to help.

If you are concerned about ensuring your children have a hearty lunch, stop by McAlister's Deli from 11am - 1pm, Monday through Friday. Every kid can receive a free sack lunch that contains a turkey and cheese sandwich, chips, applesauce and a cookie. Completely free, no other purchase is necessary.

We want to do our part to make sure our friends get through this challenging time. So take this worry off your plate, and put it on ours. We will get through it. Together.

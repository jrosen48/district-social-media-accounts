North Mountain’s “S” Shined for San Jacinto High’s Virtual Graduation

Throughout nearly the entire country, high school graduations were very different this year under the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, San Jacinto High School’s long-standing tradition of the “S” on North Mountain illuminating for 15 to 30 minutes at the close of commencement was still made possible by a group of alumni insisting that the tradition not miss a beat. “After surveying our students and parents on ceremony alternatives, we supported their desire to have a virtual graduation video released on June 4 at 7:30 p.m., the original scheduled day and time for the Class of 2020 commencement,” shared Principal Courtney Hall. “When the alumni agreed to light up the ‘S’ at the close of the video for us to live-stream, it really gave an extra touch in making it a real, although partial, graduation,” she noted.

Dear Fellow @hemet_san_jacinto_chamber Chamber members & friends!
We need your help and support!
We are once again proud to bring 'Flags of Freedom' as we (Exchange Club) do every year! We are putting up 1776 American Flags at Gibble park (2500 w. Florida) on Saturday, November 9th morning at 8 am in honor of our Veterans. We need additional volunteers to help fly these amazing flags by posting them on rebars at the park. We need a couple of hours of your valuable time to say THANK YOU to the men and women who have sacrificed so we can live in Freedom.

If you are able to help, please email Koka at LKOKA@AOL.COM and let him know you will be coming or just show up.

Thank you in advance for your help.

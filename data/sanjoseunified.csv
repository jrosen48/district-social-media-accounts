Do you feel anxious or stressed about COVID-19?

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations like infectious disease outbreaks. Recognizing when you feel anxious, stressed, or worried and finding ways to cope will help make you, the people you care about, and your community stronger.

Here are some simple steps to managing your stress during the COVID-19 outbreak:

• Take care of your body

• Connect with others (as long as you are following social distancing!)

• Take breaks

Sheltering at home is the most important thing you can do right now to fight COVID-19. We ask everyone to continue sheltering at home and leaving only for essential activities such as seeking necessary healthcare, getting groceries, or going to the bank. This helps protect everyone in the community—including those who are higher risk of severe illness and workers providing our community with essential services and goods.

“We must come together to do this … We must all do our part to slow the spread of COVID-19,” -- Dr. Sara Cody, Santa Clara County Health Officer

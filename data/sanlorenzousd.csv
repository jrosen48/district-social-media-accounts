San Lorenzo's first permanent school was built in 1859 on a site behind the present School District Office on Usher Street, across from the cemetery. On November 8, 1859 the San Lorenzo Elementary School District was established -- reputed to be the first school district in California. The members of the first School Board, organized in 1864, were William Meek, John Lewelling, and A. E. Crane.

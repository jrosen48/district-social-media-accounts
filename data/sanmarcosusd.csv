We know the coronavirus has created challenges for AP students and teachers. Here‚Äôs how the College Board will support you during this time:

1Ô∏è‚É£ We‚Äôre providing free, live and on-demand AP courses

To support AP students affected by school closures due to COVID-19, students and schools will have access to live AP review lessons, delivered by AP teachers from across the country. Lessons will begin March 25.

2Ô∏è‚É£ We‚Äôre developing a new at-home testing option

Because of the challenges created by COVID-19, we‚Äôre developing a new at-home AP Exam option. Students will be able to test on a computer, tablet, or smartphone.

We will invest so that every AP student impacted by COVID-19 has the tools and connectivity they need to review AP content online and take the exam from home.

During this challenging time, we will work to give every AP student the opportunity to earn the college credit and placement they‚Äôve been working toward all year while maintaining a focus on the health and safety of our AP community.

Princ of Richland Rap

This is a story all about how
RL School turned upside down
Let me tell ya story so just sit right there I‚Äôll tell you all about our school in despair

In San Marcos California born and raised
Richland playground is where they spend most of their days
I walked up to the school about 7 or 8 there were no cars in the lot and a lock on gate

No kids on the field playing ball acting cool
There was no math science history inside of our school
We got one little email the country is scared
They sent us all home to mom and dad to stay there

It seems there is a virus ....Covid 19
It‚Äôs ruining our learning even if it can‚Äôt be seen
We want to be together the kids want to learn
Just stay home to stay healthy? Oh! then we can return?

Just wait a little longer and soon we will hang
Don‚Äôt panic just remember you‚Äôre a Richland Mustang

We can‚Äôt wait till your back
Hurry up It‚Äôll be grand
When you‚Äôre finally here

Esta semana, destacamos el programa de AVID de nuestro distrito. El programa de AVID sirve a m√°s de 2 millones de estudiantes en m√°s de 7000 escuelas en todo el pa√≠s. Mientras su enfoque es la aceptaci√≥n y preparaci√≥n universitaria, AVID tambi√©n ense√±a a los estudiantes habilidades importantes que incluyen el pensamiento cr√≠tico, colaboraci√≥n, gesti√≥n del tiempo, y reflexi√≥n, entre muchos otros. En el video, destacamos a varios estudiantes que muestran estas habilidades.

Nuestro distrito tiene programas de AVID a nivel secundario y preparatorio y cada a√±o graduamos estudiantes del programa que est√°n listos para asumir los desaf√≠os que les esperan en la universidad y m√°s all√°.

San Diego County has been selected to receive repatriated citizens from the Hubei province of China (city of Wuhan) arriving at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Miramar. The federal government is the lead agency for this response, and the County of San Diego is working closely with these officials, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), and regional public health jurisdictions on this rapidly evolving situation.

San Diego County residents can protect their health by taking preventive measures, such as frequent and proper hand washing, staying away from those who are ill, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying home if sick. It is not too late to get a flu shot to help prevent illness and symptoms similar to the novel (new) coronavirus.

For more information and preparedness activities regarding the Novel Coronavirus, please see attached letter from Dr. Wilma J. Wooten, Public Health Officer.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=4145776642163723&id=253141068093986,,0.0,"Update on the Novel Coronavirus on behalf of the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) Department of Public Health Services (PHS).

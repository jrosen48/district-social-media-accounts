Knowing that these incredible students will have their kindness, leadership, and brilliance further amplified on the soundstage that is high school (and grateful that most of them are Titan-bound), we are left with so much hope for the future!

We were so grateful to be able to see our 5th-graders before the big move to middle school, and we take comfort in knowing many of them will not be too far -- just up the road at Huntington Middle School.

Many thanks to all of our students and families for embracing this celebration and lifting our spirits with the kind messages adorned on vehicles!

And Loren is truly a Titan in our community! Thankfully for us, Loren was unsuccessful many times in his attempts at retirement, and we are immensely grateful that he stepped in to help when we needed him, including serving as our district's Superintendent and most recently, Interim Superintendent. We were incredibly sad that Loren could not join us in person for this event due to his brave battle with cancer, and we stand with him as he puts up his courageous fight.

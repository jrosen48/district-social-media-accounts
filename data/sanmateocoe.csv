Later this week, CDE will also release the Learning Continuity Plan Template, Instructions, and Guidance in addition to an FAQ for LEAs. The template is intended to support the planning that districts are already doing as they prepare to begin another academic year and hold to the promises of the Local Control Funding Formula. The Learning Continuity Plan replaces the LCAP for the 2020-21 school year.

As a reminder, CDE will host two upcoming webinars for LEAs to better understand Learning Continuity and Attendance Plans.

Hillsdale High Senior Receives CTE Scholarship

The California Association of Leaders for Career Preparation (CALCP) recently announced that Hillsdale High School Senior Amy Bruhns was the recipient of a 2020 Career Technical Education scholarship.

Hillsdale High School Drama Allison Gamlen nominated Amy for the scholarship and this is what she had to say about her: ""She's an incredibly hard working student and in addition to being a triple threat Amy is also a playwright, director, and designed all the fight choreography in SHE KILLS MONSTERS.""

A recording of She Kills Monster is available to view until May: https://vimeo.com/401046243/839e47b5ea?fbclid=IwAR3O1t3H6TiTTF8o2OtXkfQ0EKGA3PPa_oe6o9IwUr2k3x0m37-3GMlGaCQ

Cal Grant Handbook - California Student Aid Commission

Youth Law Center
February 27 at 11:37 PM ·

For the first time, the California Student Aid Commission will be sharing that youth in juvenile facilities across the state of CA can get financial aid for college. Yesterday, CSAC updated their Cal Grant Handbook, an important tool used by teachers, counselors, and administrators, to say that youth in juvenile facilities who are under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court are not incarcerated, and therefore are indeed eligible for Cal Grant funding. YLC has been working with CSAC to clarify this issue and ensure that this population of aspiring scholars does not get overlooked. This change is important because it opens up more financial aid funding sources for youth in juvenile facilities; youth can get additional funding for books and supplies, as well as for living expenses upon release. Youth who are in facilities long-term may also be able to access funding that can help them pay for a four-year degree through the transfer entitlement program.

‘Humanistic opportunity’: University students and incarcerated youth benefit from tutoring program

Project Change
January 7 at 4:20 PM ·

Over the last four years, College of San Mateo Project Change and Notre Dame de Namur University English Department have collaborated to help young people in the juvenile hall become college students. To further enhance the college experience, NDNU students studying sociology and criminal justice have joined the students in juvenile hall in the classroom to jointly take English courses and offer tutoring services. It has been a life changing experience for students to recognize their similarities rather than differences-everyone in that classroom is a college student; it demystifies what that means.

This is a great article highlighting the deeply impactful work Professor Pearl Bauer and the NDNU students and faculty have done to help our students in Project Change at the SMC juvenile hall accomplish. What a great start to 2020!

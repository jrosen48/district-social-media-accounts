Mr. Marcucci is a native of San Rafael, a proud product of SRCS and has been a teacher and administrator in the District for more than 23 years. At first glance, it may seem that he does not necessarily “fit” the traditional profile of a school district business official. However, we firmly believe his broad base of experience fully qualifies him to successfully navigate this new endeavor. Furthermore, his tremendous knowledge of SRCS; immense personal and professional skills; and passion for serving our community make him the ideal candidate for this senior-level leadership position during this unique time for SRCS and public education when we have the opportunity to re-envision our current structures.

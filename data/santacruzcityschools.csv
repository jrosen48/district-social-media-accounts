One of the most important tips for online learning is communication with your student!

Begin and end the day by checking-in

In the morning, you might ask:

• What classes/subject do you have today?
• Do you have any assessments?
• How will you spend your time?
• What resources do you need?
• What can I do to help?

At the end of the day you might ask:

• How far did you get in your learning tasks today?
• What did you discover? What was hard?
• What could we do to make tomorrow better?

Checking in students to process instructions they received from their teachers helps them to organize themselves and set priorities – older students too. Not all students thrive in distance learning; some struggle with too much independence or lack of structure. These check-in routines can help avoid later challenges and disappointments. They help students develop self-management and executive functioning that are essential skills for life. Parents are good life coaches.

With the job market in the state that it is in during COVID-19, it is very important that when you apply for any position, (even if it is similar to others that you have applied for), that you customize your Resume and Cover letter to the position that you are applying for. Make sure to check all the fine details before submitted your application for employment. The details matter!

Sunday May 17 would have been the 15th anniversary of our Vive Oaxaca Guelaguetza festival in Santa Cruz, but, sadly, we cannot be together this year. We are happy to share videos so you can feel the Guelaguetza spirit of giving while you stay safely at home. Guelaguetza is an indigenous Zapotec word meaning a commitment of sharing and a spirit of cooperation - something we especially need during this time.

FACEMASKS REQUIRED IN PUBLIC STARTING TONIGHT:

The Santa Cruz County Health Officer has issued a new order requiring all residents older than twelve years old to wear a face covering when out in public conducting essential activities, including the use of public transit. The Order goes into effect at midnight tonight and intends to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Community members must wear a face covering while inside or waiting in line to enter an essential business, facility, or location. Businesses have the right to deny service to anyone not wearing a face covering. All essential businesses must require their employees and volunteers to wear a face covering.

A face covering is NOT required when exercising outdoors but it’s recommended you carry one in case you are unable to social distance yourself from others. Children under two must NOT wear them due to the risk of suffocation.

As Bruce McPherson put it, the dream was to transform the former jail from ”a place of incarceration to a place of inspiration.”

1. The deadline to register for the Saturday, February 8th, 2020 ACT test is Friday, January 10th, 2020. Please do this at act.org. You will have to pay for this test.

2. SFTHS plans to host on Wednesday, February 5th during the school day a PowerPrep ACT Test Prep session. Results from this prep have been beneficial to our students.

3. Then, on Tuesday, February 25th, students at SFTHS will have the opportunity to take a free ACT test provided by the State of Kansas. This will happen during the school day at SFT.

The hope is that students will do the Prep on February 5th, test on February 8th, have a chance for reflection, then retest on February 19th. It all a small window but we believe will be successful for our students. We tried this last year but a snow day ruined the second testing opportunity.

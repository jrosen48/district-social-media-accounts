U.S. Census & the Highway 97 Challenge - we've been challenged, Sapulpa!

While we don’t have sports rivalries competing right now, let’s win this competition for Census 2020! Have you completed your census yet? Looks like Sand Springs is beating Sapulpa right now, let’s step up and try to win!

Complete the census online today at www.my2020census.gov or by mail with the form sent to your residence. You can also call 844-330-2020 and speak with a census operator. Your submission is private and confidential.

LET US KNOW YOU'VE COMPLETED YOUR CENSUS BY TAGGING A LOCAL BUSINESS BELOW! IF SAPULPA WINS, WE WILL DO A RANDOM DRAWING FOR SOME PRIZES FROM THOSE WHO COMMENT!

It's estimated that each person who doesn't respond to the census costs our city $1,675 per person, per year for the next 10 years. Think about the resources we could have received if every person in Sapulpa had been counted in 2010!

With so many important resources on the line, we can’t miss our chance to be counted in the 2020 Census! Let’s beat Sand Springs and win this HWY 97 Challenge by May 1st!",8.0,"City of Sapulpa Gov.

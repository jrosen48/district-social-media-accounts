On August 19th, we will be conducting Smart Start from 9:00 Am to 5:00 PM. This event will be held outdoors in front of the JSH in a drive-up fashion similar to our lunch and textbook pick-up.

Since we have been unable to get the 7th grade as a whole into our building, Mr. Leader and Mrs. Serne will be conducting nine-student tours of the building throughout the day. In order to sign up for your 7th-grade student for a tour, please click on the link below. Tours will take less than 30 minutes. Parents will not be allowed to join the tours to ensure our numbers stay below the currently allowed number.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact Mr. Leader, Mrs. Serne or the JSH Office.

We look forward to seeing you all on August 19th.

Have a great day!

Since these are no longer options, It is my hope to do the following:

1. I hope to set up a virtual orientation meeting via Zoom later in May. I will work with the elementary school to collect parent and student emails. The invitation will be sent via email.
2. It is our plan to schedule an in-person open house/building tour in late July or early August, allowing students and parents to explore the building.

Good Morning Staff and Parents,

As of right now, the Remind App used by SCS for snow-day notification is no longer functioning for our district. We have exceeded the number of clients allowable on the free app. Moving to a subscription is quite costly with this program, so we are exploring a number of options for emergency notification.

Given that winter weather is fast approaching, we are looking to have a plan in place for communication as soon as possible. Until this plan is in place, we recommend that parents and students take advantage of the notification services available through local media outlets (WOODTV8, FOX17, WZZM).

We will continue to use the options available to us to communicate with parents (Facebook, Twitter, and parent email groups).

As soon as we have more information, it will be forwarded to staff, parents and students.

Thank you for your patience. Have a great day!",6.0,"Update: The Remind account is now active.

As part of our efforts to provide appropriate crisis response for our staff and students, SCS administration has made arrangements for the organization, HOPE: Animal-Assisted Crisis Response Teams, to have a number of canine response teams in the JSH and elementary buildings Tuesday and Wednesday.

The canine teams will work in coordination with the counselors we have arranged to be on-site assisting students in coping with the grieving process. The elementary canine team will work specifically with the sixth grade staff and students, providing assistance in that wing of the building.

I have attached a link to video provided by the organization outlining their work. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact any district administrator.

Thank you for your support throughout this difficult process.

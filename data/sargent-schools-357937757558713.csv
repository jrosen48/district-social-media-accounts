It is with great sadness that I announce the passing of one of our 2nd grade students Tristen Benns. He passed away Friday in a car accident.

His father, Josiah, asked that I send a message to all our parents:

""Please have your children buckle up correctly. Have kids use their shoulder strap, even if it is tight or uncomfortable.""

We will have some fundraising opportunities to honor Tristen when school resumes. More details will follow. You may contact myself or Clay Kimberling ckimberling@sargent.k12.co.us for more information.

It is with a heavy heart that we, the Sargent Staff, want to inform you of the passing of Mrs. Mary Garcia. Mary started at Sargent in 2002 as a custodial substitute. Then in 2004, she was hired as our librarian paraprofessional. In 2018, Mary was reassigned as the secondary administrative assistant. During her time in Sargent, she touched many hearts with her bubbly attitude and her huge heart for kids. The lasting connections she made with students and staff will be remembered for a long time.

There will be a Rosary service on Friday, September 13, 2019 at 7pm the Center Catholic Church and the funeral service will be on Saturday, September 14, 2019 at 10am again in Center at the Catholic Church.

This note is a short reminder of our illness policy which was previously sent out to you via school reach.
PLEASE do NOT send your child to school if they are vomiting or have a fever of 100 degrees or greater. In addition, excessive coughing is a disruption to their learning and to that of the class. Please DO NOT use fever reducing medicine and send them to school as if they are healthy. This is a violation of our policy and spreads illness.
They must stay home 24 hours after vomiting, fever, or starting antibiotics for contagious disease (such as Strep).
If you are unsure whether or not to send your child to school please contact us. Ask yourself if your child can learn and will benefit from school given their current condition. Sometimes as parents (and nurses!) we make mistakes and send our children to school and they become ill. That's ok! But please use the previous guidelines to prevent your child from infecting others.
We realize you have work and other commitments but this will be strictly enforced.
Sincerely,
Gina Stephens RN, BSN

The proud hiking companion of two dare-devil rabbits, I'm coming to KMS in my sixth year of teaching Middle School Spanish. I am actually coming back to the area: I used to work down the road in Hancock, teaching outdoor skills at a magical place called Sargent Camp, many moons ago. In recent years, however, I have taken on the rewarding work of teaching Spanish in the classroom. I am so glad to be back in the Monadnock Region!

The thing I love most about teaching Spanish is helping learners express themselves and their ideas in a new language, as they discover for themselves the best-kept secret of language-learning: It's easier than you think! After all, our brains are hard-wired for language!

When I'm not teaching, you can find me in one of three places: curled up with a good book, out among the trees and mountains of New Hampshire, or on a paddleboard crewed by Captain Hatchet (the gray one) and First Mate Auger (the white one).",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2750387908580013&id=1605045546447594,,0.0,"¡Hola!

The proud hiking companion of two dare-devil rabbits, I'm coming to KMS in my sixth year of teaching Middle School Spanish. I am actually coming back to the area: I used to work down the road in Hancock, teaching outdoor skills at a magical place called Sargent Camp, many moons ago. In recent years, however, I have taken on the rewarding work of teaching Spanish in the classroom. I am so glad to be back in the Monadnock Region!

The thing I love most about teaching Spanish is helping learners express themselves and their ideas in a new language, as they discover for themselves the best-kept secret of language-learning: It's easier than you think! After all, our brains are hard-wired for language!

When I'm not teaching, you can find me in one of three places: curled up with a good book, out among the trees and mountains of New Hampshire, or on a paddleboard crewed by Captain Hatchet (the gray one) and First Mate Auger (the white one).",2020-09-07 13:20:00,,

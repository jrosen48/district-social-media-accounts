Hey everyone! My name is Amanda Jordan and I was a senior at Souhegan this year. For the past 8 weeks I have been working with sophomore Shannon Hargreaves to create a talk show with superintendent Adam Steel. We’ve had so much fun, and it was a nice way to hear about other students’ and teachers’ experiences with remote learning. For our final episode, I interviewed an amazing group of fellow seniors to talk about their experiences at Souhegan. I think it puts into perspective how resilient and selfless my class of 2020 has been these past few months, and I couldn’t be prouder to be a part of it. Thanks to anyone who takes the time to watch :)))

- Shovel the walkway of a nice neighbor (leave the others to save themselves); or

Chance a delay might be needed for tomorrow (Monday). Snow is expected to start around 3-4am and then turn to rain during our normal commute. Should be no more than an inch of snow, but the turnover to rain could create hazardous conditions. I’ll be up early to evaluate.

Also, remember- no school on Tuesday!

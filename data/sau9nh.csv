Hi everyone, We hope you are all staying healthy! What have we been up to? Well, remote learning has been different, for sure, but we are still actively learning to improve our drumming skills. One of our assignments was a study on syncopated rhythms. ""What are syncopated rhythms,"" you might ask? Well, syncopation happens when rhythms are played in unexpected ways by shifting the placement of the most important notes. Syncopation helps make rhythms interesting and unpredictable. After we learned to play some syncopated rhythms, we had Google meetings by sections (snare drums, bass drums, quad (tenor) drums, and cymbals). Each section created syncopated rhythms, combining and adapting the rhythms we studied, without knowing what the other sections were composing. Then Dr. Davison entered them into a computer program to hear the resulting composition. We are excited to present, for the first time ever, our Socially Distant Groove. We plan to play it (live and in person) year after year in the future. 🥁 PLEASE LISTEN AND ENJOY!",0.0,"Kennett Drumline

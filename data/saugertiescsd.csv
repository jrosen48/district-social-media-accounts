Please know that my administrative team and I are working hard to get you what you need to continue learning and achieving. These are unprecedented times for those of us in public schools. While the way students are learning may be changing, our passion for educating them remains as strong as ever.

As always, I thank you for your support and flexibility during this health crisis. Saugerties is a strong community, made up of resilient people. It will take that spirit and more to get us through this, but I’m confident that we can and will, together.

The challenge is part of a national campaign that encourages students to create a culture of kindness, acceptance, unity, and respect. The Riccardi Kindness Committee took the lead by giving every adult in the building a rose for being so supportive of students.

• Student achievement
• Culture, climate and community
• Safety and security

These goals have been established for each school in the District and building leadership has been notified of the updates.

Superintendent Kirk Reinhardt said, “The District’s goals will build on our students natural curiosity and learning styles, so that they will emerge as creative, collaborative, critical thinkers who can communicate effectively and persevere in a rapidly changing world in order to meet their individual potential.”

The goals also factored in overall student wellness and safety. “A student’s social, emotional, and physical well-being is just as important as their academic success,” Reinhardt said.

Bridgeport's ScienceCon is both an event to attend and an event to participate in!
As a presentation team, groups of up to 4 students (and their families) worked together to create a STEM based presentation.
The presenting teams decided on a STEM-related question they wanted to ask. Then through a science/stem-based hands-on demonstration, the team guided their audience toward the answer to their question. Each presentation/demonstration was about 2-4 minutes in length.

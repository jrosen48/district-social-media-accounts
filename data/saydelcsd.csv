Here's a fun little article I wanted to share with all of you from the December 31, 1961 Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register that highlights the then upcoming bond referendum for the original Cornell Elementary School Building. Enjoy :)

Highlights:
The original bond issue to build the first phase of Cornell as well as a 4 classroom addition to Norwoodville Elementary was $400,000 and 30,000 SF = $13.69/SF. Comparatively, you would spend between $240-$330/SF for new construction today or $7.2M-$9.9M, a 2500% increase in cost between 1961 and today - talk about inflation!

The passage of the bond issue allowed the district to close 4 substandard country style schoolhouses, two of which did not have modern plumbing.

From the 1954 formation of the Saydel consolidated school district to when the article was written 8 years later, the school district attempted 4 separate bond referendums and voters never turned down a bond issue, they all passed!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3269186889839169&id=213087038782518,,0.0,"Saydel Folks,

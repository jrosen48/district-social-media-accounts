Sayre ISD is communicating with parents of students who will be juniors during the 2019-20 school year.

Our school district plans to administer the ACT® test in spring 2020 to eligible juniors as part of the state contract with the Oklahoma State Department of Education and ACT.

Last year over 95% of Oklahoma schools selected to administer the ACT. Our district believes this is an excellent opportunity for all eligible juniors to take the ACT at no cost to them or their families.

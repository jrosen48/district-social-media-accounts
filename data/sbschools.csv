Art Teachers and Counselors at Indian Fields had a conversation about working together to thank essential workers who had been helping all of us stay safe and well during this time of Covid-19. They met with Administrators to plan how to accomplish this goal and decided to co-teach lessons to K-5 students on Gratitude during virtual lessons, and offer students and staff the opportunity to make pieces of artwork to express their gratitude. After everyone made their beautiful artwork, they collected the pictures and created a video to share with essential workers, organizations and businesses in our community.

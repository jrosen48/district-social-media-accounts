Dr. Duncan Andrade told the crowd: “As you all start this school year, I really encourage you to think hard about who among the young people in your community are the most vulnerable. Those have to be folks that you flood your energy with. It’s not a zero sum game. If you are really investing in the most vulnerable and wounded ones, that has a ripple effect. What I’m encouraging us to do is seek solitary with the most wounded ones. How do you take care of, support, invest in those who need us the most. When those folks start to rise, everyone rises.”

Funding Reform must happen now for our students! Be a voice for our communities.

Do you know how lawmakers avoid funding the base student cost created in 1977 called the Education Finance Act. Lawmakers use a funding formula but house budget writers since 2010 have reduced the mandated cost to $2,400 (2017) per student by “determining” in a budget proviso they want base spending to be lower. In other words, they get around the law by simply rewriting the mandate year after year. In 2017-18, it meant 721,401 students in K-12 schools will get $421.3 million less than what they are supposed to get by law.

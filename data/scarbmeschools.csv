Currently, there is a need for 3-6 volunteers at Scarborough Middle School for a 6th grade JA in a Day program, ""It’s My Business"" on March 13. All materials and support are provided! Email Pamela (pbennett@jamaine.org) if you can help!

Here are answers to common questions that you might be wondering about:
Will I have to develop lesson plans? No, Junior Achievement provides a program curriculum, along with a volunteer guide to facilitate the process. Your role is to introduce hands-on activities that demonstrate key concepts, then share your work and life experience with students.
Will I receive training? Yes, a member of the Junior Achievement team will conduct training to ensure you are prepared for your classroom experience.
Do I have to have teaching experience to volunteer? No, just a willingness to prepare for each session and a desire to work with students.

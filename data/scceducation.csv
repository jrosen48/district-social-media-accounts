From the Times Herald:
The St. Clair County Library is offering virtual library cards following the closure of all branches due to the coronavirus pandemic. Those who do not already have a library card may call any of the library’s branches and acquire a new library card or renew their old card. Patrons will then receive a temporary virtual card, according to a St. Clair County press release.

The release states the card will be available for use of the library’s online and entertainment services.

The service will be offered throughout the library’s closure. All St. Clair County library branches closed indefinitely on Monday, according to the library system’s website.",2020-03-20 13:41:10,,

The federal Centers for Disease Control reports that flu activity is greatly increasing around the country. Most flu activity is being caused by influenza B/Victoria viruses, which is unusual for this time of year. A/H1N1 viruses are the second most common strains.

Everyone 6 months of age and older should get a flu vaccine every year. Antibodies can take two weeks to develop and provide protection against flu. “Contrary to comments often heard, it is impossible to get influenza from the flu vaccine. The vaccine is the best way of protecting yourself and those around you from the flu,” said Dr. Annette Mercatante, Medical Health Officer.

The St. Clair County Health Department has a variety of flu vaccines to meet everyone’s needs (while supplies last). Most insurance is accepted and flu vaccines are typically a covered benefit.

This weeks book is:
Ladybug Girl and Bingo By: David Soman and Jacky Davis

Before reading the book:
After looking at the nature scenes on the front and back covers, talk together about outdoor adventures.

After reading the book:
Ask your child questions about the story. Why did Lulu hook Bingo's leash over a branch instead of holding it? How did Lulu feel when Bingo ran off?

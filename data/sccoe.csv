保護您自己免受煙霧及新冠的威脅： ⁣
⁣
➡️ 盡可能的待在室內，將窗戶及門關上，直到煙霧退散。在空氣品質不健康的情況下減少出門。

➡️ 在公共空間。戴上面罩保護自己和他人免受 COVID威脅。

➡️ 減少在戶外的活動時間。

➡️ 把冷氣和車內的通氣閥調成循環，避免外面的空氣進到裡面。

Coloring helps to improve mood, enhance mindfulness, and reduce mental health stress. It allows our attention to shift away from ourselves and focus on the present moment, and specific task at hand. A low stakes activity, coloring is pleasurable and relaxes our brains; it doesn’t need to be predictable or prescriptive. Coloring can be as neat, or as messy, as you choose - one of its relaxing perks.

To close out today's #WellnessWednesday, we turn to our friends at the Santa Clara County Office of LGBTQ Affairs. Their Kids Activity Book is wonderful for all ages. Created by, and based on the art, books, and work of Maya Gonzalez - Author & Artist, this booklet allows children and their families/chosen families to color and read shorts stories that will help explore and celebrate the unique LGBTQ presence in nature, community, and more!

Take time for yourself, every day, to write down something that made you happy, grateful, appreciative, etc. Place your note into your jar. Whenever you want or need, open the jar and read all the amazing things that made you smile.

Your personal Happiness & Gratitude Jar will provide an opportunity to pause for mindful reflection. It is important to take hold of the the spirit of living, celebrate life, and capture memories. Five minutes a day is all it takes to make note of the rainbows in your life, rather than thunderstorms.

We dig a little deeper into our #HarvestoftheMonth watermelon 🍉 in this episode of Harvest with Holly, featuring fresh watermelon servings from Douglas County School Nutrition and Brantley County School Nutrition in their school meals!

Today, Holly makes her Watermelon and Arugula salad, topped with Feta Cheese and a fresh fig vinaigrette, inspired by the Savannah-Chatham County Public School System School Nutrition Program. It sounds soooo fancy but it’s so cool and super easy to make! Feel free to show us how you are using watermelons in this summer heat 🌞…

Fun Fact: Georgia is one of the top watermelon producing States in the nation. Can you name 3 of our top 10 highest producing counties?

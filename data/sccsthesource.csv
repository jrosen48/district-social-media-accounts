Class night is held every year in the auditorium at school and each senior gets recognized on stage and says what they’re doing after highschool. Each senior picks an underclassman to be their torch bearer, and the seniors line up around the auditorium and the torch bearers blow out the seniors' candles. The tradition is that after class night you go out to dinner with your torch bearer, but this year we had to do it over a zoom meeting. All of the seniors and some teachers were in the meeting, the class officers introduced the seniors and told where they’re going. Then the senior slideshow was shown. It was very short and sweet but it was nice to at least be recognized and get to see some of our classmates",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3184557158256857&id=805915219454408,,0.0,"Virtual Class Night

In New York City crime rates have dropped 28.5 percent in the month of April according to NYPD statistics. Certain crimes have skyrocketed since the lockdown, like burglaries to small businesses.

By Wisteria Kirk

COVID-19 is definitely a drag, but one perk is the low gas prices. This pandemic is causing a sharp decline in the demand for gas. Only essential workers have to drive to work everyday and others are following the advice to stay home.
The lower demand for gas coincided with the surplus in the oil market, which lowered prices per barrel and compounded the drop in prices at the pump.
Typically during the winter, gas prices are lower while during the summer they increase when there is high demand for summer driving activities.
At this time, according to AAA, the per gallon average across the United States is $1.85.
Kentucky is seen to have the lowest gas prices at the moment at a whopping 89 cents a gallon, followed by Ohio selling gas at 91 cents a gallon.
The last time gas prices were this low was in 2004, due to a crash in the oil market.
As states reopen and the nation starts to drive, prices will most likely start to rise.

Monday April 6, 2020, Boris Johnson - the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom - was moved into intensive care following a hospital visit from the day before.

Johnson is one of 52,000 people in the U.K to contract Covid-19 and one of the 1.3 million to contract Covid-19 worldwide.

Despite the Prime Minister’s visit to intensive care following a sharp decline in his condition Monday night, he is in “good spirits” and is currently in a stable condition, and breathing without assistance according to his spokesperson.

The United Kingdom’s Secretary of State for Foreign Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom, Dominic Raab, is filling in for Boris Johnson as interim Prime Minister while Johnson recovers in the hospital.",2020-04-08 10:04:25,,

COVID-19 has been a stressful situation for everyone. On top of having to get adjusted to online school, we have been informed we will no longer be having spring break.
It is normal to be anxious in this unfortunate situation. If you are feeling stressed here are some fun ways to relax and have a day to focus on yourself.
Have a spa day! No matter who you are, everyone can have a spa day. Whether it’s doing little things to make you feel better like painting your nails or doing a facemask or even just taking a long bath or shower. Anything can help to de-stress.
Take a moment to yourself and a break from schoolwork. It is alway okay to give yourself a day to watch some Netflix and lay in bed. If you're not someone who likes to sit in bed all day, go for a run and de-stress through exercise.
Seeing a familiar face may also brighten your mood. Call or FaceTime a friend to catch up on their quarantine activities.

Cancelled Break Not A Popular Decision
By Brooke Walter

When I read an article about the Governor saying highschool students will not have a spring break and will resume classes during that week I was confused and didn’t think it would apply to us so I didn’t really think about it. But then my mom woke me up this morning to tell me that we will still have classes and homework next week instead of break, and I was so upset. My thoughts and feelings on it are that not being in school for the past couple of weeks is not a break for us, we still do work for all of our classes and none of us are happy to not be in school, it’s not a break. I think it’s unfair that we don’t have a spring break and a break from our classes and work.

Mark Saxton

The city of Roswell, New Mexico - home of the famous U.F.O crash in 1947 - is looking for artists to design a city monument using a decommissioned piece of playground equipment originally installed in the 1960’s, making it over 50 years old.

The city wants the monument to honor not only the popular conspiracy theory but also the father of modern rocket science, Robert H. Goddard - who did much of his work in Roswell between 1930-41, and the sci-fi pop-culture that has swept through the city since the 40’s. The location of the monument has not yet been chosen and will be up to the artist’s discretion

The only requirement from the city is that artists must use the original rocket-ship design as the old playground equipment, but other than the rocket-ship they may do anything they wish.

The competition started on January 24, 2020 and all designs are due to the city on February 28, 2020.

The Stark County Lady Rebels cross country team has been included in Mike Newman‚Äôs ILXCTF Girls IHSA Class 1A Cross Country Season Preview. The feature ranks the top 30 cross country teams in Class 1A and lists the top 20 teams in the state that although not ranked, are the top contenders to qualify for the State Series. The Lady Rebels have been included as one of the top contenders to qualify for State this season, which recognizes them as one of the top 50 class 1A cross country teams in the state. It is an accomplishment simply to be included in the preview and further motivation to the team for this coming season.

Our first race will be August 26th 2020 at 4:00 p.m. on our home course at the Stark County High School, when the girls begin their defense of their 2019 LTC Conference Championship.

Pride & Excellence! Go Lady Rebels!!!

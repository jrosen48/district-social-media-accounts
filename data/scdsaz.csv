‚ÄúIn alignment with yesterday‚Äôs updated federal guidance, today we are announcing the extension of school closures through the remainder of the school year. Today‚Äôs announcement is intended to give parents and educators as much certainty as possible so they can plan and make decisions. While this isn‚Äôt the outcome any of us wanted, we are grateful for the partnership of schools around the state, who have stepped up to offer virtual and take-home learning opportunities for our students. These efforts are crucial, and we recognize that schools are making every effort possible to continue providing instruction during closures. We also thank our legislative partners for passing legislation ensuring all educators and staff see no disruption in pay. Our number one priority will continue to be health and safety, and we will continue to work closely with public health officials to make the best decisions for kids, families, and our school communities.‚Äù",2020-03-30 11:25:04,,

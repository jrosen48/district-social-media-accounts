""My name is Jack Hyatt and I studied biosystems, specifically the solar side of it. I studied solar stills by trying to create working ones myself. Solar stills are devices that purify water by evaporating water to separate it from the impurities and condensing the water vapor somewhere else so there is a batch of only water. It took me 3 different designs, with each design needing rework, for 6 total attempts to get a working model. My learning experience was great in that I obtained hands-on experience of designs failing, to then needing to look back and rework on those designs. The information I got from the camp overall served as a good introduction to biosystems as something I could be more interested in when I go to college.""",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157979758217415&id=35847922414,,0.0,"GSSM Accelerate Govie, Jack Hyatt, explains the research he conducted during the Accelerate virtual summer camp this year.

Q: Favorite memory at GSSM?
A: I would have to say my favorite memory at GSSM was pulling the all-nighter before graduation last year. Being able to spend time with all of my friends before we left truly reminded me that GSSM is my home.

Q: What made you decide to come to GSSM?
A: Honestly, I simply wanted a change and to be challenged academically. My old school wasn't helping me grow as a scholar or a person and I needed to find a place that would.

Q: What is your dream job?
A: I have no clue. But, if I had to answer, my dream job would probably the head of a non-profit or even just to own my own ice cream shop on the side of whatever I do.

Q: Advice for rising Seniors?
A: Don't take anything in the school for granted.

Q: Favorite memory with GSSM Accelerate?
A: My favorite memory is asking Mrs. S to be my valentine.

Q: What is your dream job?
A: My dream job is working on disease cures for the CDC.

Q: Advice for rising Seniors?
A: My advice for seniors is to get to know and be friends with your classmates from different schools and to just put your head down and keep trucking through the work load as long as you can, because as soon as that senioritis hits you, there is no recovering.

Q: Advice for rising Juniors?
A: My advice to juniors in Accelerate is to not get frustrated and to continue to remember the reward at the end of the road. Also find a community at your home school, whether it be a sport or club.

Q: What are your plans after high school?
A: I will be attending Clemson University and their honors program and pursuing a degree in biochemical engineering.

Q: Favorite memory at GSSM?
A: I was preparing for a math final and skipped dinner. I accidentally ate a bunch of protein bars that I found in my room thinking they were granola bars. The math final the next day was painful.

Q: What made you decide to come to GSSM?
A: I was interested in meeting more people like me and learning about the subjects that I am interested in. I was certain that if I got too bored at my old school I would wind up failing out.

Q: What is your dream job?
A: The person who taste tests fruit snacks, or an engineer.

Q: Advice for rising Seniors?
A: Better to take too many classes in high school than to take too many classes in college. Test your limits.

Q: Advice for rising Juniors?
A: Don't freak out about college. Also, try to make good habits for yourself-- consistent sleep and exercise will help you in weird ways.

Q: What are your plans after high school?
A: College, work, etc.",2020-05-05 08:30:00,,

Q: Favorite memory at GSSM?
A: My favorite GSSM memory is eating lunch with my friends. We often ate lunch outside, and it was the best break from classes.

Q: What made you decide to come to GSSM?
A: I decided to come to GSSM to strengthen my skills in math and science. I also decided to come for the new experiences!

Q: What is your dream job?
A: My dream job is to work as an environmental engineer.

Q: Advice for rising Seniors?
A: Be there for the juniors if they need help! GSSM can be scary sometimes, and the juniors may need advice or help from time to time. Be a leader and help them out!

Q: Advice for rising Juniors?
A: My advice to future Juniors is go to office hours if you need help! It is better to get help directly from the teacher because they can let you know the best way to solve a problem.

My favorite memory at GSSM was spending time with my friends touring the beautifully laid out streets of Washington DC on an academic team trip.

My dream job is to either work as a policy analyst for the State Department, an urban planner for the Boston City government, or as an Economics professor. My advice is for seniors to keep in contact with your friends from GSSM. They are not only good people but they will also act as a strong addition to your social network in the professional world. My advice for juniors is to find your true passion but also be considerate of economic and material needs.

Q: Favorite memory at GSSM?
A: My favorite memory at GSSM was INSIDE GSSM 2020. I got to teach kids of the Hartsville community how to write Medieval Calligraphy and stamp wax seals. As well, as share the craft of making quill pens with the parents.

Q: What made you decide to come to GSSM?
A: I saw greater opportunity for me academically and socially at GSSM.

Q: What is your dream job?
A: Forensic Pathologist

Q: Advice for rising Seniors?
A: It‚Äôs fine to play it safe Junior year, but set yourself up to make the most of every opportunity that can put yourself out there Senior year.

Q: Advice for rising Juniors?
A: Make sure any new found freedom doesn‚Äôt intervene with your academics, but don‚Äôt forget to try new things as you may discover a side of yourself you‚Äôve never seen before.

Q: What are your plans after high school?
A: For the next four years, I‚Äôll be earning my bachelor‚Äôs degree at the College of Charleston followed by Medical school. I‚Äôll specialize in forensic pathology and sometime down the line, I will go castle hunting in Scotland.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157541942187415&id=35847922414,,0.0,"#Seniorspotlight Alicia Bejarano

3. During Christmas time, there is an annual contest for the best-decorated dorm room, and the competition is close!

4. There are a lot of sentimental pass downs that Juniors receive from Seniors. These pass downs are a secret. The only way to find out what they are is if you become a Govie.

5. The residential living program is based in a House System, where each floor represents a House. There is a year-long competition each year that each house participates in.

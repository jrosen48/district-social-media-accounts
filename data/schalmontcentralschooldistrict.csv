Schalmont placed 7th in the state in the 8th Annual CLYNK for Schools Recycling Challenge, with students and partners collecting more than 7,500 returnable cans and bottles!
What’s great is that CLYNK pays an extra $.50 for every dollar we earn, so we are hoping to earn close to $500! In addition to that, Hannaford Supermarketsrewards three schools with additional prizes – one of which is awarded to a school they feel did a great job. Hopefully sharing these pictures will help us!

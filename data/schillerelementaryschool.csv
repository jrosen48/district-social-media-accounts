IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT:

Centralia City Schools Family,

The Governor’s announcement today that school will be closed for the remainder of the year is sobering. However, the Board of Education, principals, teachers, and support staff are dedicated to continuing meaningful learning opportunities, food service, and student and family support until the end of the school year. Over the next few days, the administrative team will continue the process of reviewing and analyzing our current Remote Learning Plan. We will adapt as needed and work hard to make sure you are up to date on current information as we have it. Remember to look to www.ccs135.com for all information and updates on our school closure page. I am extremely proud of the way everyone has handled this difficult situation. Your support and encouragement has helped to keep us motivated. Thank you and stay safe.

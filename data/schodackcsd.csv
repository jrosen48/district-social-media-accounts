Thank you for your patience as we have worked to develop and implement our reopening plan. We know that a technology survey went out earlier this summer, however, throughout our planning process we have found that it will be vital for our students to have computer access at home and in school.

We are asking that you complete this form to let us know if you have a personal device (Chromebook or laptop) that you are comfortable allowing your child to bring back and forth to school or if you need a school-issued device.

We will have a device pick-up time on Tuesday, Sept. 8th and Wednesday, Sept. 9th. from 3:00-5:00 pm. Parents who indicate the need for a device can pick it up any time during the pick-up window at the CES main office entrance. Students will need a device in order to access learning activities on the first day of school, whether in-person or remote.

Please fill out one form per child.

As soon as we noticed the odor, we moved a class that was scheduled to use the auditorium to the cafeteria to investigate the cause. After checking the school's boiler room, kitchen, and crawl space under the building, we determined the cause of the odor was changes to the basement ventilation that were made Thursday. We reversed those changes, which resolved the issue. As a precaution, we installed carbon monoxide and natural gas detectors in the auditorium and adjoining band room, which indicated no issues.

Castleton Elementary School students spent time learning from two Yale University scientists today.

Chemist Hannah Lant and Quantum Physicist Chris Wang visited the school to discuss their work, lead experiments and answer questions about their experiences in the field of science.

Ms. Lant showed the type of work she does in a laboratory by involving students in an experiment to split water using common items such as pencils in a solution that was connected to a small battery. Mr. Wang discussed his work to create a quantum computer that is more powerful than a standard computer, sharing a piece of his work.

The two graduate students were invited to the school by Innovative Learning Lab Teacher Sarah Lant.

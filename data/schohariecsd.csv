Read for Ronald McDonald House encourages children in their achievements in reading, a core skill that is vital to their future success in life. By participating in this program, children gain skills in reading comprehension, grammar and critical thinking. By giving their time to help others – and using their reading skills to make a difference in their community – students experience empowerment and learn the value of community service. Offered as a school-based program and a small-group program, Read for Ronald McDonald House is simple to participate in. For one month, children will track their reading minutes on the provided reading calendar and ask family and friends to sponsor their reading. At the end of the month, donations are gathered and returned to the Ronald McDonald House.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=754679244943424&id=180814365663251,,0.0,"Schoharie Elementary students received a visit from Southpaw, the Tri-City ValleyCats mascot today as part of the Read for Ronald McDonald House program.

By participating in this program, children gain skills in reading comprehension, grammar and critical thinking. By giving their time to help others – and using their reading skills to make a difference in their community – students experience empowerment and learn the value of community service. Offered as a school-based program and a small-group program, Read for Ronald McDonald House is simple to participate in. For one month, children will track their reading minutes on the provided reading calendar and ask family and friends to sponsor their reading.

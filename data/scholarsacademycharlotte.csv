As we head in to the weekend, here are a couple of ideas for some at home family fun:
YOGA JENGA - Using a sharpie, mark each Jenga block with the name of a yoga pose (see picture provided). Set up your Jenga for usual game play. During each person's turn, remove a block carefully without tumbling the tower. Then, the player demonstrates the pose written on their block. If the tower tumbles, the player tries to hold the pose for 30 seconds.
No Jenga set - no problem. Using regular blocks, an assortment of boxes, etc. mark each item with a yoga pose and take turns using one item to help build a structure and demonstrate the name of your yoga pose. Once the structure is finished, everyone holds the last item's yoga pose for 30 seconds.
EASY DIY BIRD FEEDER - Use any plastic bottle and up cycle for a feeder for your feathered friends:

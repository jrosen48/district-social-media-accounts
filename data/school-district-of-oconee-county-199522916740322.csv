SDOC schools will now be in session on February 26 and March 30 to make up for the two days missed.

Walhalla Middle School and Oconee Academy also missed September 13 due to power outages. To make up for that day, ONLY these two schools will also attend school on Monday, October 23. Buses will run routes as usual for these two schools on that day.

Students who already have plans on those make-up days can send in a note to the school and the absence will be excused. Any absence does count against perfect attendance as the South Carolina definition of perfect attendance is that “students have not accumulated any absences – excused or unexcused.”

I received a message that a 1977 WHS class ring was found in Florida. I have the three initials engraved inside and the first one is L. Any ideas on who might have a list of 1977 graduates? Is there an alumni group from WHS? Thanks for any help you can provide!,2017-06-22 17:56:16,,

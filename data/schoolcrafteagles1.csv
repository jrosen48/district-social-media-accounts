The next week or two will start a new chapter in public education. There is a huge learning curve that students, teachers, and families will be navigating together.

As we embark on distance learning I am asking everyone to refrain from publicly scrutinizing their children’s teachers/schools/district for the way they are teaching and/or assigning lessons.

Please offer grace to your child’s teacher and other school personnel. I promise that educating your children is still their #1 priority. There will be differences from school to school and teacher to teacher - just like there always has been when school was delivered in-person.

Public schools are about to navigate uncharted waters with little to no prep time. This is a crisis, not a time to be playing armchair quarterback. They love our kids and will be doing their absolute best!

Fellow educators, you know what to do. You have been caring and supporting most of our country's children for a long time. Keep on keeping on.

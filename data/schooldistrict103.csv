In observance of Veterans Day, we recognize Stevenson alumni and staff who have served. We also recall this reunion that occurred last year when Marine Corps Pfc. Jeffery Harris III, a 2015 alumnus, arrived at Stevenson for a surprise visit.

Pfc. Harris is scheduled to deploy to Iraq in April. He will be home for the holidays and his family is seeking support from the community to give him a memorable send-off. https://www.gofundme.com/1st-born-son-graduates-from-usmc?fbclid=IwAR1J-l6sWwcAvEVaVpDW-3B6qz70kL66ENtQ9_WKqEm3Puai51YL6DKROvQ",0.0,"Adlai E.

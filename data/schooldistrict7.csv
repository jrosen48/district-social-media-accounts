EIGHT of our seniors were recently recognized as National Merit Semifinalists as part of the 66th National Merit Scholarship Program. In order to qualify as a Semifinalist, students take the Preliminary SAT Test (PSAT) and are the highest scorers in each of the 50 states. Our honorees are Will Beeson, Ilan Falcon, Tristen Godfrey, Andrew (Drew) Lawton, Jackson Van Hyning, Jacob Price, Harrison VanVleet, and Alexander (Xander) Woodfin. They were among 197 students encompassing public, private, and homeschools across South Carolina to achieve the ranking nationwide.

Drivers should slow down below the posted speed limits while traveling through school zones. Countless pedestrians will trek to and from area schools during mornings and afternoons.

Ron Clark showed up as a surprise guest on a Zoom session this morning with Angela Eaton’s Teacher Cadet class from Spartanburg High School. But it gets better! Mr. Clark offered all educators in D7 an opportunity to take part in a Zoom PD session on distance learning this afternoon. Melody Nease from Jesse Boyd said she loved Ron Clark’s energy, ideas and tips for helping students succeed during distance learning.
Ours learning and growth – both at the student level and at the teacher level - does not stop just because our buildings are closed!

C'mon Spartanburg, we're at 50.3% self-response rate. It's better than the 46.5% SC rate, but we MUST do better in support of our children! The images show data from the 2010 census regarding the exclusion rates of young children from the count. Most of those children are now 3rd/4th graders whose needs were not calculated from the data we generated. Let's ensure this does not happen again. Spread the word!

For today’s #BlackHistoryMonth feature, we’re shining the spotlight on Dr. C.C. Woodson!

“Dr. C.C. Woodson was born in Spartanburg, S.C. and attended Carrier Street and Dean Street elementary schools, two of the first black schools in Spartanburg. He received his M.A. in Secondary Administration and Supervision at the University of Michigan. In 1932 he was appointed principal of the Cummings Street High School and Elementary School and remained there until the fall of 1938 when he assumed the position of principal of Carver High School. In 1953, Woodson, as part of a committee from the Palmetto Teachers Association successfully lobbied the State Board of Education for the equalization of teacher salaries.”

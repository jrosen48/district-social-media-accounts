I am so proud of my students for pulling of a virtual choir!! “The Storm Is Passing Over” is usually performed at the end of each spring concert and is so appropriate now. Seniors usually line the front of the stage and alumni join all of the choirs to sing in this tradition. Since that couldn’t happen tonight, one of my amazing senior Beacon Academy students was able to edit this together! I am so grateful for him and his many hours of work on this project!! Enjoy!!

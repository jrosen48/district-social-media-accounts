National Weather Service Update:

A very warm and moist air mass in place late this afternoon together with good atmospheric shear will set up the potential for severe weather. The time period of concern is 4 PM through 10 PM as a cold frontal boundary moves from northwest to southeast across the Midlands and Central Savannah River Area. Thunderstorms are possible, a few of which could contain damaging winds - including isolated tornadoes.

At the beginning of the school year, I created an ""Accreditation Team"" to begin the process of earning accreditation for SAIL. As we were submitting our application to AdvancED, a merger was happening. The new name is now COGNIA. Once the Accreditation Team completed our Readiness Evaluation, a representative from COGNIA reviewed our answers. He then visited the school today, walked the building and met with the team to discuss our answers to determine if SAIL is prepared for the accreditation process.

I'm happy to announce that he is recommending that SAIL move forward and begin the next steps of accreditation!

This is an exciting time for SAIL. I'm so thankful for our committee for driving the accreditation process. Please take a moment to thank our Accreditation Team members:

Mr. D
Kelli Kelly
Ken Prescott
Becky Morlan
Teresa Fox
Kayla Biles
Dianne Lyon

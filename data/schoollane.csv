We are proud to announce that Edward Solis will be graduating this June. After graduation he plans to go into the horse racing industry and start his own business. He is still exploring his areas of interest. In 5 years you can find Edward at the Kentucky Derby Winners Circle. Edward is the President of Student Government. His favorite memory of his time at SLCS was in Student Government. He said this about his experience; “They called me the president for some reason and til this day I still don't know why? hmm Could I've been?!?! nah lol.” As a student leader Edward’s advice for underclassmen is; “It's honestly okay if you still don't know what you want in life after high school. Life isn't supposed to be figured out in 4 short years. Character development is extremely crucial during this time. Focus on developing yourself as a person and the rest will follow.” Congratulations Eddie! We are proud of you and can not wait to see you accomplish your dreams!

This is Jim Thorpe. Look closely at the photo, you can see that he's wearing different socks and shoes. This wasn't a fashion statement. It was the 1912 Olympics, and Jim, an American Indian from Oklahoma represented the U.S. in track and field. On the morning of his competitions, his shoes were stolen. Luckily, Jim ended up finding two shoes in a garbage can. That's the pair that he's wearing in the photo. But one of the shoes was too big, so he had to wear an extra sock. Wearing these shoes, Jim won two gold medals that day.

This is a perfect reminder that you don't have to resign to the excuses that have held you back. So what if life hasn't been fair? What are you going to do about it today? Whatever you woke up with this morning; stolen shoes, ill health, failed relationships, don't let it stop you from running your race. You can experience more in life if you'll get over the excuses and get on with living. You can have reasons or you can have results and you can't have both.

Wearing these shoes, Jim won two gold medals that day.

This is a perfect reminder that you don't have to resign to the excuses that have held you back. So what if life hasn't been fair? What are you going to do about it today? Whatever you woke up with this morning; stolen shoes, ill health, failed relationships, don't let it stop you from running your race. You can experience more in life if you'll get over the excuses and get on with living. You can have reasons or you can have results and you can't have both.

Putnam County Baseball is pleased to announce a very unique opportunity for our players, coaches, and fans. We are selling approximately 550 tickets to the Dodgers vs. Cardinals game on Memorial Day, May 29th, at 1:15pm. Immediately following the Cardinals game, the Putnam County Midgets and the Knox County Eagles will play at Busch Stadium on the same field as some of the biggest stars in the game.
Seats are located in the LF Loge and are substantially discounted at $25/ticket. 1 ticket allows access to both the Cardinals and Midgets games. You MUST attend Cardinals game to see Midgets game.
Tickets can be purchased from PC baseball players and coaches. Tickets are not currently in but we are accepting orders that will be filled upon arrival of tickets.

It’s moments like these that remind me why this is the greatest city on earth.

Friday night there was an organized “event” where people in NYC decided to express their thanks and appreciation for all of the healthcare workers who have been working endlessly throughout this crisis.

It was meant to be a 2 minute event for city dwellers to give a round of applause - quite literally - from their windows and balconies to our healthcare workers.

It has now turned into a 10 minute long, nightly event with cow bells, cheering, honking...you name it. It’s basically what it sounds like when the NYC marathon snakes through the city. And it’s been expanded to ALL essential workers - healthcare, grocery stores, first responders, MTA, etc.

This. More of this. Please thank anyone and everyone you know in healthcare. They are on the front lines and deserve every ounce of appreciation we have.

I like to think that it’s moments like these that led to the saying “I Love New York”... THANK YOU!!!

It remained tied until Alyssa Summo assisted on Buysse's game-winner.

Sophia Johnson stopped six shots for Keene. Emma Haneman finished with 19 saves for Schroon Lake.

Our school has been blessed with an $8000 grant from the Adirondack Foundation to help us with procuring local food to feed families during the COVID-19 crisis!

We are so thankful and look forward to sending every family that is receiving meals food from the following amazing local farms and farm hubs – Juniper Hill Farm in Wadhams, North Country Creamery in Keeseville, Essex Farm in Essex, Donahue’s Livestock Farm in Malone, and the Hub on the Hill in Essex.

The Adirondack Foundation is a regular supporter of SLCS. Recently, they donated $5000 to the school to purchase cleaning supplies and personal care items for the people in the Schroon Lake community. Earlier this year they donated money to help buy a 3D printer for the tech department. In the past, they have given us money to purchase most of the video and TV equipment that we use in our videography class and club.

We had a fundraiser planned for the Freshman Class. The Marist College A Capella group The ENHARMONICS was supposed to perform on the SLCS stage on April 18th.

Unfortunately, the concert had to be postponed. The Freshman Class has decided to show you a little bit of what you missed and get you pumped up for our ENHARMONICS concert next school year.

Enjoy this virtual group performance by the ENHARMONICS and put us on your schedule for next year.

Dear Schroon Lake Residents,

Governor Cuomo has mandated that schools establish a plan for providing information about accessing daycare for essential workers and first responders.

While we are not aware of any licensed daycare providers in Schroon Lake, we are working with the Adirondack Community Action Program in Elizabethtown to address the issue.

In the past, we've gathered together on Friday mornings as a school family to share performances, successes, and to recognize scholars who are working hard to shine brightly each day.

There is no doubt that building a sense of community is important now more than ever. Community Circle looked different than it has in the past, but the return to our Friday morning tradition was a wonderful way to start the day! This week, a group of fourth-grade scholars sang the Star-Spangled Banner in tribute to 9/11. Then, sixth-grade scholars performed a beautiful dance to You Raise Me Up. The performances were live-streamed to all of the classrooms in SCA.

We can't wait for the day when we can bring our scholars and our families together in-person for Community Circle. In the meantime, we will gather together virtually and continue this tradition as a school family.

This week they will be using their knowledge of circuits to design and build a food truck with working headlights! This project will be the performance task for our economics unit and electricity unit.

Way to go fifth grade!

Clint Hon, a biologist from Grand Bay, brought his personal collection of fossils and ancient Native American artifacts. Mr. Hon, an SCA parent, shared his knowledge with all of our second grade scholars. He talked about how animals become fossils and the best locations for finding fossils. The scholars were thrilled to hear from a fossil expert and loved being able to experience seeing fossils in person!

This experience from hearing from an expert from the field helps to expand scholars’ knowledge on fossils and paleontology as they prepare for their final performance task. 🦖

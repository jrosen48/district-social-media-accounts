In the past, we've gathered together on Friday mornings as a school family to share performances, successes, and to recognize scholars who are working hard to shine brightly each day.

There is no doubt that building a sense of community is important now more than ever. Community Circle looked different than it has in the past, but the return to our Friday morning tradition was a wonderful way to start the day! This week, a group of fourth-grade scholars sang the Star-Spangled Banner in tribute to 9/11. Then, sixth-grade scholars performed a beautiful dance to You Raise Me Up. The performances were live-streamed to all of the classrooms in SCA.

We can't wait for the day when we can bring our scholars and our families together in-person for Community Circle. In the meantime, we will gather together virtually and continue this tradition as a school family.

When we return to school, we will plan for our third and fifth-grade scholars who didn‚Äôt get a chance to perform ‚ÄúPeter Pan‚Äù and the ‚ÄúWizard of Oz‚Äù, the opportunity to perform during the first couple of months of the new year. We are so sad we couldn‚Äôt do the shows this year, but not returning this year will not stop the show!

We hope this encourages all of you! Enjoy!‚ù§Ô∏è

#scaALLtheway #shineonSCA",,,0.0,"Ms. Clifford and Ms. Kent met a few days ago while practicing social distancing, which you can see in this video. They wanted to give our scholars something special. They chose a song from our ‚ÄúScintilla Peter Pan‚Äù play, ‚ÄúA Million Dreams‚Äù. Ms. Clifford and Ms. Kent want you to know they miss all of you so badly.

When we return to school, we will plan for our third and fifth-grade scholars who didn‚Äôt get a chance to perform ‚ÄúPeter Pan‚Äù and the ‚ÄúWizard of Oz‚Äù, the opportunity to perform during the first couple of months of the new year. We are so sad we couldn‚Äôt do the shows this year, but not returning this year will not stop the show!

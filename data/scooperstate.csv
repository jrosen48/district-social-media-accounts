I want you to know that I feel your pain and appreciate what you guys are having to go through. I know you won’t have the graduation you imagined, but in times like these, I believe adversity makes people stronger.

When I look back on school, I don’t remember the exams or papers or even my exact GPA. What I do remember is my friends, my teachers, my coaches, and the many lessons I learned.

Trust me, that’s what you’ll remember too.

Congratulations, class of 2020! Since you may not have a graduation speaker this year, allow me to share some of my thoughts.",0.0,"One of two special messages we would like to share today with our graduating seniors. #ClassOf2020 #ScooperSpirit

We ask that the parents and/or students use the bus drive through lane and stop near the main entrance. Following the guidelines that the state has set forth; we ask that you do not get out of your car. The bag with your items will be brought to you. This would also be a good opportunity to pick up your student’s medication. Finally, if your student was in one of Sage’s fitness classes we ask that they please stop by and pick up their binder.

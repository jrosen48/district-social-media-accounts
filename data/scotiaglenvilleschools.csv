Starting on Monday, June 22nd and running through Friday, June 26th, parents and staff can return Chromebooks to the Scotia-Glenville High School.

We ask families to place a piece of masking tape on the top of the Chromebook with the child’s or staff’s name clearly written.

According to our files, the school district loaned out 629 Chromebooks – 558 to students/families and 71 to staff.

Staff and students should return during the same collection hours June 22-26.

An SG staff member will meet each car in the front circle of the high school at the first set of double doors to recollect (much like the process for handing out Chromebooks). Each SG staff member will be wearing gloves and a mask.

We ask all who are returning Chromebooks to remain in their car and stay in the line until your Chromebook has been collected. Hours for collection are below:

Monday, June 22 – 9:00 AM – 12:00 PM

We know there's a lot of talent hiding inside those bedrooms and houses out there.

Lincoln Elementary students will be able to participate in a virtual talent show. They will need to submit their videos by June 5th and the virtual talent show will be available for viewing from June 12th-19th.

Every elementary school is doing a variation on the virtual talent show theme.

Lincoln students can check their Google Accounts to fill out the GoogleForm. All the contact people and due date information will be found there.

Going virtual means that the possibilities are endless! And you have the freedom of deleting and rerecording if it’s not perfect!

Think about what talents you have that you could share with our Lincoln Family:

Read a story!
Do a comedy routine!
Sing, dance, play an instrument!Showcase an impressive artwork you created!
Tae Kwon Do!
Break dance!
Pet tricks!",2020-05-22 15:34:56,,

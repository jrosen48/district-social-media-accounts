We are working on plans for re-opening our school buildings for the 2020-21 school year and
are exploring various options based on available guidance from the Illinois Department of
Public Health and Illinois State Board of Education.

Since we cannot predict exactly what the fall will look like, we need to be prepared for a range
of possibilities. We value the input of our families in this process. We have created a very
short, anonymous survey to help us understand what is most important to you for when we
return to school in the fall. Please complete one survey per family before Tuesday, July 14th.

It is our intention to have an initial plan shared publicly by July 27th, 2020. Your input is critical to that first draft. Thank you for taking the time to fill out this survey.

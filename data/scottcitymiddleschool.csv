As we prepare to send them back to school, here's a reminder about crosswalk safety. It's EVERYONE'S responsibility.

✅ Talk to your children about using crosswalks, making eye contact with drivers, cross/don't cross signals, etc.

✅ Talk with your young drivers to ensure they're aware of the laws, tips for ensuring pedestrian safety, and to drop the distractions

✅ Remind yourself to ditch the distractions, that no deadline or errand is worth the rush to prevent you from looking twice at crosswalks and intersections, and always yield to pedestrians (even if they're in the wrong)",0.0,"Scott County, Kansas - Department of Emergency Management

Student-Athletes & Parents,

Each year we like to have our 7th & 8th Grade student-athletes take a baseline concussion test that can help medical professionals treat individuals who are recovering from a concussion. This year we have joined teams with a new program called XLNTbrain in the fight against concussion injuries in sports.

This test can be taken from the convenience of your home, but will NOT work on an iPad. The instructions are provided on the document I've shared with you.

Following our Easter weekend I think it is important to make sure we have our priorities in line and that students are NOT overwhelmed during this time. The following are the KSDE recommendations for MAXIMUM student commitment each day:

Pre-K: 30 mins
Grades K-1: 45 mins
Grades: 2-3: 60 mins
Grades: 4-5: 90 mins
Grades: 6-12: 30 mins per teacher (3hr Max)

The goal for this time is continuous learning. I believe we are accomplishing that. Make sure we are still taking advantage of this slower pace, more time together with family, and all of the learning opportunities around the house.

If your child is feeling overwhelmed please have them contact one of their teachers or administration. We would be happy to visit with them and ease any anxieties.

Have a great week and as always Go Beavers!

Just a reminder as we are beginning flu season-

Updated (10/23/2019) Information on K.A.R. 28-1-6 in regards to Influenza:

If you recall from last school year, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment stated that a student diagnosed with influenza had to be out of school for 7 days after the onset of illness.

A memorandum has been issued from KDHE today changing this to 5 days after the onset of illness. The student must also still be 24 hours fever free without the aid of medication.

If your child has been diagnosed or suspected of having influenza then subsequently started on an anti-viral medication (such as Tamiflu) please notify the school. If you have questions, please call Niki Depperschmidt, RN at the school health office 872-7660.",0.0,"Niki Gleason Depperschmidt uploaded a file in the group: USD 466 School Health.

Update: We are still in a holding pattern, waiting to see if a summer production (live or streamed) would be possible. The performers have been ANXIOUSLY waiting for news as well. We won't know more for a few weeks still.

Here's the scoop on tickets:
1) We will honor all purchased tickets if we are able to do the show this summer.
2) If the show is cancelled altogether, we will offer refunds. Many people have already said the don't want their money refunded.

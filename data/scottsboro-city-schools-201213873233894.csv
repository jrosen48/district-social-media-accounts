Students who are absent on Monday through Wednesday will be coded as excused. With that said, our faculty and staff hope to see you there on Monday as we continue to try to keep our days as normal as possible.

Please stay tuned as things are constantly changing and I will keep you informed. There are many other questions that you have I am sure and they will be answered as we move through the next couple of days.

The ASCTE is Alabama's only fully public, residential high school for students seeking advanced studies in math, science, engineering, and cyber technology. Although residential housing is available, those near Huntsville can commute. Tuition for ASCTE is free. Through the month of March 2020, the school be accepting applications for its first set of students in the Fall. In the Fall of 2020, ASCTE will welcome its first classes and if you are interested, I would encourage parents and students to visit their website at www.ascte.org.

Dear Wildcat Family,

We find ourselves in a situation here at the end of January similar to the one we found ourselves in last year concerning sickness. Currently, each afternoon we run the numbers for absences for the day and have done this since Tuesday. Of our five schools, three are holding steady at a near normal daily attendance rate. The three that are holding steady are SHS, Collins, and Nelson where we are in the 91-93 percent range for daily student attendance. At Caldwell and SJHS, our average daily attendance has fallen below 90 percent. We will continue to monitor our average daily attendance closely and if you have a sick child or one who demonstrates symptoms of sickness, please take necessary precautions. I will continue to monitor our situation daily and provide additional information if it becomes necessary.

Warmest Regards,

Dr. Reyes",0.0,"Scottsboro City Schools

I have updated information as of 7:15 p.m. this evening concerning the weather. This updated information also includes the overwhelming majority of school systems in our area taking the same action. This action is a two-hour delay on Tuesday, November 12th. This will put all of our normal times back two hours (i.e. bus pick up time, drop off for car line time, staff reporting to school time, etc.). While I would rather us be able to go to school on a regular schedule, I must keep in mind the safety of our people and the consensus of all school leaders in the area. I appreciate your understanding in the matter and I believe that letting you know what we are going to do with ample notice is the best course of action even if the weather turns out to be not as dangerous as might have been expected.

Thanks and we will see you tomorrow.

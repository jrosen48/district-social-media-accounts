Most exciting thing about being a School of Distinction: ”First, I love the focus that SCPCSD has on high quality education for all South Carolina students and the fact that we are able to work in partnership with them to achieve that is an exciting opportunity.

What makes York Prep different?: “One thing that makes us different is the level of focus that we give to individual student growth and the way that our entire K-12 campus pulls together to make it happen for each student.”

I am extremely honored to represent SC Whitmore School along with the South Carolina Public Charter School District as a The Riley Institute at Furman fellow! Our state has come a long ways, yet there is a lot of work yet to be done. Let's build a better SC together! #Diversityisourstrength #DiversityandInclusion

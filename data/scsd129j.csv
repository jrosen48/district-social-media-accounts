My heart sinks for our community and the losses. Right now, don't worry about school. Take care of your safety and family.

Chromebook and material pickup that was scheduled for today and tomorrow is postponed. The new dates are unknown, but we will let you know once they are set.

First day of school will most likely be postponed. No formal decision has been made on this, but I can safely say we will not be starting school this week. Once we can get back into the district and assess the situation, we will be making adjustments to the school calendar and let families know.

Right now, all we can focus on is safety. Take care and reach out to other Canyon residents to make they are safe as well. Now is our time to stand together and support each other through this disaster.

If needed, updated closure information will be sent out by 7:15 tomorrow morning.

I feel confident based on the forecast that we will not be attending school on-time tomorrow. This advanced delay gives us some time to see if temperatures are going to rise enough in the morning to allow delayed travel. If not, we can cancel.

Get names and pertinet information of why a person should be nominated to David Plotts at this school email address or call me at 503-551-6221.

Nominees should have done something extra-ordinary, beside just being in the district or graduating from here.

Categories are former student. (Could have done something extra-ordinary in high school, but more likely done something more after high school.)

Former staff member: Done something(s) great while in the district and also maybe something special after leaving the district. Years of service may be of some consideration, but needs more to be added to it. This is for both certified and classified staff.

School booster/supporter. Someone/business who have helped this district out.

Former Outstanding Team: teams which have done something special. Teams must be at least 3 years removed from high school.

Would love to hear from staff.

Thanks.

We are opening this privilege on a trial basis starting tomorrow through January. Our hope is that our students continue to show responsibility by being respectful at local establishments as well as being back to class on time for 5th period. Please speak with your student about your rules regarding this privilege. If you would prefer that your student not drive off campus, please make that clear with your child.

Thank you,
Angela Rasmussen

Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Loggan Family and the North Central Panther Family. Paul Loggan unfortunately lost his battle with COVID-19. Paul was a great advocate for high school football and athletics in Indiana. I was at a conference rival school (Ben Davis) to Paul, yet he always went out of his way to say hi and ask how I was doing at the IFCA meetings and Other events. He was a great man who could light up a stadium with his smile. May his legacy live on through IHSAA Athletics! Tonight we salute Coach Loggan by lighting up Warrior Field!#paulstrong

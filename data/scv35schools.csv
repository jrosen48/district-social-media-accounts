Stay home. Stay healthy. Stay connected.

At the recommendation of public health officials, I‚Äôm issuing an Executive Order for Arizonans to stay home while encouraging alternative ways to stay connected with friends and loved ones. This order builds on Arizona‚Äôs efforts to protect public health by reminding Arizonans to maintain healthy habits, including physical distancing, and continue to look out for each other and support one another.

Arizonans have acted responsibly, and I‚Äôm grateful to everyone making adjustments to fight this virus and protect others. We need to keep these efforts up. As we move forward, our actions will continue to be guided by facts, data and the recommendations of public health officials.

As you may be aware, Governor Ducey and Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman announced earlier today that school closures in Arizona will be extended through April 10th.

Our Grab and Go meal program will continue as planned beginning Monday, March 23rd. Also on Monday, teachers will begin to send students work electronically.

For families who do not have internet access, packets will be available at meal pick up sites. Pick up sites are Calabasas School, Coatimundi Middle School and Mountain View Elementary School. We appreciate everyone's efforts during this time.

I&O staff designed three stations to allow graduates to receive their diploma, a custom graduation t-shirt, and a gift card to Dairy Queen, provided by the U.S. Army at an ice cream ""non-social""; all while ensuring participants were kept safe and healthy.

Many students commented that the non-traditional celebration was better than what they had expected, some preferred it to tradition, but, most importantly, they all came out as graduates. Congratulations, all!

Hello! Like many of you we have been working our day jobs, helping our children with virtual school, running our small business, and reinventing our lives from the ground up. This month we have been focused on providing 125 meals a day to essential staff, pizza kits to those bored at home, as well as searching out grant funding in order to provide more free meal opportunities in our community.

We are focused on our families and creating balance between our business and social responsibility. When all of this began our goal was to make a little and give a lot! With the help of many key community members and organizations we are hopeful that next week we will hit 1200 free meals for those in need! Of course as long as we are in trying times, Simply Pizza will continue to find ways to serve!

Please help us spread the word-we will be popping up next week at South Elementary School!

Simply Pizza Truck
April 16 at 4:48 AM ·

Hello! Like many of you we have been working our day jobs, helping our children with virtual school, running our small business, and reinventing our lives from the ground up. This month we have been focused on providing 125 meals a day to essential staff, pizza kits to those bored at home, as well as searching out grant funding in order to provide more free meal opportunities in our community.

We are focused on our families and creating balance between our business and social responsibility. When all of this began our goal was to make a little and give a lot! With the help of many key community members and organizations we are hopeful that next week we will hit 1200 free meals for those in need! Of course as long as we are in trying times, Simply Pizza will continue to find ways to serve!

Please help us spread the word-we will be popping up next week at South Elementary School! City of Brighton Employees, through Brighton Employee Charities, as well as many community members and other community partners made this event possible!City of Brighton, Colorado Government and 27J Schools",2020-04-22 16:46:45,,

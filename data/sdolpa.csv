So proud of Georgia...she is documenting history through the McCaskey Seniors of COVID 19 in a ‚ÄúI was supposed to...‚Äù project. Here are a few out-take photos. She is planning to use the photos as a gift to them and/or an art exhibit of some kind in the future so we all remember them. If you are a McCaskey senior ...she would love to include you. Stringent safety protocols in place and only takes about two minutes. She hopes to get as many seniors as possible to fully represent the class of 2020. She has 10 ‚Äúappointments‚Äù today, but a few more spots open today, tomorrow and this week. DM Georgia (@georgia_is__ ) or me for more details. ***Georgia is sensitive to the fact that lives are being lost due to COVID 19 and how awful all of this is***but this is a pandemic passion project for her peer group and we are so proud of her. @ Lancaster, Pennsylvania",40.0,"Calling all McCaskey High School Campus seniors!

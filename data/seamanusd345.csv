Our production of Into the Woods has officially been cancelled. We wanted to share some pictures of our short experience with everyone. Our department has so many talented students who are dedicated to the theater and it is a shame we couldn't share it.

In addition to our performance, we would have had a raffle basket fundraiser. We have found a way to do the fundraiser online! So please, support SHS Theater and buy some raffle tickets for the opportunity to win one of six different raffle baskets! The tickets will be on sale for 2 weeks, at that point we will randomly select a winner and arrange pick-up/ delivery.

Tickets are $1 each-- there is also a place for donations if you're not interested in a basket.

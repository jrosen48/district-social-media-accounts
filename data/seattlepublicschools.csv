Air quality has declined overnight and is currently unhealthy to hazardous in areas. Inhaling wildfire smoke is not good for anyone! Stay indoors and keep indoor air clean. A few tips...
➡️ Close your windows and doors to reduce intake of smoke. Open them when the air quality is good to refresh the air.
➡️ Avoid doing anything that may contribute to smoke or dust in the air, like burning candles or incense, smoking inside, frying or broiling, or vacuuming.

‚ÄúI found it is the small everyday deeds of ordinary folk that keep the darkness at bay‚Ä¶ small acts of kindness and love.‚Äù
~J.R.R. Tolkien

I‚Äôm so thankful for all the ‚Äúgood news‚Äù reports that keep popping up amidst the ‚Äúbad news‚Äù. They bring moments of brightness to the day that we all need right now. I want to thank Kaylie Bartletta for her recent acts of kindness and love. So far, she has raised $365 for St. Jude‚Äôs!!! SMS is so proud of you and so very grateful.‚ù§Ô∏èüíô",2020-04-01 18:03:58,,

This flag is one of the select few that was carried by 35 Navy SEALS as they swam across the Hudson River from Liberty State Park and ran towards the 9/11 Memorial in NYC on August 3, 2019. This swim was organized to raise funds and awareness for military veterans and their families. We are extremely proud and honored to have received this thoughtful token of appreciation.

Im so beyond proud of my students for this performance of True Colors by Cyndi Lauper. I might be biased, but I think it‚Äôs truly remarkable!

Music teachers by nature are always looking for ways to help improve their students, which means always looking for faults. A dear close friend and colleague of mine gave me the best feedback for this performance. He said, ‚ÄúWhile listening, I was able to stop judging, nit-picking, and error-detecting. I found myself moved to a point that all of that stuff didn't register. Pure enjoyment.‚Äù

That is quite possibly the best feedback to receive. Thanks for such kind words Sean! I learned from the best! üòä

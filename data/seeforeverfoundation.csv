As we enter the start of this school year it is with a heavy heart that we realize that one of our elders left us this morning. Toni Morrison returned to the arms of the ancestors this morning. Her life was full of amazing literature and a spirit of hope. As the literature she produced tackled the joys of life but also the challenges of living with racism in our society, I am asking everyone to take a moment to reflect on our work, and why it's so important given the violence, racism, xenophobia and anti-LGBTQ behavior and rhetoric that plagues our society. Toni Morrison once said--the function of freedom is to free someone else. As we embark on this new school year please take a moment to think about the dreams you have for yourself and how you will ensure that we liberate the bodies, minds and spirits of the scholars we serve.

With peace and blessings on a day of grief for many, but also a day to celebrate one Dr. Angelou's dearest friends--Toni Morrison.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157350795959598&id=56211234597,,0.0,"Message from our CEO, Dr. Robert Simmons:

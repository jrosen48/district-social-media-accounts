On Wednesdays, I teach writing to third grade. Since it was Earth Day, the plan was to have the class write a paragraph about one thing they can do to take care of our planet. Before we began the assignment, I asked how they were and how many of them missed school. They all raised their hands. Right then I decided that because every day should be Earth Day, we could do that assignment another day. Instead, they talked and wrote about the things they missed about school. These were some of their responses. The first one made me cry because I also miss the sounds of school.

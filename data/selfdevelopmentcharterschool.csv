Recently, Fordham Professor of English and Creative Writing Caroline Hagood asked her students what would move them so much as to write on the nearest thing possible, as MLK had done writing his famous “Letters from Birmingham Jail” on top of old newspaper.

What would move you and your children so much to write on the nearest thing possible? Prove it in this mini challenge. Write a short simple statement about some belief, value, or idea that would inspire you to write vigorously on anything nearby. Eg the above MLK example, paper napkins and musical riffs for musicians, back of hand and poets. Make it brief but write with passion. Points for writing it with creative materials and/or on creative (but adult approved) surfaces.

Please write a haiku

about your experience

Haikus are short poems that follow a strict syllable structure. The first must be only 5 syllables. The second 7 syllables. And the third 5 again. For instance, if you couldn't tell the above instructions is a haiku.

For some background: each word has syllables. To find them, put your hand under your jaw. Every time your jaw moves down you count it as one syllable. How many syllables are in the word syllables? syll-a-bles. 3! Please be as creative as possible with this assignment and write as many as you want! We will repost our favorite!☺️💙 Here is an inspirational haiku

Good luck to you all!

But this year it’s teaching us something too.

As we social distance away in our cocoons, let’s try to become butterflies. Let’s commit to becoming the very best versions of ourselves. When it is over we will bravely fly into the world once again with a determined spirit, serving as an inspiration for others to do the same.

In fact, every year at Self Development Preschool we teach our four year old children this concept, relishing in the sheer joy in each child as they watch something cocooned away for a month turn into something so beautiful. But this year it’s teaching us something too.

As we social distance away in our cocoons, let’s try to become butterflies. Let’s commit to becoming the very best versions of ourselves. When it is over we will bravely fly into the world once again with a determined spirit, serving as an inspiration for others to do the same. But until the time we are butterflies, let’s use this as a time for self development. 🦋",2020-03-19 22:17:17,,

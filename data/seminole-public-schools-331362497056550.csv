Each dollar of your ad valorem tax, on the statewide average, is apportioned about 68% for common schools, 13% career tech, 16% county, with the remaining 3% percent apportioned to other publicly supported projects as authorized by the voters.

When a School District passes a bond, it is repaid by the owners of property located within that School District, NOT the entire County. Below is a map of the School Districts in Seminole County.",7.0,"This was posted today by the Seminole County Assessor. Please share this post.

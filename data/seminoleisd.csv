SJHS Pick up & Drop off Supplies info:
Parents will first need to park in the west parking lot (this is Station 1). Students will enter the building at Door #19 and they will go to their locker where contents are bagged. Pick up your bag and then exit at Door #18. If you have things in the athletic locker rooms you may go and pick them up before exiting the building. (This does not include PE Lockers) After exiting the building students will get back into their parents' vehicle and go to Station 2 through 5. (Students from the same household can come together, even if last names are in different groups.)

Senior year started out AMAZING! But it ended more different than we could have ever imagined. Unfortunately this means that our original Senior Review plans must change‚Ä¶but we still want to make things as special as we can for our Seniors.

That said, we are HOPING to reschedule this event for later this summer. Mark your calendars for what we HOPE to be our NEW date, Tuesday, June 16th

PLEASE NOTE:

The Seminole School Board has voted to name the High School Gymnasium Court after Leland ""Buck"" Caffey.

Coach Caffey was in Seminole to see this incredible honor.

He won a State basketball championship as a player in 1955 and then was the head basketball coach of the 1979 state basketball championship team.

Coach Caffey definately deserves this.

Love this! After the Lamesa 7th, 8th grade boys and girls track meet. I noticed that all of Seminole's kids were lining up at the south goal line of the football field! My first thought was. Did these kids get in trouble and are going to have to run after just competing in a track meet?

Nope I was wrong these coaches and players were lining up and picking up the trash that was left on the field by other kids! I applaud you Seminole Coaches and kids!

Earlier this week SHS Student Council hosted the District Convention in the PAC. There were 14 schools from TASC District 8 present. During this event, the councils met for a day of learning from one another. This years speaker was Kyle Scheele. They also had breakout sessions about StuCo Leadership, Stress Management (led by Mr. Autry), Distracted Driving (led by DPS), Bullying, and Mental Health.

There were 3 District 8 scholarships given out and our very own Madison Dyck was a recipient. Congrats! Lastly, Student Councils were recognized for ALL of their achievements this year. Seminole was recognized as a SWEEPSTAKES school!! SHS StuCo won awards in the following:

--Drug, alcohol, safety and health
--Energy and environment
--Pride and patriotism
--Community Service
--Outstanding Student Council

We are VERY proud of our StuCo and EVERYTHING that they do!

On Saturday, February 15th, SHS had 54 students enter 63 pieces of art into the Region 17 VASE (Visual Art Scholastic Event) art competition at Plainview High School in Plainview, TX.

The competition consisted of 16 school districts with 21 schools. In the ranking system, a rating of a 4 is the HIGHEST a student can get. Each of those students receive a medal. Seminole High School's students earned 51 total medals. Those receiving the highest ratings are considered to move on to the State Competition.

Out of 393 pieces of art, only 28 were chosen to be state-bound. This is only 7% of the total artwork, 10% of those who earned a medal. Four of our very own SHS students' pieces were chosen to advance to state: Sydney Gonzales (junior), Raven Parker (junior), Sandra Hernandez Tarango (sophomore), and Kevin Ronquillo (freshman).

We are VERY proud of ALL of the students who participated and are extremely excited to showcase them in the Seminole Art Walk in the Powwow Room on March 24th as well as the Night of Fine Arts in the PAC on May 4th.

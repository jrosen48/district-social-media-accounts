Please, please, please allow your children grace during distance learning. It's weird to them, it's not much fun, and it's anathema to their very nature.

Take their emotional temperature frequently through the day; tell them it's ok to feel frustrated/sad/mad/lonely but that you and their teachers love them and want what's best for them.

Read to them every night. Tell them stories. Have them tell you stories. For the littles, find Sesame Street and reruns of Mr. Roger's Neighborhood and learn those numbers and letters and how to be kind. For the mediums, find Schoolhouse Rocks (seriously, I STILL think these have some of the best basic grammar instruction in the history of mankind). For the big heads, remind them how smart they are and have them read read read read.

Allow yourself grace, too. This is difficult right now, but it feels so much like we're making it harder than it has to be for everyone.

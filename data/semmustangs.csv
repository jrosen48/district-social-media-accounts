Last night was a long-awaited night. With all of the changes and things that were taken away from these kids, we are so happy they got to have prom! Special thanks to Tianna O'Neill and Diana Williams for the decor, KTown Sound (Joey) for DJing, Finney's for catering, and Bill and Sarah Scoville for dessert! The night wouldn't have been possible without all of you!
Without further ado, I present ""A Night in Paradise""!

The Nebraska Promise program covers undergraduate tuition at the University of Nebraska (UNO, UNK and UNL) for students who have a family income of $60,000 or less (Adjusted Gross Income/AGI) or are Pell Grant-eligible, and who meet academic requirements.

Nearly 3,000 students currently attend NU tuition-free under Collegebound Nebraska. The expanded Nebraska Promise will cover approximately 1,000 additional current and future NU students. Through this program, our desire is to expand access and support Nebraskans who may not have thought they could afford a university education.

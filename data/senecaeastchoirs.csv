Choir students are welcome to participate in the contest by submitting a carved, or painted pumpkin.

Tickets will be sold at the door for $1 which families can place into a jack-o-lantern jar. The winner will receive half of the proceeds, and the remaining half will go toward the music boosters for future concert costs.

Reminder that High school tenors/basses should have black dress socks, black dress shoes, white undershirt, and assigned uniform.
Soprano/altos should have black dress shoes, black socks/pantyhose, and optional undershirt.

Students grades 6-8 should have black socks, black shoes, and black undershirt.

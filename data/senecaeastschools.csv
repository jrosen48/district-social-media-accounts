We are pleased to announce that Seneca East can provide meals free of charge to all students enrolled in the district starting Monday, September 14, 2020.

The USDA, along with the Ohio Department of Education, have authorized districts to participate in the Seamless Option Meal Program due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Under this program, schools can offer free breakfast and lunch to all students until December 31, 2020 or until funding is no longer available.

Additional items, such as water, snacks and second entrees will still be available for students to purchase through their accounts. Parents who have already loaded meal money into student accounts can use those dollars for extras or to purchase meals when the program is discontinued. Students do not need a K12 payment account to receive meals or to purchase extras.

Families are encouraged to complete the free and reduced meal applications so they can receive free or reduced benefits after the program ends. Applications can be completed at www.lunchapplication.com.",,,0.0,"Great News SE Families!

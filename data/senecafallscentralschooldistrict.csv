As the new Centennial Fountain was dedicated today by NYS Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul, Mynderse Academy students kayaked in the Cayuga-Seneca canal to help celebrate the event. SFCSD Board member, Joell Murney-Karsten, who also serves as the Chair for the Seneca Falls Development Corporation, also spoke at today's dedication. Superintendent Jeramy Clingerman was also at the event.

Mynderse Academy students who participated in the ceremony today were: Alyssa Marley, Mya Soto, Alyssa Karsten, LaToya Soura, Isabel Wager, Mansi Trivedi, Rya Swenson, Tristan Shell, Macy Benz, and Emily Cook.

The Centennial Fountain features a pump that was provided by Seneca Falls company, ITT Goulds Pumps. The fountain will be on display in the canal until September 8th, and will light up each night with purple, gold and white lights - the colors of the American suffrage movement.

On Monday, Mynderse Academy rising sophomore Grace Lando visited the White House for a ceremony that unveiled the Building the Movement Exhibit, which features one original piece from each state that celebrates 100 years of women's suffrage. Grace's artwork was chosen to represent New York State and featured suffragettes Ida B. Wells and Alice Paul. Grace also had a tour of the White House and met the First Lady.

Below is a link to a short video with highlights of the ceremony. Soon, the White House will display the exhibit virtually - and we will pass along the link when we have it. So proud of you Grace! #SFCSDPROUD #MynderseArt

Drive down Fall Street in Seneca Falls today and things may look a little different!

The Seneca Falls community found a way to highlight this special Senior Class of 2020 by coming together and organizing a special tribute.

Two community members, Angela Anderson and Autumn DeVries organized an online fundraiser which raised over $4500 to honor the seniors with posters downtown! They coordinated with the school district and Brad VanDusen to make posters of each senior to hang downtown from the light posts. Ferrara Lumber donated the zip ties that were used to hang the posters and the Seneca Falls Fire Department also volunteered their time to help hang them up. Once the project was finished and paid for, Anderson and DeVries donated the extra funds - $2400 back to Project Graduation for the Class of 2020.

Many thanks to all who contributed in some way to this special honor for our seniors. We continue to be so proud of our community partnerships!

What an incredible show! You still have three more opportunities to see it - today at 2:00 and 7:30 PM and tomorrow at 2:00.

However, due to Governor Cuomo's recent restrictions on the number of people who can attend a social event due to COVID-19, we can only allow 190 people to attend each performance.

The good news is that the show can still be performed, but unfortunately, we will have to turn people away once we reach 190. We are sorry about the limitations this puts on the number of people who can attend each show, but we hope over the course of the three shows that are left, everyone who wants to attend will be able to. All tickets will be sold at the door.

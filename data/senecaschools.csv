Seneca alumni! We decided last year at a Foundation meeting that we were going to try to make a database of all alumni including addresses and email addresses. We would like to send invites to our banquet and possibly some day start sending annual updates about what is going on in our district. We will not give this information out and we will not send mail very often. I have been working on the database for several months and now need your information. If you would, please message me or this page your name, maiden name, address, email address and the year your graduated, it would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

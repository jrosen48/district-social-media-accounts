On Patriot Day, we honor the memories of the lives lost on September 11, 2001, and of every hero who gave their life since that day to protect our safety and freedom. We come together united. Our values endure and the memory of our loved ones never fades.

As a community and a nation, we honor the lives of the victims of 9/11. We commend the heroic and courageous actions of the first responders, rescue workers and volunteers.

For the innocent men, women and children who lost their lives on an airplane, at the World Trade Center, at the Pentagon, in Somerset County and on the streets of New York.

For civil servants, firefighters, police officers, and military personnel who dedicated and lost their lives protecting our safety, our freedom and democracy.

We will never forget.

Last fall, Lihini Ranaweera and Friyana Sepai, in partnership with Classrooms Without Borders (CWB) of Pittsburgh, participated in a Holocaust Immersion Day where they sang a Yiddish song for their classmates. CWB reached out to these two talented students again, this time for their Open Minds, Open Hearts Fundraiser.
The virtual event will be held at 6:30 p.m. on Thursday, Sept. 10 featuring the musical talents of Miss Ranaweera and Miss Sepai.
The young ladies will speak live about their experiences with CWB and learning about the Holocaust. Afterward, a recording of their song will be shared.

Anne Frank is the most widely-read diarist of the Holocaust. But students are also reading ""The Diary of Anonymous Girl,"" which describes a family's devastating hunger during food rationing in Poland's Lodz ghetto. With help from Classrooms Without Borders Pittsburgh PA, middle school students in the Seneca Valley School District are learning first hand what the well-worn phrase ""I'm starving"" meant for teens who actually lived that terror.

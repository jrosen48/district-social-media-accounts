Dear Sentinel students and parents,

As many of you read this, I‚Äôm sure you are wondering about the back to school plans for students at Sentinel Public Schools. We are in the final stages of editing and revising our plan. We started our planning process at the end of May and our goal was to have a plan in place that we could send out to parents and students by the middle of July. We are still on pace to meet those goals. I am hopeful that by this time next week, you will be looking at or will have already read our back to school plan. I can tell you that we have every intention of beginning with students in the school buildings on August 13. Our goal will be to have traditional in-person school as much as is possible and safe for our students and staff in the 2020-2021 school year.

We appreciate your patience as we try to make decisions that maximize learning and safety for all our school community.

Sincerely,

Will students have to make up these school days?
Will students still participate in state and federal testing after the school closure?

We don‚Äôt currently have answers to these questions. These are being discussed at the state and federal level and we hope to have more information on these topics by March 26.

You can find more information and stay up to date on the Oklahoma State Department of Education‚Äôs website at:

You can also find more information at the Oklahoma State Department of Health‚Äôs website at:

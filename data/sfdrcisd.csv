The Roving Chef Program consists of healthy food demonstrations with Real recipes by our District Chef. The demonstration encourages participation of each student to create his or her own meal. Each student also receives a certificate of completion and a recipe card to take home to share with family and friends. Our goal is to educate students on how their school meals are prepared and how healthy food can also taste great in a fun environment!

ESD Goes to Atalaya Elementary
We want to teach them while they're still young and curious that Recycling is the right thing to do!

Last week, a team from the Environmental Services Division visited with Ms. Gibb’s Pre-K class at Atalaya Elementary School. Recycling Lead Driver Abran Sanchez answered questions about where the recycling goes and how the truck works. Then, the class watched as Abe and Operations Manager Eric Lucero demonstrated the automated cart collection system. Thank you to Ms. Gibbs and class for a great visit, and thank you for recycling, Santa Fe!

Ticket procedures for our home Volleyball and Football games are straight from approved District Policy for this year and we apologize to the family members and fans who are not able to support the teams in person.
It is true that the two ticket per athlete rule is not the same at all school districts and sometime will be different when we are playing away. However we are going to practice all mitigating guidelines when it comes to our games such as social distancing, sanitizing, masks and the District ticket procedures. Should we be able to change these in the future we will be sure to notify our fans immediately.
We apologize for the inconvenience and understand the frustration that can result with so many new protocols.
Thank you for your patience and understanding as we continue to do our best to navigate these difficult times.
Feel free to contact the school if you have additional questions.

We would like to say thank you for your patience and understanding today. Day 1 of Virtual Instruction (Asynchronous) is done. Given everything that we have been through, it all faded away as soon as the first ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù was said. No, we didn‚Äôt have carline issues, but we did have ZOOM issues. Mrs. Garcia apologizes for that. I can honestly say our teachers were very nervous not knowing what would or could happen. This emotion disappeared quickly once they saw your child‚Äôs happy faces. Yes, there are still kinks to work out. We assure you, SGISD will work to make this the best year yet!! We shared this YouTube video early this week among our staff. WE ARE LIONS!!

Santa Gertrudis Lions- we move into the unknown with UIL and extracurricular activities - it really seems we are at a point where there are more changes expected on the horizon this coming week.

SGISD is committed to keeping our kids safe and we have made the decision to begin the year virtually for the first three weeks of school. Our plan is to remain 100% virtual and that will include our extracurricular activities/practices. These sports/practices are to be resumed in person when we offer face to face instruction to our students beginning Aug 24. I cannot say for certain what changes or guidance will be coming in the future between now and then but we will remain ready to adapt to them and overcome this adversity as a Team.

Workouts will continue to be posted and regular online meetings with your coaches will be scheduled.

I hope this message finds you all healthy and taking care of each other.

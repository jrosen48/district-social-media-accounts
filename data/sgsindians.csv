May‚Äôs Family Literacy Challenge!!
Family Game Night for grades K-4! Did you know that there are lots of games that require you to read or build literacy skills? Examples are Apples to Apples, Scrabble, Bananagrams, or even a homemade game like Build a Letter (as shown in the picture.) For May‚Äôs Challenge take a picture of your family playing a game that builds literacy skills and send it to Mrs. Hargis at 918-575-2021 so she can post it here!

Spring Conversation Cards: Why is asking and answering questions important?

We ask questions in order to learn more about a topic and we answer questions to provide information. To answer questions, students think about the meaning of the question, form an answer and speak the answer they formed. To ask a question your child has to think about what they want to ask, form a question in their mind and then produce the question they want to ask.
Asking and answering is part of how we learn! It is important to form complete sentences that have meaning.

This activity targets: articulation, WH question (who, what, when, where and why), vocabulary and formation of sentences.

Why is Vitamin C important? Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin well known for its role in supporting a healthy immune system. Because your body cannot make vitamin C, it must come from the foods you eat every day. You'll find high levels of vitamin C in citrus fruits, strawberries, kiwi, guava, peppers, tomatoes, broccoli, and spinach. Teen guys need 75 mg and girls need 65 mg of vitamin C a day.

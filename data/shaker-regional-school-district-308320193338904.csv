Hello Families,

Starting this week, we will be offering meal pick-up/delivery service on Mondays and Wednesdays only. This does not mean that you will receive fewer meals. This means that you will receive multiple days of food in one pick-up and/or delivery. The pick-up/delivery locations/times have not changed.

Summary:
Food Pick-Up for All Students: BHS and CES, 8 AM - 11 AM, Monday and Wednesday only.
Food Delivery for All Students: Locations and times remain the same. Delivery is on Monday and Wednesday only.

Please know that our goal is to minimize exposure to staff, families, and students while still providing the same number of meals to our students.

Governor Sununu announced today that school closures are extended ‪through May 4th‬ as well as a stay-at-home order ‪starting tomorrow at 11:59 PM‬. According to the Governor, the stay-at-home order does not restrict people from leaving the house to perform their ""essential functions""; going to the grocery store, pharmacy, gas station, hardware store, etc. He also mentioned that this does not restrict ""essential personnel"" from performing their ""essential duties."" It is my understanding that educators and food service workers are considered ""essential personnel"" who perform ""essential duties"".

What does this mean for our school district?
1. We will continue developing remote learning plans and providing remote learning resources ‪through May 4th.‬
2. We will continue our meal pick-up/delivery service ‪through May 4th.‬

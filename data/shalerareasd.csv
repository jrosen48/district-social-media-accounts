‚ÄúI really enjoyed my time at Beattie, either be it technical training or friends I've made,‚Äù Benjamin said. ‚ÄúI have learned a lot in the 2 years that I have attended the ERT program.‚Äù

Benjamin, who wanted a career in public safety, always knew he would attend Beattie for the ERT program.

He credited ERT instructors Mr. Thomas and Mrs. Rogowski with making sure everyday was engaging. Asked if he had any good stories to tell, Benjamin said ‚Äúyou had to be there.‚Äù

Benjamin will attend CCAC and the Center for Emergency Medicine! He was in Shaler Area‚Äôs Stage Crew, a section leader in the Marching Band, named a TribLive Elite Top 100 Outstanding Young Citizen, an Eagle Scout, a volunteer for Etna Station 149, a Beattie Ambassador, a SkillsUSA competitor, a National Technical Honor Society member and a fan of The Office.

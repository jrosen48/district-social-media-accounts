Black slacks
FCCLA is looking for donations of black slacks of all sizes. Our competition requires a dress code and not all students have or can afford them. We compete in the spring, but we‚Äôre trying to get a head start on this to help these kids out. The slacks would be kept by the school to be used for years to come. These competitions give students opportunities for scholarships and helps them gain such great leadership skills.

You can contact Traci Clanahan at tclanahan@shallowaterisd.net and I can come pick them up or you can bring them to the high school.

Band and Choir in Middle School are considered Fine Arts Electives not extra curricular. Therefore we will be offering online instruction to students in grades 6-8 who decide to do remote learning.

High School band is extracurricular because the elements of performance at games and marching competitions are extra curricular and determine the curriculum for the class. Band in Middle school does not have these elements.

We are still working on remote instruction plans, and will post them when we have them finalized.

These bingo cards will serve as our assignments for the next two weeks for each grade level. As we wrap up the school year, we wanted to finish up our instruction and tie in a few meaningful life skills challenges.

Each student's assignment will be to blackout their Bingo Card by the end of the two weeks. Once your student has completed every challenge on their Bingo card, they will need to complete the survey at the bottom. Surveys will be due next Thursday, May 21st, but can be completed sooner.

Times like this have also taught us to appreciate the beautiful things in life. One student, Hannah, has spent time working with her family.

Read about her family below!

Hamilton Farms is a local family farm that primarily produces cotton, cattle, corn and kids! We also offer other commodities as well such as summer vegetables and cotton honey.

We raise Black Angus beef cattle. We have spring calves annually and look forward to this time all year long! We offer our beef for sale direct to consumer.

7th graders in Mrs. Stanton‚Äôs class learned about different adaptions that organisms use to survive in their environments. Yesterday‚Äôs experiment was in camouflage. Students worked to camouflage butterflies to different spots in the classroom. Each classroom had a predator (a staff member unaware of the butterfly locations) come in and try to locate as many camouflaged butterflies as they could.

They had about 75-80% survival rate camouflaging from their predators.

This was such a fun activity! Here were some of the survivors. Some of these pictures will require you to look closely!",0.0,"Amazing learning going on at SMS!

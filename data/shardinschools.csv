Eligible families will receive $307.80 per child. If your household received food assistance benefits in April, May or June, you will see that amount added to your EBT card by July 15. If you have not received food benefits in the past three months, you will get a P-EBT card in the mail before July 21.

The P-EBT cards will come in a white envelope addressed with your child's name, with a return address from Austin, TX. The cards themselves will be white with black font, with ""IOWA P-EBT"" printed at the top. Once you receive your card, follow the included instructions to activate it.

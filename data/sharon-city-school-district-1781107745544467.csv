Under the direction of Choir Director, Frank McCauley, Justin competed at the Regional PMEA choir festival in February where he was the only Sharon student to qualify for the state competition that was to be held at the end of April in the Poconos. Unfortunately, due to the current closure of schools, the PMEA State competition was canceled. This would have been the second trip to states for Justin; last year he competed with fellow Senior, Ally McMahon.

The characteristics of a TROJAN are generally described as a BRAVE, HARDWORKING, and DETERMINED individual who protects the ancient City of Troy.

I can’t think of a better way to describe how our parents, teachers, and students have responded to this pandemic.

So Parents and Community thank you so much for helping us get the school year started as we try to instill the characteristics of a TROJAN into each one of our students. I know your students will benefit from attending Sharon-Mutual Public Schools.

If you have a female student getting ready to head to college, here is the ultimate list of scholarships for women and girls.

If your student isn’t sure what degree she will pursue or simply wants to apply for awards that don’t require a specific major, general scholarships are an excellent choice. This site includes scholarships that aren’t restricted to specific fields, making them more flexible than some other options, like scholarships for women in STEM.

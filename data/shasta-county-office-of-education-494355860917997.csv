Our local schools went above and beyond to celebrate their 2020 graduates during the coronavirus pandemic!

A few months ago, the Shasta County Board of Supervisors invited schools to share about their creative and unique graduation celebrations and be recognized with ""Super Graduation Awards."" Drive-thrus, movie screens, and bagpipes...oh my! The results were impressive!

At last week's Board of Supervisors meeting, the Board honored all of the hard work that went into these efforts and sent signed letters of recognition to each participating school. Thank you, Shasta County Educators!

Why is the census important for schools?

Census data is used to fund federal programs for schools. In California, over $7 billion in federal funding supports school programs such as: school nutrition, after school, special education, English Language Learners, Native American students, farm workers, youth experiencing homeless, and Head Start programs.

Why does your participation matter?

Your school district receives funding from Title I A Part Federal funds and Your participation matters. Counting all children, even those in preschool, is essential for California’s schools to receive their fair amount of funding.

New this year!

Filling out the census questionnaire is easier than ever. For the first time the census questionnaire is available online at www.census.gov.

Even though our preschools are not in session, two of our preschool teachers are showing support within the community. The first photo of the hearts is to support community workers from Angie Leiferman's classroom at Buckeye School of the Arts.

The second photo is at Jennifer Pore’s classroom at Bella Vista School, keeping her classroom in the spirit of the bear hunt. As an extension of something that’s occurring in other places, to keep children entertained while they’re out of school and sticking close to home because of the coronavirus, placing teddy bears in street-facing windows allows children to hunt them out on walks and bicycle rides through their neighborhood.

What a great event! The 6th Annual STEM Career Day for 9th graders took place today. Over 1,200 students from 32 high schools across Northern California came together to learn about careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, & Math.

As students started their day, Professor Randy Reed, who teaches Earth Sciences at Shasta College shared about some of the learning experiences offered at Shasta College, including a Global Expeditions experience each summer. Brandy Greene, a graduate of Central Valley High School, shared about what she does as an Environmental Scientist who works for an engineering firm. She shared the importance of internships and the types of jobs and flexibility within this career field.

Students then had the opportunity to explore careers in two of the exhibition halls as well as compete in small groups in a wind challenge.

What a great event! The 6th Annual STEM Career Day for 9th graders took place today. Over 1,200 students from 32 high schools across Northern California came together to learn about careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, & Math.

As students started their day, Professor Randy Reed, who teaches Earth Sciences at Shasta College shared about some of the learning experiences offered at Shasta College, including a Global Expeditions experience each summer. Brandy Greene, a graduate of Central Valley High School, shared about what she does as an Environmental Scientist who works for an engineering firm. She shared the importance of internships and the types of jobs and flexibility within this career field.

Students then had the opportunity to explore careers in two of the exhibition halls as well as compete in small groups in a wind challenge.

An event such as this takes an enormous amount of planning and many volunteers. I'm so thankful for all the businesses who came out to engage students and all the volunteers who made this event a reality!",2019-11-18 11:24:05,,

This morning, I had the opportunity to visit Rocky Point Charter School. Administrator Shawna Norris shared with me about the very collaborative nature of her staff as they strive together to continuously look at ways to improve.

The school has small class sizes and lots of adult support, including an intervention teacher who helps students in both reading and math. They also have electives where 2nd through 8th graders are able to work together on activities and projects of common interest.

Thanks, Shawna, for the invitation to come and see the work underway to support students at Rocky Point!",0.0,"Judy Flores is at Rocky Point Charter.

I am incredibly grateful to work alongside such dedicated staff who will give of their own time to join for an evening discussion to help intentionally increase our impact. Tonight was the Part 2 in a 5-part book study series with Anese Cavanaugh’s book Contagious Culture.￼ I appreciated the openness and honesty as we all continuously strive to bring our best self each day. And that can only happen if we take care of ourselves.

The quote from Contagious Culture that I ended with tonight is this￼:
“The people are the culture, and the more intentional everyone in your organization is about what they want the culture to be, the more likely that culture will unfold in a healthy in contagious manner.￼”

Special thanks to Jodie VanOrnum and Mike Freeman for facilitating the discussion! And thanks to all who participated!",0.0,"Judy Flores is at Shasta County Office of Education’s Professional Development Center.

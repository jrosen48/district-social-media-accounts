Angelo Reyes and Logan Cash both finished 5th place respectively. We brought home some individual hardware, but missed out on 2nd place and a team award by 8 points. All good, we wouldn’t have been satisfied with 2nd place anyway!! We are headed in the right direction! Now for a well earned rest to recover and get ready to kick it into high gear and come into 2020 with a clear vision of the mission!! Happy Holidays from your Wolfpack Wrestling team!!

💓 Feel good story! Lone senior and team captain Jose Cervantes poses with his Christmas gifts for Christmas Connection! Christmas Connection is a gift exchange program for kids who are more financially challenged so that they may have a Happy Holiday even if life is weighing hard on their families! He took great pride and time in gathering his gifts for the kids and made sure to get them things they would really enjoy and get great use out of! Instead of paying back the kindness he has received Jose is instead paying it forward! So fortunate to have this kind of leadership and example for our program!

Shout out to Shawnee Cross Country! They honored our program with the “Fan of the Year” award on Thursday night at their end of the year banquet. We had a blast supporting our fellow Shawnee wolves as they represented our school and our town so well! The cross country events we attended were some of the most fun because we got to run around and interact with the runners and encourage them throughout the races! We don’t do it for the recognition, but we sure do appreciate it!!

All 3 branches of our program will be in action today! HS and JH in Westmoore and the Shawnee Takedown Club will be kicking off their season in Harrah! 🐺🤼‍♂️🤼‍♀️💙

For the second year in a row we have received handmade scarves and hats for our students from the local group, Down Home Friends. The ladies group crocheted and sewed each item over the last couple of months. We now have 80 scarves, 69 hats, 17 headbands, and 40 pairs of socks. These are for any SMS student who might need a little extra warmth this winter. Thank you! 🐺❤️🧣",6.0,"Shawnee Middle School

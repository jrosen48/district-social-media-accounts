Hi Cards!
Here is a screenshot of the “clap out” route. When I drove it, it took about 30 minutes in Sheffield Village and 30 minutes in Sheffield Lake.

We will have a police escort.

I know an hour is a long time but if we are going to do this “clap out” procession we might as well make it a good one!
...anything worth doing...is worth doing well. 😜👍

Thank you to both police departments for being so flexible and available. They are great partners with the school. Also, thank you to both Mayors Bring and Mayor Hunter your partnerships are very much appreciated.

Please share so our community will turn their porch lights on and know the route of the procession to cheer on our seniors.

I do have good news!

I have spoken with both police departments and Mayors and they are both happy to accommodate more routes for the parade in both communities.
I assure you there was really no intent on anyone’s behalf to minimize the amount of streets in either community and we don’t want too many people congregating in one spot. Please keep in mind we cannot come down every street, so some people may have to walk a little bit.

The caveat is that we can add more streets as long as they are streets that are plenty wide for two way traffic and come back out on one of the main streets.

Stay tuned for the possibility of a new map with added streets to come out soon. It will need to be approved once it’s drawn up. Then we will share it. 🙂

This is for the seniors of 2020 and the community! We want nothing more than it to be great and fun. We want all people to feel good about it.
We appreciate the input that was shared on how to make it better.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2834095713304705&id=867555306625432,,0.0,"Hi all,

Hi all

Each year we try to select two or three Brookside graduates that have been nominated as a success and we celebrate their success with recognition on a very special night.

We want our students to see that the sky is the limit when it comes to their future and we also want to recognize greatness in our graduates. Let’s face it, no one is ever too old to hear that they are special.

In order to be selected, a person must simply have done something to be considered a success. Perhaps they wrote a book, saved someone’s life, they have done something to touch the lives of others, or they are a Major in the Marine Corps.

We have so many graduates that are amazing. Our students and adults work together to pick the winners.

Please see the forms below.

We would love it if you would please nominate someone that you feel is worthy.

Please also share this with as many people as possible so we can reach those amazing graduates even if they are not local.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2662492230465055&id=867555306625432,,0.0,"Gallery of Success!

We are going to have school today.

At 5:30 am, I was up.
There was definitely a snow squall and I questioned having school.
If you had to drive to work at 5:30 am it must have been a slow go!

Since then, I have been gathering as much info as possible.
At this point, the morning News (no free channel advertisement here) and a special weather statement states for our area the squall will be over by 7am.
It’s not remarkably cold.

The roads are definitely better now than they were at 5:30 am. Snow plows are out.
We need to get our buses out on the road by 6:15 so I needed to make a decision one way or the other before that time.
I also know people need lead time for child care.

So...Please just do the best you can this morning getting to school. Especially for BMS and BHS and JVS which open first.

High school students that drive, please take your time, clean off your windows so you are able to see and leave a little early.
I think by the time you are driving it will be pretty decent out.

Please be safe!!

Here is a screenshot of the ‚Äúclap out‚Äù route. When I drove it, it took about 30 minutes in Sheffield Village and 30 minutes in Sheffield Lake.

We will have a police escort.

I know an hour is a long time but if we are going to do this ‚Äúclap out‚Äù procession we might as well make it a good one!

I do have good news!

I have spoken with both police departments and Mayors and they are both happy to accommodate more routes for the parade in both communities.
I assure you there was really no intent on anyone‚Äôs behalf to minimize the amount of streets in either community and we don‚Äôt want too many people congregating in one spot. Please keep in mind we cannot come down every street, so some people may have to walk a little bit.

The caveat is that we can add more streets as long as they are streets that are plenty wide for two way traffic and come back out on one of the main streets.

Stay tuned for the possibility of a new map with added streets to come out soon. It will need to be approved once it‚Äôs drawn up. Then we will share it. üôÇ

This is for the seniors of 2020 and the community! We want nothing more than it to be great and fun. We want all people to feel good about it.

I have had a number of questions sent to me regarding our time off from school. I began to answer some of the questions and then thought I should send the answers to everyone.

1. We could be off longer than 3 weeks... depending on how the virus spreads. We will have to see how that develops. Right now they are estimating that the peak of the virus may be in one month.

2. If we happen to be back in school and then it is time for our scheduled spring break... we will still have our spring break.

Hi all

Each year we try to select two or three Brookside graduates that have been nominated as a success and we celebrate their success with recognition on a very special night.

We want our students to see that the sky is the limit when it comes to their future and we also want to recognize greatness in our graduates. Let‚Äôs face it, no one is ever too old to hear that they are special.

In order to be selected, a person must simply have done something to be considered a success. Perhaps they wrote a book, saved someone‚Äôs life, they have done something to touch the lives of others, or they are a Major in the Marine Corps.

We have so many graduates that are amazing. Our students and adults work together to pick the winners.

Please see the forms below.

We would love it if you would please nominate someone that you feel is worthy.

Please also share this with as many people as possible so we can reach those amazing graduates even if they are not local.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2662492230465055&id=867555306625432,,0.0,"Gallery of Success!

We are going to have school today.

At 5:30 am, I was up.
There was definitely a snow squall and I questioned having school.
If you had to drive to work at 5:30 am it must have been a slow go!

Since then, I have been gathering as much info as possible.
At this point, the morning News (no free channel advertisement here) and a special weather statement states for our area the squall will be over by 7am.
It‚Äôs not remarkably cold.

The roads are definitely better now than they were at 5:30 am. Snow plows are out.
We need to get our buses out on the road by 6:15 so I needed to make a decision one way or the other before that time.
I also know people need lead time for child care.

So...Please just do the best you can this morning getting to school. Especially for BMS and BHS and JVS which open first.

High school students that drive, please take your time, clean off your windows so you are able to see and leave a little early.
I think by the time you are driving it will be pretty decent out.

Please be safe!!

It was installed shortly after the stadium was improved around 10 years ago.

The last few weeks, we have been fortunate to have our track be re-surfaced.
Today it is getting re-lined.

All of this was made possible with the original purchase and installation of the track as part of the warranty.

**Please remember that our track is not only for our students but also for our community. We encourage you to enjoy the beautiful facility.

The lines need some time to dry and needs to stay closed for a few more days. It will open back up on Thursday July 18th.
Remember to use the turnstile.

This guy inspires me. Meet Eli Hairston. He suffered a traumatic brain injury in November. He was in a coma, suffered multiple strokes, and had to relearn how to walk and talk. 9 months later, I sat down with him and his parents on how his road to recovery is going. Probably the most positive person I have met. You got this Eli 💪#prayforeli #elistrong

This guy inspires me. Meet Eli Hairston. He suffered a traumatic brain injury in November. He was in a coma, suffered multiple strokes, and had to relearn how to walk and talk. 9 months later, I sat down with him and his parents on how his road to recovery is going. Probably the most positive person I have met. You got this Eli 💪#prayforeli #elistrong

I cannot believe that my baby is a junior and that I only have 2 more years with a kid at school with me. This was the first first day in my 20 years where I didn’t have a son riding to school with me. What is life?? Luckily I have trained him well and he KNEW that he better come find me for a first day pic.

Equip her with the knowledge, tenacity and steadfastness she needs to succeed during this school year! May she continue to be leader and a good steward of her time! Protect those around her and help them all too encourage each other when things get a little tough! I plead the blood of Jesus over my child, YOUR child Lord! Amen!!!

It took me so long to make the decision to send Gabriel to school. This is his Kindergarten year, it’s scary and exciting anyway, now there’s COVID-19 to make it that much scarier (for me, he couldn’t care less). Today, I dropped him off for his first day, and he didn’t even give me a chance to hug him 😭😥 Barely even a “Bye, Mommy.” He got out of the car and ran to his teachers. And I got home and cried. Why do they grow so fast?

Taelen Carter is a good kid.
Quiet by nature, Taelen loves his family and he loves his music- he’s a member of the Oak Mountain High School Band.
I hear he plays a mean snare drum.
For months now, Taelen’s bandmates have been there for him.

It was today when Taelen heard his doorbell ring- he answered the door, only to see several uniformed Birmingham Police officers smiling back at him.

You see, today, Taelen Carter turns sixteen, eighteen months after his father, Birmingham Police Sgt. WyTasha Carter, was gunned down and murdered in the line of duty.

Sunday, January 13th, 2019 seems like yesterday to Taelen.
Then again, it seems like a long time ago.

While Taelen wishes that he had his dad by his side while he celebrates his birthday, he’s truly appreciative of his father’s comrades who took time to cheer up his day.

Let’s wish Taelen a happy sixteenth, and give our best to Taelen’s mom Tiphanie and his sister Dashae.
I know our support will mean the world to them.

Senior Class of 2020....we have not forgotten you! Several sponsors donated funds so that we could purchase a personalized sign for each of you! These are all on display in front of the high school. I am going to post several pics and videos during the next few minutes. Please feel free to come get your sign when you can. All I ask is that you take a selfie with your sign or have someone take your picture holding it and send it to me either via email at bsnyder@shelbyed.org or tag the scwildcatnation account on instagram. We have another special tribute coming your way in the near future. Thank you to Scott Owen for making all of the signs. Thank you to the following people/groups for also sponsoring your signs: Alabama Graduation Products, Bob Patrick, Corley Ellis, Kevin Morris, Scott Owen, SCHS administrators, and SCHS Senior Class Sponsors. #scwildcatwatch #scproudprincipal

Although this isn't the ending she had hoped for, the end of senior year still means the start of something new. I love you Gracie Crowe, I believe in you wholeheartedly, the sky is the limit.

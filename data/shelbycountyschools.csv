Due to the recent extension of the USDA’s Summer Meals Program, SCS is able to serve more families during the virtual learning period. This extension will also allow the District to provide bulk meals for ALL children 18 years of age and under, not just children enrolled in school, from all school locations.

Starting tomorrow Sept. 3, SCS will distribute seven-day meal packs at all school sites every Thursday. Parents can pick up meals from 9 a.m. – 12 p.m. and 1 – 5 p.m. Parents who cannot pick up on Thursdays may get their meals on Fridays, 7 – 9 a.m.

The child does not have to be present to receive meals. The Parent/guardian will need to have the student name, school and child’s birthday if they are of school age. If they are not of school age, only name and birthday are required.

Ray published an open letter to officials with the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association (TSSAA) expressing concerns over frequent decisions that do not reflect the best interests of all Tennessee student-athletes.

In the letter, Dr. Ray announced the formation of an exploratory committee to evaluate SCS’ continued participation in the TSSAA. SCS is requesting immediate action and deliberation by the organization, which includes:

“In no way does our call to action mean that athletic competition has come to an end,” said Superintendent Dr. Joris M. Ray. “While the fall season has not started, conditioning will continue as previously stated. Like all athletes and coaches, ‘we want to play’ and will ensure our student-athletes have an opportunity to showcase their talents for potential post-secondary endeavors.”

**What does WIDA measure?
It measures English Language Proficiency, broken down into four domains- reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Not only does it measure social language, but it also measures the content specific language needed for academic success.

**How will the scores be used?
Parents can use the scores to advocate for their child, teachers can use scores to plan instruction and assessments, and the district can use the scores to evaluate language support programs.

The C.L.U.E. program provides Pre-K through 12th grade students with enriched learning experiences that develop leadership abilities, creativity, cooperative learning, and self-examination skills. The program currently serves over 3,500 SCS students - and now it is expanding by putting equity in action in its 50th anniversary year!

We have implemented a game-changing process for how students are chosen for further C.L.U.E. testing. Rather than relying only on adult recommendation, we have introduced the Universal Screener Assessment, allowing the student's own academic performance to determine their eligibility. This has resulted over 4,000 more students being assessed for C.L.U.E, 602 brand new C.L.U.E. students, and 13 new C.L.U.E. Centers.

Deirdre McClellan exemplifies heart as a school psychologist because she has brought unparalleled passion to her job each day for the last 32 years.

Deirdre knew at early age in her life that she wanted to work with preschool age children and eventually children suspected of having autism as well. Upon graduating from Memphis State University, she immediately began working as a school psychologist. She now works full time at the Colonial Hearing, Speech, and Vision Center where she evaluates preschool age children, using her wonderful gift of empathy to reassure parents and bring out the unique qualities in her students. Also a leader in our community in assessment of autism, Deirdre was among the first in west Tennessee to receive specialized training at Vanderbilt University. #SPAW2019

Nichol exemplifies innovation by being one of only a few SCS school psychologists certified in Crisis Prevention Intervention instructor helping others in the district to use de-escalation techniques with students.

During today’s press conference, Governor Scott announced that he will be releasing an Executive Order that pushes back the start of the school year to September 8.

My furry friend and ""colleague"" Eleanor was reminding me that sometimes we get scared or nervous about new things and other times we have fears that stick with us a long time. She is scared to go outside, even on the deck. I don't like the dark (okay, maybe I am a little scared of it).

What makes you nervous? Does your furry friend get scared easily?

Today we had a faculty meeting, 42 teachers coming together to be sure we are doing all we can to be here for you and to plan for the future. That prompted the question, what have you experienced since the building has been closed that has been a positive and what are the things that still remain challenges?

So far a whole wall of siding has been removed and the crew inside is dismantling the bathrooms and the locker rooms. How exciting!

Hello Sheldon Families! Happy Thursday. ☺️When I was playing a little game of ""I Spy"" today, not only did I spy something with the letter ""c"" (check out the video to see what that is) I also spied a lot of Sheldon students participating in their Google Class assignments, showing up for morning meetings and class get-togethers, posting on classroom Facebook pages and sending in requests for more books! 💚

What games are you playing at home right now? Do you have one that you can play from afar? Let me know, my partner in this video is not all that interested in playing ""I Spy"" but perhaps she would like a game you suggest?!

Hoping to spy you on the parade route tomorrow. 😎💚

Hello Sheldon!

So I came into school today and when we are in the building we wear our masks. We wear masks and gloves to keep ourselves and others safe. When I wear my mask, it does start to feel warm so I found myself ""hurrying"" a little to do the jobs I need to do here and then get back home.
Did you get enough snow to make a small snow sculpture? ⛄️Or, is the snow already gone from where you live? This time of the year we know it does not last long. Make sure you check for your BEARS Bingo Board! Holler BINGO when you get one! Better yet, get a SUPER BONGO and fill the whole page!! 🤩

Happy Friday, Sheldon. I hope you have a good weekend. See you Monday! 💚🙂

First, tomorrow is delivery day and many of. you will be receiving a new hard copy learning materials. Be sure to put something out by the road to collect them. We will be by to drop them off. Second, we have teacher inservice tomorrow. That means your teachers will be working hard together and sharing everything they know about how to reach out to you all and learning a few new tricks and strategies as well. We also have to begin preparing to be in this for a while, that take a little time.

Important Safety Reminder: According to information from the Center for Disease Control (CDC), coronavirus can stay active on metal for up to 3 days. If you are spending time outside or traveling to a park or a playground, please be sure to use safety precautions and assume nothing has been cleaned. I know Sheldon Elementary's playground equipment has not been disinfected and though we typically love for you to visit, now may not be a good time.

In today's message I mentioned that you just might see my cat make a cameo in a video one of these days. She is shy but she is curious and she sure does love to have her photo taken! Who are the furry friends who share your home? Comment below or take a photo so I can see your pet family! 💚

We would love to stop at every household so please let us know if a healthy breakfast and lunch for each student in your household 18 and under would make things just a little bit easier!

Hope you were able to get out and enjoy the sunshine that has been peeking in and out today; I know it was streaming through my window off and on all day. 🌤
On Friday's we will be delivering more than meals. Your students might be getting some of their belongings they left that may be useful at home, school supplies you requested, and possibly some more learning materials.

We have a couple of quick announcements for you.

1. Since Parent-Teacher conferences are canceled and we only have three lines at school, we need to get creative about calling families. So if you see a call from a ""Private"" number or an ""Unknown Caller"" that actually might be your teacher calling. Teachers will be in touch about making those calls!

2. If you have a child in grades 3 - 8, who did not take their chromebook home from school, please find a time to drop by and pick their chromebook at school. We will not be busing devices home. Call the school to schedule a time, we will be in 8 - 5 today and tomorrow, March 19th and 20th.

Kindergartners at Sheldon Elementary School have been writing their letters in lots of ways: with pencils, crayons, bendy bodies, their fingers and even bread dough. Did you know they can even write letters using their own bodies? That's what they did today in the gym. They could make some letters on their own and others needed a friend to work with.

Do it with games! Many popular games require mathematical problem solving and help kids develop fact fluency. Even simple routines involving counting (forward and backward), adding up, taking away, making equal sets, dividing items in parts (think pie!) will help “math” become just another part of every day. Want to know more about math games and supporting your math learners? Sheldon Elementary will host a few workshops for our family partners on December 19th!

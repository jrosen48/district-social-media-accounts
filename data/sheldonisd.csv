Dear Senior Class of 2020 Students and Parents,

Due to COVID-19, we are required to social distance each family during our graduation ceremony. With that being said, each family will receive four non-transferable tickets with the students' names and seating sections. For example: Student A only needs 2 tickets and wants to give/sell to student B who needs 2 more tickets. Because of social distancing, the two tickets from student A would require the users of those tickets to sit with Student A’s family. We are social distancing families based on state standards for graduation. Each student will also receive 2 parking passes. Each car entering the parking lot will have to have a parking ticket including graduates who drive.

Communication was sent out asking if students would be participating in graduation. If you or your student answered NO, tickets will not be provided to you.

As a source of community pride, Sheldon ISD will be displaying tonight's ""C. E. King High School Class of 2020 Virtual Graduation"" on the giant video board at the new Sheldon ISD Panther Stadium.

The video will play at approximately 7 p.m.

Rules/Guidelines
Due to our current social distancing guidelines under the executive order by Gov. Greg Abbott, no one will be allowed inside Sheldon ISD Panther Stadium. This means there will be no restrooms and/or concessions available, so please plan accordingly.

Also, individuals may bring lawn chairs, blankets, or even remain in their vehicles in order to be as comfortable as possible - but you MUST maintain social distancing, as required by law.

One suggested viewing area is the upper portion of the north end of the stadium. There is a great view of the video board, and the sound should also be sufficient.

Lastly, for those who would like to view the video in the comfort of their own homes, the same video will be posted at approximately 7 p.m. by visiting the following URL: www.sheldonisd.com/graduation/

As a source of community pride, Sheldon ISD will be displaying tonight's ""C. E. King High School Class of 2020 Virtual Graduation"" on the giant video board at the new Sheldon ISD Panther Stadium.

The video will play at approximately 7 p.m.

Rules/Guidelines
Due to our current social distancing guidelines under the executive order by Gov. Greg Abbott, no one will be allowed inside Sheldon ISD Panther Stadium. This means there will be no restrooms and/or concessions available, so please plan accordingly.

Also, individuals may bring lawn chairs, blankets, or even remain in their vehicles in order to be as comfortable as possible - but you MUST maintain social distancing, as required by law.

One suggested viewing area is the upper portion of the north end of the stadium. There is a great view of the video board, and the sound should also be sufficient.

Athletes from tennis, golf, basketball, boys and girls track, boys and girls soccer, baseball, and volleyball were able to come to the Panther Zone to pick up their gift baskets from the athletic department.

When someone hurts your feelings, you can try these sentence stems
Please stop doing…...
I don’t like it when you…..
I feel sad when you…..
That makes me angry……
I’m upset because…

Putting your needs into words can give you a better sense of control over a problem.
Try phrases like:

*Can you use a softer voice when talking
*I like that you made your bed this morning
*Great job stopping when I asked you to",2020-05-13 11:00:00,,

C. E. King High School graduate cap and gown pickups are scheduled for Friday, May 8, from 8 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. at C. E. King High School.

The pickup locations and traffic patterns have been pre-determined based on the students’ last names:

“Aaron – Longoria”: The pickup location will be outside the KHS Performing Arts Center [see map]

“Lopez – Zuniga”: The pickup location will be outside the KHS Competition Gymnasium [see map]

Seniors, if you have not yet paid for your cap and gown, a Balfour representative will be on site to sell you these items for $65 (cash or credit card).

For those individuals who may not be able to make Friday’s pickup, there will be an additional date and time scheduled in the near future.",2020-05-07 16:50:31,,

Try to be calm when someone acts out. If someone is genuinely overwhelmed, they may say and do things they do not mean.

If that happens, calm yourself first. Ask your loved one to take a break from what is overwhelming them

If you have children, Play with your kids and/or pets. Try and be creative by cooking something new or making something that will bring you a sense of accomplishment. Taking time to play, gives everyone a break from the stress of the moment, and a chance to connect with each other.

Be as consistent as you can with your routines. If you want people to wash their hands before they eat, wash your hands every time before you eat.
Leading by example empowers us all.
Turn off the news & social media. Talk with someone (phone, video chat, in person). Taking a break from the worry of the world. Can help you feel better. Connecting with someone you know (even if it’s just on the phone) can help.

Try “sound bathing.” It is playing music with repetition of sounds that soothes your thoughts patterns
Benefits are:
*reduces stress and anxiety
*decrease blood pressure
*helps tun out your thoughts and increases balanced and focused thoughts

Instead of saying “Calm down,” say “I see you’re upset,” or “it makes sense that you’re angry.”
In order to handle difficult or challenging situations, it is important that both children and adults learn to recognize their emotions, understand that all people have emotions, and learn to manage their emotions.

Please use the link provided in order to submit your photo and quote: https://forms.gle/QSWaGExuz34GmYqi9",2020-04-14 10:38:47,,

Although local authorities and emergency management personnel have not included the Sheldon ISD community among its shelter-in-place protocol - SISD administrators have decided to err on the side of caution and have all students and/or student athletes to come inside for any practices, rehearsals or other school-related activities that were scheduled today.

District officials will continue to monitor and evaluate these ongoing conditions in the Baytown area and will keep you informed regarding tomorrow’s scheduled activities.

Thank you.",2019-07-31 13:10:59,,

Posted 7/9/19, 9:36 a.m.

A low-pressure system over southwestern Georgia is expected to move over the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday and has an 80 percent chance of developing into a tropical depression by the end of the week, the National Hurricane Center posted earlier today.

The hurricane center advised residents from the western Florida peninsula to the upper Texas coast to monitor the system as potential heavy rains and wind gusts are likely to impact coastal areas spanning from Florida to Texas.

It is also important to note that the hurricane center cautioned that the magnitude of potential wind or storm surge impacts along the Gulf Coast are too soon to be determined.

Posted 7/9/19, 9:36 a.m.

A low-pressure system over southwestern Georgia is expected to move over the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday and has an 80 percent chance of developing into a tropical depression by the end of the week, the National Hurricane Center posted earlier today.

The hurricane center advised residents from the western Florida peninsula to the upper Texas coast to monitor the system as potential heavy rains and wind gusts are likely to impact coastal areas spanning from Florida to Texas.

It is also important to note that the hurricane center cautioned that the magnitude of potential wind or storm surge impacts along the Gulf Coast are too soon to be determined.

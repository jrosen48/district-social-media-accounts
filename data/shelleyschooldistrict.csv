All players, we will be suspending all football related activities including the weight room for two weeks. This is because one of our athletes who attended two days of football camp has tested positive for COVID-19. We are currently working with the district health department about the next steps and will have more information in the next 24 hours. This will include what steps the players and coaches will need to take. If you have further questions please email me at jwells@shelleyschools.org.

We will start up activities again on AUG 10th which is the first day of practice

How to handle struggles with education at home:

Communicate with your student's teacher and/or counselor, depending on the concern. At SKS, your student's teacher can put you in contact with the counselor, if needed. They are there to help!
Take it easy on yourself. This is not a typical situation, and you are not expected to be perfect.
Be sure to take care of yourself. If you wear yourself out you cannot help your student. We are all in this together!

What if we run out of school work:

This is a great opportunity to teach kids ""real life"" skills! Teach them how to do laundry, cook a meal, or change a tire. You can also incorporate school subjects into these lessons. For example, you can teach math such as measuring or adding/subtracting to adjust the size of the recipe while you are cooking.
If you're still looking for more, there are online resources. Please, use your discretion in which sites are appropriate.
If all else fails, READ!!! Reading is the foundation of all learning and is always helpful to practice.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2569949453263969&id=1619026008356323,,0.0,"Some helpful hints/reminders from Mrs. Givens (part 2)

How to talk with kids about what is going on:

It is important to be honest with kids while being sure to communicate with them at an age-appropriate level (not all ages are able to understand/deal with all the details of what is going on).
Allow them to tell you their feelings, and validate those feelings.
Discussing what you do and do not have control of, along with making a plan for what you can control (washing hands, staying home, etc.) can help empower kids and calm their nerves.

How to minimize the stresses that go with being home all day:

Keep routines, such as bathtime, getting up by a certain time, etc., keeping in mind some typical routines may need to be adjusted during social distancing.
Make plans for how you want days to go, communicate those plans with kids, and even include kids in making the plans to encourage buy-in from them.
Set boundaries and communicate expectations for the family.
Create personal spaces for members of the family to have time to themselves.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2569947573264157&id=1619026008356323,,0.0,"Some helpful hints/reminders from Mrs. Givens (part 1)

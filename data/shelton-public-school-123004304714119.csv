Thank you to all of the athletes and coaches that took time out of their evening to clean up the grounds at Shelton Public Schools. Our goal is to always create a culture worth fighting for. We want to invest in one another to the point that everyone wants to fight for the culture and for each other. Investing personal time and work in to who and what you represent should bring a sense of pride and accomplishment and ultimately a desire to fight for the culture you have worked so hard for. Strong cultures will ultimately lead to our student-athletes successes both on and off the field. Yesterday we took another step toward building that culture.

If you are planning to participate in ANY sport next year, and want to raise the level of your game, the weight room is the place to be this summer. The weight room will open up next Monday, June 1st. Please see the attached 2020 Summer Strength schedule to see start times for each group, look over the weight room waiver you and your parent/guardian will be required to sign and bring back Wednesday, June 3rd (you will also be given paper copies on Monday), and come next week ready to mold yourself in to a better student-athlete.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Mrs. Thober or any of your respective coaches. We are all excited to see you and work with you this summer...within CDC guidelines, of course.

Had the state convention taken place today as planned, our senior FFA member Wyatt Ohlman would have walked across the stage to earn his State FFA Degree. The State FFA Degree is the highest degree the state association can bestow upon a member. Each year members are awarded the degree based upon their comprehensive Supervised Agricultural Experience Program. FFA members must submit two years of SAE record books, meet all minimum qualifications as well as completing an interview to be awarded the State FFA Degree. Wyatt's SAE program included an entrepreneurship project focused around Team Roping, and a placement project working for local feedlots. Congratulations Wyatt!",0.0,"Congratulations Wyatt!

In light of our current situation, our officer team has decided it would be best to conduct our annual banquet virtually, rather than trying to postpone the event. Any physical awards like certificates, pins, and plaques will be handed out in person when it is safe to do so. We are excited to share our accomplishments from this year, even if it is in a different format than what we are used to.

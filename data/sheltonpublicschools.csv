There are several items owned by the Shelton Public Schools that need to be collected from students at the end of the year. Some of these include chromebooks, iPADs, textbooks, library books, teacher-loaned books, athletic uniforms, fees, graphing calculators, band equipment, technology equipment, etc. We also realize that there may be some items that students need to pick up, such as art projects and mentee gift bags. Attached are the end-of-year procedures for students. The parent of any student who needs to pick up materials or clean out their locker must email their respective building principal prior to the designated date for their school drop off. Anything left beyond the last call date will be disposed of. Honor letters/certificates and promotion/retention letters will be mailed this year. Report cards will be sent via Infinite Campus. The procedures for distribution of yearbooks, caps and gowns, t-shirts, class gifts, etc. will be communicated in the future when these items have been delivered to the schools.

I am saddened to inform you that on the annual Washington D.C. trip
the group from our SIS was thrown out of the Smithsonian’s highly
regarded African American History Museum.

Why?

Because a student, a White male, spit on a Black visitor at the Museum.

This kind of action is not a reflection of who our students are, or
who we are as a community.

This is not the time or place to talk about consequences.

But this is now, regrettably, a pattern of behavior that is
disrespectful and does not serve anyone well —including the student
who acted inappropriately and embarrassed himself and his school.

Yes, we will deal with this at school.

But we need the help and support of families. Please speak to your own
children in an age-appropriate manner about our expectation of how we
treat people: Black or White, elder or young, or anyone, a child (or
adult!) may perceive as being different.

Shelton schools and the Shelton community can do better! We must!

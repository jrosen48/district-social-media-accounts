Today we begin the Washington Mask Requirement order from the Secretary of Health. It’s important to note that we are not in the same circumstance as the Yakima “no mask-no service.” Businesses are required to have employees in masks when social distancing is not possible, but they are not required to refuse service to customers. Businesses may choose to do so on their own.

Please understand that anyone can have COVID-19 without ever showing signs or symptoms. By wearing a mask, you are reducing the chances of spreading the virus to other citizens who may have weakened immunity or a compromised health system.

Here are a few references to answer questions regarding enforcement:

Stadium Lights

Dear Highclimber Community,

The stadium lights will shine on Jack Stark Field at Highclimber Stadium tonight. The lights will honor all the Seniors who lost their seasons, and let you all know we have not forgotten about you. You will always be a Highclimber and this will always be your home. We will miss you, and we can’t wait to see the amazing things you do in the future.

The lights will also be a symbol to the community as a statement that we will get through this and will return. This stadium which is now empty, will soon enough be filled with the Highclimber faithful cheering on our athletes.

This will be the last Friday Night Lights that these lights will ever shine on this field. In the short few months ahead, we will have new lights, a new field, and a new future. However, we will not forget this moment in time or our Seniors lost seasons.

Tonight those lights will be burning for you Seniors, and the community which we love.

Sincerely,
Trevor Leopold",12.0,"💙

The NAYLA program is geared to help gather Native American youth from across the Western Washington region. It develops leadership, communication, and life skills for Native youth in a safe and nurturing environment. These students, that represent many districts, gather and discuss topics that affect their lives and how to approach solving issues. Along with making new friends and stepping out of their comfort zones, students learn to become leaders in their schools, among their peers, and in their communities.

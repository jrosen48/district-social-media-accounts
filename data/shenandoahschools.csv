I regret to inform our Seniors, staff members, and parents that we will be changing our graduation format for Friday, July 10, 2020. This is necessary due to Governor Holcomb’s decision to keep Indiana at Stage 4.5 instead of going to Stage 5 of his “Back On Track” plan for Indiana. As a result, SHS will no longer be allowed to hold a traditional graduation service. Therefore, SHS will distribute diplomas at 10 AM on Friday, July 10th at Door # 5. Students and Parents will pull up to door 5 and exit their vehicle and will receive their diplomas outside door #5. Students will wear caps and gowns and will have the opportunity to have pictures at this time. Additionally, we are planning a Senior parade through campus and into Middletown at 6:00 PM.

Attn Students! Below is an update from the College Board regarding SAT tests for the rest of the calendar year.

""The College Board will not be able to administer the SAT and SAT Subject Tests as planned on June 6, 2020.

Students will have opportunities to take the SAT to make up for this spring’s lost administrations. If it’s safe from a public health standpoint, we will provide weekend SAT administrations every month through the end of the calendar year, beginning in August. This includes a new administration in September and the previously scheduled tests on August 29, October 3, November 7, and December 5.

Students will be able to register for these administrations beginning in May. We’ll communicate directly with students when the exact date is available. Eligible students will be able to take the exam with a fee waiver. Students who were registered for June and those in the high school class of 2021 who do not have SAT scores will have early access to registration for the August, September, and October administrations.""",6.0,"Shenandoah HS Counseling Dept

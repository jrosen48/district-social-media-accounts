Shepaug has purchased a personalized lawn sign for each senior that will be placed in front of their home. The First Selectmen purchased a personalized sign for each senior in their town that will be placed in front of each town hall.
Last night the PTO announced lawn signs are available for the community to purchase. They have set-up a website to process the orders. Each sign is $5, printed two sides and comes with a metal stand.

The PTO's signs are a way to show support for our seniors. Anyone wishing to purchase signs can do so through the link to the PTO webstore: https://bit.ly/shepaugproudstore.
To reduce handling, the PTO will be fulfilling orders from one location - SVS from 10A - 1P on Saturday, May 30th, most likely at the foot of the driveway. We ask families to stay in their cars, pull up, give their name and they'll be given their signs.

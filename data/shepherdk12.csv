We have had a positive COVID case in our District. As per our plan that was developed,
we will not have school for the next 2 days in order to do a thorough cleaning. I realize
this is early in the year and much quicker than we had hoped. I know this puts a stress
on our families. We have not checked out Chromebooks to students as that was
planned for upper grades starting this week. Teachers will be contacting you tomorrow
to touch base with things students can be working on over the next 2 days as well as to
ask about technology needs at home. If your child is in a sport please know coaches will
be communicating what that will look like for the next two days practices. I want to thank
you for your patience through this time. I know it is stressful for everyone involved.

Sincerely,

We have had a positive COVID case in our District. As per our plan that was developed,
we will not have school for the next 2 days in order to do a thorough cleaning. I realize
this is early in the year and much quicker than we had hoped. I know this puts a stress
on our families. We have not checked out Chromebooks to students as that was
planned for upper grades starting this week. Teachers will be contacting you tomorrow
to touch base with things students can be working on over the next 2 days as well as to
ask about technology needs at home. If your child is in a sport please know coaches will
be communicating what that will look like for the next two days practices. I want to thank
you for your patience through this time. I know it is stressful for everyone involved.

Sincerely,
Superintendent O‚ÄôDonnell",2020-08-23 20:09:15,,

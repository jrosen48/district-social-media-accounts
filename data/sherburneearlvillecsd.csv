Makayla is a three-sport varsity athlete (soccer, softball, volleyball) who ranks third overall in academics at Sherburne-Earlville. She plans to enter the nursing program at Onondaga Community College this fall.

Section 3 typically honors its Scholar-Athletes with an Awards Night Dinner at Onondaga CC’s SRC Arena. Since this is not possible in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Makayla and the rest of Section 3’s Scholar-Athletes will be honored with a slide-show presentation at 6 p.m. June 15.

The Awards Show will air on CNY Central Channel 6 in Syracuse and the website https://cnycentral.com/.

I wanted to do something for my students for Memorial Day- since many places won't have bands and fireworks, I decided to make my own band. I hope this makes everyone feel festive today! (For anyone trying to make their own mashup, I definitely recommend using a metronome- I didn't because my headphones broke, but the videos need to quite literally line up to hundredths of a second. I did this on iMovie- glad the pandemic has allowed me to become more tech savvy!)",6.0,"Jenna Stango

Sherburne-Earlville’s Jonathan Ryan is hooked on helping others.

Jon has been using the district’s Glowforge laser-cutter machine to carve out plastic clips for protective facemasks worn by caregivers during the COVID-19 crisis.

“I have seen pictures of people’s ears rubbed raw from wearing these masks all day long,” said Jon, a computer whiz who works as a teaching assistant at S-E. “Facemask straps can be hooked to these clips behind the head, which takes the pressure off of the ears.”

Jon, who wrote a grant for the Glowforge machine in November, is working on his third sheet of clips right now. Each sheet yields 66 clips.

Jon said he will deliver facemask clips to Community Memorial Hospital in Hamilton in the near future and can make more by request. For more information, email him at ryanj@seonline.org.

Sherburne-Earlville Middle School sent 17 students to the annual STEM Showcase event at Mohawk Valley Community College in early March.

Our kids put their windmills, mousetrap cars and ping-pong-ball launchers to the test against students from other local school districts. We took first and second places in the MS mousetrap competition and also had the top ping-pong-ball launcher.

SEMS students, who competed in the windmill and mousetrap categories for the first time, also learned what they need to do to be competitive in the renewable energy KidWind Challenge in the future.

We gave educators almost no notice. We asked them to completely redesign what school looks like and in about 24 hours local administrators and teachers ""Apollo 13'ed"" the problem and fixed it. Kids learning, children being fed, needs being met in the midst of a global crisis.
No state agency did this, no so-called national experts on curriculum. The local educators fixed it in hours. HOURS.
In fact, existing state and federal policies actually created multiple roadblocks. Local schools figured out how to do it around those too. No complaining and no handwringing - just solutions and amazingly clever plans.
Remember that the next time someone tries to convince you that schools are better run by mandates from non-educators. Remember that the next time someone tells you that teachers have it easy or try to persuade you that educators are not among the smartest, most ingenious people in society. And please never say to me again, ""Those who can't do anything else just go into teaching.""

Administrators, teachers, staff, and mental health professionals will all be available. Our staff members are going to do their best to ensure learning continues. We are confident in the ability of our students to practice everything from math to manners while at home.

There is no shame in asking for help. Whether you can't figure out an equation or are wondering how to contact your insurance company - please ask. If we don't know the answer, we'll help find someone who does.

These kids are fantastic! Their progress has been nothing short of amazing in the past week, and they should be so proud of themselves.

I have been working with them for the past week on costumes. I was terrified to have any part of this. I have never had any theater experience and my costume experience has been limited to making them for kids and dogs at Halloween. However, these kids have been so incredibly respectful, patient, and grateful, that I would definitely help with future productions. They have even fanned the love of performing, that had been ignited in our child, when she attends rehearsals with me. These really are some great kids!",2.0,"RA-Bel Farm

Sherburne-Earlville Elementary School students in grades 3-5 were loud and proud Wednesday morning, cheering on the Colgate Raider Nation women's #basketball team before, during and after its 72-53 win over Lafayette.

Our S-E kids sang the national anthem during Colgate's Kids Day pre-game festivities, which included a brief ceremony honoring senior guard Rachel Thompson for scoring 1,000 points at the college level.

We also enjoyed pizza for lunch, gave some love to Colgate's mascot, Raider, and stole the show at halftime with a mass jump-roping exhibition.

Sherburne-Earlville thanks Colgate University for giving back to local school districts and making its annual Kids Day one to remember!

The price was right for Sherburne-Earlville Elementary School students this past Thursday and Friday during our annual Holiday Bazaar!

Classes visited the makeshift gift shop in the west end of SEES during designated periods, giving kids a chance to purchase holiday presents for 50-cents apiece.

All of the new or gently-used items on sale at the Holiday Bazaar were donated by community members or purchased from an account that feeds the proceeds back into the program.

Former SEES secretary Maggie Fitzpatrick and former SECSD Superintendent Gayle Hellert spearheaded a crew of volunteers who made the Holiday Bazaar possible.

SEES accepts Holiday Bazaar items and monetary donations any time throughout the year. For more information on how you can help, call the main office at 607-674-7336.

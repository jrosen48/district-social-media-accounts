I am looking for several judges to help make this day successful. I am asking for volunteers to help judge the Science Fair. The judging will start at 9:00 a.m. Please let me know ASAP if you are available to help. We hope to be done with judging around noon, but that will all depend on the judging. Also, if you a preferred age group, or the age group you really don't want to judge, please let me know, also! And, finally, if you know of someone else that would love to judge or be interested in volunteering, please pass that info either on to me or to them. Thanks! Mrs. Decker",2019-02-14 20:38:28,,

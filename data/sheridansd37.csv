Today is Teacher Appreciation Day but I want to give a big shout out to all of you Mamas, Daddies, Grandmas and Grandpas out there! You are the real MVP’s! On March 12, you took over a job that you didn’t plan on taking! You became first grade teachers over night! And I see you! I see you pop in to google meets to help with sound. I see all the work you’ve done come through. I see the pictures, and videos you’ve sent me. I see the emails and texts with worries and concerns! You all are doing a fantastic job, all while trying to do your job, take care of other children, and be a parent. And it’s hard! I became a third grade teacher and speech pathologist all in one night! It’s hard to teach your own child. I know tears have been shed and tempers have been raised. But the end is in sight and You are doing great! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
So Happy Teacher Appreciation Day to all of you!

Today is Teacher Appreciation Day but I want to give a big shout out to all of you Mamas, Daddies, Grandmas and Grandpas out there! You are the real MVP’s! On March 12, you took over a job that you didn’t plan on taking! You became first grade teachers over night! And I see you! I see you pop in to google meets to help with sound. I see all the work you’ve done come through. I see the pictures, and videos you’ve sent me. I see the emails and texts with worries and concerns! You all are doing a fantastic job, all while trying to do your job, take care of other children, and be a parent. And it’s hard! I became a third grade teacher and speech pathologist all in one night! It’s hard to teach your own child. I know tears have been shed and tempers have been raised. But the end is in sight and You are doing great! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
So Happy Teacher Appreciation Day to all of you!

Picked up her announcements ...even though we don’t have a date for a ceremony. These should be in the mail soon. Katie Mayberry is the first known student who has always used a wheelchair in the Sheridan School District to be mainstreamed from kindergarten to 12th grade. She never had special ed services, resource, or an IEP. She has had amazing teachers, counselors, principals and nurses guiding her along the way.

For the last 7 years, I have had the privilege of working with some of the best professionals I have ever known. Every day I spend at SHS, I see teachers and staff members advocate for kids, work to build amazing futures for kids, love kids without question, and look beyond curriculum to help teach kids lessons that can't be found in the pages of any book.

Spending my days at SHS with the fabulous professionals that walk the halls each day blesses me more than I could ever express. You guys are amazing!

Additional resources will be made easily accessible to AP students and teachers through mobile phones and other devices. These include free online AP lessons and review sessions from some of the top AP teachers in the country.

The AP program is finalizing streamlined AP exam options that would allow students to test at home, depending on the situation in May.

The AP Program will communicate the details of these additional solutions to educators and students by March 20.

Dear Sherman School Families,

Although there are no known cases of coronavirus in our community, out of an abundance of caution, the Sherman School will be closed until further notice.

However, the school building will be open tomorrow, Friday, March 13th between the hours of 12:00 PM and 4:00 PM so that parents will be able to pick up hard copies of instructional packets (if they were not received today), Chromebooks, or any other personal items that students may wish to have.

Please also be sure to continue to check emails from the school as we plan to communicate regularly.

Thank you,

Jeff Melendez

We made sure to return at least this amount back to the Town from last year's budget surplus in order to pay for this critical capital expense. The MPR is the center of so much of what we do - and what we hope to do - at the Sherman School as we expand programs in music, visual arts, performing arts, and other enrichment initiatives. It also houses sensitive equipment, instruments, and supplies.
And, let's face it: it gets damn hot in there!

We feel this is an important, legitimate need and a responsible use of Sherman tax dollars. We made sure to return at least this amount back to the Town from last year's budget surplus in order to pay for this critical capital expense. The MPR is the center of so much of what we do - and what we hope to do - at the Sherman School as we expand programs in music, visual arts, performing arts, and other enrichment initiatives. It also houses sensitive equipment, instruments, and supplies.
And, let's face it: it gets damn hot in there!
The meeting is at 7PM at Mallory Town Hall.
We would appreciate your attendance and YES vote.
Thanks!!!",2017-11-30 16:30:40,,

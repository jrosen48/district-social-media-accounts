Good Afternoon Williamsville & Sherman Communities!

As many of you are aware, the $40million dollar WCUSD#15 facility plan referendum was overwhelming approved at the March 17, 2020 Primary Election.

I wanted to take the time to THANK the Williamsville and Sherman Communities for coming together to support a facility plan that will provide opportunities for our students and solidify the district’s facilities for the future.

The Board of Education will continue to be good financial stewards to the taxpayers.

We are very fortunate to live in these two wonderful communities and raise our families.

Our communities demonstrated we value education and we value opportunities for all students.

Even on a rainy day – The sun still shines on WCUSD#15

Thank you Williamsville Subway!

As we all know, Illinois has closed schools temporarily in an attempt to control the spread of COVID 19. In addition, restaurants are only able to operate for drive thru, curbside pickup, and delivery.

We believe this is the right decision, but also understand that it may present challenges to families in our community. We're here to help.

If you are concerned about ensuring your children have lunch, please call us and order a kids meal free of charge. Kids meals consist of a mini sub (turkey, ham, roast beef, or veggie) a side item, and 20oz. fountain drink.

Good evening Williamsville & Sherman Families,

We sure have had an interesting last few days. I am so proud of everyone’s understanding and compassion for our school district.

We still have a very important and historic opportunity for your school district. Tomorrow is Election Day.

I want to remind all families there is an important ballot issue for your school district. We encourage all of our parents and families to learn about the referendum and to vote in the election tomorrow.

The referendum is a plan to improve all of our schools throughout the district. This proposal will maintain our district’s commitment to providing the type of up-to-date facilities our children need and our families expect.

The facility plan is a smart financial improvement plan that will not change the district’s overall tax rate. These facility improvements can be made with zero change in the property tax rate to support our district.

Happy St. Patrick’s Day Tomorrow
Tomorrow is Election Day

Good evening Williamsville & Sherman Families,

We sure have had an interesting last few days. I am so proud of everyone’s understanding and compassion for our school district.

We still have a very important and historic opportunity for your school district. Tomorrow is Election Day.

I want to remind all families there is an important ballot issue for your school district. We encourage all of our parents and families to learn about the referendum and to vote in the election tomorrow.

The referendum is a plan to improve all of our schools throughout the district. This proposal will maintain our district’s commitment to providing the type of up-to-date facilities our children need and our families expect.

The facility plan is a smart financial improvement plan that will not change the district’s overall tax rate. These facility improvements can be made with zero change in the property tax rate to support our district.

Happy St. Patrick’s Day Tomorrow

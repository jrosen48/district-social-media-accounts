We've collected your feedback and will be releasing a plan that integrates that feedback with state guidelines in the next few days.

All plans will be made with your student’s safety and academic progress as our unwavering top commitments. Our goal remains: To ensure that all students have the knowledge and skills necessary to be resourceful and successful.

After about 11 hours of work, here it is...the virtual quarantine performance of Sherrard Victory by the Sherrard Band Members! These kids recorded their own parts at perfect tempo, with correct notes, in their own homes, and sent the videos to me to be edited and put together in order to create this amazing video. Please give it a listen and share with the community to spread some joy at the end of this school year. And a special thank you to our Sherrard Band Seniors who built this band to where it is today. They never got their chance to perform one last time, so I hope this can be a great memory.

May 11 - This morning teachers and staff got to interact with students - if only for a brief moment during school supply pickup.

Vehicles lined the front of the school from 8 - 11 a.m. where tables were set up with student belongings bagged up and ready to go, organized by class.

Smiles and teary-eyed waves were exchanged - teachers heard from kids that they missed being in class, and some even received parting gifts. It was emotional as teachers told kids they can't wait to teach in-person again.

School continues online until May 22, supply pickup will be available again for Matherville students in the evening on Wednesday (May 13), 5:30-6:30 p.m.

After Wednesday - you can call the office and schedule a time for pickup Monday/Wednesday and Friday (8-noon) with Principal Jeff Shillinger.

All the employees of Sherrard School District are educators and each one of them deserves our appreciation. This annual recognition looks a little different this year. It will be quieter and there will be less food, but the level of gratitude from the stakeholders is higher than ever.

Over the past couple months, everyone has had to rearrange the way they do education. They had to learn new technology skills, do things out of their comfort zone and continue to work with little insight into where things were going. Through it all, our educators persevere and remain focused. They plan, teach, communicate and lead. They clean, prepare meals, deliver materials, complete important paperwork, and repair things. All of this has been done while social distancing and taking care of the needs and challenges of their own families.

The idea was to have a free ""Little Library"" outside SG to allow children and adults to borrow a book, and loan a book.

With the help of daughters, Anabel, 6 and Marily, 2, the Fritch family constructed a Little Library to sit outside Sherrard Grade. It will be installed and ready this week.

“They truly answered and stepped up. SG is very grateful to the Fritch Family for their amazing work and generous donation so all children have materials to read during this trying time, and beyond,” said Fry.

This time last year Sherrard high school students and Winola fourth graders designed, constructed and installed a free little library for Winola Elementary school in Viola.

Tim Wernentin, principal of Sherrard High School, said the district was thrilled to earn the recognition.

“We’ve worked hard as a staff to expand our AP offerings, and beyond that, really focusing on students performing well on the exams,” he said. “We have a great group of teachers who go above and beyond getting the kids prepared.""

Sherrard students have the opportunity to take AP classes in the areas of statistics, calculus A and B, English literature, English language, U.S. history, chemistry, biology, and studio art. Next year, Sherrard will be adding AP physics and computer science.

Wernentin said last year the district administered 100 AP exams, and 79 of those test takers earned a score of three or higher.

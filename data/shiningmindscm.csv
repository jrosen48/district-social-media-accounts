We had a Community Montessori high school Pets Show and Tell day today (virtually, of course!), and it was the highlight of my week. Getting to see around 20 teens pop in to introduce the group to their critters at home was heartwarming and delightful. It was a great opportunity to connect and blow off steam and combat the isolation of social distancing. We plan to offer a virtual activity every Wednesday afternoon to just give everyone a time to come together and have fun. I am so fortunate to be part of this school community. Teens, if you came today, thank you for sharing your pets with us! If you didn’t make it, then I hope to see you at next Wednesday’s gathering!#cmelearning #socialdistancing #wecandothis",2.0,"Hannegan Roseberry

Dreaming about and planning for the CASA dei Curiosity, the new construction at Community Montessori! We’re breaking ground in the coming month and within the year we’ll have a beautiful new space in which to do large-scale creative endeavors, exhibitions, and theatre productions! The CM Players theatre program began 10 years ago and has grown exponentially into a program that helps teens to become leaders and collaborators (while also putting on terrific shows). My head and heart still can’t believe we are going to have this beautiful new space to create art in. Stay tuned for the journey ahead! Here are some of my amazing teens working on spray painting out the footprint of the new building so the learners can picture what is to come. A big thanks to Martin French for helping us map it out today! #casadeicuriosity #communitymontessori @ Community Montessori",0.0,"Hannegan Roseberry is with Martin French and 3 others at Community Montessori.

Welcome to the 10th season of the CM Players at Community Montessori! Today was our first music/choreography rehearsal for the 9 to 14 age level’s production of Honk, Jr. It was awesome to watch the highschoolers teaching the younger learners the ropes. On Monday we begin our performing arts expressions with the high school, where we will be focusing on skills building this fall, culminating in a showcase of talent in December. Spring brings The Sound of Music and the building of our new performance space at school, the Casa dei Curiosity! There is so much to celebrate and so much that has been built from the hard work of learners collaborating for the last decade.

As part of school life, which gives priority to the intellect, the role of movement has always been sadly neglected.

July 20, 2018 at 8:54 AM · Clermont, KY ·

On July 19th our summer residency ventured out to Goat Milk Stuff Farm in Scottsburg, Indiana and Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest in Kentucky. Our goal was to see how leadership could be seen through stewardship.

I was surprised by how much precision is involved in both raising goats at Goat Milk Stuff and running a sustainable cafe at Bernheim. It takes a lot of dedicated people to continuously brainstorm, create, and reflect in order to create something that can continue feeding itself into the future. Once again, the scientific method is at work.

There isn’t just a thought of stewardship to the community, but also to the environment. I was inspired by what I saw because it makes all of this feel a little more realistic. I can do this too. If I can do this, then I can pass that same thought onto the teens that I teach, which is what is starting to move me forward.

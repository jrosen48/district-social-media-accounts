A really exciting event is happening on Monday, Aug. 21 — a solar eclipse! For many, this may be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see our solar system in action. And it’s a great teaching moment for our kids.

A solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, blocking our view of the sun. The eclipse will occur across the continental United States on Aug. 21. It will start on the West Coast and end on the East Coast. Everyone in the continental U.S. will be able to see at least a partial eclipse on this day.

As educators, the safety of our students is always our top priority.

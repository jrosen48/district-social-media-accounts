We also want to thank all the other participating schools (600+) who mobilized quickly to release their salmon early, prior to school closures.

Huge shout-out to Shorecrest sophomore Ian Prosser for his initiative in collecting and delivering items for the Hopelink food drive last weekend!

With the help of Bruce, a Kellogg student and others, Ian collected over 200 pounds of groceries, as well as $50 in Safeway gift cards.

Julia, Ian's mother, said, ""This was a great experience and showed Ian how much need there is in our community right now. The carload of food came from 8 families on our street, as well as 12 other Ridgecrest/Shorecrest families.""

The Kirkland Hopelink warehouse provides food boxes to all five locations, including Shoreline Hopelink off Aurora Ave. where 390 boxes of shelf-stable food are picked up or delivered each week. Hopelink also provides boxes for the Supplemental Weekend Food Program that benefits Shoreline/LFP residents and supports King County Housing Authority residents with regular deliveries.

Excellent showing at Mat Classic XXXII 2020 this weekend Shorecrest!

In the entire 59 year history of Shorecrest High school, only 8 wrestlers have ever placed at the State tournament. This weekend, there were 5 state placers! The team placed 10th out of 61 teams in the 3A division. Extraordinary!

A huge factor in the team‚Äôs success this year was the work ethic and leadership of the two senior captains: Kaiya ‚ÄúKyle‚Äù Conway-Yasuyama and Trentyn ‚ÄúTrevor‚ÄùGood. And also the athleticism and dedication of senior Ian ‚ÄùMartinez‚Äù Mortensen.

Individual results:

Trentyn Good (Senior) 152lbs - 3rd place
Thomas Rhodes (Sophomore) 113lbs - 4th place
Ian Mortensen (Senior) 170lbs - 7th place
Jordan Glesener (Junior) 285lbs - 7th place
Kaiya Conway- Yasuyama (Senior) 132lbs - 8th place

Mrs. Johnston's 2nd grade students looked on as the eggs were released into the tank.

Librarian, Frank Kleyn, taught the students about the salmon lifecycle and their role in taking care of our local environment to help salmon and wildlife. All LFP 2nd grade students will participate in learning about salmon and environmental stewardship.

After the eggs develop into fry, students and staff will release them into the stream at Grace Cole Park this spring in partnership with the Lake Forest Park Stewardship Foundation.",2020-01-10 17:53:03,,

The safety of our students and staff are always our highest priority. If we believed there was any sort of danger to any of our schools, we would act immediately and notify families of those schools.

If you or your child ever have any information on real or perceived threats, always contact our school or police department directly so that we can act accordingly.",2019-12-11 12:34:24,,

The team, coached by Dan Faires, maintained an incredible 3.87 grade point average this season. In addition to winning in the classroom, they also had a great season on the field, going 9-5 in league play and 10-9 overall.

‚ÄúShorewood athletes have an inner drive that shows in the classroom as well as on the playing field,‚Äù said Shorewood Athletic Director Joann Fukuma. ""The girls soccer team exemplifies what it means to be a successful student-athlete at Shorewood High School with focus, drive and determination to be their best selves.‚Äù

The team will accept their Academic State Championship trophy during halftime of the 3A State Championship game on Saturday, November 23 at Sparks Stadium in Puyallup.",2019-11-13 16:04:51,,

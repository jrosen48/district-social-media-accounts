How will this bond affect my taxes?
The total amount of the High School Bond request would be $55 million dollars and represent an increase of $0.94 per $1,000 of assessed value. The Board of Directors has directed the district to delay assessment of this increase due to current economic uncertainty. Taxpayers would not see this tax increase until 2022.

How do I know bond funds would be spent on these projects?
If the measure passes, funds could only be used for projects approved by voters. Additionally, an independent citizen-led Bond Oversight Committee would be established to oversee the use of bond funds and regular, independent audits will be conducted.

The total amount of the High School Bond request would be $55 million dollars and represent an increase of $0.94 per $1,000 of assessed value. The Board of Directors has directed the district to delay assessment of this increase due to current economic uncertainty. Taxpayers would not see this tax increase until 2022.

How do I know bond funds would be spent on these projects?
If the measure passes, funds could only be used for projects approved by voters. Additionally, an independent citizen-led Bond Oversight Committee would be established to oversee the use of bond funds and regular, independent audits will be conducted.

As a classroom teacher, Nicole Andrehsen, has been willing to provide whatever each student needs whether it is flexible scheduling or implementing a new strategy. She greets all her students each morning with a smile and gives challenging students a fresh start after calming breaks. Nicole has been known to swing on the playground, turn on music, and to even dance with students to break a behavior cycle. Most importantly, she has helped all her students know that each individual is an important part of the classroom community. Columbia City Elementary is proud to have Nicole as one of its staff members.

Laurie has always taken hundreds of photos at sporting and school events and makes them easily available for free to the community. She is always there for students to lean on and even goes above her job description of supplying students in need with food and essentials for life.

He wants to be the best he can be in and out of the classroom, helping with his younger sisters and being very involved in sports. I can always count on Gavin to ask ""why"" or ""can you explain this to me?"" to deepen his understanding.

I knew as soon as my daughter enjoyed going to middle school that there had to be a special teacher behind all of this. Mrs. Massey goes above and beyond to make all of her students enjoy their time at school. She breathes life into my daughter and makes her feel like she is an important part of the middle school puzzle.

Mrs. Massey goes out of her way to talk to my daughter and is creating a very special bond between teacher and student. I am positive that this bond will last a lifetime. Whenever we have met with her, she has a smile that lights up a room on her face and a friendly ‘hello’ for all who cross her path. Its teachers like these who deserve the world! They are the ones that put passion into our students and give them something to model after.

Thank you, Mrs. Massey, for being an amazing role model to not just my daughter but to all of your students. Thank you for giving her a place where she fits in! St. Helens Middle School is lucky to have you!

She is known to go over and beyond for her students and invests so much of her heart and time into each and every one of her kids.

Her heartfelt approach with her students is contagious. She has always taken the time to truly see the inner needs of each one of her students and works with each one individually to make sure they are succeeding to their fullest potential.

Her classroom is a place where kids can feel safe and want to learn. She always makes sure her student's basic needs are met first, that their stomachs are full, they are well-rested, they feel emotionally safe and that they feel they are in a trusted safe place before diving into learning which is crucial for any successful classroom.

Bridgett is constantly going above and beyond for the students in her classroom and kids in our school and community. She comes to work early and leaves late, as many teachers do. She has a calm exterior that radiates to the students and staff around her. The world could be in turmoil and Bridgett would quietly and efficiently bring peace to all. She is unstoppable with endless energy, kind words, and encouragement for everyone. I am in awe of how much she does and how much love she has to give. Bridgett gives so much support to her colleagues and is always willing to help another student or teacher in need. McBride and all of Columbia County are lucky to have such an amazing leader in the community.

Mrs. Rhoades has been an amazing help in navigating the Special Education Program at St. Helens Middle School. I was a little nervous about all the changes that occur when going from elementary school to middle school, but she made it effortless. Her caring attitude towards my child, as well as the other students in her classes, is evident in everything she does. She gave my child the confidence he needed to succeed, and he is now excelling in mainstream classes. She is fantastic and my family could never thank her enough for all that she does.

Ms. Rhonda Larson is an exceptional middle school teacher and takes the time to reach out to each student individually to create a learning plan that fosters each student’s success. Rhonda has been an incredibly motivating and encouraging teacher for my daughter this year. Middle school is a time of change, growth, discovery, and challenges. It makes such a difference to have a teacher that sees your child as an individual with the potential for great things.

Crystal Briggs is an advisor to our yearly Literature Journal that takes an entire year to assemble. She is also the advisor and grant writer for our Slamboo Team, which is a team of spoken word students who compete against other schools around the Portland area. The funding for the league is obtained through the lengthy grant she has to write each year.

Along with those two time-consuming efforts, Crystal organizes a trip to Washington D.C. for 7th and 8th graders which requires numerous fundraisers, parent meetings, and general logistical wizardry.

Of course, all of this is in addition to her full-time job of teaching 8th-grade Humanities and being part of our AVID site team. If any teacher deserves a “Tire-Less” award, it is Crystal Briggs.

As part of developing that plan, the district engaged in listening sessions during which participants reflected on specific questions to build a plan that was reflective of our community's wants and needs. In the spirit of continued responsiveness and transparency, the St. Helens School District has scheduled four additional listening sessions with Superintendent Stockwell. The listening sessions are designed to be open-ended without an agenda so that the community may provide feedback about what is going well in the district and what are challenges to overcome.

We hope that you are able to find the time to join us at Columbia City Elementary for the second of four district listening sessions.

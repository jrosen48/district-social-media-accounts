Reminder to parents of students who will be starting kindergarten in the fall of 2020 at Sidney Public Schools ... registration is open on our website www.sidneyraiders.org (you will see a link to register for kindergarten) on that page, you will find a link to upload documents. Uploading your student's birth certificate and/or immunizations now will save you time in the fall. Simply take a photo on your phone and upload it today. The files go directly into a folder that is only seen by SPS employees that need to see the information. Please take the time to fill out our registration and health information when you can and don't forget the ability to upload documents directly to us is an additional time saver. I am including a link to upload the documents below and if you still need to register, please visit our school website - www.sidneyraiders.org

""Being a 12 sport athlete has taught me to be a better person, a stronger leader and a more confident role model. Sports has taught me time management and that education extends beyond the classroom. The support I’ve received in the past four years from teammates and Sidney High School is incredible! Being a 12 sport athlete has given me the opportunity to make countless memories and experiences that I can draw from over and over in life. Being able to be a 12 sport athlete has been a blessing and I would not trade the past 4 years for anything!

The one quote I have lived by since I can remember, is something my mom has always told me, ""It's not what you did or said, it's how you did it or said it."" I did it with pride and I did it with all my heart.""

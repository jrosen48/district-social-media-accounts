It was a great learning experience, as Diego had to face many new challenges on the Austin course that our desert golfer had not faced before. Diego said, ‚ÄúI learned so much that I can bring back to my team that I think will take us all to the state competition next year.‚Äù Diego had to develop new strategies on the spot to deal with the multitude of trees, high heat and humidity and rain. Coach Elo said, ‚ÄúDiego learned about strategy, about when to give up on a ball and take the stroke on a drop and how to shoot a 3-wood punch shot.‚Äù Even through the new experiences, Diego maintained great composure and ended the two day tournament in the top half of the field scoring a 192. Congratulations, Diego, on your fine performance!",2019-05-23 12:51:20,,

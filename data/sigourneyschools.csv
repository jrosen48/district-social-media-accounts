The inspiration behind this idea, actually came from neighboring and other fire departments!

We know that kids are stuck at home due to the COVID-19 outbreak. But SFD would like to make the best of it and try to brighten a young ones day!

If you have a little one that is celebrating a birthday, and who would like a little light show with some sirens, let us know! We will arrange a time to drive a fire truck or two to your house to put on the best light show we can offer! We will wish your young one a happy birthday, in a social distancing kind of way, to help lift their spirits!

Parents,

I have temporarily set up a skills account for each student to work on during this time. The lessons will review topics that we have learned in class, as well as dig deeper into upcoming lessons. We were each at a great ""break-point"", having just completed a unit and ready for the next unit. When we return to school, I will pick up where we left off.

Feel free to contact me through email, as I will be checking my messages daily.

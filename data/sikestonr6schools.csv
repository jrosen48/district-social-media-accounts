I was able to space them 3 or more feet apart measuring from the legs of one desk to the legs of another desk. Each desk has at least 3 feet of space in front, behind, to the left and the right.
When students are seated at their desks following social distancing they will not be required to wear a mask. When we work in small groups or with a partner, however, we will wear masks. There is no way to give an amount of minutes they will wear or not wear a mask. There will be an amount of time students will work in their individual space each day and there will be time they will work in groups or with a partner during the school day.

I understand the different perspectives on reopening our schools. I also understand the plans we make for reopening schools may not please everyone.

We hope you and your family are doing well and staying safe, while returning to some sort of normalcy.

Sikeston R-6 has made plans to reopen the school district gradually, keeping in mind the need to protect our staff as well as our patrons. Throughout this gradual reopening, we ask that everyone continues social distancing procedures.

Beginning next Monday, May 11, all offices will be staffed from 8am -3pm to take phone calls. We will still not open to the public just yet. If you need information or need to make plans to pick up or drop off something, please call the school to which this applies.

Beginning the week of May 18th, we begin our district savings schedule, with the entire district being closed on Fridays.

Beginning June 1, if all goes as planned, we want Sikeston R-6 to go back to normal. We will then open to the public.

We want to thank everyone for being patient and willing to provide alternative solutions to every day school business to safeguard our staff, students, and patrons of the school district.

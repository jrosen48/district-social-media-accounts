We have all become accustomed to the quickly changing landscape of the school and activities environment. We are currently in a situation where there have been a few positive cases of COVID-19 in the district. Due to our requirement to contact trace we are in a situation where the majority of our high school football staff, and possibly some high school football athletes will need to quarantine following the KDHE guidelines.

If your high school football athlete needs to quarantine you will be notified tomorrow.

This will require us to postpone our high school football season for the next two weeks and focus on making sure we are all healthy and ready to return to the field safely for the remainder of the season.

All other fall activities will continue as scheduled.

We continue to monitor all students and coaching/teaching staff very closely and at this time we are not aware of any new cases in the district.

Given the restrictions we are currently operating under there is no possible way to hold Graduation ceremonies in May unless it was done virtually. We are cautiously optimistic that by moving Graduation for the class of 2020 to Saturday, July 25th, at 11:00 AM, it will increase the likelihood that some of the social gathering restrictions will be relaxed and we will be able to hold Graduation ceremonies. While we hope that those ceremonies are more traditional in nature, we must be prepared to adjust the ceremonies to meet any social distancing requirements and crowd size limitations that we are operating under at that time. Considering the Senior class size, the limited staff required to conduct a graduation ceremony, the ability to adjust the location (outside if needed) we are hopeful that gives us the flexibility we need to provide our 2020 Graduates with a ceremony that allows them to experience Graduation together.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=4357471880945735&id=214480058578292,,0.0,"2020 High School Commencement Ceremony Re-Scheduled.

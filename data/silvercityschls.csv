ParentSquare will replace School Messenger, Class Dojo, Remind, ClassTag, and various other apps throughout the district to help ensure parents aren't switching between multiple platforms. Parents should expect to receive invitation emails from ParentSquare in the upcoming week. More features will be added as students are scheduled into their classes.

La Plata Middle School is an ""Offer vs Serve"" School. Students are offered 5 components for lunch and must take at least 3, which must include a fruit or vegetable.

silverschools.org",3.0,"Recently an incomplete picture of a food service tray from La Plata Middle School was posted on Facebook. La Plata Middle School is an ""Offer vs Serve"" School. Students are offered 5 components for lunch and must take at least 3, which must include a fruit or vegetable. One of the new items in all of our schools this year is a Fresh Veggie Bar which contains fresh vegetables with ranch dip and sometimes peanut butter. This option is a ""serve yourself"" option which the kids can help themselves and take as much as they will eat. Along with this, canned and fresh fruit choices are available at each school every day. These options are picked up or chosen after a student moves through the lunch line and proceeds to the seating areas.

The Decker family of Silver Creek Central School District made cookies and brownies for staff members working at Absolute Care Nursing and Rehab Center in East Aurora. 🍪

Amy Seavy, a parent of a Kindergartner in the district, is among those working on the front lines at the nursing home. The treats were a gesture of appreciation for all the hard work Ms. Seavy and her co-workers are putting in during the pandemic shutdown.

The 2020 Pi Day Celebration at Silver Creek Elementary School held recently (Friday, March 13, 2020) was a hit! Pi Day is an annual celebration of the mathematical constant π (pi) and is observed March 14th or 3/14. since 3, 1, and 4 are the first three digits of pi.

Students in Pre-Kindergarten through fifth grade had the opportunity to buy one to three pies for $1 each to throw at SCES staff volunteers! All proceeds will be used for a future Elementary Math Night! Students threw a total of 562 whipped-cream pies!

Thank you to all the staff who helped make the fun experience possible for our kids and to this year’s volunteers: Mrs. Giampaolo, Mrs. Zbytek, Mrs. Near, Miss Bromsted, Deputy Johnson, Mrs. Austin, Mrs. Gould, Miss Sanford, Mrs. Anderson, Mrs. Sills, Miss D’Amaro, Mrs. Johnson, Mrs. Chesbro, and Miss Conner.

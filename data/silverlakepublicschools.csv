We are aware of changes to the Nutrition program for neighboring districts. I am working with NDE Nutrition Services on Silver Lake Schools eligibility for the program.

The program is Sponsored by the USDA and is allowing districts to provide free meals to all Preschool through Grade 12 enrolled students. This would include Breakfast and Lunch. This would not include - extra milk or second servings.

Once I have more information to share I will be in contact. If accepted these changes would be retroactive to September 1st and all lunches charged for the month of September would be refunded to the students' account. Meals purchased in August would not be included in this program.

Thank you for your patience as we work through this process,

Planning your Planter!! You should choose a Thriller, Spiller and Filler. Lots of different interpretations of these are out there. This combo works great, however, you could also do a nice combination of Sun Coleus that will turn out beautifully. Don't be afraid to mix in Perennials to your Planters- nice choices are Coral Bells, Hostas, Grasses, Pugster Buddleia, etc. Another great addition would be to use a tropical plant such as a Bird of Paradise, Banana, Tropical Hibiscus, or other fun choices. I am including some great pictures of different large planters I have found over the years. Let your creative juices get flowing!!! Don't be afraid to ""step outside the box"" of your regular choices. Find colors, shapes and textures that you like and go wild!! (This will apply to all sales available)",0.0,"Janet's Jungle, Inc

Perennials are more popular than ever. Perennials will come back year after year eliminating the need to replant. That being said, perennials do not have long bloom periods with which to give us viewing pleasure throughout the spring, summer and fall. You can, however, plant different perennials in order to get interest and blooms throughout the summer. Perennials are a great addition for a ""pop"" of color, texture or appearance to any patio planter where you just want a little something different. Great additions to your Annual Patio Planters would be Hostas, Coral Bells, Grasses, and even Roses. All plants featured will not necessarily be available on all sales options.",0.0,"Janet's Jungle, Inc

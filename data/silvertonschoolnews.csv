We will be utilizing the home bleachers for students with additional student viewing locations around the track and on the field. Parents and family members are welcome to attend, however we would request that families remain in cars or near your vehicles around the track and will have the visitor stands available for any guests, just know that the cheerleaders will be facing the home stands.
We know that this is non-traditional and hope we can all enjoy a spirited pep-rally in the midst of COVID19.

The Seniors have missed a lot this year from the homecoming snake and bonfire due to weather as well as their Easter egg hunt, Senior Luncheons, Red & White banquet, UIL events, etc. We will be preceding our graduation with a ""Senior Snake"" parade to begin at the High School around 6:00 pm on Friday and winding the streets according to the map shown on this post. We would encourage families on the route to set up chairs, make signs and make some noise as our graduates drive by. For community members and families wishing to get a view, we would simply ask that you find a location on the route that still permits the ""Snake"" safe travel and cheer them on.

In addition, a power pole snapped, branches are down, and power lines are in the street by George O. Barr Elementary.

1. When students open their Chromebook, there should be a picture with their name and a spot for their username.

2. Next to their name is an arrow. Click the arrow.

3. There should be an option to remove or delete the user. Choose this option.

4. Have the student add a user.

5. They will then log in with their email ending in .com. Their password should be the same.

1. When students open their Chromebook, there should be a picture with their name and a spot for their username.

2. Next to their name is an arrow. Click the arrow.

3. There should be an option to remove or delete the user. Choose this option.

4. Have the student add a user.

5. They will then log in with their email ending in .com. Their password should be the same.

This should solve the problem. If you are still having problems, please let me know. Thank you for your patience during this transition.

We hope you are all doing well and miss you! Have a great day!",2020-04-28 13:22:49,,

On Tuesday, February 18th, UTHS is hosting a Parent Night. The event begins at 7:00 pm. Information will be sent home with the students.
The 8th grade students will be taking a tour of UTHS on Monday, February 24th. The bus will take the students to UTHS and the school counselors from UTHS will lead the tour. The students will have their pictures taken for their school ID as well. The students will also get materials to create their class schedules for next year.
The UTHS school counselors will meet with our students individually the following week to review and collect their schedules. The official schedules will be mailed home from UTHS in May.

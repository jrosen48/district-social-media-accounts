We know how disappointed our Seniors must be to have their last year of high school end this way. We want you to know how proud we are of your accomplishments. In an effort to celebrate you this Spring, the district has purchased these 2020 graduate signs and vehicle flags for you to proudly display. Your school will be in touch with distribution information, as soon as they arrive. We do not have a confirmed plan at this point about any type of graduation, but your schools are currently collecting ideas and developing a plan.

I’m back!! Today I am advocating with my tri-county colleagues for students.

I have some big news for Simi Valley residents. Last week I was in San Francisco with my colleague, Ron Todo, to lobby a credit rating agency to give our district an upgrade in credit rating. We found out today that our efforts were successful. SVUSD has received its 3rd upgrade in 5 years. Over the life of our bond, these efforts will have saved or avoided over 20 million in tax liability to the residents of Simi Valley. This is evidence that our fiscal position is much improved and that we are working hard to protect the tax payers in Simi Valley who have been so generous in their support of school bond measures. Kudos to our staff and School Board for their hard work over the years to earn these upgrades. Super proud today!",2.0,"We are doing good things!

Simms Parents

Can I get parents or adults that will volunteer to help with working the volleyball games or football games?

Volleyball games need three volunteers
JR. High and JV football games need 10 volunteers
High School games need minimum 15 volunteers

At this point I have certain parents working the majority of the games. I understand about work schedules and their daily lives but if each parent from JR. High to High School who has a child in sports or band volunteer to work just one game would make a huge difference.

Money raised by the concession stands is used for the Sports Department as well as Band activities. The sports banquet as well as scholarships are also provided by the Booster Club.

I would like to thank Siloam Baptist Church who brought a group of workers to Friday night’s football game. Thank y’all for your time.

Inbox me if you would like to volunteer. You can check the schedules at Simms Isd page for all games.

Pirate football field ready for tonight game against Union Grove. In the two end zone pictures we painted 9 lines in each end zone. The 9 lines added together equals 18 which is Scotty’s age. Each painted line is 30 degrees which represents Scottie’s jersey number. Pass the word around so the fans will know the importance of the end zone lines. Each Senior football player painted the lines.",7.0,"In our endzones this evening you may notice some diagonal lines.

Now more than ever, it’s crucial to check in on the state of your student’s mental health - as well as your own! Social, emotional learning is a critical component of a child’s development. The Sioux Falls School District is proud to offer a strong SEL curriculum beginning as soon as pre-K. We encourage our families to continue the mental health conversation in the home as well. If you have any concerns about your child’s mental well-being, counselors are available at each of our schools. Please don’t hesitate to contact them with any questions or concerns.

Equally as important as our students’ mental health is our employees’ well-being. Teaching and working in our schools is no easy feat during this unprecedented time. If you work for the District, please remember, there are counseling services options available to you and your family members at no cost.

The 24th Public School Proud Grant (and the largest award this year) goes to Mikaela Haskell and Megan Hannemann at Hawthorne Elementary! They received $9,126.96 for their grant, “Dashing to Success.” They will purchase Dash robotics kits, sketch pads, and iPads that can be used by the 400+ students in their building. Dash robotics kits will allow students to work collaboratively with one another to dive deeper into topics discussed in the classroom. Through the engineering process, students will get the chance to make mistakes, troubleshoot, and collaborate on a solution. As students develop their coding skills, they will program the robots to draw on a whiteboard, throw objects to measure distance, and play xylophones to demonstrate musical knowledge. Thank you to Sanford Health, Raven Industries, and Verizon for making these grants possible! #PublicSchoolProud",0.0,"Have you been following along with the Sioux Falls Public Schools Education Foundation in recent weeks?

**Adopt•A•Senior**

Sunnyvale Moms, thank you for your patience as SHS manages the best way to assure each senior receives recognition. After some discussion, it has been decided that SHS will head up the Adopt A Senior program for our 2020 Seniors. However, we cannot make this successful without your help and donations. An account has been set up at the SISD Administration building, 417 E Tripp Road, and we would welcome any donations, in the form of cash or check. If you have an item you would like to donate to our 140 Seniors, please feel free to contact me at Raquel.banno@sunnyvaleisd.com. We will begin the distributions on May 8 and continuing on, each Friday, through the end of May. We hope you will help SHS make every senior’s dream come true! I look forward to working with you all.

Using Google Meet but want to see the faces of all your students? Easy fix! Download the “Google Met Grid Extension”. Then, when you create a Meet, the grey grid/window below will be added to your video screen permenatly. Select it during a meet and there you go. Easy peasy!

Why you might use Meet vs Zoom?
-Zoom is hackable and not as secure.
-Meet allows for any length of meeting and up to 250 people in attendance.
-If your school/district uses Google Suite, it embedded seamlessly.

Hello Intermediate Raider families!! I miss you all so much! As you have heard, we will be kicking off our At-Home Learning on Monday. To get a jump start here are two things that are happening and that you can check at home:

1. Homeroom teachers will be calling parents today through Friday to ask you a few questions to help us in our preparations. Be advised the number may say “unknown”,but that is probably your teacher 😊

2. Make sure your student can access their email if you have access to technology. Students will need their email over the next two weeks.

I’ll be posting a lot more information soon!

As you have heard, we will be kicking off our At-Home Learning on Monday. To get a jump start here are two things that are happening and that you can check at home:

1. Homeroom teachers will be calling parents today through Friday to ask you a few questions to help us in our preparations. Be advised the number may say “unknown”,but that is probably your teacher 😊

2. Make sure your student can access their email if you have access to technology. Students will need their email over the next two weeks.

I’ll be posting a lot more information soon!

2. Take up money and food donations at your book club, small group, sporting events, and Sunday school class.

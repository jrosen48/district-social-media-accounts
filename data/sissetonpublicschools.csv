- Tuesday October 1st from 4:00pm 5:30pm at Westside Elementary School.
- Wednesday October 2nd from 3:30-5pm at MS/HS Multipurpose Room.

The Department of Health offers seasonal influenza vaccine for children aged 6 months through 18 years. Influenza vaccination helps protect children from the flu and its complications and decreases the spread of influenza in the community, as children are often the biggest spreaders of the disease to adults and other children.

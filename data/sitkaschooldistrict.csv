Let’s do a quick review of everyday Hygiene, as prevention is critical when it comes to concern over the Coronavirus.

~ Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds,… Before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing…
~ Clean and Disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using regular household cleaning spray or wipe.
~ Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
~ Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
~ Stay home when you are sick
~ Cover your cough, cover your sneeze.

CDC DOES recommend using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol IF soap and water are not readily available.

~ Students need to be fever free for 24 hours before returning to school, so if a student has a fever, then no school the next day.

* WASH YOUR HANDS*

Classes are multi-grade, teaching students students a wide range of skills and abilities (including cooking impressive meals through the Fish to School Program).

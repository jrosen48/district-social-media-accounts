Our hope is to get youth more engaged in expressive and creative activities during this pandemic, and to consider healthy ways in which they can take care of themselves. With a strong focus on mental wellness, we hope that this art contest will strengthen protective factors which will aid in youth substance use prevention while youth are stuck at home. We'll be offering prizes (TBD) to three youth -- one from each age group (10-13, 14-17, and 18-21).

What I miss most about our wonderful Sizer community is the way each one of us connected and grew so close to one another. Our bonds have become tightly woven together and not seeing each other has been a real struggle. I especially enjoyed spending time with my friends, talking with them and laughing with them about silly things. I also loved being in the classroom with my awesome teachers, who have always been kind and gracious with their attitude, work/assignments, and have always worked their hardest. Above all, our Sizer community is loving, and cares for each student, accepting them for who they are

Thank you so much for sharing, Audrey. And thank you Camden S. for sharing this Seuss inspired creation.

Today, Sizer School seniors presented their Senior Products to peers, faculty and community leaders during Sizer School's Annual event.

The Senior Class of 2020 has done everything from organizing fundraisers, to creating theater art workshops to improve mental health. Our seniors have put on sporting events that brought our community together, run advocacy campaigns that helped raise awareness for health & education programs and so much more. Today they got a chance to show off their work and inspire their peers who will one day have to do a senior project of their own.

Special thanks goes out to the over 30 Community Leaders that attended today's event and thank you to our Sizer Stringers 8th grade student Bailey Mulrenan and 9th grade student Dominic Gionet for helping photograph all of the activity we had going on today at school!

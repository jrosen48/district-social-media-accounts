This week's episode is about: ""Protection Methods: part 1""

""The Talk"" podcast was created by Sizer School Health Teacher Sneha Verelst and features topics for students, prepared by students.

This project began last year and required students to come up with a topic of interest with an essential question, plan out a podcast with a claim, evidence and a conclusion, write a script for their episode and record the episode on iPads using GarageBand.

More episodes will be released weekly until all episodes are live.

""The Talk"" podcast was created by Sizer School Health Teacher Sneha Verelst and features topics for students, prepared by students.

This project began last year and required students to come up with a topic of interest with an essential question, plan out a podcast with a claim, evidence and a conclusion, write a script for their episode and record the episode on iPads using GarageBand.

More episodes will be released weekly until all episodes are live.

There is a section for your school counselor to complete so please be sure to be in touch with Ms. Currallo should you need a signature.

Mount Wachusett's application for dual enrollment can be found at https://mwcc.edu/academics/k-12/programs/dualenrollment/. Again, please contact Ms. Currallo with questions: Currallol@sizerschool.org.

The priority deadline for Mount Wachusett is June 30th and the deadline for FSU is July 20th.

Next week is our final week for home deliveries, and we will be working with folks to get set up with additional resources as needed. If anyone is in a position to help, we could definitely use any/all of the following: cereal, granola bars, pasta sauce, snacks (crackers, pretzels, popcorn), fruit cups, macaroni and cheese, canned chicken/tuna, baking mixes (people always seem to love the brownie mixes), and rice.

The photos below show a regular Monday delivery as well as an example of what gets dropped off each week.

LUK Prevention virtual art contest: ""How I stay mentally well during physical distancing""
LUK is asking Central MA youth ages 10-21 to submit artwork based on the theme ""How I stay mentally well during physical distancing"". Our hope is to get youth more engaged in expressive and creative activities during this pandemic, and to consider healthy ways in which they can take care of themselves. With a strong focus on mental wellness, we hope that this art contest will strengthen protective factors which will aid in youth substance use prevention while youth are stuck at home. We'll be offering prizes (TBD) to three youth -- one from each age group (10-13, 14-17, and 18-21).

What I miss most about our wonderful Sizer community is the way each one of us connected and grew so close to one another. Our bonds have become tightly woven together and not seeing each other has been a real struggle. I especially enjoyed spending time with my friends, talking with them and laughing with them about silly things. I also loved being in the classroom with my awesome teachers, who have always been kind and gracious with their attitude, work/assignments, and have always worked their hardest. Above all, our Sizer community is loving, and cares for each student, accepting them for who they are

Thank you so much for sharing, Audrey. And thank you Camden S. for sharing this Seuss inspired creation.

Today, Sizer School seniors presented their Senior Products to peers, faculty and community leaders during Sizer School's Annual event.

The Senior Class of 2020 has done everything from organizing fundraisers, to creating theater art workshops to improve mental health. Our seniors have put on sporting events that brought our community together, run advocacy campaigns that helped raise awareness for health & education programs and so much more. Today they got a chance to show off their work and inspire their peers who will one day have to do a senior project of their own.

Special thanks goes out to the over 30 Community Leaders that attended today's event and thank you to our Sizer Stringers 8th grade student Bailey Mulrenan and 9th grade student Dominic Gionet for helping photograph all of the activity we had going on today at school!

Tropical Storm Sally is projected to make landfall sometime Tuesday morning as a possible Category 1 Hurricane. St. John Parish is currently under Hurricane, Storm Surge and Flash Flood Watches. Periods of heavy rainfall, strong winds and coastal flooding remain the greatest threats through Thursday.

Parish President Hotard would like to encourage residents to complete all hurricane preparations before the weekend ends as conditions could start to deteriorate as early as Monday afternoon. Residents can assist with potential heavy rainfall and winds by clearing and unclogging drains and catch basins around homes and securing garbage cans and other loose debris.

Parish crews are out working, checking drainage and utilities systems and will be throughout the remainder of the event.

STEM-ulating: Elkhorn educator honored

When Elkhorn Elementary School teacher Hank Chau was visited by his principal and representatives from the San Joaquin County Office of Education in his classroom Tuesday morning, he thought they were there only to film him teaching science, technology, engineering and mathematics curriculum.
Little did he know, though, they were visiting to present him with the Albert Brocchini Memorial STEM Teacher of the Year award.
Brett States, the STEM Director with the SJCOE, presented Chau with a plaque as he conducted a Zoom session with his 10:30 a.m. class. Nominated by his eighth grade students Caden Cao and Haroon Abdulgader, Chau said it was all the students he teaches that made the award special.

The 2020-21 school year marks the fifth year that Mavis has taught preschool-autism classes at McFall School in Manteca. 🏫 When asked what Mavis loves most about teaching, she stated, “I love seeing each student learn something new, no matter how big or small the skill, whether it’s sitting during circle time for a whole song or simply giving a high five upon request.”

Mavis chose a career in education because she genuinely enjoys helping and nurturing others. 🧡 Plus, working with children keeps her on her toes! Per Mavis, the best part about working at McFall is the wonderful students and awesome staff.

A fun fact that students and colleagues might not know about Mavis is that she has a swimming pool but doesn’t know how to swim unless you count doggy paddling! 😉",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3243678345692488&id=107268869333467,,0.0,"Please join us in congratulating Mavis Thomas, the August 2020 Special Education Programs Educator of the Month! 🎉

Learn to integrate API into your web project!
Have you ever wondered how other sites interact with big name sites like Google, Facebook, or Pinterest? Maybe you want information or functionality from those other sites have but don't have time to build it yourself.

Well, in some cases, API's help you do this. A lot of functionality can be pulled into your website with a few lines of code creating a simple API call.

Mark Hypolite will be demonstrating ""JavaScript Fetch API"", a library native to JavaScript that allow you to communicate with any available API. During this presentation he will give a brief overview about what an API is and how they can be used and he will give you a quick peek into API code.

There were no shortage of smiles from the children, their families, and Venture staff. Anthony and his sister Genesis beamed after they had their chance to hurl the balloons. Genesis said she was smiling for two reasons. The first was because she hit her target. The second was because she got to see people from the school she missed. ""I'm happy,"" the first-grader said.",2020-05-20 21:47:00,,

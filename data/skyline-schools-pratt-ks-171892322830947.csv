Let the officials do their job and let’s do ours of supporting our team. In all my years, I’ve never seen an official change their call because the crowd complains. If anything, it works against our team and doesn’t represent the school well. Let’s bring home a State Championship AND a KSHSAA Sportsmanship Award for Skyline! Good luck to the coaches and team this week. We are all super proud of you!

I hope that everyone is enjoying your last few weeks of summer. I am super excited to start the year!

Just a reminder to all to parents and guardians that all Preschool, Kindergarten, 7th grade, and 11th graders have immunization requirements before starting school this year.
If you have questions regarding your student please contact the health department at 672-4135 or me at 672-5651/ email: hmckennon@skylineschools.org. I will also be at enrollment Monday and Tuesday if you need to visit with me about anything.

Medication forms are available online again this year. Your student will need a form signed if you wish to keep prescription or non prescription medications in the health office. If your child needs to carry their own medication you will need to fill out the self administration form and return it to the school. This includes cough drops and over the counter medications.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2690283950991759&id=171892322830947,,0.0,"Notes from the nurse:

As we release our 2019-2020 school supply lists, we remain committed to our ongoing partnership with our families. Skyline will again purchase a majority of the typical school supplies in bulk and provide those for your students. Supply lists will be available on our website this Friday, July 12th. They will also be available at our local Wal-Mart.

Students will still be required to wear tennis shoes to PE. However, if your elementary student opts to wear tennis shoes daily, they can simply wear those shoes for PE. Children who wear sandals, boots, etc will still need to bring a pair of tennis shoes to keep at school. Again, PE shoes to keep at school are not required if your child wears tennis shoes daily.

We hope you are having a fantastic summer break. We are looking forward to having all of our students back in the building on August 27th. If you have any questions or concerns, please let us know!

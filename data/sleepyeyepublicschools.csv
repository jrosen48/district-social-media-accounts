2020 Fall Planning Survey",2.0,"Minnesota School Fall Planning Survey for the 2020-21 school year.

The Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) wants to know how distance learning worked for you or your family in the spring of 2020. We want to know what went well and what schools should do differently if they use distance learning again in the future. This information will be shared with schools through guidance created by MDE.

This survey is for parents and families of Minnesota students.

We look forward to hearing from you.

The survey is available here in English, Hmong, Somali, and Spanish.

We received two school related directives from Governor Waltz.

First, he placed a Shelter in Home directive for the State of Minnesota from Friday March 27th through Friday April 10th.

Second, the Governor directed school districts to start executing our distance learning plan from Monday March 30 through Thursday April 30th. Teachers will need to be in the building on Friday May 1st and May 4th to start the transitioning process back to school. At this time his plan is to have students return on May 5th.

Stay Safe!!

Mr. Domeier and his custodial staff are working to ensure the common areas and classrooms are sprayed down daily to help from any germs spreading. We ask our families to review basic hand-washing, coughing into the inside elbow, and other techniques to minimize the risk of transmitting any kind of virus. We also ask that families do their best to keep their children home when they are sick, for the duration of the illness. As conditions continue to develop, we will take the guidance of the Department of Health and the CDC and MDE, and will keep you informed to the best of our ability.

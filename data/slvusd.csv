Thrill the World.jpeg
Rehearsals
When: Thursdays: Oct.3 and Oct. 17 and Fridays Oct. 11 and Oct. 25 from 3:00-4:00pm
Where: Multipurpose Room on the District Office (Quail Hollow) campus
No need to sign up ahead of time. Just show up.

This event was founded in 2006 in Toronto, and has now spread to six continents. Every October people in cities around the world dance to ""Thriller"" at exactly the same time. Preparation and counting down worldwide is part of the fun, but the feeling of being connected to others and dancing together as one is a Thrill like no other! This year the event will be held in Santa Cruz on Saturday, October 26, 2018 at the Louden Nelson Center lawn at 3pm sharp. There is also an option to perform in a flashmob on Halloween in Ben Lomond.

PHONES DOWN AT DISTRICT OFFICE
Please read - important news
Due to a scheduled PG&E Power Outage, the SLV District Office and tri-campus do not have phones for Monday, July 29th.
Please excuse the fact that the District Office phones are saying that they have been disconnected. It is because we have a VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) phone system and when the internet is disrupted due to power outages, etc., we lose our phone system. We do have the capability of plugging a single phone into our fax machine (land line), however, it would operate using our fax machine phone number and many of you would probably not think to call in to us using that number.

Please accept our apologies. Because it is still summer time, we did not think many community members would be trying to contact us. We should be back up and running smoothly tomorrow, Tuesday, July 30th.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=869440650099558&id=377392472637714,,0.0,"FYI: If we missed you today.

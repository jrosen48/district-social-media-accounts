Our district policies support this commitment as Policy JIC states the following (the term ’students’ is synonymous for all in our Sumner Community): “Students should not discriminate against other people on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, ancestry, national origin, sexual orientation or disability. Nor should students harass anyone on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, ancestry, or national origin, sexual orientation or disability. Sexual harassment is also prohibited.”

Nevertheless, we still have a plan to celebrate the accomplishments of our 8th grade scholars.

""Jayla was radiant and fierce, a great dancer, and a light in our community. She was a founding scholar that enjoyed supporting her teammates and building relationships with staff members. She taught us all to embrace our differences and be strong in the face of adversity.""

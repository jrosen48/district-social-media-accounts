ARE WE THERE YET? In 1971, Congress designated Aug. 26 as Women’s Equality Day, to commemorate the passage of women’s suffrage in the United States. The 19th Amendment was ratified Aug. 18, 1920 – 100 years ago – granting the right to vote to American women. While there is still much work to be done, we thank all who fought to get women where we are today.

Did you know that our own Sophia Smith, founder of Smith Academy and Smith College, was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, NY, in October 2000?",0.0,"Hatfield Historical Museum

TALES OF THE MILL RIVER – Gun parts, the dam and tents, oh my! Here’s a second story from Mrs. Jepson’s 5th grade class in 1995, when they were assigned to interview someone about the Mill River. David Vachula told his story to Kimberley Vachula about finding gun parts and camping out next to the river.

Anyone have a picture of THAT, or remember participating?

ONE FOR THE HISTORY BOOKS. The SA Class of 2020 graduated today, wearing the usual purple and white, and throwing their hats in the air at the end. But that’s about where the similarities ended. In addition to being held more than two months late, it was OUTSIDE, with graduates sitting on the edge of the plateau (the soccer practice field). The grads wore masks, as did the audience, at least until the program started, since each family group sitting in their assigned “bubble” was more than six feet apart. This year’s graduation speaker, history teacher Keith Lepine, noted that he hadn’t seen his students since their last day of in-person school on March 12 – nearly five MONTHS ago.

But in spite of graduating during a pandemic, many things were the same. The class speakers thanked their parents and families, teachers and administrators. They reflected on their years together, and looked ahead to what they might do in the future, in a time where so much needs doing. And afterwards, the proud parents, families and teachers were happy that their students got a graduation after all.",0.0,"Hatfield Historical Museum

DIRTY, SMELLY, LONG HOURS, NO SHADE. If that’s the summer job advertisement, what are you waiting for? That’s the warning 14-year-old Jean (Klocko) Gromacki got about working shade tobacco, but her father said it would be a good learning experience, so she did it – for three summers. Not only did the work teach her many lessons, but she also had a lot of fun because she was working with lots of other teenagers.

HEAD TO WATER OR AC! Supposed to hit 91 degrees in Hatfield today, after 6 days in the 90s in the past month (including in the Historical Museum). Makes you long for bodies of water -- like these two 21-year-old Hatfield gals from 65 years ago (1955) -- who were not escaping summer heat but winter chill, visiting Hollywood Beach, FL, at one of their family's vacation home.

Can you recognize them??

JULY 4 DIARIES. Journals, diaries, daybooks, ledgers – they all keep a record of our lives. What was life like in Hatfield 90 years ago, in the 1930s? Or even earlier, at the start of the 1800s?

Check out the July 4 diaries of Dorothy Jandzinski, who just graduated from Smith Academy (1931), and Oscar Belden, farmer, who lived on what is now Depot Road, North Hatfield (1802).

Tomorrow, the SA Class of 2020 will be receiving their diplomas, one at a time, in 10-minute increments inside the school, accompanied by up to four family members, all wearing masks. If you are one of those grads, or a family member, please consider donating a photo of yourself or your student receiving their diploma in cap and gown and MASK!

ANOTHER SPONSORED PHOTO -- this one by Museum Volunteer Wunderley Stauder. Wunderley not only worked on the Marian Billings/WWI exhibit in the Historical Museum, but she found an article online that described and pictured the Vierzon, France, Red Cross Canteen where Marian worked during the war. It is the ONLY PHOTO we’ve seen of where Marian worked, and we now have a copy, courtesy of the Minnesota Historical Society, and of Wunderley, who funded its purchase.

We’ve added the photo to our WWI exhibit (see below), but you’ll have to wait to see it in person until it’s deemed safe for the museum to reopen. Thanks, Wunderley!

It’s also a great article, and you can check it out here:

HATFIELD TOBACCO STORIES – WE WANT YOURS! We’ve just launched a website for a new project during Hatfield’s 350th anniversary year. With 150+ years of tobacco farming on as much as 2,000 acres in the past, it has come down to just a few family farms keeping the tradition alive. We don’t want to wait any longer to capture the stories and pictures of working in Hatfield tobacco fields and shops.

Check out the website and please share with anyone you know who worked tobacco in Hatfield, or was from Hatfield and worked in a neighboring town. Then send us your stories!

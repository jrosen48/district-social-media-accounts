HERE WE GO...
After a brief 6 month hiatus, let's get our first Bryan Jenkins State Farm Athlete of the Week for the 2020-2021 school year, WESLEY MORRISON some major recognition.

Wesley, a Sr. Smith-Cotton Tiger Soccer Goalie (and kicker for the Football team) is starting off the soccer season on fire. Last week against Helias, Wesley had to run to the opposite end of the field to break the 1-1 score with a game winning PK for the Tiger 2-1 victory. Last Friday, Wesley shut out Osage and perfectly placed another PK for the Tiger 2-0 win. Currently Wesley (goalie) is tied for highest scorer on the Smith-Cotton team.

When not excelling on the field, Wesley ranks 4th academically in his class and will either attend SFCC to take advantage of the A+ program OR pursue an Aerospace Engineering degree at a major university...""if the right scholarship comes along.""

Congrats, Wesley, We are proud of your accomplishments and drive. Best of luck in all you do!!!

SC had a tough 1st half as we struggled to defend the 3 point line. The 2nd half was a whole other story as the boys battled and forced many turnovers to our score Rock Bridge 21-10 in the 3rd quarter. SC was able to cut the lead all the way to 6 in the 4th but was unable to keep the momentum. Our season ends with a record of 13-13.

After day 1 of the MSHSAA State Championships, we have the following updates:

In the girls division, Kali's season has come to an end. But what a season! A 22-6 record with a district championship is nothing to hang our head about. We have a process and a plan. Kali will be back for a senior campaign- and she will be ready.

In Class 4 Boys, Jackson dropped his first round match to 2019 State Runner Up, Stegall from Northwest Cedar Hill - the number 1 ranked wrestler at 220 pounds this year. Jackson returned to the Wrestlebacks and posted a well-wrestled 5-1 decision over Fort Zumwalt North opponent.

He will wrestle tomorrow, hoping to earn an opportunity in the medal rounds.

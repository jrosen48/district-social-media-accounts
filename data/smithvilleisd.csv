Dear Smithville ISD Community,

Smithville administrative staff are continuing to work on the back to school plan. Things are changing on a daily basis. The plan is being developed based on guidance given by the Governor of Texas, Texas Education Agency, Commissioner of Education, and Bastrop County local health authorities. The Commissioner of Education plans to provide updated information to superintendents today. At this time the district is not ready to release a plan as we evaluate guidance provided by state and local health authorities. We are currently reviewing our start of school date and revisions to the academic calendar. The plan will include district and state guidelines for the virtual learning environment. Thank you for your patience as we work to provide you with an accurate plan for the start of school.

Sincerely,
Cheryl Burns

Obituary for Willie (Buddy) Edward Kellar | All Faiths of The Pines",9.0,"We are saddened to learn of the passing of Coach Buddy Kellar. Coach Kellar graduated from Smithville High School in 1953. After graduation, he served in the U.S. Army and later worked for Smithville ISD. Coach Kellar spent 38 years as a high school football coach.

This past season Coach Kellar joined the Smithville Tiger Football team on the field for pre-game festivities as an Honorary Captain to 'flip the coin'. It was a special treat to have him join the team on the field at Tiger Stadium.

Thank you for your service to our country and your time as an educator in your hometown of Smithville, Texas.

Our condolences go out to Coach Kellar's family and friends.

(Written by Pamela M. Tuck, illustrated by Eric Velasquez, and read by Dul√© Hill)

Young Mason Steele takes pride in turning his father‚Äôs excited ramblings about the latest civil rights incidents into handwritten business letters. One day Pa comes home with a gift from his civil rights group: a typewriter. Thrilled with the present, Mason spends all his spare time teaching himself to type. Soon he knows where every letter on the keyboard is located. When the civil rights group wins a school desegregation case, Mason learns that now he will be attending a formerly all-white high school. Despite his fears and injustice from the students and faculty, Mason perseveres. He does well in school‚Äîespecially in his typing class. And when he competes in the county typing tournament, Mason decides to take a stand, using his skills to triumph over prejudice and break racial barriers.

(Written by Jodi Moore, iIllustrated by Howard McWilliam, and read by Mark Duplass)

If you build a perfect sandcastle, a dragon will move in. And that‚Äôs exactly what happens to one very lucky boy at the beach. Dad is busy sunbathing and Mom is busy with her book, so the boy and dragon roam the beach together, flying a kite, braving the waves, and roasting marshmallows. But no one believes him when he shares the news of his magnificent dragon: Mom only hears the roar of the ocean, Dad thinks the dragon feather is a seagull feather, and know-it-all sis claims there‚Äôs no such thing as a dragon. That‚Äôs when the sandwiches mysteriously disappear, claw prints are found in the brownies, and dragon-giggles erupt from the strangest of places. Heh-heh-heh. Is there truly a mischievous dragon running around on the beach or is someone‚Äôs imagination running wild? Decide for yourself When a Dragon Moves In.

(Written by Fiona Roberton, illustrated by Fiona Roberton, and read by Sarah Silverman)

There are two sides to every story. In Part One, a little girl finds a strange beast in the woods and takes it home as a pet. She feeds it, shows it off to her friends and gives it a hat. But that night it escapes. Then, in Part Two, the beast tells the story of being kidnapped by the girl, who force-fed it squirrel food, scared it with a group of beasts and wrapped it in wool. Can the two beasts resolve their differences? A Tale of Two Beasts is an eye-opening story that makes you look at things from a different perspective.

(Written by William Miller, illustrated by Charlotte Riley-Webb, and read by Viola Davis)

This story is set in New Orleans in the 1930s. Sonny and his mother are scraping by to pay their rent. Mama works in a fish canning factory, and Sonny works for the coal man before school each morning. When Mama loses her job, they no longer have enough money for the rent and fear that the landlord will turn them out. One day Sonny meets Smilin‚Äô Jack, a jazz musician who is playing his trumpet in Jackson Square. Smilin‚Äô Jack offers to play at a party at Sonny‚Äôs house to help raise money for the rent. The neighbors all come to sing and dance and before they leave, drop some coins in a bucket. Sonny learns how people can help one another ‚Äúif they put their minds and hearts to it.‚Äù

(Written by Megan and Jorge Lacera, illustrated by Jorge Lacera, and read by Jaime Camil)

Mo Romero is a zombie who loves nothing more than growing, cooking, and eating vegetables. Tomatoes? Tantalizing. Peppers? Pure perfection! The problem? Mo‚Äôs parents insist that their ni√±o eat only zombie cuisine, like arm-panadas and finger foods. They tell Mo over and over that zombies don‚Äôt eat veggies. But Mo can‚Äôt imagine a lifetime of just eating zombie food and giving up his veggies. As he questions his own zombie identity, Mo tries his best to convince his parents to give peas a chance.

Tonight's story is 'Library Lion'
(Written by Michelle Knudsen, Illustrated by Kevin Hawkes, and Read by Mindy Sterling)

The description below is from the Storyline Online website:

Miss Merriweather, the head librarian, is very particular about rules in the library. No running allowed. And you must be quiet. But when a lion comes to the library one day, no one is sure what to do. There aren‚Äôt any rules about lions in the library. And, as it turns out, this lion seems very well suited to library visiting. His big feet are quiet on the library floor. He makes a comfy backrest for the children at story hour. And he never roars in the library, at least not anymore. But when something terrible happens, the lion quickly comes to the rescue in the only way he knows how.

At first glance, Arnie looks like an average doughnut - round, cakey, iced and sprinkled, with a hole in the middle. He was made by one of the best bakeries in town, and admittedly his sprinkles are candy-colored. Still, a doughnut is just a doughnut, right? WRONG! Not if Arnie has anything to say about it. And, for a doughnut, he sure seems to have an awful lot to say. Can Arnie change the fate of all doughnuts - or at least have a hand in his own future?

Did giant ants fight huge Dino‚Äôs or did they just get crushed?

The title of his 2005 biography refers to Ogden Nash as ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Laureate of Light Verse‚Äù and that is certainly true. His hilarious and droll verse has delighted readers for almost 100 years. Nash has even had a postage stamp created in his honor. Some people discount humorous verse as not ‚Äúreal‚Äù poetry. But the use of humor in poems, or in other genres of writing for that matter, while entertaining, has also proved to be one of the sharpest tools writers have to criticize culture and society and, in some cases, it‚Äôs use has even wrought social change.

Ogden Nash was a jester with words, and so is our beloved engineering instructor, Mr. David Lively.

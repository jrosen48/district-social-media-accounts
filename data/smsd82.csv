Hi Spartans! My name is Gracie Martinez and I am a former student of SMSD and happy to return as a staff member nearly 25 years after my education first began on campus. Prior to joining the team, I worked at a successful holding company directly supporting the CEO and rebranding an entire agency. I graduated from the University of Houston with a BA in Public Relations as valedictorian and a Terry Scholar. As I step into Michael Sudhalter's position, I look forward to honoring the initiatives he had in place as well as continuing to create new ones. Even though school has changed quite a bit these days, my passion for higher education and purposed conversation has me feeling like I'm at the right place at the right time.

In my free time, I like watching Disney movies with Spanish subtitles on and I like to eat Best Burger once a week to keep the doctors away. I can't wait to meet more of you soon.

To measure student progress during the 2019-2020 school year, Stafford MSD will be administering an End-of-Year assessment. This assessment is designed by the Texas Education Agency to determine student growth and understanding of the state curriculum.

It has been my distinct honor to maintain the Stafford MSD Facebook Page for the past four years. Today is my final day with the District, as I have accepted an opportunity outside of the Houston Metropolitan area.

I remember starting the page in March 2016 immediately after a Stafford Spartan Soccer Game.

The page recently reached 4,880 followers. Not because of me, but because of the dedicated students, faculty and staff of Stafford Municipal School District. I was simply relaying the message.

I would like to thank SMSD Superintendent Dr. Robert Bostic, SMSD Chief of Innovation & Operation Marva Rasberry and the SMSD Board of Trustees for giving me the opportunity to work on your behalf.

I know Stafford MSD will continue to do excellent things, and I look forward to watching it as a person who follows this page.

At 8 a.m. this morning, a construction contractor inadvertently ruptured a Centerpoint gas line, adjacent to Stafford MSD Property, while working on a sidewalk.

Stafford MSD is closed today in observance of President's Day, so students and most of our employees are not on campus.

As a precaution, the Stafford Fire Department enacted a Shelter in Place for one street near the Intermediate Campus. Centerpoint employees came out and fixed the line, and thus the Shelter In Place was lifted at 10:30 a.m.

According to Stafford Fire Chief Larry DiCamillo, ""Everything is under control.""

Stafford Fire immediately contacted Fort Bend Emergency Medical Services (EMS), and together they determined minimal to no risk for the immediate area, because the line in question was natural gas.

The Shelter in Place did not affect the majority of the Stafford MSD Campus. It only affected the immediate area near the Intermediate Campus.

“As a teacher, I saw such a need for it, to help students with what they’re dealing with in their lives,” Hobbs said. “I wanted to have a larger impact with more students.”

Hobbs is in her third year as a School Counselor at Stafford Elementary.

“I love going into the classroom to talk to students about good character traits,” Hobbs said. “The kids are the best part of the job. They make my day.”

A Stafford citizen, Hobbs is the proud parent of two Stafford MSD Graduates. She’s also the President of the Stafford Band Boosters – a position she has held for the past 13 years.

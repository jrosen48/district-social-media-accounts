This information is critically needed as we prepare for the start of school.

Learning model options are 100% online instruction with teachers from your child’s home/traditional school, our Parent Partnership Program for homeschool students and families, Apex Online Learning or Running Start.

On this last day of school, I want to thank you for your support this past school year. None of us could have imagined when we started the year in September, that this is how the year would end. All of us, including you, had a role to play in educating our students during the challenging time.

As the year closes, I’d like to share this video highlighting two important focuses within our district as we continue our work through the summer:

• 2020-2021 reopening plan

• Social justice, racism and equity

We’ve been called upon to meet the needs of our students, families and community while continuing to cultivate a more inclusive culture. I am confident we will be stronger as we move forward together.

Again, thank you for your ongoing support! I hope you and your families stay safe, healthy and have a great summer!

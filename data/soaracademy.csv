Tomorrow 6/13/19 is our Field Day Carnival for our students! Please read this whole post for some reminders and notifications:

Tomorrow will be our hottest and sunniest Field Day ever!

We welcome students to bring personal bottles of water. Please put your student's name on the water bottle.

We highly encourage the use of sunscreen! Sunscreen is considered an over the counter medication so SOAR is NOT allowed to provide or apply sunscreen for your students.

We will have a break time inside with otter pops to cool off midday after lunch and there are shaded areas for students to have a break.

There will also be a liability waiver required for students to play on the bounce house and inflatable slide we have rented. We began passing out this morning and will post on facebook, email, classdojo, and hand out during pick up.

This event is only for students and pre-approved volunteers. If you are unsure if you are volunteering, please contact the office.

Says our anonymous family nominator: ""Every morning she gives a warm, personal greeting to each child and parent, and spend a few seconds on a new sight words activity with each student. I love seeing how her enthusiasm draws the kids in and they ask to have the next turn reviewing their words with her!"" #soaristhankful

We count ourselves lucky to have Ms. Nyaria in our community as both a staff member and SOAR parent! Have your own words of appreciation for her?

This week has been a very painful and disheartening time for the entire Jersey City community. In the midst of this, we continue to work together to prepare our children for tomorrow. At the end of the day, we are left with the need for all of us to move forward together. We find the strengths within us to unite and hold onto the belief that the human spirit will rise above this. What better way to invest in tomorrow than joining together with all of you to make a world that reflects our dreams for our children to live in peace… On behalf of everyone at the school, I thank you for all of the wonderful support you have offered us this week.

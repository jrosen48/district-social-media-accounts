We are looking for students who would like to get some volunteer hours and help our school out. We have over 2 large tables of trophies that need to be sorted and cataloged. We are asking for some students who would come in and record the year, event, etc of our old trophies that we will later make available to the public. We would like this project to be finished before school begins on August 24.

Please contact the HS office if you are interested.

Starting June 1, our school will be providing a summer lunch program. We are in need of some helpers for this program during the month of June.

If you would like to or are in need of some community service hours, we would gladly accept your smiling faces and your efforts.

We can use students volunteering on any weekday between the hours of 8 am to 11 for food prep and the hours of 11 am to 1 for handing out meals.

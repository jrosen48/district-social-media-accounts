Christina Schweiss - Your last high school performance is literally one for the history books! FABULOUS!

Dylan Beattie & Christian Welch - Thanks for your willingness to capture your classmates' celebrations and accomplishments on film!

Jeremy Hawkes - You produced a memory better than we could have ever imagined! You are so very TALENTED!

We would like to thank the Sedona Police Department for their partnership in prioritizing student safety on our campus. The police department initiated a lockdown today. A vehicle on campus raised concern with our student resource officer who initiated the lockdown until the owner of that vehicle could be located. All areas of campus were searched and cleared by police officers. The owner of that vehicle, the person of concern, was located off campus. The vehicle had been driven to campus by another person.

We are grateful to have law enforcement partners, particularly our SRO on campus, as safety is our highest priority. Thank you for your support, confidence, and patience as well as we verified student safety before releasing students to their next classes.

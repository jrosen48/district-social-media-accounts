Dear VCUSD Families and Staff,

The North Bay fires are a tragedy impacting several VCUSD teachers and staff. We are staying in close contact with those being directly affected and are providing supports as needed.

At this time VCUSD remains open and Distance Learning will continue, but there may be an impact to our classes throughout the district, and if that is the case our families will be notified by site principals.

We keep our teachers, staff, and families, as well as those in our neighboring cities and districts in our thoughts and prayers in their time of crisis.
Should events change we will notify you accordingly.

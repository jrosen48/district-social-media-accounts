The National Weather Service has issued a windchill Advisory, which predicts the ""real-feel"" could drop to -25 degrees. In the past we've delayed or cancelled school for Windchill Warnings, but never for Advisories. A Warning is issued when temperatures fall below -30 degrees.

The National Weather Service is NOT predicting temps to fall below -30 degrees so I anticipate our schedule will run normal tomorrow. There is a risk of slick roads and limited visibility in the morning, depending on the amount of snow we receive tonight so we will monitor that closely. In the case of a delay, we will not release early. Based on the National Weather Service, it appears we will be able to run a normal schedule tomorrow.

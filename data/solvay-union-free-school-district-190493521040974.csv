The hours for pick up will be Thursday and Friday from 8 am until 3 pm. There will be 3 locations for pick up; the Elementary School, the Middle School, and the High School. Please be sure to fill out the request form online before picking up the Chromebook.

A parent or guardian will need to come into the main lobby of the school to sign the Chromebook out, the process will be just like checking out a school library book.

If these times do not work for you, please email covid19@solvayschools.org to schedule another time.

If you have filled out the Chromebook request form on the website, www.solvayschools.org/covid19 the Chromebooks and chargers will be ready for pick up by a parent or guardian starting tomorrow morning. The hours for pick up will be Thursday and Friday from 8 am until 3 pm. There will be 3 locations for pick up; the Elementary School, the Middle School, and the High School. Please be sure to fill out the request form online before picking up the Chromebook.

A parent or guardian will need to come into the main lobby of the school to sign the Chromebook out, the process will be just like checking out a school library book.

If these times do not work for you, please email covid19@solvayschools.org to schedule another time.

Thank you

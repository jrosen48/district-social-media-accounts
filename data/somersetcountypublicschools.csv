With today's additional restrictions placed on gatherings of 10 or more people in Maryland, we sadly cannot accept more volunteers for Friday, March 20. We will be reaching out to staff to notify them if they are needed, and when. Thank you all so very much!

WATCH >>> WICOMICO COUNTY AND SOMERSET COUNTY SCHOOLS ARE OFFERING FREE LUNCHES TO KIDS

With the #COVID19 outbreak sports are by the wayside as the country fights the epidemic. As a result I am now helping our news team cover stories across the peninsula.

Thank you to Professor Simon Perez for training myself and my fellow classmates with the skills to do both.",9.0,"“The last thing we want people to worry about is where their next meal is coming from.”

What does 2018-2019 Maryland Teacher of the Year Dr. Richard Warren love about teaching in Maryland?

""I remember being jobless and going into the school system as a substitute, as I began to teach the kids I began to see pieces of my own story within some of the students that I taught. The challenges that they had to overcome, the obstacles that they were facing, and I felt as though I was the person to inspire them to move forward. Those kind of stories and students really hit home for me.""

Day 66, and after two days of the “mess” that is going around, back at work!

Today was some morning work and then off to the ESMEC meeting in Easton. We met with the Special Assistant to the Secretary of Rural Education from the United States Department of Education. Our conversation was centered around grant opportunities to enhance programs in rural America. It was an interesting meeting and hopefully one that would benefit Somerset County.￼

Getting closer to winter break so hoping everyone stays focused on what they need to do the next six school days so they can enjoy the two week break! Short report tonight.

Everybody have a great night!

I have received a call from the Town of Crisfield and they have to turn the water off for an extended period of time. We are in the middle of picking up Woodson students and will bring them to school. Because of the length of the shut off we will not have water to flush toilets, run sinks or run our kitchen. Therefore we will be dismissing Crisfield High School at 9 o’clock and Woodson at 10 o’clock. We are sorry for any issues this causes, however, it is out of our control. Teachers are to stay until all students have been dismissed.

I do not know whether or not we have to make this day up. Again Crisfield High School dismisses at 9 and Woodson at 10.￼￼￼￼￼￼

Day 53 was all about getting out of the office and interacting with the students!!!!! ￼

The day started with a meeting with the SEA over at the new technical high school. While there we visited several classrooms and saw students engaged in some great activities!￼

After that it was off to Washington High School where we checked out their Community Day with all of the various groups and activities from the school, represented in the front foyer.￼ It was great to interact with the students and see community members checking out all the school has to offer. There is so much positive going on at the school that is overlooked!

Next we attended the Promotion Ceremony for students in the Criminal Justice Program at the technical high school.￼ It was an honor to be able to pin new rank pins on the students!￼ Below is Deputy Superintendent Tom Davis doing the same thing!￼

What a great day!!!!!

See you tomorrow!!!!

We are still hoping/planning to perform Matilda in the future, (although nothing is confirmed due to the current state of affairs.) In light of this, ticket holders will receive an email in the coming days that will give them the opportunity to donate back to our program or request a refund. If we’re able to mount our production in the future, ticket sales will re open with new dates. So proud of these talented kids!

Here is a quick rundown of our 8th grade Lady Colts Volleyball season so far. Records for A Team is 3-0, B Team is 1-1

The Lady Colts started the season off with wins over Crane. Our 8th B teams defeated Crane 25-18, 25-11. ‚ÄúA‚Äù team defeated Crane 25-1, 25-5. We travelled to Odessa Compass Academy where our 8th ‚ÄúA‚Äù team defeated Odessa in 3 sets 25-15, 17-25, 25-23. The team from Odessa was very good, but our Lady Colts were determined to win, coming back from six points down in the final set to win. On Monday our Lady Colts hosted Reagan County with our B team coming up short of a win taking Reagan County to 3 sets- 25-22, 17-25, 11-15. Lady Colts ‚ÄúA‚Äù team took down the Lady Owls 25-13, 25-4.

Lady Colts Volleyball is in full swing, come out and support our girls. The 7th and 8th grade teams are exciting to watch. Future looks great. ‚ÄúGirl Power‚Äù !!!!

Next two games are @ Coahoma and Crane

JV's Jojo Dooley was strong from the service line in yesterday's match---putting the girls out in front early on. The rest of the team worked well together on both defensive and offensive ends to make quick work of their opponents and claim a VICTORY!!

The Varsity squad extended their winning streak to 5 as well. A quick ball termination from Kaylyn Hoffman--assist Skylar Harris, Reception Clarissa Rodriguez---set the tone for the match. The Lady Broncos did a good job controlling the tempo of the game for the vast majority of its duration.

Dear Test Coordinator,

ACT has decided to reschedule the April 4, 2020 National ACT¬Æ test date to our June 13 and July 18 test dates in response to concerns regarding the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19).

ACT will be notifying registered students directly in the next few days, informing them of the postponement and providing instructions for next steps.

We will be in contact with you in the days ahead as we work to plan for June and July, where we will need to build capacity to accommodate April examinees.

Our primary concern right now is the safety of students and testing staff. We hope you and your loved ones are healthy and safe during this challenging time.

Before we go to break I would like to brag on my volleyball girls for just a second! We graduated 9 seniors yes NINE! I had THREE girls come back to my varsity team this year that played at that level and this young team stepped up in ways you could not imagine. Facing number one in the state in the second round is just crazy but, that is the playoffs for you! I have been beyond blessed to coach such an amazing group of girls this year.

State LDE Results:

The State LDE was held at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville this weekend. The two chapter conducting teams did not advance to the state finals on Friday. Both teams placed seventh in their respective heats. Many hours were spent preparing for this event since the middle of September.

The Junior Quiz team placed 12th in the contest. Gage Owen was five points out of the top ten individuals. The team was three points out of top ten also. Other members of the quiz team were Molly Friess, Jara Wootton and Tanner Flanagan.

Congrats to our ""Racing the Sun"" team for their great performance! Last Saturday, the Sonoran Science Academy DM's Solar Race Kart team, ""I Can't Read This"", participated in their first solar kart race at Tech Parks Arizona’s Racing the Sun competition.
In its 8th year, this unique competition challenges high school students to design, build, and test a solar go-kart. It was held at the Musselman Honda Circuit and saw more than 100 students from Phoenix, Tucson, and southern Arizona race their solar-powered karts and show off their engineering and science skills.
In its first ever competition, Team “I Can’t Read This” garnered the Best Verbal Presentation Award and the Innovation Award. The team also placed 2nd in the Endurance category and the Speed category. What an amazing rookie year achievement!

Realizing this vision is vital to our state’s economic prosperity, quality of life and civic health.

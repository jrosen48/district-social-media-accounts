Dear SUESD Parents, Families, & Staff,
It appears likely that another round of PG&E's planned Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) will take place in our area this weekend. I want to keep you informed on how this will impact SUESD Schools. Please rest assured that student safety will always be the top factor considered when making any decisions of this nature. As of this moment, we are planning to have a regular school day on Monday, October 28, 2019. We will, however, be monitoring the situation very closely over the weekend. I will send you updates over the weekend with the latest information. If it becomes necessary to cancel school on Monday, I will send you that information as soon as humanly possible. The uncertain nature of the shutdowns is undoubtedly frustrating. I empathize with the challenging nature of childcare and work schedules and how this uncertainty complicates things even further. We'll get through this together, again. Thanks for your cooperation and patience.
Sincerely,
Scott Turnbull

It's here! Tomorrow, Wednesday, August 22, 2018, is the first day back to school for students in our district's schools. Every year in a young person's development is precious, and we take it as an honor to educate your child. As you know, this is our big year for building those new classrooms! We are making every attempt to limit the impact of construction on instruction. Still, the work is bound to impact the start of the school day and dismissal. In this regard, I merely ask that we all give ourselves a little extra cushion time-wise at drop-off and pick-up and have as much patience as possible. School and District Staff will be out and about tomorrow doing everything we can to make the start of this school year a smooth one. Have a great first day tomorrow.

Welcome to the 2018-19 School Year in Soquel Union Elementary School District. We are looking forward to another fantastic year of learning. I wanted to remind you to please complete the Back To School forms for your child(ren) if you have not already. These forms were sent to you via the parent portal. These forms will not be available on paper. Having full information for all of our students is imperative to student safety and record keeping. We will not be able to release student class placement until these forms are complete and the beginning of the year is approaching quickly. If you need any assistance please contact your child's school or contact us here at the District Office.

First day of school is August 22, 2018!

Dear NBMS Staff & Parents,

We just became aware of a water leak underneath New Brighton's parking lot closest to the district office and Monterey Park. We must shut down the impacted water line to repair it first thing tomorrow morning. The restrooms & water fountains that will be available tomorrow are in the PAC and the Gym. Bringing a bottle of drinking water is advisable. I apologize for this inconvenience. We will still prepare school lunches since this line does not provide water to the New Brighton Kitchen. All school activities will proceed as usual. This message is just a ""heads-up"" so everyone knows what to expect tomorrow. Thanks for your patience and understanding.

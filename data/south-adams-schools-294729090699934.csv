Please tune into the Berne Witness Livestream of our SA Board Meeting tonight at 6:00 to hear discussions related to our return to school plan. Thank you to all of our families and staff that took the time to respond to our survey and submit questions. We have been able to use this thoughtful feedback to help us refine our focus and define the steps we will take to ensure the safety of our students, staff and community. A special thanks too, goes to Dr. Ainsworth and our County Health Department for their constant guidance and support as we work to develop and refine our plan.

We are so thankful for the tremendous patience, understanding and support we have received from our entire SA community. Following tonight’s Board Meeting Discussion, the SA team will work to refine our plan and formally distribute it to our families sometime during the week of July 27th.

The Class of 2020 Senior Parade has been approved and is set for Wednesday, May 20 starting at 3 PM (the end of the last day of school). The seniors will be in their vehicles and will be escorted by the Berne Police starting at Spare Time Lanes and going south through Berne on US 27 to 700 S where students will turn towards the HS.

The parade of senior vehicles will loop through the south parking lot of the HS where the SA teachers and staff will be waving and cheering for our seniors. The caravan of vehicles will get back onto US 27 and head south to Geneva and conclude the parade by turning right onto US 116 (Line St.) in Geneva.

The plan is to have community members and businesses line the sides of road of the parade route and cheer and beep and make signs in support of seniors. Please come out and support our graduating Class of 2020!",3.0,"City of Berne Indiana

Synopsis:
Our Dorothy is a young dreamer feeling pressures from bullies who want to force her to give up on being herself and living her own life. We will join her on an adventure to a land where people can be who they want to be and live the life they want to live. Along the way she meets many interesting characters you might think you are familiar with such as a certain lion, scarecrow, and man made of metal. However, they aren’t quite the ones you know. She’ll also meet some witches both good and bad, and visit the land of costume play—Cos—to meet a wizard, sort of. In the Land of Cos, people dress as their favorite characters and live happy lives not worrying about what other people think. From her adventure Dorothy learns to stand up for herself and help others be themselves as well.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10156573930511960&id=279106921959,,0.0,"Save the Date!

The PA Department of Education has approved South Allegheny School District’s request to provide “Flexible
Instructional Days” to our learners. This means that on days when situations like winter weather or a building emergency
require us to close our schools, we can provide instruction to our students at home rather than in the classroom (think
“Alternative Snow Day.”)

been approved to use up to five (5) of these days this school year. We are planning to use these “Flexible Instructional

Being a part of those different organizations early on gave her an idea of what different career paths would be like; which ultimately helped her choose her current profession.

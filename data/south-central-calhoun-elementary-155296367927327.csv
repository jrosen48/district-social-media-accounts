I hope you are all enjoying your summer. Mrs. Stamp and I are back to work now. We are getting everything ready and are so excited for the new year! The construction and remodeling are almost finished at our building, and Ms. Miller and Ms. Bell are going to have the place looking spiffy. I‚Äôm also excited to welcome several new staff members and new students.

Despite COVID, I truly believe this will be an excellent school year. Next week, the district and elementary ‚ÄúReturn to Learn‚Äù plans will be shared with everyone. These plans include measures to address health and safety as well as to provide options for students who can‚Äôt atten in person.

Please join us in the fight against heart disease. Help your children go online at heart.org/kidsheartchallenge or download the Kids Heart Challenge mobile app to make a pledge to be more heart healthy and earn a free powerband. Our goal is to have 100% of our students take their heart healthy challenge online to move more, be kind, or be prepared! When your child takes their challenge, they will become a Heart Hero!
This year, the mobile app unlocks even more fun and the Heart Hero characters and powerband come to life. As soon as your child raises $10 online, they will also receive Perrie and Knox, two of our Heart Heroes!

Thank you for your life-saving help!

American Heart Association",2.0,"Hello Parents,
We kicked off our American Heart Association‚Äôs Kids Heart Challenge today.
Please join us in the fight against heart disease. Help your children go online at heart.org/kidsheartchallenge or download the Kids Heart Challenge mobile app to make a pledge to be more heart healthy and earn a free powerband. Our goal is to have 100% of our students take their heart healthy challenge online to move more, be kind, or be prepared! When your child takes their challenge, they will become a Heart Hero!
This year, the mobile app unlocks even more fun and the Heart Hero characters and powerband come to life. As soon as your child raises $10 online, they will also receive Perrie and Knox, two of our Heart Heroes!

Thank you for your life-saving help!

Each month, an order form will be available in the school office and here on Facebook. Families just fill out the order form and return it to the elementary office (or to a Lake City preschool teachers). If a printed form is not available, families can text or email their orders to Mrs. McChesney. Requested items will be boxed up for pick-up. Limited delivery is also available. Here's this month's form. Hungry kids can't learn to the best of their abilities. The food pantry exists to help families who are experiencing short-term or long-term difficulties with their grocery budget. There are no income guidelines or paperwork. Please call the elementary office (712-297-8621) or Mrs. McChesney (712-210-5168) with questions.",2019-07-31 18:43:03,,

Welcome to September :)
I just want to thank parents and students personally for their understanding about the cold grab n go lunches(rebel meal) for the month of August. The administration team all come together and agreed that in these uncertain times and with reopening school very cautiously, and with all the changes that we would start the year this way.
The students have been great about keeping socially apart and dealing with the changes in a positive way.
With all that being said, we will still have limited choices and everything will be in closed containers but we will again be having hot lunches starting in September with the second option being the cold rebel meal. Thank you again!!",8.0,"South Newton Food Services

Attached is the South Newton School Corporation 2020-2021 Re-Entry Plan. The Plan will answer many questions you might have about bringing our staff and students back to school safely. As you will see, the first page of the Plan mentions how fluid the Coronavirus situation is, as well as our school being required to follow mandated guidelines set forth by state or federal governments. This plan was finalized last week, then voted on by the South Newton Board of Trustees last evening. Between the time of the Plan being finalized and voted on, Governor Holcomb has mandated facemasks for the state of Indiana. This mandate includes inside school buildings, specifically for students in grades three and higher. The mandate also includes all adults in school buildings. While the South Newton plan “recommends” the use of facemasks, until further notice, we will require facemasks (for grades three and higher) until the Governor’s mandate is lifted.

Sincerely,
Mr. Hall

With recent events and schools being closed, we want to help. We know theres families whos kids eat breakfast and lunch at school ( I know this 1st hand as our child is one..and I had to go ""shopping"" for those extra meals just recently), not everyone is able to right off the bat with the extreme and sudden decision that was made. So we're going to try and help, if for some reason your child needs lunch we will offer a personal pizza (or other size depending on how many kiddos) for free. We're checking in with our vendors for other options ie hotdogs etc. We ask that this gesture isnt abused and only for the families in need so someone in need isnt going without or deplete our resources (we're a mom and pop place not big corporate). These orders will have to be for ""togo"" as we're a 21+ establishment. Our plan is to do this until school is back in session or a forced closure. Please be kind and patient with one another we're all in this together 💙

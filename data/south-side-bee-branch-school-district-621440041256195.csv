Update on pics and yearbooks:
Pictures are in and have been delivered to the high school and elementary offices. Yearbooks came in at the end of last week.
I am planning to go up and sort through orders this next week. I will contact people regarding order balances. There are a limited number of extras for those who want to order.
The school would like seniors to receive their yearbooks first. This is to honor them and to recognize them for the many Sr year events/experiences that they missed this year. The plan is to give them to seniors at the graduation ceremony on Sunday, July 26th. I realize this is a change in plans, but we would like to honor seniors in this way. Because school essentially starts 2 weeks later, it is felt that it might be best to distribute yearbooks to kids on the first day of school. If there is a change in this decision, I will post it.

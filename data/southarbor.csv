Next Wednesday (August 19) we will hold a Meet the Teacher Night at the school from 6-8 PM. We look forward to seeing you at our ""Parking Lot Pop In"" event.

Each family will remain in the vehicle while driving up in a single-file line to the curb, like our June luau event. Our teachers will be outside to greet you on the curb. Each grade-level team will have a balloon to note their location, and you can stop your car in front of that grade to say hello and receive an ICEE pop. An example would be if I had a Kindergarten student and a 2nd Grade student, I would stop my vehicle in front of the K and 2 balloons to see the teachers. This is a quick pop-in and not a time for questions or to drop off student supplies.",,,0.0,"Hello South Arbor Families!

Puffy Sidewalk Chalk Paint Ingredients

How to Make Sidewalk Chalk Paint:
In a large mixing bowl stir together the flour and water until there are no lumps.
Stir in the dish soap to the flour mixture.
Add food coloring of your choice until you reach the desired color.
Pour the mixture into a squeeze bottle. (Try an old ketchup bottle or something similar that has been washed thoroughly if you don't have one.)
If you are making multiple colors, make each color in a separate bowl.

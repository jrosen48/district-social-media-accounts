So, come on out to WECT TV's ""Get Fit With 6"" expo, Saturday, January 25th from 10am until 3pm at the Coastline Convention Center right by the Cape Fear River in downtown Wilmington!

Admission is free, and there will be some great wellness organizations on hand to help you with those New Years Resolutions you may have made.

You can even enter the 5K race or 1 mile wellness walk! Or just cheer on one of our fantastic RBA race team members

(details and registration info at the link provided,)

Make sure to stop by the RBA booth, (# 41, right beside the stage,) and say hi! (there may even be a little bit of swag in it for you!)

And if you know a family with a K-8 student, bring them as well so they can learn about the choices they have in their child's education, and how a top-performing, tuition free Roger Bacon Academy charter school can exercise their child's mind!

Hope we see you there!

Saturday looks to be a BEAUTIFUL day for a race!

So, come on out to WECT TV's ""Get Fit With 6"" expo, Saturday, January 25th from 10am until 3pm at the Coastline Convention Center right by the Cape Fear River in downtown Wilmington!

Admission is free, and there will be some great wellness organizations on hand to help you with those New Years Resolutions you may have made.

You can even enter the 5K race or 1 mile wellness walk! Or just cheer on one of our fantastic RBA race team members

(details and registration info at the link provided,)

Make sure to stop by the RBA booth, (# 41, right beside the stage,) and say hi! (there may even be a little bit of swag in it for you!)

And if you know a family with a K-8 student, bring them as well so they can learn about the choices they have in their child's education, and how a top-performing, tuition free Roger Bacon Academy charter school can exercise their child's mind!

Hope we see you there!

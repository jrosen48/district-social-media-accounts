Last night 225 Riley High School seniors received yard signs delivered by volunteers, teachers, and school administrators. Special shoutout, and thank you, to Becky Hill, president of the South Bend Riley Athletic Boosters, for purchasing the signs and making this possible.

""To knock on a few doors, and see their reaction just reminds me of why we do what we do,"" said Principal Shawn Henderson.

She will use the award to send her students gratitude journals, mathematics games, Brain Quest Math Cards, and books they can read together in Google Classrooms.

“I can't wait to see the pictures of my students when they get their new material,” she said. “I know that these new supplies will keep the momentum going for our eLearning the rest of this school year.

South Bend Schools Use WiFi Buses to Keep Students Learning",8.0,"“People can access, for free, the WiFi that is on that bus and it branches out about 300 feet we’re told,” said Susan Devetski, the Chief Academic Officer for South Bend.

Devetski said they park in front of apartment complexes and in parking lots in places in South Bend where parents say they can’t get WiFi otherwise.

“We’ve seen people come and park their cars in the parking lot next to the bus. We’ve seen on nicer days people sitting outside and using their laptop right outside the buses so it’s a variety of ways in which they can access using the buses. WFYI News #TeamSouthBend

Individual colleges and universities will often times award incoming students with various Merit Based Scholarships, taking into consideration such things as their overall grades, standardized test scores, and the rigor of the courses they have taken in high school. These students have all been awarded Merit Based Scholarships from Ball State University. Congratulations students- your hard-work throughout high school has paid off!

Please note that we can only recognize merit based scholarships/ awards that students have made us aware of (colleges do not send the school a list of this information). Students/Parents, please email Mrs. Randall to report any Merit Scholarships you have been awarded from the school you will be attending.

Individual colleges and universities will often times award incoming students with various Merit Based Scholarships, taking into consideration such things as their overall grades, standardized test scores, and the rigor of the courses they have taken in high school. These students have all been awarded Merit Based Scholarships from Ball State University. Congratulations students- your hard-work throughout high school has paid off!

South Central Community,

As Yearbook Adviser, I want to make sure that every senior gets a copy of their senior yearbook this year. My staff and I are working hard to make sure we tell the story of this unprecedented and surreal school year.

Some families have been hit hard by COVID 19 and so we are looking for sponsors to help cover the cost of these books.

If you are willing to purchase a yearbook ($65) for a senior who may not be able to afford one, please email me: etheridge@scentral.k12.in.us

Thank you! These kids deserve all that we can do for them to make this year special! ❤️💙

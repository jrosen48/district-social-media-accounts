We appreciate your patience as we work through the first day of school traffic. Starting tomorrow morning, 6th graders will be dropped off and screened at the normal drop-off in the north parking lot drive (like we did last year). This will help
keep our traffic moving a little better. There will be signs posted to remind you tomorrow.

Please note that we have more students being picked up this year which can slow down our traffic. Please be sure to post your child’s name tag that was given to you today on your front dash. Again, we appreciate your patience as we work to keep the students socially distanced and get them safely to your car. Once the students are familiar with our process, it will move more quickly.

Dear SCCSD Learning Community,

As we embark on the beginning of the 20-21 school year, the SCCSD wishes to thank you for your trust in allowing our District to partner with you in the education of your student. Whether it is on-site or off-site virtual learning, we are honored and committed to maximizing the safety, learning and achievement of every scholar!

We ask you for your grace this school year. Everything will be different from drop-off, to checking out your student, to lunches, to pick-up, extracurricular events, etc. Please be patient, especially the first week of school as we learn and improve on everything. Many of our staff are very experienced, but this is all of the staff's first year in education with COVID-19. This is a new frontier, but there is great opportunity to grow and learn.

We are so excited to be back educating our scholars! Thank you for being an amazing learning community.

Monday is the first day of school and we can’t wait to see your child!

Please remind your student to wear his/her mask.
Don’t bring children to school who are sick or have fever.
Drop off for kinders is in the parking lot off of Winthrop Drive. Kindergarten is over our door!

Drop off for first graders is in the front of the school off of Bridge St. Remember to use the southern entrance to the lot and “snake” through the parking lot to get more cars out of the traffic on Bridge St!

Early drop off starts at 7:15. Regular drop off is 7:30. Students need to be in class by 7:50 to start eating breakfast in the classroom! (Provided to them for free!)

Parents aren’t able to walk children to their classrooms this year because of COVID concerns.

We promise your children are in GREAT hands! The staff of Morrilton Primary was born to take care of kids!! We can’t wait to meet and teach them!

Good Morning Band Boosters!! I am looking for sewers. Due to Covid19 guidelines our students will need to use bell covers on their instruments. These are extremely expensive to purchase so we will be making our own. We will provide all the materials to put each one together. We will need 200+ so multiple volunteers are appreciated!! Don't sew - that is ok- we need you too!! We will have plenty of material to cut and prepare for our sewers. If you are able to help - please text Adrianne @ 501-208-4144 and I will add you to the list. We are in the process of ordering materials now and will be starting production in the next few weeks.",15.0,"Morrilton High School Band

I want to take a moment and recognize all of my Band seniors. When I became a band director at Morrilton six years ago, you all were only seventh graders! We all have a LOT of good stories and memories from these past six years, and they will stay with me forever.
You all have grown into endlessly talented, intelligent, and wonderfully unique young adults before my very eyes. The potential you all hold is obvious from looking over the future plans of this bright group! The resiliency you have shown throughout the curve-ball thrown at us this year further proves this. I hope to see you all later this summer for a final goodbye at our senior award event and tell you all of this myself and hopefully, give each of you a big hug!

Here’s “Click, Clack Moo, Cows That Type” by Doreen Cronin...I emailed the author to see if I could get a response & she actually wrote me back! How cool! Parents, ask your child if they even know what a “typewriter” is? Some challenging vocabulary words in this story are: “strike”, “impatient”, “demand”, “ultimatum”, “snoop” & “exchange”....Enjoy!

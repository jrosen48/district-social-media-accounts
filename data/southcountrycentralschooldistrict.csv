Bellport High School’s Life Skills Program was awarded the Outstanding Cooperator Award, recognizing the students’ great work at the Cornell Cooperative Farm, located in Yaphank.

Teacher Jane Quatrale explained that students enrolled in the self-contained/prevocational Life Skills Program (ages 17-21) and special students in the 8:1:3 classes who receive academic and behavioral intervention are often scheduled to work in community businesses. One of the locations during the last eight years includes the Cornell Cooperative Farm where the students assist with routine maintenance, including raking the animal pens, and filling feed bags and filling wood chip bags for the animal pens. The students also perform light office work and bundle brochures according to school districts and schools.

“We have a great rapport with the farm,” Ms. Quatrale said. “The students enjoy going to the farm and interacting with the animals. The Cornell Cooperative farm is a great program and the students learn important work skills by volunteering their time.”",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3027745913958447&id=469936803072717,,0.0,"Life Skills Students Receive Cooperator Award

The District’s students celebrated the first 100 days of school on February 26 with special and engaging hands-on English language arts, mathematics and art activities to mark this momentous occasion for the district’s elementary-level students.

Many of the students arrived at their school entrances dressed as 100-year-olds or wearing T-shirts decorated with an array of 100 items. Science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics stations allowed students to build structures with Legos, Unifix cubes and plastic cups. Students honed reading skills while hunting for 100 site words posted in their classrooms and by listening to stories about the first 100 days of school. Many of the students made hats for the occasion that said “I am 100 days brighter” or “I am 100 days smarter.”

Kreamer Street Elementary School Principal Sean Clarke said it was a very special day for the students. “Through hard work, the students have met the academic challenges of the first 100 days of school.”",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2934120536654319&id=469936803072717,,0.0,"100 Days Smarter

Each student received rock wool, where they planted seeds for 28 plants including kale, basil, arugula, bib lettuce, gourmet lettuce and rainbow chard.

Having food available for those who need it binds families together and is one less worry.”

At present, PTA members and faculty will box food, based on requests, and families can call the main office to make an appointment for a pickup.

Struggling families in the Brookhaven Elementary School community now have an additional community resource with the opening of the new food pantry on Nov. 6. In collaboration with the school’s PTA organization, the pantry has been filled with nonperishables and paper goods donated by Island Harvest Food Bank.

Principal Dr. Rebecca Raymond said that 20 families in the school community have thus far reached out for assistance. “Students are at the heart of the community,” Dr. Raymond said. “It takes a village to raise a child. Having food available for those who need it binds families together and is one less worry.”

At present, PTA members and faculty will box food, based on requests, and families can call the main office to make an appointment for a pickup.

Superintendent of Schools Dr. Joseph Giani thanked Dr. Raymond and the PTA for their insight and help with the project. “We are very excited about this new resource, which will assist our neediest families,” he said.",2019-11-19 12:05:20,,

Throughout the district, students have been preparing for Halloween.

The Bellport High School Student Council held its Safe Trick or Treat program for students at Frank P. Long Intermediate School and Brookhaven, Kreamer Street and Verne W. Critz elementary schools. Dressed in Halloween costumes, the high school students visited classrooms where they gave tips for a safe Halloween. Some of the tips included abstaining from eating unwrapped candy, never entering a stranger’s home, staying in big groups and having parents check candy before eating it.

At each of the elementary schools, the PTA held pumpkin picking activities in the back of each schoolyard. Classes were escorted to the pumpkin patch by hayride where they chose their favorite orange gourds.

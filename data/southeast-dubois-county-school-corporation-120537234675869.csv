The USDA announced an emergency waiver which allows ALL students to receive a free breakfast and lunch each day at school. Due to limited breakfast supplies, we will begin offering free breakfast to all students on September 21.

The USDA waiver will be in effect until December 31, or until funds run out (whichever is first). Once the waiver or funds expire, breakfast and lunch will return to its normal price.

There will be no change to the menu or food items offered. Students may continue to purchase a la carte items at current pricing.

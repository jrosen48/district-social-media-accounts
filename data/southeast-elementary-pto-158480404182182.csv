Wowza! Thank you parents and community for supporting our “meet the staff”parade. We had a wonderful time and it was so good to see everyone.
We can’t wait to get the children back in school.

If you are bringing your child to school, pre-K through first grade, drop off your child off at the elementary wing. The second through fourth grade students need dropped off at the main 2 story building. Please drop your child off between 7:30 and 7:40, so they will have plenty of time to eat breakfast before class starts. For the first semester, breakfast will be free to all elementary students.

We will be taking the temperature of all the students and staff as they arrive and they will also sanitize their hands. Shortly after, the students will eat breakfast in their classrooms.

Please send your child with a backpack, mask, and water bottle.

It is so important, especially this year, to keep your phone number updated, so we can contact you in an emergency.

If you need anything, please call the office at 620-396-8211.

We would love to have teachers and informal educators (anyone who isn’t a K-12 teacher who provides education to kids - zoos, nature centers, extracurricular programs, etc.) join us for this call. It’s an opportunity to connect with your peers to do some group thinking around summer programming, sharing ideas, and supporting each other with virtual summer programming.

Many summer programs, camps, and even city pools are already deciding to cancel/remain closed for summer 2020. We hope to help you begin thinking about ways to engage home-bound kiddos over the summer! ☀️ Here's the link to join the call: https://global.gotomeeting.com/join/269338093

We are excited to announce that Kansas teachers, students and parents just got a new partner in their continuous learning efforts.

Thanks to the support of Kansas Public Broadcasters, Kansas students will receive supplemental education content by way of a new television program produced by Kansas PBS stations and KSDE, and hosted by local teachers. The new program called Learning Across Kansas will begin airing the week of April 20.

Each 30-minute segment, individually produced for elementary, middle school and high school students, will feature grade-specific educational content delivered by our very own Kansas teachers who serve on KSDE’s Continuous Learning Task Force.

Teachers, students and parents/caregivers, tune in for short, fun and engaging lessons. Plus, you just might see one of your own teachers presenting!

I stumbled across this poem today and I thought it was fitting for what is upon us. Everyone please take care, give the kids a hug for us, and we will conquer this together!
Mrs. Hall and Staff

Unity

I dreamed I stood in a studio
And watched two sculptors there,
The clay they used was a young child’s mind,
And they fashioned it with care.

One was a teacher; the tools he used
Were books and music and art;
One a parent with a guiding hand,
And a gentle, loving heart.

Day after day the teacher toiled,
With touch that was deft and sure,
While the parent labored by his side
And polished and smoothed it o’er.

And when at last their task was done,
They were proud of what they had wrought,
For the things they had molded into the child
Could neither be sold nor bought.

And each agreed he would have failed
If he had worked alone,
For behind the parent stood the school,
And behind the teacher, the home.

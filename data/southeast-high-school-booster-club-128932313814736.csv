Craw-Kan Telephone Cooperative Inc. Team of the Week from Southeast Kansas: Southeast-Cherokee football entered the year on a 28-game losing streak that dated back to 2014. The Lancers are now 4-2 with a rushing attack of 288 yards per game. QB Brett Malle has over 900 yards of offense while Zaden Hendricks & Jakob Tavernaro each have 360+ yards rushing & each lead the team in tackles w/ 41. Huge turnaround for a program that didn't score over 12 points in a game last year and were shutout in nearly half of their games. #sportsinkansas

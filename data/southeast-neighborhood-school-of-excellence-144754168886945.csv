While I am still awaiting final guidance from the Marion County Health Department, we have worked diligently over the past several months to develop a plan that promotes both in person and on-line learning opportunities (computers and hotspots being provided to those who need them) while promoting social distancing and appropriate screeners to help prevent sickness. It is my hope that on or before July 6th, a complete plan for re-entry can be shared. I look forward to seeing you all very soon!

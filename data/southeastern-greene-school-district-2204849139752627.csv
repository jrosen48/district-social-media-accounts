Dear Students,

We are currently in the process of assessing the possibility of having Prom at the Mapletown High School on July 17th. Prom will be open to all students who were in grades 9 through 12 during the 2019-2020 school year.

If you purchased a ticket already, please complete the attached Google Sheets survey. Those who do not plan on attending will be issued a refund. To receive a refund you must complete the form and enter that you do not plan to attend.



Students who wish to purchase a ticket should also complete this form and enter the number of tickets they plan on purchasing. Tickets are $50 per person.



Please complete this form by this Thursday, June 18, 2020. Once the survey is complete we will announce if we have enough participation to continue.

Prom 2020 Survey",3.0,"MAPLETOWN NEWS:

Dear Students,

We are currently in the process of assessing the possibility of having Prom at the Mapletown High School on July 17th. Prom will be open to all students who were in grades 9 through 12 during the 2019-2020 school year.

If you purchased a ticket already, please complete the attached Google Sheets survey. Those who do not plan on attending will be issued a refund. To receive a refund you must complete the form and enter that you do not plan to attend.



Students who wish to purchase a ticket should also complete this form and enter the number of tickets they plan on purchasing. Tickets are $50 per person.



Please complete this form by this Thursday, June 18, 2020. Once the survey is complete we will announce if we have enough participation to continue.

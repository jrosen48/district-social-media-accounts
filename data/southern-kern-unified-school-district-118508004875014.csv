Thank you for such a great turnout for schedule/laptop pickup!
However, if you haven't been able to pick up your schedule/laptop - here is the plan-

1. Bring all of your signed data confirmation with you to school.
2. Report to the attendance office windows to pick up your schedule.
3. If you have a math class you will be able to pick up your laptop then. No math class? Pickup you laptop during nutrition or lunch.

Big thanks again!🥰😘🧐

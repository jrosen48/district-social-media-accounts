Have you ever noticed how many different logos are associated with Southern Lehigh? Well, it's a new year and the district has revealed a new, streamlined look with a uniquely designed Spartan and font that show the world we are Southern Lehigh.

Between now and the end of the year, you will start to see our new Spartan appearing around the district. The administrative team is currently working on a process for sharing the logo and font with clubs and organizations that support our students and activities.

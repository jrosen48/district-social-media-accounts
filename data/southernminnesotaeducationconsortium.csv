The students planned the layouts of the board, went shopping for the items, and have been busy this week painting and attaching the objects to the boards. Once the boards are completed they will deliver the sensory boards to the preschool programs. A sensory board is basically a board on which you attach tactile and visual objects to be explored. Sensory boards are often used for young children to encourage stimulation of the senses and exploration through sensory play, a natural part of child development. The Transition students have really enjoyed being creative and being able to provide a fun educational tool for the younger students. We are very excited to see the finished projects!",2019-04-08 12:57:31,,

They learned how each day is very different, the importance of customer relations, and the differences due to locations - small town vs big town. They learned the different needs of flowers & plants and also the various service needs such as banquets, prom, funerals, and weddings. They learned the time commitment it takes to run a floral business and the difference between a varied schedule vs a student/teacher's structured schedule. They also learned some

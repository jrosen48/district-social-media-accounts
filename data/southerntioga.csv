One item Abaigeal included was a small American Paint horse replica. In her description she said, ""This object is important to me because I recently lost my own American Paint and this small horse is very similar. Her name was Hope.”

Arianna included a very special book from her grandmother. She explained, ""It's full of quotes about being a granddaughter.

March 20 at 1:24 PM ·

We know the coronavirus has created challenges for AP students and teachers. Here’s how the College Board will support you during this time:

1️⃣ We’re providing free, live and on-demand AP courses

To support AP students affected by school closures due to COVID-19, students and schools will have access to live AP review lessons, delivered by AP teachers from across the country. Lessons will begin March 25.

2️⃣ We’re developing a new at-home testing option

Because of the challenges created by COVID-19, we’re developing a new at-home AP Exam option. Students will be able to test on a computer, tablet, or smartphone.

We will invest so that every AP student impacted by COVID-19 has the tools and connectivity they need to review AP content online and take the exam from home.

During this challenging time, we will work to give every AP student the opportunity to earn the college credit and placement they’ve been working toward all year while maintaining a focus on the health and safety of our AP community.

The Wolf Administration will continue to monitor Covid-19 in the commonwealth, and at the end of 10 days will reevaluate and decide whether continued closure is needed.

As a result of this notice, the school will be closed as a precautionary measure to mitigate the transmission of the coronavirus. The school will remain closed until further notice. Only essential staff will be allowed entry into buildings. That list of personnel will be shared at a later date.

The closures affect all programming at the school, including before- and after-school activities, all athletic and extracurricular practices and competitions, and weekend events.

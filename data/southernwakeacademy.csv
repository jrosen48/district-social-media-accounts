The administration of SWA was made aware of a situation that happened in a middle school classroom last month in regards to a teacher taping a student’s mouth with masking tape. This was handled quickly and seriously by contacting parents and meeting with the teacher. Although inappropriate, the teacher's actions were not of a malicious intent. The teacher was placed on a disciplinary action plan for the remainder of the school year. The parents were contacted in regards to what disciplinary action took place and were extended an invitation weeks ago with dates and times to meet with both the teacher and administration.

As many of you know, Google came to our school a couple months ago and beta tested a new app for our students. The app introduces augmented reality to the classroom. It is a huge resource for teachers and students to be able to show students what certain concepts look like in person. If you would look to learn more, follow the link below.

We are going to try to build some sets of devices for next year so teachers can take advantage of this app. We are asking if you have any old iPhones or Android phones that you're not using to consider donating them to the school for us to use with the Google AR app. If you have any questions just email me at rumcbride@swake.org.

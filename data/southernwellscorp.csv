Rose-Hulman’s AskRose Homework Help has added daytime hours to help homebound students better understand math and science homework problems from their virtual or online classes during the current coronavirus public health crisis that has led to many schools moving to an e-learning environment.

Free homework help is now available Monday through Friday from noon to 3 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time) by a phone call, email or chat session. Our traditional hours remain unchanged: Sunday through Thursday from 7-10 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time.)

Students may call 877-ASK-ROSE (877-275-7673) or email and chat on our AskRose website, AskRose.org. The site also offers more than 500 resources available through videos and downloadable reference materials.

Rose-Hulman students also are doing remote learning but are able to continue offering this service from locations throughout the country.

One adaptation to this year's Michigan Poetry Out Loud (POL) program was a video recitation contest. Many of this year's 36 school champions recorded and shared their three memorized poems, and the original panel of State Finals judges provided feedback. In the weeks ahead, we'll share videos from four students whose recitations received the highest scores.

Today, we're highlighting the powerful recitation skills of Elizabeth Ajaero. Elizabeth is concluding her senior year at University High School Academy of Southfield Public Schools, and her POL lead teacher is Torrie Maas. Here, Elizabeth recites ""Confessions,"" by Robert Browning.

Thank you, Elizabeth, for sharing your recitation with us, and congratulations on this achievement!

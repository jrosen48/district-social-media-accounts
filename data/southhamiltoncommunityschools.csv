This project is supported by the USDA-ARS Unit on the Iowa State University campus, where they maintain a Monarch butterfly colony all year long. For this project, monarch eggs are provided to educators so that every student in the classroom can rear a monarch butterfly from egg, caterpillar, chrysalis, to adult. This project starts at the beginning of the school year. Since it takes a month to develop from egg to adult butterfly, the timing is perfect for the reared butterflies to hopefully join the fall migration to Mexico. The Monarch Egg Project is funded by an Iowa DNR REAP-CEP grant.

Senior year is an important time for high school students — it’s a time to celebrate the hard work of the past 12 school years as well as say goodbye to teachers, classmates and friends as they embark on their new journeys into college or their selected career paths.

The class of 2020 may not get to experience those moments — but we would like to highlight them!

Submit your high school senior's photo at wcsy.com and tell us their story. All submissions are entered to win CASH PRIZES, including:

Another exciting moment was the announcement of the 2021 game theme: FIRST Game Changers. It's odd to think about next season when we are still sad about missing out on so much with this season, but if you know anything about our team, you know that Ramageddon team members are some of the most resilient people you will ever meet.

Each Club in our District is invited to nominate a member who has made an extraordinary contribution to the Club over the past year.

The District invited each club to give a two-word descriptive of their nominee. President-elect Dan Thompson chose ""Meeting Savior""

Steve has been an active South Haven Rotarian since 2018. In that short time he has faithfully participated in all club activities. His biggest impact on our club have been his ability to make the audio visual equipment at the Wellness Center and other locations work. He comes early to help speakers connect their computers to the Center's equipment. Steve's easy-going demeanor during times of stress is applauded.

Steve's ""real job"" is coordinating all of the technology for South Haven Public Schools. Can you imagine his challenges during this time of crisis!

Thank you to Officer Wildey for helping students in Mr. Dubbink's class understand the justice system and how it impacts each of our lives today. Officer Wildey spoke about Supreme Court cases that shape how Law Enforcement handles situations. Students were particularly interested in amendments about citizens natural rights, including the right to bear arms, search and seizure, rights to an attorney, and due process. Officer Wildey spoke about the importance of Supreme Court cases and the effect they have on all of us and the Constitution's influence over what Law Enforcement both can and cannot do. Students had far more questions for Officer Wildey than time permitted. Several students walked away with an interest in a career in Law Enforcement. Everyone left with a better understanding of the justice system.

A huge thank you to all of our families and community members that sponsored another child - because of you, every child at Maple Grove and North Shore had the opportunity to create a gift! At Lincoln, every child was able to purchase a gift from the holiday shop, either with money from home or sponsored by the PTO. North Shore also had a shop where purchases could be made with PBIS points!

Thank you, again, to everyone who came together to make this happen this holiday season! Check out the pictures below courtesy of Maple Grove Elementary PTO, Lincoln Rams PTO, SH North Shore Elementary PTO, Lincoln Elementary School, Maple Grove Elementary and SH North Shore Elementary but don't look too close or you may ruin your holiday surprise! :)",2019-12-19 12:09:04,,

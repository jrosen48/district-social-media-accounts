Good Morning,

To alleviate some possible confusion, I want to clarify pick up expectations for educational materials. This message only refers to HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT MATERIALS.

The vast majority of high school students WILL NOT have items to pick up at the high school during the hours communicated by Mr. Slater.

ONLY families who indicated on the Family Resource Survey that they have LIMITED INTERNET CONNECTIVITY or NO INTERNET will have hard copies of materials packaged for pick up from the high school.

We will communicate directly with families that have materials here to pick up, after pick up hours are over. If you feel that you can manage without picking up materials for your high school student, please do not come to school during pick up this week.

We will be handing out materials to ALL STUDENTS in grades K-8 during pick up hours this week.

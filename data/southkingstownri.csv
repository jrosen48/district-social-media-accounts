High winds (sustained winds higher than 40 mph) can cause downed trees and power lines, which may lead to power outages, transportation disruptions, damage to buildings and vehicles, and injury or death.

During a high wind event, the safest place to be is inside- but if you are caught outside- watch for flying debris. High winds can turn branches into projectiles during a storm. Tree limbs may break, and street signs may become loose during strong wind gusts. Keep an eye toward nearby balconies for loose objects that may fall.",0.0,"Important info to keep in mind now and in the future from Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency

Last week, Rhode Island’s school districts submitted their plans for opening schools in the fall. The teams at the Department of Education and the Department of Health are reviewing those plans in collaboration with local leaders to determine the best path forward. Every decision we make around reopening schools will be guided by science and data. I’m going to be upfront and transparent with you about our thinking every step of the way. We’re going to cut through the frenzy and present just the facts.

The Department of Education and I will be hosting a virtual forum on schools with different stakeholders every week. You can tune in every Thursday at 3 p.m on my Facebook page. The first forum will be July 23rd with two prominent pediatricians.

Businesses planning to reopen on Monday should visit reopeningri.com to review guidelines and access the template for the COVID-19 control plan. Please complete that plan before you reopen.

A few weeks ago, I outlined these four data points we’re watching closely as we track the trends of this virus. I’m excited to announce that all four of these metrics are where we want them to be, and because of that, we can officially move into Phase 2 on Monday.

Businesses planning to reopen on Monday should visit reopeningri.com to review guidelines and access the template for the COVID-19 control plan. Please complete that plan before you reopen.

As a reminder, if you’re a small business looking for masks and cleaning solutions, Rhode Island Commerce is making these available through industry associations and local chambers of commerce. Visit commerceri.com for more information.",2020-05-29 19:43:49,,

It's no secret that art can be a source of comfort, strength, and hope in difficult times. That’s something I think all Rhode Islanders need right now. So today, I’m announcing an initiative for all Rhode Islanders to connect through art during this difficult time. I'm inviting Rhode Islanders of all ages to create and share family-friendly art - drawings, poetry, songs, essays, photographs, videos, or any preferred medium - inspired by this unique & challenging time. Rhode Islanders can share artwork by posting it on social media with the tag #RIArts. Creations can also be submitted via email or mail to the Rhode Island State Council on the Arts. We want to see art from everyone – professional artists, students of all ages, and adults of all ages.

We've also launched RIArts.org. If you’re an artist, you can go to this website to connect with resources available to support artists. If you’re someone who is missing the arts, you can go to RIArts.org to get an up-to-date list of all the performances (music, film, theater) going on virtually around the state.",2.0,"#RIArts

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT FLUSH WIPES. This problem has been so bad that DEM issued two press releases in the last few days, as many communities are having these issues. Unfortunately, due to recent issues with wipes the Town is going to have to spend close to $6,000 for cleaning and repairs at our Wastewater Treatment Facility. Keep in mind it’s not just the Wastewater Treatment Facilities that have problems, this could happen to you, with sewer backups into your home or basement. When we are all being told to stay home, that’s the last thing we want to happen. We can all do our part by disposing of wipes in the trash - not the toilet.

Did you know that new Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) have been prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)? These FIRMs are used to assess vulnerability of properties and buildings to flooding and can impact requirements for flood insurance on properties. The new FIRMs will become effective on April 3, 2020. Prior to this the FEMA and RIEMA, along with Connecticut Department of Energy & Environmental Protection, will be hosting an Open House to provide information to property owners. Details for the Open House can be found on the attached flyer.

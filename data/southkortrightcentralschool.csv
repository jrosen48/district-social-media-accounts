*We will not be having K-10 awards. This was decided because many of our awards are supported by community individuals and businesses. I did not think it was appropriate at this time to ask for those donations. Our traditional awards will return next year.
Due to no in-person summer school allowed, we will not have summer driver education, summer school, or CROP.
We will have a modified in-person graduation limited to the graduate and parents scheduled in a sequence to avoid a gathering over 10 people. This will be a recorded event and sent to families.
The District has put together a re-opening leadership team that includes students. We have begun our planning.

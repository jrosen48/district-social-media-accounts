As you already know, school is in session for a full day today, Friday, March 13, 2020, to allow students to meet with their teachers and prepare for the extended closure. Since students will be out of school for an extended period, we want to make sure they have a chance to connect with teachers, collect books/materials, and bring home any personal items. The full day of school will also allow families time to make arrangements for childcare during the closure.

Additional information will go out to our community later today.

Superintendent",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2821149681287196&id=335583386510517,,0.0,"Dear South Lake Schools Community:

Last evening Governor Gretchen Whitmer announced the closure of all K-12 school districts in Michigan, beginning Monday, March 16, 2020. This closure by our governor runs through Sunday, April 5, 2020.

As you already know, school is in session for a full day today, Friday, March 13, 2020, to allow students to meet with their teachers and prepare for the extended closure. Since students will be out of school for an extended period, we want to make sure they have a chance to connect with teachers, collect books/materials, and bring home any personal items. The full day of school will also allow families time to make arrangements for childcare during the closure.

Additional information will go out to our community later today.

Sincerely,

Theodore VonHiltmayer
Superintendent",2020-03-13 09:10:53,,

The world for our children is changing at an incredible pace. In South Lake, we are taking steps to keep our students at the cutting edge of learning and trying to ensure that every student graduates from our schools with the skills they need to go out in the world and be successful. As part of those efforts, we are investigating the idea of equipping all students in grades 5 – 12 with a computing device that would allow them to learn and complete school work at their convenience. We are also planning on equipping elementary classrooms with a set of devices for use within the classroom.

As part of this effort, we are seeking some input from parents and the community in regard to perceptions around the use of technology in education and the technology resources available to students within their homes. We are asking that all parents of children in South Lake complete the following short survey so that we can better understand the needs within the community.

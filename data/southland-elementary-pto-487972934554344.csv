It is with great regret that Southland Community Education has decided to cancel all in person Community Education activities indefinitely due to safety concerns surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic. This includes Summer Rec and the Pool Bus. Drivers Training is being moved back to start August 17th and we are currently looking for ways to offer our Speed and Agility camp through a virtual medium, more information will be coming as we develop a more concrete plan.

The safety of our kids is our number one priority at this time. If we get to a point where it is determined to be safe to resume large gatherings, we will look into opening some camps and activities back up.

PLAY OF THE WEEK: Southland's Novell Jackson cannot be stopped. This time he took down a King brother, beating Eli King's insane touchdown catch and run, to stay on top as the reigning play of the week. The latest challenger to Jackson is the Byron Bears boy's soccer team. Byron ended Lourdes' 20 year HVL winning streak, behind goals from Andy Lambrecht and Adam Krakora. Vote for your favorite play, the winner will advance to next week's contest and has a chance to become our Play of the Year. You can watch both plays here: https://kttc.com/sport/sports-extra/2019/09/27/play-of-the-week-9-27/",0.0,"KTTC TV created a poll.

Today, we showcase and celebrate
MS. GIA FOX!

Gia Fox is a happy, positive young woman who sees her destiny following in the path of healthcare. Specifically, she sees herself becoming a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Nurse (NICU) because of how much she adores newborn babies. She knows that she will have to work hard to become a registered nurse, but she's up for the challenge.

Her favorite memory will always be when she stepped out onto the court for her last home game on her beloved Southland Volleyball Team. But NO ONE will forget that Gia Fox may likely be the biggest JUICE WRLD fan on Planet Earth.

She's been dreaming of enrolling in a college in Florida where many of her family currently resides. While COVID-19 may have affected her plans, she has finally decided to move forward with her dreams of taking her talents to Florida.

She has decided...and it's
MIAMI DADE COLLEGE!

We wish Gia all the best in sunny Florida!!!!
Congratulations Gia & The Class of 2020!

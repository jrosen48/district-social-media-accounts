It is with great regret that Southland Community Education has decided to cancel all in person Community Education activities indefinitely due to safety concerns surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic. This includes Summer Rec and the Pool Bus. Drivers Training is being moved back to start August 17th and we are currently looking for ways to offer our Speed and Agility camp through a virtual medium, more information will be coming as we develop a more concrete plan.

The safety of our kids is our number one priority at this time. If we get to a point where it is determined to be safe to resume large gatherings, we will look into opening some camps and activities back up.

After the best regular season since 2005 your Bulldog wrestling team has earned the #1 seed in sections. We’ll wrestle Thursday night in GM at 7pm against either W-K or Triton. We’ll then wrestle Saturday in the semi finals against the winner of Chatfield/Caledonia. We need all fans there to support our efforts to get back to state for the first time in 15 seasons!! My ask of you is to make this a priority!!! Our wrestlers need and more importantly deserved to have us pack the stands as they try to win a section championship. If I coached you or your child I’m asking this as a personal favor. Our kids deserve to have the loudest cheering section in the civic center!!! Think back to when you or your child wrestled. Fan support plays a huge roll!! I better see you Saturday! Current parents and fans, make personal calls and ask for family and friends to support our team!!! Feel free to share. And remember, this is Southlands team too! Past Rebels please come and support your boys!",0.0,"Troy Gilbert

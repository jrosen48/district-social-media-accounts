If your student is absent due to illness, you must contact the office at 219-474-5167 by 9:00 am to report the absence and the reason for the absence. Students who are ill with a symptom consistent with COVID-19 will need to provide medical documentation of an alternative diagnosis or documentation of a negative COVID-19 test before being cleared to return to school. This documentation must be brought to the office prior to the student's return to school. Without this documentation, your student will need to remain home for ten days and be symptom/fever free for 24 hours before returning to school. Students may only join class remotely after the office has been notified of the absence and they are quarantined or out due to the ten day window, students cannot just choose to join remotely. We are very fortunate to be able to offer this option of remote learning in these situations in order for our students to stay current with their coursework.

Educational technology and its funding change daily. To keep up with these changes and their accompanying expenses, our school is participating in Murphy's Food King's Apples for the Students Program. The Apples for the Students Program enables our school to earn computers and iPads, sporting goods, audio visual equipment, and science supplies, with choices from hundreds of other awards, too! And, they’re all free! To earn these FREE awards we simply have to collect as many register receipts as possible from September 1st, 2020, through March 1st, 2021. Ask your friends and relatives to shop at Murphy's and save every receipt and deposit in the box for South Newton located by the exit door. You may also send the receipts to school with your student as often as possible. The school will count the value of the register tapes collected and redeem them for great educational awards that benefit your child. Thank you in advance for your participation!",5.0,"SN Middle

Welcome to September :)
I just want to thank parents and students personally for their understanding about the cold grab n go lunches(rebel meal) for the month of August. The administration team all come together and agreed that in these uncertain times and with reopening school very cautiously, and with all the changes that we would start the year this way.
The students have been great about keeping socially apart and dealing with the changes in a positive way.
With all that being said, we will still have limited choices and everything will be in closed containers but we will again be having hot lunches starting in September with the second option being the cold rebel meal. Thank you again!!",0.0,"South Newton Food Services

Sadly, our annual Back to School Night has been cancelled. However, we realize that the first day of middle school can be very tense for our new 6th grade students. So as not to conflict with elementary back to school video conferences, on Tuesday, August 11, at 6:00 p.m., the 6th grade team will be hosting an optional panel discussion via Zoom to introduce themselves, discuss 6th grade, and answer questions. All 6th grade students should be checking their email later this week for a brief survey that will allow them to list their most pressing questions because we hope to answer them!",0.0,"SN Middle

Attached is the South Newton School Corporation 2020-2021 Re-Entry Plan. The Plan will answer many questions you might have about bringing our staff and students back to school safely. As you will see, the first page of the Plan mentions how fluid the Coronavirus situation is, as well as our school being required to follow mandated guidelines set forth by state or federal governments. This plan was finalized last week, then voted on by the South Newton Board of Trustees last evening. Between the time of the Plan being finalized and voted on, Governor Holcomb has mandated facemasks for the state of Indiana. This mandate includes inside school buildings, specifically for students in grades three and higher. The mandate also includes all adults in school buildings. While the South Newton plan “recommends” the use of facemasks, until further notice, we will require facemasks (for grades three and higher) until the Governor’s mandate is lifted.

Sincerely,
Mr. Hall

** Please try to limit the number of family and guests that are attending. Please follow the CDC Guidelines for all Hoosiers.
**Please maintain a social distance of 6 feet per family
** We strongly recommend face coverings to protect others and yourself
**Use precautions, Be respectful of others and Be Safe
**After graduation please return to your vehicles as quickly as possible and go enjoy this honorable day away from school

I have attached information about athletics for this coming fall. You will see that last year's physical will be recognized, with some exceptions. You will also find a link to Family ID. You will have to sign up for every sport you play. Before you can sign up for a sport you will have to make an account. If you have already done this you will not have to do it again. On May 22 Family ID will open up for the Fall season .Last thing. The school year is coming to a close. Make sure all your school work is done and handed in. Eligibility will be checked by the average of your 3rd 9 weeks and 4th 9 weeks grade. The IHSAA has stated that there are no waivers to the eligibility rules, all students must meet academic requirements to participate.

I hope to see everyone back in the building in the fall. Stay safe.

Hello Everyone,
I hope everyone is home, safe and healthy. As many of you know, the IHSAA has cancelled the remainder of the spring season. Summer schedules and practices are also on hold until we get further direction from the state. As soon as we know what & when we can start summer activities we will let you know.

I have had questions about the sports physicals. Right now we have these on hold until we are allowed to gather back in the school. Currently there are no plans for the physicals until July or August.

Lastly all of those who made contact with their spring coach and signed up will be given a varsity letter for this spring.

With recent events and schools being closed, we want to help. We know theres families whos kids eat breakfast and lunch at school ( I know this 1st hand as our child is one..and I had to go ""shopping"" for those extra meals just recently), not everyone is able to right off the bat with the extreme and sudden decision that was made. So we're going to try and help, if for some reason your child needs lunch we will offer a personal pizza (or other size depending on how many kiddos) for free. We're checking in with our vendors for other options ie hotdogs etc. We ask that this gesture isnt abused and only for the families in need so someone in need isnt going without or deplete our resources (we're a mom and pop place not big corporate). These orders will have to be for ""togo"" as we're a 21+ establishment. Our plan is to do this until school is back in session or a forced closure. Please be kind and patient with one another we're all in this together 💙

South Newton was grateful enough to send two members from our Chapter Officer team, a member from our Greenhand Officer team, and two members from our discovery officer team to LDW.

This was an awesome opportunity to work with every level in our FFA organization! At LDW our members got to update our chapter’s plan of action, set up a thorough service project/LTS plan, and set goals for our newly revamped Ag community breakfast as well as set goals for FFA week!

The South Newton FFA LDW attendees can not wait to further discuss and present all these wonderful ideas to the rest of the South Newton FFA!!",2020-02-02 22:04:40,,

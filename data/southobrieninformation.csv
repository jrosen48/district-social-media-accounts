We have decided that we will be allowing 8th grade students the opportunity to play high school baseball and softball this summer. We have freshman schedules that will be filled with a combination of incoming and outgoing freshman.

If you are an 8th grader and you desire to play this summer, please reach out to your sport's head coach if you have not already done so (Baseball-Tanner Petersen, tpetersen@soswolverines.org; Softball-Heather Struve, hstruve@soswolverines.org) and let them know your interest so they can make appropriate accommodations.

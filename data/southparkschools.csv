The All Star Teacher award is dedicated to those who are making a significant difference in the lives of students across the region by providing engaging instruction and curriculum, encouraging lifelong learning, and inspiring a passion for education beyond the classroom and into the future.

As an All Star teacher, Mrs. Thurner received a $1,000 donation to use for her classroom. She’ll also be treated to a VIP experience at PNC Park when games are allowed to occur with fans. That experience will include an on-field, pregame recognition.

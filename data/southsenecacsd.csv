The second grade students who attend the South Seneca Central School District South Seneca Elementary School enjoyed having educators from Seneca County Cornell Cooperative Extension join them in the classroom. The Educators read this year’s NYS Agriculture Literacy Book, Right This Very Minute to the students to start Agricultural Literacy Week a bit early. Right This Very Minute is a story that is about where our food comes from and encourages us to “thank a farmer.”. The students enjoyed hearing the story, playing a matching game about the sources of the foods we eat, all while learning about agriculture. 🍀

Michael Garvey, Slade Gardener and Chuck George, owners of Center Street Technologies, introduced the boys to the world of possibilities that come from a career in engineering and design. They were impressed by the enormous size of the 3-D printer, the complexities of the electrical panels and thrilled to meet Alex the engineer.

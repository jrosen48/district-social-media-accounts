The Huntingburg Kiwanis are proud supporters of the youth in our community!

Recently, Huntingburg Kiwanis members Mandy Allen of German American Bank and Sara Schroeder of the Huntingburg Chamber of Commerce presented a check to Xavier Horton during a special moment at Southridge Middle School.

Xavier received a check for $500 to go towards his Eagle Scout project at Freedom Reins Therapeutic Riding Center. He is building a therapy room for the children that receive services through Freedom Reins. Good job Xavier on being an active member of your community!

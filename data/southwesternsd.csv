Our Yearbook Company is finally back open as of today, May 18th. Unfortunately, due to the shut-down, the yearbook company now has to catch up on all of their printing for high schools and universities throughout the country. This means that our yearbooks will NOT be in by mid-June as we had hoped back in April. Our delivery date to the school is now set for between July 16th - July 21st.

As the date nears closer, we will receive updates from the company and then we will be able to make our distribution / extra sales plan with the admin team.

We know this is not the news you wanted to hear, but please know that we will be working on a plan to get the yearbook to you as soon as we can once they arrive in July.

Until then, we are taking names for anyone who wishes to purchase one of our extra yearbooks. We have about 30 left, so don't delay! You may email us at swhsequestrian@gmail.com to get your name on the list.

""What's Highlighter"", you ask?
Highlighter is a back-to-school event, hosted at Church on Fire for students that have a need for school supplies.

It's on Friday, August 7th from 6-8 p.m.

We decided to make some changes this year to make sure that everyone was still able to get supplies, and also stay as safe as possible!

So... this year we will be hosting a drive-through school supply distribution. Supplies will be for any student in ANY district grade K-12. We will hold the drive-through supply distribution at Church on Fire in Harrison, OH (10544 Harrison Ave., Harrison, OH 45030) You will enter the line through the backside of the old KMart Plaza (next to Frischs).

Even though it won't be our normal huge party, we will still have fun ways for your kids to engage with the event while waiting in line in your car. Covid isn't going to take ALL our fun!

We hope to see you then! Please, invite some friends and anyone you think might need some help!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3117766351671395&id=730271807087540,,0.0,"From our friends at Church on Fire:

The 138th annual Wm. Henry Harrison High School Alumni Association is scheduled for Saturday, May 30, 2020. Due to COVID-19, we will not be having our traditional dinner with the meeting. This year the William Henry Harrison Alumni Association will only have the meeting. The regulations at the time of the meeting will determine how many can attend or if it will be conducted virtually.

To view our annual invitation visit https://www.southwestschools.org/about-our-district/alumni-association-7/ . We still encourage members to send their dues and consider donating to our scholarship fund. Scholarships will still be awarded as usual this year as usual.

This is not a drill! We talked John Morris Russell from your Cincinnati Pops Orchestra into giving us a lesson on conducting. So grab a chopstick, or a spoon, or maybe a pencil and conduct along with one of Cincinnati's favorite people! (And be sure to post some pictures of your young maestros in the comments!)

Farmers Market and Food Updates:

The farmers market will still be taking place tonight with some modifications. It will be a drive-through only. We will need people to drive through the back side of the old Kmart building, and all the way around the back side of the Plaza. We will be serving people out of the back side of our building as usual just bringing the food directly to cars.

We will continue to take the Food Truck around on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. We will do a separate post on that with the times and locations, or go to:
Notinourtown.info for the full list.

If you are a student or elderly adult in the Southwest Local area with an emergency food need, please text:

We love you and are praying for all our Harrison friends.

We are still collecting for MDA this week so please send your donations with your students. We also will be selling bracelets again at lunch for $1. We hit the next teacher dare threshold - hallway swimming. We know that those halls are clean at the end of the day!! Thank you Ms. Helmer, Ms. Tracy, Mrs. Miller, and Mrs. Brown for getting dirty for MDA!",0.0,"Crosby Elementary School, Harrison Ohio

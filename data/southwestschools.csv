Her best teaching memory happened when a student was so engrossed in understanding that he began a question with “Grandma” instead of “Teacher” or “Ms. Beal.”

Her message to her team is this, ""Everyone has a place, a voice, a skill that is needed. It’s what a child gets from each person that builds their character.""

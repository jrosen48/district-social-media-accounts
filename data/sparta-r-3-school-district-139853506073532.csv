Thank you for helping us get the school year off to a great start! Your support and willingness to help with our safety protocols during the first week of school have been great. The new structures we have put in place are an effort to continue to provide seated classes throughout the year. We ask that you continue to reinforce the necessity of this with your students at home as well. It is great to have your children back in the buildings!

Also, we hope our students choosing virtual learning options had a great first week as well! Please continue to reach out to your student's building offices and teachers for any questions you may have. We are encouraged by the positive responses from our parent contacts this week.

Our grab and go teams also helped distribute other items to students and families. We appreciate their great effort this week. Also thank you to Mrs. Nichols to helping to get student band instruments handed out.

Next week our food pick up and delivery will be moving to single pick up on Monday nights from 5-6 PM. Meals will continue be available at Sparta High School, Bruner Baptist Church, Sparta Christian Church, and Sparta First Baptist.

We appreciate Southern Missouri Containers who have generously donated 450 boxes to help with packaging these meals.

Earlier today, area leaders met to discuss COVID-19 and its impact on local school districts and communities. At that time, a decision was made to move forward with a 2-week extended school closure. This step is being taken to help ensure the health, safety, and well-being of our students and staff.

This closure will begin Monday, March 23rd and go through Friday, April 3rd. During this time, all school activities, including athletic and extracurricular practices and competitions, will be canceled.

The decision to close the district was extremely difficult, made in consultation with area superintendents, health department officials and out of an abundance of caution for our families.

As the week progresses, I will be sharing more information with our staff and community. Our immediate focus will be to provide food-service options to students starting next week. The administrative team will be working together in the coming days to develop our approach to the two-week closure.

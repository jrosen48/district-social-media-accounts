Sparta Public Schools ordered a variety of personal protective equipment for staff and students as they prepare for face-to-face instruction. Students have a choice of two different washable face masks. Teachers will be issued see-through plastic face masks, sometimes known as ""communicator masks,"" so students can see their smiles. The masks are also a huge benefit to the deaf and hard of hearing. Our Janice Holst covers Sparta schools and snapped this photo today.

ANOTHER BIG WIN!!

Cody James Stamann shows up and dominates his opponent for a 30-27 unanimous decision victory. Cody looked amazing and we couldn’t be happier for him.

Our condolences go out to Cody, and his entire family for the loss of Jacob. You are a true inspiration with what you were able to do tonight, with such a heavy heart 🙏

As part of our district preparation and planning for full implementation of our Continuity of Learning plan, our educators will be attempting to make contact with every student and family this week. We need to determine how to best meet your child's learning needs, and what additional supports we can provide to assist in that process. Because most of our staff is being asked to work remotely, many phone calls that staff will make may come from a restricted or unfamiliar number. We wanted to inform you so that you can be aware of that and hopefully take the call. Once we have gathered all necessary information, we will work to provide all resources and support that are necessary to implement our learning plan. Please do not hesitate to email your child's teachers if you have any questions or do not receive a call by Thursday of this week. We appreciate your support as we all work together to do our best during this extraordinary time!!

As many of you wrap up the year, we want your input on what’s going to happen this fall.

We're using a new tool called Thoughtexchange to gather your input. You'll be asked to answer one open-ended question with as many responses as you'd like and then move on to the next step which is Star. In Star, you'll see your thoughts and the thoughts of others and assign stars to each thought (from 1-5) depending on how strongly you agree or disagree with the idea.
Thoughtexchange keeps confidential who shared each thought and who assigned what ratings. You can rate as many thoughts as you'd like before moving on to Discover where you can see all the thoughts sorted by the average star rating.

You can also navigate by using the bar across the top to go back and share more ideas or star some more thoughts at any time.

District Three had a unanimous vote (9-0) to reschedule the referendum for July 14 as requested by Governor McMaster's executive orders.

If this referendum passes, it’ll provide a significant tax cut for District Three residents and businesses. It’ll also allow the District to renovate and upgrade all schools more than a decade faster than having to pay for it a little bit at a time. If the referendum passes, the board would no longer have to access the 8% debt limit annually, therefore, making constituents’ taxes cheaper on a yearly basis and in the long run.

If the Governor removes restrictions and we are able to safely hold small community discussions, we will plan town hall meetings on the days leading up to the election. Until then, we plan to hold virtual meetings and send information via mail to try to spread the word about the new election date and encourage constituents to get out and vote.

We also understand some people might want to avoid the polls during this time and would like to encourage anyone who feels uncomfortable to vote absentee.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3447341541959883&id=167271783300225,"GOUPSTATE.COM

Mrs. Ruth Kirby Schoonover sent this photo to me from Broome this morning. It’s a photo of the gifts you dropped off this week after they have been sorted.
I asked if there was anything that needed to be increased over another and she said no that you guys nailed it with a great assortment! Thank you friends. We are starting week two now.

Because of the Covid 19 epidemic we are experiencing a higher than normal amount of families that are in need within our D3 communities. Because of this Mrs. Ruth Kirby Schoonover has identified new families and has asked Cnc Thunder to become a collection point for any gifts of non perishable goods, hygiene goods, food gift cards and cleaning supplies.
This project is named #D3givesback.

I’m just going to leave this right here.

This scoreboard tells a story that these Senior athletes will never forget. We were all saddened to hear that their senior seasons that they had trained for since probably childhood came to an end so abruptly. 😥

Tonight instead of a ball field standing next to their parents, these athletes were recognized one by one as they drove up in their cars to a stop line where their accolades were read aloud. With their friends and family left to honk their horns as each athlete was recognized by the sport they played.

Let us never forget this Senior group of Centurions and what they mean to the history of our Getty’s D. Broome family.

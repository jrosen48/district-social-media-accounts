Additionally, students and staff must wear a face covering when entering a school building, moving through the hallways, during carline/drop off or pickup, and when social distancing is not possible or optimal.

Spartanburg Four is starting the school year using a hybrid model and in most cases, students will not be required to wear a face covering inside a classroom or during special activities outside the classroom while under the hybrid model. Based on the activity and proximity of the students, the teacher will determine when a mask is needed.

Special considerations will be made for those students who are younger than two years old, who have trouble breathing, who are unable to remove the covering without assistance, and those with special healthcare or educational needs (IEP, 504, IHP).",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2475893219367361&id=1939009899722365,,0.0,"UPDATE:

Dear SC Teacher,
Before you scroll because the last thing you want to read about is more politics, I ask you to give me just a second of your time. I promise this is not political. What I propose is that you make a decision? Not a political decision. Not even a candidate decision, but a right-now-in-this-moment decision to have the best school year ever in 2020-2021. Make a decision, no matter the situation or circumstances, that you will speak life into your students, and your classroom will be one of positivity whether in person or virtually. Make a decision that when people speak negatively of you, your profession, or even of your students that their opinions (and that is truly all they are) don’t have a place in your mind, heart, or classroom. We are teachers. We do the impossible each and everyday, and we can decide to do education in 2020 better than ever.

Dear SC Teacher,
Before you scroll because the last thing you want to read about is more politics, I ask you to give me just a second of your time. I promise this is not political. What I propose is that you make a decision? Not a political decision. Not even a candidate decision, but a right-now-in-this-moment decision to have the best school year ever in 2020-2021. Make a decision, no matter the situation or circumstances, that you will speak life into your students, and your classroom will be one of positivity whether in person or virtually.

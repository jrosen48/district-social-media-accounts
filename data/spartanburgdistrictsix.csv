If you are not able to pick up a meal at a school bus stop, we will offer a drive-through pick up service at all District Six elementary and middle schools between 11 am and 1 pm. SC Governor Henry McMaster has asked everyone to limit gatherings of large crowds. Therefore, we ask for parents using the drive-through meal service to stay in their cars and meals will be handed to you by our employees. Walk-up students will be given meals but should not eat them on our school campus. As always, the safety and well-being of our students and community is our first priority. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact our food service department at (864) 216-4350.",2020-03-15 20:00:22,,

According to Sahiyd’s parents, he jumped into the lake to save his brother, who appeared to have been caught in a current. He was able to get his brother to shore, but unfortunately Sahiyd did not make it. Sahiyd was a sophomore who genuinely cared for others. He loved to sing and was actively involved in the Dorman chorus. We ask that you keep his family in your thoughts and prayers. Sahiyd’s siblings also attend District Six schools. His family has created a Gofundme page to help cover the expense of this unexpected tragedy. If you are interested in assisting the family in this way, you may donate through the link below.

This flyer outlines only the highlights of the district's PHASE I requirements. Each high school will communicate further details outlining PHASE I procedures in the coming days.

Will there be morning 4K classes?
- In the event of a 2-hour delay, Spartanburg One does not hold morning 4K preschool classes.

What should high school students taking classes off-campus do during a delay?
- The district will provide transportation to off-campus programs on a delayed schedule. For example, if a bus normally leaves a high school campus at 8 AM, it will leave at 10 AM during a 2-hour delay. However, if a student needs to arrive before that time, parents may take the student off-campus or the student may drive.

What time will school buildings be open on a 2-hour delay?
- All school buildings will be open to students beginning at 9 AM in the event of a 2-hour delay.

“As a school librarian, I believe it is my job to help our students find the right books to compliment their interests and help increase their abilities. My firm belief is that reading-in any form-is an advantage that can help our students succeed beyond the walls of our school. This includes the use of non-traditional formats such as graphic novels and audiobooks. Reading for pleasure increases our awareness of the world and introduces our students to new ideas,” states Smith.

Smith was selected out of five secondary teachers across the district who were nominated by their colleagues for motivating students to read, developing reading skills, and inspiring a love and appreciation of reading in their students.

These are in addition to a number of assistant directing credits around the Chicago area, and time spent as the assistant to Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and screenwriter Doug Wright.

Passionate for Human Rights advocacy, Eli is also a facilitator for Unsilence, a social justice organization dedicated to illuminating hidden injustices through interactive storytelling.

Join us for a SHADOW DAY at SPCPA to find out!

Intended for PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS, Shadow Days give the opportunity to see a school day through the eyes of a student. Prospective students will be paired with an SPCPA host in the grade level they would be entering into, and the arts program that most interests them. They get to follow their host throughout the school day as they attend academic and arts courses.

Our fall shadow dates are set and we'd love for you to join us!

A shout out to SPCPA Musical Theatre Department Chair, Joey Clark, who was the Vocal Coach for the national anthem this past weekend at the Final Four at US Bank Stadium. He was selected by the NCAA and hired to coach and arrange the piece. The performers were four student athletes chosen from the four represented colleges of the Final Four teams. Joey found out who his performers were and what their musical ability and instruments were on Monday last week, they met for the first time on Friday morning for their one and only private rehearsal where they sat down and created an arrangement to perform the next day for 80,000 people in the stadium and hundreds of thousands on television!

RYAN COLBERT (SPCPA Class of 2010)

Be sure to check out the Guthrie Theater's production of FRANKENSTEIN--PLAYING WITH FIRE, before it closes on October 27. The title role is played by SPCPA alum, Ryan Colbert (pictured below)!

Ryan is receiving terrific notices for his work in the piece:

""It is Ryan Colbert as Victor that drove the play’s heartbeat. Even though Victor is molded to be emotionally awkward to the point where it is played for some face-palming laughs, Colbert breathes so much life into the play as he conveys a man ruled by a duty that no one else understands: to discover all that is out there.""
--MN Monthly

""Colbert commands his scenes with youthful vitality and volatility as a young student on fire for exploring the brave underworld of biological experimentation.""

ANANDA CORDOVA STUART

Be sure to see 12th grader, Ananda Cordova Stuart, at the Children's Theatre Company in the world premiere production of I COME FROM ARIZONA, directed by Lisa Portes. It opens tomorrow!

The play is about Gabi Castillo, a bright, 14-year-old Mexican-American girl living on the South Side of Chicago, who is accepted into a very different, elite high school. Through her Global Perspectives class, she learns secrets about her past and her parents, discovers her own inherited strength, and begins to understand what it means to take risks. In today’s world of immigration raids and Dreamers, fear and uncertainty, Gabi inspires a modern-day lesson in bravery, courage, and finding power in what seems like a powerless situation.

Ananda plays a number of roles, and also understudies the role of Gabi.

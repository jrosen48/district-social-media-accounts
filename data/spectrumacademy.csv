The students receiving the iPads all used assistive technology apps in the classroom, including communication apps and apps to assist with written communication. The Martin Jahnsen Foundation teamed with Best Buy and other community partners to fund the event for our families. Foundation volunteers helped to get the iPads set up and connected to home networks and other devices, and ensured that each family was able to use the device. On behalf of the families, we would like to express our gratitude to all the individuals involved with this event. The Martin Jahnsen Foundation",2018-05-17 19:28:54,,

Example 1: I saw to nice NEW sleeping bags on FB Marketplace and asked the seller if she would donate them to our school Gala, she said yes, I picked them up. Donated them = 8 Volunteer Hours

We appreciate all of your help with gathering donations and selling tickets! We have raised over $27,000 so far!

We wanted to let you know that tomorrow we will be selling discount tickets for the gala. We have 50 tickets available. They will be $20 each. In order to get the tickets at the discounted price you will need to contact the school directly. You WILL NOT receive the discounted price if you purchase the tickets online. These tickets will be on a first come, first serve basis. We will not be able to hold tickets without payment.",2015-04-20 18:16:01,,

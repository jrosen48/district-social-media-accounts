Do you have a kid (or love a kid) that attends Spectrum Academy NSL Elementary? This is the group you want to be part of!

We have meetings, but you don’t have to come to all of them to be involved. We try to utilize all kinds of communication in order to be as efficient as we can be with everyone’s time and resources. This Facebook page is a big part of that communication.

We organize all kinds of events and activities for our kiddos, for the teachers and staff who support them, and we fundraise to get it all done.
-Welcome Back Playdates
-Class Parties
-Teacher and Staff Appreciation
-Autism Awareness
-Sensory Day
-Red Ribbon Week
-Field Day
-And so much more…

It takes a lot of organizing and a lot of volunteer hours… And none of it is possible without YOU!

We are all busy but, when we work together, we can accomplish great things!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2349447731937060&id=2345059139042586,,0.0,"Who are we? Let’s break it down…

VENUE
Abravanel Hall
123 W S Temple, Salt Lake City, UT 84101, USA

Utah Symphony | Utah Opera offers an annual concert for children with special needs and their families. We present this concert because we know that many families cannot attend cultural events together because some special needs children may have difficulty keeping quiet in their seats. We feature the Utah Opera Resident Artists with the Utah Symphony on the Abravanel Hall stage for this special concert.

This concert is FREE but registration is required.

What we need from you: We need hats and scarfs that are handmade (knitting, crocheting, sewing, etc.) that we will bundle together and give to our students.
When is it due by? November 1st all hats and scarves are due to the Elementary school in the PTO donation box.
What happens if you don't receive enough? We will put out the call for donations for hats and/or scarves (have to be new with tag still on it, or can donate a gift card).
Any and all work on this project counts towards your volunteer hours!! Whether it is making a hat, or buying materials, it all counts!

We are excited to announce that the Spectrum High School yearbook signing tradition is alive and it’s fully digital to suit our socially distanced students.

Jostens has just launched a new platform, Yearbook Digital Signing Pages, that gives every student in our school the chance to create virtual signing pages, invite their friends to leave messages, and print out the final pages to keep with the yearbook as a permanent keepsake. This is free for every student whether they purchased a yearbook or not.

In early March, Grade 6 Bare Necessities Service Learning learned about local food instability and decided to support our local food shelf with a change war.

Students promoted the friendly competition between Sting advisories in the Grade 6 building by designing posters, writing and giving announcements, and encouraging participation. Mr. Frentzos' advisory took first and had donuts during advisory time on March 13. Mrs. Johnson delivered a cashier's check to CAER (Community Aid Elk RIver) the following week, in the amount of $368.10. This equals $3,681 in buying power for CAER to use with its regional food bank.

In early March, Grade 6 Bare Necessities Service Learning learned about local food instability and decided to support our local food shelf with a change war.

Students promoted the friendly competition between Sting advisories in the Grade 6 building by designing posters, writing and giving announcements, and encouraging participation. Mr. Frentzos' advisory took first and had donuts during advisory time on March 13. Mrs. Johnson delivered a cashier's check to CAER (Community Aid Elk RIver) the following week, in the amount of $368.10. This equals $3,681 in buying power for CAER to use with its regional food bank.

Well done, #SpectrumSting sixth graders!",2020-04-06 20:00:39,,

Apologies for the confusion. Here are some clarifications and corrections to information released yesterday regarding quarter 3 Service Learning grades.

1. Assignments posted, submitted, and graded throughout the quarter will remain as they are.
2. Assignments and assessments that were due on 3/18/2020 will be entered into the grading calculation as ""exempt."" This action will not impact on your student's final grade.
3.The final grade calculation will be based up work already posted and graded throughout the course of the third quarter service learning rotation.
4. Your students final grade will be posted as either a ""Pass"" or ""Fail.""

Marines are trained to improvise, adapt and overcome any obstacle in whatever situation they are needed. They have the willingness to engage and the determination to defeat the enemy until victory is seized.

The kinds of battles Marines fight range from traditional warfare to humanitarian and disaster relief missions (HADR). The fighting spirit that helps them win these battles extends beyond the scope of their military service, and many Marines continue to serve in the communities where they live.

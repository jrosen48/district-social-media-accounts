Yesterday afternoon, we received the guidelines from Webster City for our game on Friday.

- Spectators in the bleachers are going to be limited to every other row, and no seating in the first two rows. The away bleachers typically sit 700, so will approximately sit 300-350 fans.
- There will also be standing room along the fence.
- Students are allowed to attend and will sit every other row in their section.
- Face coverings are REQUIRED to be worn at all times.
- $5 admission
- Start time is 7:30 pm, National Anthem at 7:15 pm

It is our top priority to keep everyone safe, and it is imperative we respect and follow Webster City's guidelines in place.

Attention Parents and Guardians:

Upon reviewing guidance from the Oklahoma State Department of Education and the CDC we regret to inform you that we will be unable to have any summer learning opportunities for face to face instruction for students in grades Kindergarten thru 6th at Spiro Public Schools. Our hope is that all of our students have a safe and restful summer. Until then, we will be anxiously waiting to welcome students in August!",2020-05-27 10:02:53,,

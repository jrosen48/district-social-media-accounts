First senior shout-out goes to Cody! His 3200 at league last year was the grittiest race I've seen in a long time. Cody is always up for a challenge and has never scratched a race as far as I can remember. We'll miss his crazy enthusiasm especially as practice drill sergeant. Only problem was that he dirtbikes so much he thought he was braaaaping into that long jump üòÖ",2020-04-23 15:08:44,,

From Mr. Barefoot (PE): I had told several parents I would be posting PE plans on Facebook. After consultation with other staff, I've chosen to post assignments on Google Classroom. Please check Google Classroom for PE assignments beginning April 6th.

For now, all PE students this week should do the following: Pick one day a week to run the mile and record the time. For each day, do the dynamic stretches we do at the beginning of class (jog 20 yds and back twice, sprint 20 yards down and back, high knees, high kick, butt kick, lunges, karaoke, squats). Next, do 10 pushups, 20 crunches/sit ups, 50 jumping jacks. Finally, pick any cardiovascular or sport activity and do that for at least 30 minutes. Some possibilities include bike riding, running, rope jumping, power walking, skiing, gymnastics, archery, golf, soccer dribbling/kicking, softball, basketball drills/shooting, volleyball drills on wall or by self, running football routes, wind sprints, frisbee golf or any other sport you can do by yourself. Remember to practice social distancing and hand washing when done.",0.0,"Thomas Barefoot‚ÄéSierra-Plumas Joint Unified School District

Words cannot say how proud I am of my daughter. It has been a long road to get to this point. Not all was pleasant but most of the time it was. Dragging the family to tournament after tournament. Argument after argument, forgotten cleats, broken bats, needing new glove, batting gloves it seemed to be endless. But the most important of all is the smile on her face when she succeeded! She pushed herself so hard to reach her goal, she stayed focused and pushed on even when she felt like a failure. All of our hard work and sacrifices has paid off. NOW THE REAL WORK BEGINS for her and I feel she is ready! She has prepared for this moment for so long! To play at the collegiate levelüôåüèª and to boot will get her education paid forüòÉ the count down has begunüò¢

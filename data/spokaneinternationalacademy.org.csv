Spencer Grainger ’18 came to the School of Continuing Studies from a career in non-profit leadership seeking teacher certification. Since completing his master’s degree and receiving his certification, Spencer has kept himself busy at Spokane International Academy, teaching 6th grade and leading various extracurricular activities. He is also an adjunct instructor at Whitworth.

The past academic year has put a strain on teachers, students and parents alike. Speaking to his experience, Spencer says, “The [teacher certification] program's emphasis on compassion and relationship development paid massive dividends to me and my students during the COVID closure…I will never forget the experience of seeing my students trying to encourage one another though our online class meetings.”

When a class of 2nd graders send you letters and a check for $150 that they raised from their read-a-thon!!

They could have raised money for just about anything, and they chose to help those who are experiencing homelessness. Thank you Julie Stannard and Spokane International Academy.

""My students are an amazing group of 5th graders from all different backgrounds. I have been impressed by their love of literature, the environment and their desire to learn about different cultures from around the world. They love asking questions, discovering what they believe in and who they are as individuals.

Thank you to all the families that came out and marched with us to honor the life and work of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Today's Spokesman article covering the march has a quote from our very own Mrs. Flowers, principal of our Primary Academy.

""One of the marchers was Morgen Flowers-Washington, principal of Spokane International Academy, a K-8 charter school. She marched with her family and encouraged many of her students to participate as well.

“We teach our students about the fact that they can be advocates, even at 6 and 7 and 8 years old,” Flowers-Washington said. “So if there’s a cause that they have passion around, they can use their education, as well as their family and friends, to mobilize and create change in our community.”

Thank you to all the families that came out and marched with us to honor the life and work of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Today's Spokesman article covering the march has a quote from our very own Mrs. Flowers, principal of our Primary Academy.

""One of the marchers was Morgen Flowers-Washington, principal of Spokane International Academy, a K-8 charter school. She marched with her family and encouraged many of her students to participate as well.

“We teach our students about the fact that they can be advocates, even at 6 and 7 and 8 years old,” Flowers-Washington said. “So if there’s a cause that they have passion around, they can use their education, as well as their family and friends, to mobilize and create change in our community.”

Hello SIA community, it's that time again! Every year SIA 1st and 3rd graders organize a Socktober drive to help support the homeless in Spokane. Since we started doing this our students have collected thousands of pairs of socks and $1,000s in donations to purchase socks and other necessities.

Our students will begin contacting businesses in our area and national offices of large retailers to get them involved. If you would like to support our drive, please send packages of new socks with your student to school. Their teacher will then make sure the socks get to where they need to go.

We really hope you jump in with us and help us to provide our friends in the community with some much needed support during the cold months. If you need a little inspiration, please watch the Kid President video :)

A large part of acting locally is setting a good example, and these two wunderkinds are great role models of that very mantra. Maddie and Kailey are just one example of the dedicated volunteers that keep the farmers market fun and running. Both students from Spokane International Academy, they each have their own favorite thing that comes with volunteering. Maddie loves the variety of stands that come to the market and of course all the dogs that come too and Kailey's favorite market activity is working with all the kids at the KERNEL booth.

A big thanks to these two and all our other volunteers for all they do!

Martin Taught Us- Martin Luther King Jr. Tribute",33.0,"2nd Grade MLK Video:

Get ready for an amazing video. 2nd graders in both Mrs. Martin and Mrs. Stannard's classes came together to create a really moving tribute to Dr. King and what he taught all of us.

Thank you to Mrs. Bassett, Mrs. Stannard's student teacher, for all your work in making this happen. We are so thankful you are on our team :)

From Mrs. Edwards:
I have done extensive research on the benefits of flexible seating. Today, most teachers have started to incorporate flexible seating in their classrooms based on the overwhelmingly positive results.

Flexible seating also has the added component of choice. Students love when they have autonomy and agency over where they can work. It also allows for important conversations about which places in the classroom work for each individual student. They learn about what works best for them and these are skills that they can use well beyond the classroom environment.

Spring Hill Parents,

We are all looking forward to fall when we can hopefully all return to school. With this in mind, we want to remind ALL parents, and especially parents of incoming Pre-K, Kindergarten and 7th grade students to contact your student’s physician and ensure that your child is up to date on state required vaccines. If they are not, please contact your student’s physician and make time to have these vaccines administered before the 2020-2021 school year begins. Also, please make sure to provide your student’s campus nurse with an updated vaccination record once we are able to come together again.

Until then, stay safe and healthy by continuing proper social distancing, frequent handwashing of at least 20 seconds with soap and water, covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or the bend of your elbow, and proper disinfecting of frequently touched objects and surfaces.

This evening we will say farewell to the Spring Hill High School Class of 2020. These seniors have represented our community with such pride during their time in Spring Hill ISD. This group wasn't able to complete their semester within the walls of Spring Hill High School but their influence and leadership will continue to fill our hallways. May we keep our seniors in prayer as they leave us and enter into the next phase of their life. ~ Dr. Wayne Guidry, Superintendent

Dear students,
It is with great trepidation that I have made the decision to retire. After 32 years of teaching and mentoring young people, the time has come. I know you are asking why my parents are requiring more attention and care than I can give working full time. As much as I love my job and all of you my family is very important to me. I want each of you to know how much I have enjoyed working with you. I will still be around to help out and support you. I hope you will all understand and will continue to be a part of the theatre program. It’s not over it’s just the next adventure. I have been looking for someone to recommend and I believe I have found a great new director with lots of energy and passion. Please give this person the respect and devotion that you have given me.
I love you all.

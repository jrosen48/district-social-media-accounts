Panther Nation,
Spring Hill ISD is canceling all classes tomorrow, August 27, 2020, including virtual learners due to the pending storms from the hurricane. There is a likelihood that we will lose power from the high winds that are expected. With the new COVID-19 protocols in place, including social distancing, we are not willing to take the chance of no electricity and are erring on the side of precaution. We feel that this is the best decision for the safety of our students, faculty and staff. We will make an announcement tomorrow morning concerning after school athletic events. Classes will resume on Friday, August 28, 2020 at regular time.

The TB&T Student Board is a prestigious program recognizing outstanding high school seniors in the community. Students were selected based on their grade point average, extra-curricular activities, and after school work activities. Students had to submit an essay with their application as well as two letters of recommendation from either a faculty member or administrator to be considered for the program. The Student Board program is designed to introduce students to banking and money management at a critical point in their lives, and provide them with the essential economic building blocks to earning, spending, saving, and investing money.

We are all looking forward to fall when we can hopefully all return to school. With this in mind, we want to remind ALL parents, and especially parents of incoming Pre-K, Kindergarten and 7th grade students to contact your student’s physician and ensure that your child is up to date on state required vaccines. If they are not, please contact your student’s physician and make time to have these vaccines administered before the 2020-2021 school year begins. Also, please make sure to provide your student’s campus nurse with an updated vaccination record once we are able to come together again.

Until then, stay safe and healthy by continuing proper social distancing, frequent handwashing of at least 20 seconds with soap and water, covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or the bend of your elbow, and proper disinfecting of frequently touched objects and surfaces.

This group wasn't able to complete their semester within the walls of Spring Hill High School but their influence and leadership will continue to fill our hallways. May we keep our seniors in prayer as they leave us and enter into the next phase of their life. ~ Dr. Wayne Guidry, Superintendent

We have all had to adjust our way of living and I continue to be amazed at how well this community has adapted and continues to move forward. Part of the Spring Hill ISD Vision Statement is that we will always seek to be the premier school district in East Texas. Throughout this pandemic I have continued to be bothered by the fact that we will spend approximately five months away from our students. I believe our in-home learning program was a great success in helping bridge this five month gap.

Coach Griffis is currently our associate head coach and offensive coordinator. I believe coach Griffis will play a pivotal role as we transition to a new athletic director.

I want to thank Coach Louvier for the positive impact he has had on Spring Hill ISD athletics and in the lives of our students. We wish him well in his future endeavors.

To our student athletes and Spring Hill community, no one person is larger and more important than the team itself. As a team under coach Griffis’ leadership we will continue our workouts on Monday and move forward.

Instead, they are going to have to use the built-in browsers that come on the two devices. On Xbox, it is Microsoft Edge. On Playstation, it is the “www” browser. Your students will probably know how to find the browsers on their consoles, but if not, each one has a search function they can access on the home screen. On XBox, follow the following steps:

Go to Home menu --> My games and apps --> Scroll down to apps--> Go to the Edge application and open it

Once the browser has been opened:

Type in classroom.google.com in the URL bar.

A prompt for a Google account will appear.

Type in your school district email and password – it doesn’t end in google.com and that is ok!

SHISD would like to recognize Reece Malone for his outstanding accomplishments as a phenomenal musician. As a sophomore student at Spring Hill High School, Reece is currently endorsed by Gibson Guitars and Ernie Ball Guitar Strings. He was recently flown to California to open a show for Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, Don Felder of the Eagles, and Slash of Guns N Roses and has played with a member of the Rolling Stones.

Reece was mentioned in a blog by Ernie Ball Guitar Strings, blog.ernieball.com ~ The 16-year-old, Reece Malone is the reason the word ""prodigy"" exists. Though he is from Longview, Texas, he has been cutting his teeth all across the nation, shredding on the guitar at various events. He's got the chops to stand up with any blues or rock 'n' roll players of today's intensely competitive guitar world.

You can follow Reece on Facebook and Instagram @ Reese Malone Music. Reece, we are so proud of you and wish you the very best in your music career!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2417983914980312&id=465442210234502,,0.0,"Panther Nation,

FLU season has arrived!
Common signs and symptoms of the flu are fever greater than 100F, coughing/sneezing,
headache, body aches and extreme fatigue.
Please help us minimize the spread of the flu by keeping your student home if they have a fever
greater than 100F. Your student must also be fever free for a full 24 hours WITHOUT the use of
fever reducing medications like Tylenol or Ibuprofen before they can return to school.
Good handwashing, staying home when running fever and exhibiting flu symptoms and yearly
flu vaccines are the best way to protect your family and reduce the spread of the flu.

Spring Hill High School Theatre Department presents Joseph Kesselring's infectiously funny dark comedy Arsenic and Old Lace. Murder, mayhem, and madcap lunacy abound in the Brewster home. Mortimer Brewster is a drama critic whose two spinster aunts have a unique hobby—they poison lonely old men with elderberry wine laced with arsenic. One of his brothers thinks he’s Teddy Roosevelt, and another murderous brother is on the run from the law. All are getting in the way of Mortimer’s plans to marry the woman he loves. Playwright Joseph Kesselring’s masterpiece became an instant classic when the film version was released in 1944 directed by Frank Capra and starring Cary Grant.

Performances Nov. 14-16 at 7 pm at the Spring Hill High School's Little Theatre

Due to the construction of Gilmer’s new High School, parking on the main campus is very limited this football season. They will be providing shuttle buses to designated parking areas that are fairly close to the high school campus. Please review the map below to find these parking areas and designated stops at church parking lots. No Parking is allowed on Scott St. from Bledsoe to Bradford. This street is marked and will be enforced by City Police. They ask that spectators not park on side streets so the shuttle buses have room to maneuver on their routes.

We are very proud to say that our afternoon pick up lines at the Primary are going very smoothly! We are releasing close to 300 students during parent pick ups each afternoon. Our bell rings at 3:10 for classes to release and our lines start rolling by 3:15. Our lines are clear by 3:30!!! It is amazing that we have this process down to 15 MINUTES!!!! Thank you to our amazing staff and parents who keep the lines moving each day!
No need to wait for hours in this heat to pick your child up at the Primary campus. Please help us keep our roads clear for traffic.

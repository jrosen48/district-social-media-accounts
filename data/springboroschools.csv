Just before the COVID-19 situation set in, the Five Points Elementary PTO was in the process of finalizing their spirit-wear fundraiser with Image Mark-It.

A few days into the quarantine, the Five Points Elementary PTO had to make a decision about continuing with the fundraiser or postponing it for another time. In light of everything going on, it didn’t feel right to have a spirit-wear fundraiser when so many people in our community and surrounding areas are hurting.

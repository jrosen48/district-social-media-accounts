Tune in LIVE on June 23rd as we dedicate our newest home with future homeowners Marielis and her family.

This home was built in partnership with carpentry, construction, electrical, and HVAC students at Roger L Putnam Vocational-Technical High School. Students were able to earn academic credit and real world work experience, and now have the pride in knowing they helped a family in the community.

Thank you and congrats to the students and everyone who played a part in the project. Thank you also to Springfield Public Schools - Massachusetts for your partnership and Roger L. Putnam Technical Fund for sponsoring the project!",4.0,"Greater Springfield Habitat for Humanity

One of them in Naydeliz. This is her story as shared by her proud mother:

""This is Naydeliz Ramirez. All 4 years at Putnam, she played Varsity Soccer and Varsity Basketball. She’s a beast when it comes to sports, but her passion was always soccer. The coach pushed her to play soccer in any and every position because he knew she could- from her amazing corner kicks to her speed and her footwork skills! Naydeliz will be leaving for Army boot camp in July. She will train in Missouri and then Georgia before being stationed for 3 years at her first assignment. She’s a respectful young lady, who has so many great things waiting for her in the world!""

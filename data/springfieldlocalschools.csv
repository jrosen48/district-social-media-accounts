Do you need something fixed or made? Anytime someone has had issues or need a problem solved: putting things back together, making a sign, or finding ways to make a fancy rotating bookshelf, the students suggest we take our projects to Pete Geiss! He is always willing to help out. He often uses these opportunities to put his classes to work to find a solution. He knows that this hands-on experience is a great way to model helping others and teaching new skills. Obviously the students have confidence in his skills too or they wouldn't suggest his help. Many students say how much they learn in Pete Geiss’ class. He holds kids to a high standard.

We ❤️ Our Spartan Teachers!

Today marks 1 month since schools closed & students said goodbye to teachers & staff in the Springfield School District here in Akron, Ohio (Lakemore, Springfield, Uniontown & Akron to be specific) due to the Covid-19 Virus. Since then, school has been done remotely. Our kiddos and families miss their teachers so much! We love all they have done for us over the past month. From Zoom meetings, phone calls, specials drive by waving... And everything in between. No matter the distance between all of us Spartans, we are in this Together and Are Spartan Strong!!

❤️ A huge Thank You to everyone that sent pictures & helped spread the word the last 3 days so we could reach as many Spartan Families as possible ❤️ We had over 150 Spartans get involved!!!!! ⭐

Prepared...Optimistic... Positive!

Fernando Aguirre has matured a lot over the last year. While improving his grades and being active in sports, he also manages to put in a lot of work hours outside of school. He is fun to talk to, polite, and respectful. He works hard to keep up with the workload for his sophomore year. As a first-year soccer player, he has an upbeat personality and is a good addition to the soccer team. He is respectful; the type of kid who thanked his coach for coming out and watching him play basketball. He also set up our sports fundraiser at his workplace. Other students look to him for leadership or for a friendly face.",,,0.0,"POP

It is with a heavy heart that I inform you that 8th grade student Ryan Clemons has passed away from a brain tumor. We are all deeply saddened by this news. Pray for comfort for his family and for all his friends grieving this great loss. He was such an intelligent and sweet young man.

For those students who need to grieve and share, we have set up a zoom meeting in order to meet during this time of physical distancing. The meeting will begin at 5:30pm. Counselors, Mrs. Rummer and Mrs. Heade will be leading the meeting. Here is the link:

Springfield Platteview Community Schools, Salberg Field is a special place on Friday nights under the lights! Over the last 10 years, I have had one of the best seats in the house working with the wonderful training staff. This group of seniors this year were true leaders on this team. From the pics I took this season, you can hear Coach McLaughlin getting the players pumped and feel the seniors leading the stampede on the field. Best of luck to the graduates!",0.0,"Summit Health Physical Therapy

Friday was a busy day for Mrs. Klein and many of our musically-talented students!

First, the kindergarten classes sang holiday songs at the Springfield Bank and then enjoyed some cookies as a post-performance snack.

Later, Mrs. Klein took some of the Westmont students to perform with Springfield Students at Midlands Hospital and Oakview Mall as a part of the Community Choir.

Everyone looks like they had a great time and we hope Mrs. Klein was able to get some rest this weekend - she sure earned it!",0.0,"üé∂ üéº üéµ

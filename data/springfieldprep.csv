First, Mr. Justin joined our elementary students to share all about how his love for languages and social studies lead him to his career as an Anthropologist. When he asked ""Who else loves Social Studies!?"" there were lots of straight, silent hands!

Then, our 5th graders ended the day checking out our new enrichment programs- cooking, photography, graffiti art, improv comedy, student government, coding, and school newspaper. They jumped right in making salsa, discussing the emotions different kinds of photos can create, and designing their campaign posters for our first-ever student election! Belle's platform? ""More Fun Fridays""!

You got it, Belle!

We have some of our regular Sherwood kids, and they‚Äôre always so excited to see me, even though I have my mask on.

Meet Debe Eaves, Nutrition Services manager at Westport K-8 School

Q: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre leading the Westport community‚Äôs Grab & Go meal program. How is your team supporting that effort?‚Äù

A: ‚ÄúWhen my girls come in, we start making entrees. We pack around 600 meals a day, and we send food to the Early Childhood Center and to Study. They‚Äôre back there, packing and making, all day long, but I always have a Westport girl out front so the kids can see a familiar face when they come by. It‚Äôs so gratifying to know that SPS passed out more than 67,000 meals last week -- it makes me so happy to know that there are at least a few babies who won‚Äôt go to bed with grumbling bellies. It breaks my heart, thinking about those babies who are going to bed hungry.

Meet Franz Nguyen, Supervisor - IT Support

Q: ‚ÄúAt Springfield Public Schools, you‚Äôre known for being kind. Why did you want to join Team SPS?‚Äù

A: ‚ÄúI am originally from Boston working as an IT Support Specialist in their public schools. I moved to Springfield almost 11 years ago and have been working for SPS IT department ever since. I joined the SPS team because of the system‚Äôs reputation. The system‚Äôs focus and vision aligns with my own. I am passionate about being able to help others. I have enjoyed my past IT work with teachers, staff and students, so it makes sense to join a public school system that is known for its leadership, to be innovative, and to be visionary. It‚Äôs a privilege knowing I am supporting Missouri‚Äôs largest school district.‚Äù",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10156540535746735&id=140851216734,,0.0,"Faces of SPS

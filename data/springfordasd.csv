Earlier this week, the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners declared Juneteenth an Official Holiday.

On this day in 1865, Union Army General Gordon Granger read federal orders in Galveston, Texas, that all previously enslaved people in Texas were free – more than two years after President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. However, this was not the end of slavery in the United States. People enslaved in Union-held territory were not freed until the passage of the 13th Amendment several months later on December 18, 1865.

He was accepted into all the colleges he applied, receiving presidential and academic scholarships. We are so proud of all the hard work he put into his academic career, achieving honors every semester. Drew also found a way to help our nurses and doctors during COVID-19 by using a 3-D printer to print bands which pull face mask straps away from the ears. He has printed over 300 bands, which was sent to three different area hospitals. We are proud of all your accomplishments and the true gentleman you have become. Life is full of possibilities and we are excited for the journey that lies ahead of you.

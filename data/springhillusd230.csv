We revamped our response rate graphic so you can see the percentage of households that have responded within your census tract. Darker blues have a higher response rate, while lower blues have a lower rate.

If you have not responded, do so right now. It's safe, it's fast, it's easy. Check in with your friends and family to make sure they've responded to census. A higher response rate means more funds, more funds mean better roads, schools and more.

Attention, Spring Hill P.O. Boxholders! You will soon receive a postcard from the U.S. Census Bureau to encourage you to complete the Census if you have not already done so.

Households that receive mail at P.O. boxes should provide their street address (not their P.O. box number!) when responding to ensure their response is associated with the physical location where they live, not where they receive mail.",2020-07-08 13:56:12,,

1. We are only .1% away from meeting our final 2010 Response Rate. That's just .2% from topping it. If we get there, we would be the first county in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area to beat their 2010 census rate.
2. Spring Hill is back at number 1. Sorry Louisburg.
3. We are doing well, but we are still missing 27.2% of households in Miami County. If we stopped counting today, Miami County could miss out on approximately $182.4 million in federal funding over the next 10 years.

Erica Book is the December Teacher of the Month for Johnson County Pediatric Doctors' Appreciation. Her first grade student, Quintyn Hendrich, put her name in the monthly drawing. She was awarded a $100 gift certificate.

Johnson County Pediatrics started this about a year ago. Every month during the school year, a teacher is awarded. The Pediatric Doctors wanted to show appreciation for teachers and their coordinated efforts to help raise healthy kids.

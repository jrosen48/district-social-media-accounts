We need K-12 parent input to plan effectively for the reopening of school! Please take a few minutes to complete a survey (you should have received an email/links from the School District today) that will help us better understand the needs of our families and guide us in our decision-making. All data collected by noon on Sunday, July 19th, will be shared in the School Reopening presentation on Monday evening for purposes of discussion. The survey will remain open until Wednesday, July 23rd, when we will begin to use the data for planning purposes.

The District is committed to making plans for September that, to the greatest extent possible, meet the needs of all students. We know that the challenges we face are significant. We also know that working together, we will find a way to move forward.

The IB Biology, Chemistry, and Physics classes collaborated with the second grade team at Springhurst to present mini interactive science stations to the second graders in the district. The second graders learned about waves, cells, pH, and many more science topics connected to the curriculum.

Special thanks to the IB science students for creating the stations, and the IB Science Teachers - Ms. Ravo, Ms. Molloy, and Mr. Cottingham for coordinating a great event!",2018-12-18 13:21:33,,

How do you renovate 70,000 square feet in 3 months? One key is to have the proper equipment onsite with a coordinated plan. Never more evident than today. Pictures below give a glimpse of the equipment in use today at SLMS as construction crews continue their summer-long sprint.

Still in the tear down mode in many spaces within the building, but window frames going in on the west side of the building and blocks being set within the new Intermediate Office. Duct work is laid out in many rooms and installed in a few.

Three plus weeks of summer in the books and progress continues to amaze.

Status of projects: on schedule, still plenty to remove and breakdown, but some areas being rebuilt/renovated.

You can see that progress has been IMPRESSIVE. Teams on site are laying the carpet on the LAX field now. Once the carpet is down, they sew the panels together before adding the infill and grooming. Right now it's a hard surface - once the infill is down, it will be softer & more plush, but still a fast surface for our athletes.

The soccer field is fully prepped and awaiting carpet. Light pole and scoreboard foundations are in the ground. And, the concessions stand is UP.

As I walked the site today, I was struck with the size of these fields and how perfectly they fit within the site: softball field to the southeast, trees framing three sides, the HS and FAC to the south. What a place to catch our Lakers in action!

Status of the project: on time and awesome!

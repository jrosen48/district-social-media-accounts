On Monday, September 14, the driver for bus 111 will not be available to drive the PM route. There is not a sub available to cover, therefore, we are going to hold those students until another bus returns, this will be about a 45 minute delay.

If you are able to pick up your child in the afternoon this day, that would be great! Please call the building that your child attends and let them know in advance that you will be picking them up. If that is not an option they will be 45 minutes later than their normal drop off time.

We are very sorry for any inconvenience! Thank you for your understanding!

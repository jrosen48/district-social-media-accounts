There's still room in a Zoom workshop about improving drawing skills that I am teaching through Jasper Community Arts. Sign up this week! We will learn and practice techniques for proportions, layout, form, light/shadow, and perspective. Good painting is based on solid drawing.

SV Community,
We have set a make-up date for prom on Saturday, July 11 in the JH gym with a start time to be announced later. That time will be determined by other factors which can not be planned at this time.
If state regulations are not lifted by an appropriate date, we will cancel prom for this year. Graduating seniors will be allowed to attend prom in 2021 free of charge.
We have postponed the 2020 graduation ceremony until Saturday, July 18 starting at 6:00 in the HS gym. This will be a traditional commencement as long as COVID-19 regulations are lifted by that time.
If regulations are not lifted, we will be performing a virtual drive-through celebration. Students and families will drive up and remain in cars with our students receiving their diplomas from administrators and the school board. Other plans with this option will be organized as time gets closer.
Thank you all for your support. We are going to do the best we can for our seniors.",17.0,"Svhs Principal

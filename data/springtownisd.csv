Hello Porcupines!
Just a little note to say we miss you and are proud of you for keeping up with your school work. Yes...it’s still school, and yes...it still counts. 😏. It just looks a bit different right now.

Keep it up.

Even though we may not be together, we are still with you.
Hang in there.

Stay safe and see you soon.

SHS Culinary Arts students had lunch at the Reata today. Chef James, as well as general manager Russell Kirkpatrick, talked to them about becoming a chef and the restaurant industry as a whole.

They then went to the The Virgin Olive Oiler, where the owner, Chef Charles Flock, shared how olive oil is made.

The staff at SHS will gladly be taste testers for our students’ attempts at culinary perfection!

Time to get back into the habit of being especially mindful of buses, students, and young drivers in the morning and afternoon. We're expecting about 3600 students across six campuses...traffic will be extremely challenging tomorrow as a new routine develops.

Keep in mind that the first few days of school creates a much higher percentage of parent drop-offs/pick-ups at each campus than is normally the case. Historically, the amount of time it takes for the last car to finish in our parent pick-up lines on the first day of school is about four times longer than it will be in mid-September. Drop-off times are only slightly less extended, but will also be lengthy. We ask that parents model PATIENCE, and we will try to do the same!

These students have been working hard for months on their projects.

Out of the 17 who received a ""4"" on their artwork is advancing to the State competition in April in San, Marcos Texas. SHS freshman, Jordyn Buie (Self), will be advancing with TWO pieces. To put things into perspective there are roughly 1,500-2,000 pieces at each regional event and our group created 21 of those pieces. Roughly 10% or less advance to state from each regional event.

Congratulations to all, and especially to Jordyn for advancing with multiple pieces (see attached).

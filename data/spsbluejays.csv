In the midst of uncertainty...we rise to the occasion! Our Shepherd Public School District has risen! Like so many other school districts around, they have done everything in their power to look out for kids.

Our food service and admin staff have prepared almost 4,000 meals...so no kid goes hungry!

Our transportation staff has delivered those meals...so no kid goes hungry!

We have seen numerous posts from our teaching staff offering their teaching services via e-mail, Skype or phone. Some have created virtual lessons...so no kid gets behind!

We have even see teachers getting together to mill lumber for our industrial arts program...so no kid goes without!

None of this was required or mandated...it was done because it is the right thing to do.

We are proud to be Blue Jays!

This month, Shepherd Middle School students will be participating in the #WhyYouMatter project. The #WhyYouMatter project uses lesson plans and activities to encourage students to consider why they matter and how they impact people around them. Once every middle school student has an answer to the statement “Why you matter” they will write their answer on the whiteboard and be photographed with their reason.

The photographs will be displayed around the school for the Shepherd community, students and their families to view during the Maple Syrup Festival. Through the completion of the #WhyYouMatter project, Shepherd Middle School students will gain confidence, positive self-esteem, and an understanding of why they are a significant part of this world.

Dawn from WMLM 1520am came to the high school today and announced the winner of “Teacher of the Week”. The winner was our very own Mrs. Julie Prout. Mrs. Prout’s students were so excited for her.

One of Mrs. Prout’s student said , “She deserves to win because she always helps me and makes me smile even when I am having a bad day.”

Thank you Mrs. Julie Prout for being an outstanding educator.

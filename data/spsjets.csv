Pre-Participation Physical Examinations for 2020-2021 School Year

Sterling Public Schools
April 30 at 9:52 AM ·

Health care providers in the state are experiencing changing demands to deal with COVID-19. These changes are causing them to postpone most, if not all, non-essential wellness and maintenance visits. Most of them are planning changes to last until July.

The NSAA SMAC unanimously recommended to the NSAA board that Pre-Participation Physical Examinations (PPE) for the 2019-2020 school year be acceptable for the 2020-2021 seasons. This recommendation would be for a one-year exemption only and would not include incoming freshmen. They continue to recommend that students visit their primary care providers for the PPE.

What does this mean for Sterling Public Schools? The only students/athletes that will need physicals for the 2020-2021 school year will be incoming freshmen and incoming 7th graders. All other students/athletes that turned in a physical in 2019-2020 will be exempt.",0.0,"NSAAHOME.ORG

Health care providers in the state are experiencing changing demands to deal with COVID-19. These changes are causing them to postpone most, if not all, non-essential wellness and maintenance visits. Most of them are planning changes to last until July.

The NSAA SMAC unanimously recommended to the NSAA board that Pre-Participation Physical Examinations (PPE) for the 2019-2020 school year be acceptable for the 2020-2021 seasons. This recommendation would be for a one-year exemption only and would not include incoming freshmen. They continue to recommend that students visit their primary care providers for the PPE.

Just because there's no ceremony today doesn't mean your hard work has gone unnoticed. All the late nights doing homework, befriending underclassmen, perfecting your game, holding down a job. This is what matters. All the steps that you've taken to get to this point and beyond, those matter. This situation does not define you.

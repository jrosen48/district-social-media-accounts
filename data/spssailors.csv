Our next featured senior is Bonnie Naughtin. Bonnie shows her versatility and talent in the fact that over her four years of speech she has competed in four of the nine events, making it to state in three of them. It most likely would have been all four if her season had not ended early. Bonnie was also another member of the OID that has been together since they were freshmen (which will be featured in tomorrow's post).

Bonnie also uses her talents for the benefit of the team as a whole. She not only wrote her own poetry this year, but she also wrote Serious Prose scripts for Emma Wareham and Abbie Morris. And although this spotlight is focused on speech, I feel it is important to note that she also composed and recorded all of the music for the one act play for the last two years.

In addition to her OID, Bonnie was incredibly successful with her Poetry program this year. She brought many an audience to tears with her heartfelt look at the struggles of dementia.

Thank you so much for your hard work over the years, Bonnie. We can't wait to see what you do next!",0.0,"Sutherland Public School Speech and One Act

It's graduation week, and that means it's time to put a spotlight on our seniors!

The first senior we would like to honor is Megan Coffman. This was her first year at the school and her first year on the team, and we are so glad that she joined us. Megan participated in two events this year. The first event she picked up was a hilarious OID called ""Elf on a Shelf Must Die"" with Dominic Ralston, Taylor Weber, Taarna Gray, and Trinity Turner. Wanting to further challenge herself and expand her horizons, she also put together an informative speech about tabletop gaming. Although her season ended before districts, we would like to honor Megan by sharing one of her OID performances. Enjoy!

Thank you for a fantastic season, Megan. Good luck as you move on to your next chapter.

To finish out our group of sophomores, we have the talented Maverick Naughtin. Maverick qualified for the district team in two very different events. He joined a hilarious OID with four seniors (which will be featured in a future post), and he also qualified in the much more serious event called Extemp. Extemp is a unique and demanding event where you have an hour to write your speech on a current events topic that you draw right then. And you have to do this up to three separate times if you make finals! Add in another event where you are coordinating schedules with four other people and that makes for a very busy day! Maverick has always thrived under this pressure, consistently medaling in both events. Maverick was a state qualifier in two events last year, and was hoping to repeat that feat before his season was cut short.

Taigen Ruff was new to the school last fall, and we are so glad she joined both speech and drama. During speech season, she jumped in and was willing to try many different events.

The team had 8 members participating in the Serious Prose event, and Taigen's hard work and dedication helped her rise to the top and take one of the two available spots on the district team.

Today we are featuring the talented Mekenna Fisher. It would be difficult to find a harder worker than this young lady. When you are regularly getting medals and even winning your event, it would be easy to coast on that success, but Mekenna is always striving to improve. She takes the time to come in and go over tab sheets, ask questions, practice, and find ways to keep getting better and better every single week. This hard work resulted in the accomplishment of medaling in three events in the same meet- Two 1st place and one 2nd!

Mekenna was set to compete in Entertainment and Extemp at districts for a shot at state before her season was cut short. The attached video is Mekenna's entertainment speech about how to find the perfect boyfriend.

Last school year, several people came to me to tell me about a new student who blew everybody away with her speaking skills at the FFA Greenhand ceremony. Rumor had it that she was going to be a great addition to the speech team. How right they were! For the last two years, Paige Hoelting has been an amazing addition to the speech team, and we are so glad to have her!

Not only was she part of our amazing trio of Extempers who must each draw their topic on a current event, write their speech in under and hour and then perform it (repeating this process for each round), but participated with an informative speech as well. It is this speech that she was planning to perform at districts for a shot at state.

Our next feature is a group of five hardworking young women. After the last day of finals in December when most students had cleared the school to start their winter break, these girls stayed several hours longer to get help picking out a script so that they could practice over break. Olivia Miller, Serena Martinez, Cloee Peterson, McKenna Bliss, and Bailey Zona worked hard over break and throughout the rest of the season to put together a performance which not only earned them medals and a spot on the district team, but took on the difficult and intense topic of bullying in schools.

Our next feature is a group of five hardworking young women. After the last day of finals in December when most students had cleared the school to start their winter break, these girls stayed several hours longer to get help picking out a script so that they could practice over break. Olivia Miller, Serena Martinez, Cloee Peterson, McKenna Bliss, and Bailey Zona worked hard over break and throughout the rest of the season to put together a performance which not only earned them medals and a spot on the district team, but took on the difficult and intense topic of bullying in schools.

Thank you for a fantastic season, girls. I can't wait to see what you do next!

Also, a big thank you Stage Partners for permission to post this performance.",2020-04-24 21:48:05,https://video-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/10000000_2260767540899796_7353499290863403008_n.mp4?_nc_cat=107&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=eMO-u2UCxvQAX_Hjqgb&_nc_ht=video-atl3-1.xx&oh=1a7c0d16a20b47daf4ffc099e4da6b11&oe=5F5E3970,

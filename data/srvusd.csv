Hello Parents/Guardians and Staff,

I would like to take a moment to clarify the purpose of the ThoughtExchange.

ThoughtExchange is not a vote.

SRVUSD is planning to enhance remote learning AND we are planning for a return to in-person instruction as soon as it is safe to do so.

Remote learning will remain available to families and in-person learning will be made available to families when we can.

ThoughtExchange is meant to allow everyone to share their perspectives so that we can strengthen remote learning and prepare for in-person learning.

We will be asking parents to decide whether their child/children will remain in remote learning or return to in-person learning after the September 15th Board meeting.

I hope this clarification will assist families who have been asking further questions or commenting on social media.

Take care,
John",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3173380909378174&id=164500476932914,,0.0,"✨A Message from our Superintendent✨

As a token of gratitude to the retirees for their many years of service to our students and community, each one will be receiving a clock, engraved with their name and years of service.

It's time for these dedicated individuals to check items off their bucket list, travel, enjoy their families, friends and more. Regardless of the capacity in which these individuals served, their work had a positive impact on the lives of countless children and families. We thank them!

Message from County Superintendent:

You might have heard that the Governor made a statement suggesting that schools may not reopen until the fall. At this time, the Department of Education, the Department of Public Health, and the Governor’s Office have not made a decision in this direction. I continue to communicate daily with local public health officials and with our school leaders as we monitor and plan during this situation. I want to assure you that the school leaders throughout Contra Costa are working hard to help support families during this very stressful time. Your schools will continue to communicate with you as the situation evolves and decisions are made.

Please check your school district’s website and social media sites before calling or emailing to see if your questions are answered there. Also, go to http://www.coronavirus.cchealth.org/ or our CCCOE website: http://www.cocoschools.org/coronavirus.

County Superintendent of Schools",10.0,"Contra Costa County Office of Education
March 18 at 9:15 AM ·

Message from County Superintendent:

You might have heard that the Governor made a statement suggesting that schools may not reopen until the fall. At this time, the Department of Education, the Department of Public Health, and the Governor’s Office have not made a decision in this direction. I continue to communicate daily with local public health officials and with our school leaders as we monitor and plan during this situation. I want to assure you that the school leaders throughout Contra Costa are working hard to help support families during this very stressful time. Your schools will continue to communicate with you as the situation evolves and decisions are made.

Please check your school district’s website and social media sites before calling or emailing to see if your questions are answered there. Also, go to http://www.coronavirus.cchealth.org/ or our CCCOE website: http://www.cocoschools.org/coronavirus.

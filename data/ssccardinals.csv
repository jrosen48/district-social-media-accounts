This morning, Mrs. Martineck shared “The Morning Song” by Dwayne Reed with this great message: “I won’t be bothered by mistakes from yesterday, today I’m going to learn about something new.” Mrs. Martineck asked her students to share something new they wanted to learn about. How about you? What to you want to learn about this year?",2020-08-18 23:15:32,,

Happy faces with ketchup when Mrs. Dandurand gets to put it on the sandwiches 😊!

We have made several changes to our day including our lunch procedures. We’ve put marketings on the floor and through the food line to encourage to remind students to keep space between themselves. This year we also have five separate lunch times so that each grade can lunch while spaced out in the lunchroom and only sitting on one side of the lunch table. Students do wear their face covering through the lunch line. Once seated, students have a lanyard they wear to clip their face covering onto while they eat￼￼￼￼. Students then put their face coverings back on as they return their trays and head outside for recess through the hallways. Once outside, while playing, students are allowed a face covering break, students keep their face covering clipped onto the lanyard while they are at play.",0.0,"Covington Elementary

Parents, thank you for sharing your children with us! We are so proud of what they've become and are excited to see what the future holds for them.

We have some exciting news to announce just two weeks before Memorial Day! We will soon be home to The Freedom Rock!

The concrete slab where the rock will be set has just been installed thanks to LiteForm and Nelson Commercial Construction!

On the docket for next week (hopefully) will be transporting the 21 ton rock to Siouxland Freedom Park from Frame Aligners in #SouthSiouxCity! (Thank you for donating the rock, Frame Aligners!!)

To transport the rock, Barnhart Crane will be donating the use of a large crane to pick up the rock and to place it at the park. B&B Rodgers will be the ones transporting this beauty!

A BIG THANK YOU to all involved in making this project happen! All of the services we needed to get this rock in place have been 100% DONATED! We live in a wonderful community! THANK YOU!!

We'll be posting updates on the rock's journey and when we can expect Ray Bubba Sorensen to paint the rock. Here's more information on our wonderful artist: https://www.thefreedomrock.com/

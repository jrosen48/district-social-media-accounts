As we get the new year started we are planning to have a pep rally for each Friday home game during the season at Ram Stadium. Our first one is this Friday, August 28th at 10:15 AM. This first pep rally will be attended by high school students and the middle school cheerleaders. We plan to include all middle school students for all future pep rallies. It is important for us to be able to allow parents to attend if they choose so we have come up with a plan to allow us to social distance and help keep everyone safe. Parents attending the pep rally will need to enter the gate near the old middle school gym and park and sit according to the attached map. We will have a special section designated for parent seating. Our students have done a great job with the wearing of face coverings and we will expect all attendees to follow that protocol so we can continue with pep rallies the rest of the season.

Thanks

10 Ways to Survive Life in a Quarantine

Here it is at long last. S&S Theatre presents 10 Ways to Survive Life in a Quarantine by Don Zolidis.

This production is a little different. Because of social distancing, we are having to think outside the box. It is not live or directed by Ms. Gibson. (She was the editor). Instead each theatre student became their own director, set designer, costume designer, and camera operator. They filmed their part and sent it to Ms. Gibson, where she put together the final product. This production highlights all levels of theatre students at S&S High School.

Enjoy!

SHAC Meeting
What is a SHAC?
A SHAC (School Health Advisory Committee) is an advisory group of individuals who represent different segments of the community. By law, a majority of the members must be persons who are parents of students enrolled in the district and who are not employed by the district. A SHAC is made up of parents, community members, students, and school staff working together to improve the health of all students and families through coordinated school health programs.

Why do we need a School Health Advisory Committee (SHAC)?
• It's Texas law
o Department of State Health Services
• Healthy children learn better
• Healthy homes and healthy schools support healthy children

The components of a coordinated school health program include:
• Family and community involvement
• Nutrition services
• Physical education
• Health education
• Counseling, psychological & social services
• Health services
• Health promotion for school staff

On Friday, November 15th there will be a funeral service taking place at the Sadler Methodist Church which is located next door to our middle school. The service will begin at 2:00 PM and could continue through our regular student dismissal time. Out of respect for the family and to help alleviate any traffic issues in this area we are asking parents who normally pick up their children in the car line to avoid arriving early. Students are released at 3:35 so if you can delay your arrival until close to 3:30 it will greatly help everyone involved tomorrow.

Thanks for your help and cooperation.

It has been brought to our attention there is a rumored threat on social media involving the high school for Wednesday, October 30th. While there has been no substance of any kind at this time to the threat we are taking extra precautions to ensure the safety of everyone. We plan to have a normal school day but we will have the presence of the Grayson County Sheriff’s Office on our campus to help alleviate any concerns.

Tickets for Friday night are officially SOLD OUT! You can still get tickets for Monday night.

Let’s meet our next suspect Phoebe Muffet, Chief editor of Mynute Weekly. She is always looking for the next juicy story to sky rocket her paper to the top. But nothing ever happens in Mynute to bring in national recognition. Could she have killed a famous pie legend to make her paper the headlines all over the world? She was given the opportunity now that Mynute is hosting Mother Mabel’s pie contest. You’ll have to find out November 1st or 4th. Get your tickets for Monday night before they sell out!

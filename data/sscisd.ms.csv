As we get the new year started we are planning to have a pep rally for each Friday home game during the season at Ram Stadium. Our first one is this Friday, August 28th at 10:15 AM. This first pep rally will be attended by high school students and the middle school cheerleaders. We plan to include all middle school students for all future pep rallies. It is important for us to be able to allow parents to attend if they choose so we have come up with a plan to allow us to social distance and help keep everyone safe. Parents attending the pep rally will need to enter the gate near the old middle school gym and park and sit according to the attached map. We will have a special section designated for parent seating. Our students have done a great job with the wearing of face coverings and we will expect all attendees to follow that protocol so we can continue with pep rallies the rest of the season.

Thanks

Here it is at long last. S&S Theatre presents 10 Ways to Survive Life in a Quarantine by Don Zolidis.

This production is a little different. Because of social distancing, we are having to think outside the box. It is not live or directed by Ms. Gibson. (She was the editor). Instead each theatre student became their own director, set designer, costume designer, and camera operator. They filmed their part and sent it to Ms. Gibson, where she put together the final product. This production highlights all levels of theatre students at S&S High School.

The teachers and staff are working hard to get academic work together to mail home. We hope to have the work in the mail Thursday or Friday at the latest. This work is what the teachers have put together do the current closure through the 3rd of April. Also include in the mailer will be your students report card from the 3rd nine weeks. Teachers will be available via email if you have questions about any work received. Please be on the lookout for those the beginning of next week. In the meantime, below is a link to khan academy that are some online resources you can use.

Also, on the district website is the student handbook and code of conduct, if they are acting out and disrupting learning at home, they can copy rules in your new homeschool ISS🤣!

We are here to assist and support along the way!

Mr. Pierce

Khan Academy schedules for school closures",12.0,"Dear families,

The teachers and staff are working hard to get academic work together to mail home. We hope to have the work in the mail Thursday or Friday at the latest. This work is what the teachers have put together do the current closure through the 3rd of April. Also include in the mailer will be your students report card from the 3rd nine weeks. Teachers will be available via email if you have questions about any work received. Please be on the lookout for those the beginning of next week. In the meantime, below is a link to khan academy that are some online resources you can use.

Also, on the district website is the student handbook and code of conduct, if they are acting out and disrupting learning at home, they can copy rules in your new homeschool ISS🤣!

We are here to assist and support along the way!

As you have witnessed the last couple of days there have been several events cancelled including but not limited to: Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, the UIL boys state basketball tournament, NHL, NBA, MLB, and the NCAA tournaments.

S&S CISD will be in communication with the Texas Education Agency and Commissioner Mike Morath on Friday before making any official announcement of our plans moving forward. Once a decision is made those plans will immediately be shared with you via FACEBOOK and TWITTER. All information can also be found on the main page of our website at www.sscisd.net

SHAC Meeting
What is a SHAC?
A SHAC (School Health Advisory Committee) is an advisory group of individuals who represent different segments of the community. By law, a majority of the members must be persons who are parents of students enrolled in the district and who are not employed by the district. A SHAC is made up of parents, community members, students, and school staff working together to improve the health of all students and families through coordinated school health programs.

Why do we need a School Health Advisory Committee (SHAC)?
• It's Texas law
o Department of State Health Services
• Healthy children learn better
• Healthy homes and healthy schools support healthy children

The components of a coordinated school health program include:
• Family and community involvement
• Nutrition services
• Physical education
• Health education
• Counseling, psychological & social services
• Health services
• Health promotion for school staff

On Friday, November 15th there will be a funeral service taking place at the Sadler Methodist Church which is located next door to our middle school. The service will begin at 2:00 PM and could continue through our regular student dismissal time. Out of respect for the family and to help alleviate any traffic issues in this area we are asking parents who normally pick up their children in the car line to avoid arriving early. Students are released at 3:35 so if you can delay your arrival until close to 3:30 it will greatly help everyone involved tomorrow.

I know it's July and we don't really want to think about back to school but it is right around the corner and there will be kids that do not have the supplies to have a successful year so this is where my crew and myself start our annual fundraiser to help these kids. Both POP'S PLACE restaurants in Denison and Southmayd are drop off locations starting tomorrow July 3rd until August 11th. This list is created by us talking to each school to see what are the most needed items, what kids are mostly missing at the beginning of school and what needs to be replenished during the middle of the school year. Please bring us anything on this list and as always if you need to drop off a cash donation to us we will gladly do the shopping for you. Last year was our biggest school supplies drive and with your help I hope to make this one even bigger!!

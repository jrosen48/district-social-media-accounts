We are getting so close to the end of the school year and are looking forward to celebrating with you over the next couple of weeks!

One thing that we require prior to graduation is that all seniors return any supplies (athletics, library books, textbooks, art supplies) that they have been issued or that they reimburse the district for the cost of such supplies. We are hoping that seniors can return any missing supplies at Arch Day. We will have boxes set up for drops near where you pick up your cap and gown, senior badge, and other items. After that, we will work to coordinate drop offs of supplies between Arch Day and graduation.

1. March 16 & 17--With COVID cases in Greater Springfield, we closed two days before the Governor closed all Vermont schools on March 18th. Those days are waived.
2. Our three snow days--The student days are waived in this case in exchange for staff only days for planning and training in anticipation of next fall.

Good morning parents, students, and staff of Springfield School District,

This is Zach McLaughlin, the Superintendent of Schools. I hope that enjoyed yesterday’s weather, and that the transition to vacation mode in the midst of this difficult period is going well.

I am calling this morning with an important reminder about this week’s food delivery. In order to give our food workers a necessary break, we are handling food service differently this week. Rather than handing out one day worth of food, each site will be handing out bags with five lunches, five breakfasts, and small snacks for the week.

If for some reason, you don’t get a bag for the week or the site runs out of food, we ask that you 885-5133 to notify us. Then we will see if we can work on a solution for your students.

In the meantime, I wish you and your family well, and I want to send my appreciation for your ongoing support and patience with us as we do our best to find ways to help you.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2747528258808752&id=1730012987226956,,0.0,"BIG FOOD DELIVERY DAY!!

As you are likely well aware, we have entered a mandatory school closure as a public health response to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Vermont and across the country. While the current school closure runs through April 6, we are planning internally for the likely possibility of a longer closure. We know that this is a difficult time for families and for our students and are here to support families in whatever they might need.

At this point, we want to update you on our remote learning effort and other work our school has been engaged in. Please refer to the attached pictures.

Step 3: Apply for any (or all!) of the 150 scholarships administered by VSAC, worth over $5 million – and only for Vermonters.

Good afternoon parents and guardians of Springfield School District students,

This is Zach McLaughlin, the Superintendent of Schools. I am calling to let you know about an important informational event on Wednesday night. Over the course of the last year, the district has been changing its model of response to a potential active shooter event. In conjunction with local first responders, we have been working to train staff in the approach known as the Civilian Response to Active Shooter Events (CRASE). As we continue our process to make this change, we want to be sure to keep you aware of the program and how we are trying to keep the school community safe.

On Wednesday night at 7 PM in the high school auditorium, District Safety Coordinator Kevin Anderson, District Psychologist Kristen Hurd, and I will be joined by Springfield Fire Chief Russ Thompson and Springfield Police Chief Mark Fountain to discuss CRASE and answer your questions. We hope that you can join us Wednesday at 7PM.

A wonderful collection of staff (especially Ms. Stagner, Mr. Lievense, and Ms. Polk), student, and adult community partners are making this youth bridge to the community-at-large possible. Thanks also go out to the Vermont Community Fund for their support. Yesterday, the group was hard at work on taking next steps. You'll find The SPACE right next to Flying Crowing Coffee. For more info on the SPACE, check out the following article from the Eagle Times.

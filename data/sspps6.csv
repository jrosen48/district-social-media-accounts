Student gardens included a variety of fruits, vegetables, grains, and even some flowers. Some wanted to plant tulips, pumpkins, tomatoes, strawberries, asparagus, carrots, watermelon, corn, cucumbers, grapes, and an apple tree. Some students shared Mrs. Borrell’s love of raspberries, and a student also included wheat so he could make bread.

While Gov. Walz has declared a state of emergency for Minnesota, the Commissioner of Health and other health officials continue to warn 𝙖𝙜𝙖𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙩 broad school closures at this time given current information available.

However, in order to prepare for a possible closure in the future, the district decided to extend spring break for students by two extra days to allow time for SSPPS staff to prepare for a potential future closure if called.

Therefore, SSPPS classes will be canceled for students on Monday, March 16, and Tuesday, March 17, 2020, so that district staff can do extra planning for COVID-19 (coronavirus).

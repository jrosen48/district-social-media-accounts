👨‍👧‍👦 Parents: Is your child experiencing COVID-19 related stress?

Here are some ways the CDC recommends supporting them:
💬 Talk with your child about COVID-19 and share facts in a way that they can understand.
💕 Let them know it is okay to feel upset. Share how you deal with your own stress.
🗞 Limit exposure to pandemic news, including social media. Children may misinterpret what they hear and become frightened.
🖍 Try to keep up with regular routines and create a fun schedule of activities.
🦸 Be a role model. Take breaks, get plenty of sleep, exercise, and eat well.
💻 Connect with your friends and family members.
📚 Spend time with your child in meaningful activities such as reading together, exercising, playing board games.

1. Am I at least 6ft away from anyone that does not live in my home?
2. Am I using items that people (not living in your home) touch? Ex.) Park benches, playgrounds, picnic tables, sports equipment,…
3. Do I have hand-sanizter or a means to clean my hands before I start touching things when I am back in my home?

I get to play with my brother Jack, and have been getting to know my little sister Edie better. My Dad is working from home, and now he is home and making us all breakfast. Times like this can help you grow as a person, think of new ideas, and get some rest. I have been using this time to read all the books in my room I haven’t read yet. I’ve also been getting fresh air, and am excited to play the game Clue with my parents.

UPDATE: Due to the recent stay-at-home order from the Governor, we will unfortunately be suspending our activity kit program for the time being. We will let everyone know once we are able to distribute the kits again. Until then, keep an eye out for some fun activity video tutorials from our staff.

Here is a sneak peak at some of the activity kits that our youth programs staff have been busy assembling this week. We are still waiting on additional supplies to be delivered, but the first round of kits will be available this Thursday, March 26 at 10 AM.

Kits will be located outside the main entrance of the Parks & Recreation office (245 Howelsen Parkway) in plastic bins. Each bin will be labeled with the following age groups: PK-1st Grade, 2nd & 3rd Grades and 4th & 5th Grades.

The kits will be available all week, and will be replaced with new kits each Thursday at 10 AM. We hope you enjoy these activities, and don't forget to comment and let us know what supplies and activities you would like to see next! #hopeintheboat",0.0,"City of Steamboat Springs Parks & Recreation

Social distancing is an effective tool for preventing the spread of disease. It can include large-scale measures like canceling group events or closing public space, as well as personal decisions such as avoiding crowds. The Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment explains social distancing as the following:

• Try to keep 6 feet between yourself and other people whenever possible, particularly when you or others are sick. No hugs, no handshakes.
• Work from home if you can.
• Keep children and teens from gathering in other public places when school is closed.
• Stay home.
• Avoid group gatherings. The smallest group in the largest space poses the least risk. Our current advice is to not attend gatherings of more than 10 people.",0.0,"Routt County Colorado

Early symptoms of COVID-19 may be mild and are easily mistaken as a common cold. That's why it's important to follow self-isolation directions – even if you have mild symptoms. And make sure your family & close contacts follow self-quarantine directions. Self-isolating and self-quarantining will help prevent the spread of disease. #COVID19Colorado

Here is what Sara has to say about the students she works with: ""All of the students I work with at Steamboat Springs High School are absolutely amazing. They are truly the reasons I wake up in the morning excited to go to work. We have laughed together, cried together and have shared many good moments in between.""
This year Sara started a lunch and discussion group called Ladies of the Boat for high school girls looking to connect with each other. Swipe to see the poster designed by one of her mentees!

Do you want to be a mentor like Sara? We will be looking for next year's School Based Mentors starting this spring. Email jeanette@partnersrouttcounty.org if you are interested!",2020-02-24 19:08:42,,

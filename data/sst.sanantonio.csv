We are excited to announce a new look and feel for all campus websites!

Our IT staff has been hard at work over the past few weeks to transfer all previous information found on older sites to our new websites.

These campus sites are now live, but are still under construction. This means that although your campus may have a new website, not all information may be present on the website. We are working to get this resolved as soon as we can so that parents can get access to all of their campus information.

Discover Project-Based Learning at SST",0.0,"Your daughter loves to understand the world around her.

Yesterday, she asked you how a helicopter rises into the sky.

She’s gone from making paper planes to investigating the physics of lift, drag, weight, and thrust!

When she catches the fever to learn something, we don’t hold her back!

Hands-on learning develops your child’s advanced thinking skills.

At SST San Antonio, your daughter will follow her curiosity and learn
by doing projects that inspire her to go deeper into topics she loves.

SST San Antonio - how high will your child fly?

The School of Science and Technology campuses on the Texas coast, particularly those in Houston, have been hit by the devastation of Hurricane Harvey. SST-Corpus Christi withstood the torrential rains and winds fairly well as did most of the surrounding neighborhood. The condition of the campuses in Houston has not been assessed as principals and others have been unable to inspect the sites. Surrounding neighborhoods have been significantly impacted.

Our thoughts are with our SST families who have been effected by Hurricane Harvey. SST encourages families and friends in San Antonio to give to the American Red Cross and the San Antonio Food Bank as these two organizations can most efficiently deliver support to all families, including our SST families.

To learn more about how you can give, please visit the websites, San Antonio Food Bank: https://safoodbank.org/ and American Red Cross San Antonio: http://www.redcross.org/",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1468516496562296&id=145234402223852,"Home

America’s Most Challenging High Schools ranks schools through an index formula that’s a simple ratio: the number of Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate and Advanced International Certificate of Education tests given at a school each year, divided by the number of seniors who graduated that year. A ratio of 1.000 means the school had as many tests as graduates.

SST earned 6th place in San Antonio, 47th place in Texas, and 231st place in USA.

Dear Parent/Guardian:

As we head into Spring Break, April 6-10, I want to thank you for all of your support and resilience over the past three weeks. As we transition into district-wide Distance Learning starting April 13, we realize no one could have anticipated the way our daily routines would change, and for as long as this change would impact us. However, we are working through these challenges together. Together we are stronger!

As a reminder, please know that we will continue grab and go food service during the spring break, Monday-Thursday, April 6-9 (however, we will not be providing food services on Fri., April 10 or Mon., April 13).

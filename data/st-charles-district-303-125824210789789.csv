Parents, please talk to your children about the dangers of the ‚ÄúOutlet Challenge‚Äù that has gone viral on the TikTok social media app. The challenge calls for inserting a phone-charger partly in an outlet and then touching a coin to the exposed prongs to produce a spark. The result can cause electrical system damage, fire, and potentially serious injuries. Look for scorched outlets in your home, and be sure to talk to your children to let them know if they do this they are putting themselves and others in a dangerous situation.
Thank you helping us keep our community safe.

Today a few students represented our school and the SJE FFA Chapter at the State FFA Potato Evaluation Contest. Our students dove right into learning the ins and outs of grading potatoes and their hard work paid off!

Out of the 35 teams that competed, SJE secured 13th place. Our members graded 100 potatoes according to U.S. grading standards, identified various potato blemishes and diseases, ranked plates of seed potatoes according to grading standards and gave oral reasons on the placing of ten potatoes.

Out of the 153 students that competed today, our members placed in the following ranks:
Kyra Holt - 40th
Olivia Kjack - 55th
Wyatt Walker - 60th
Keely Jones - 65th
Brooklyn Bailey - 86th
Cale Crider - 91st
Dakota Jones - 99th

The SJE FFA looks forward to improving their skills for next year and hope to continue representing our communities with pride at many state events to come!",0.0,"St. John-Endicott School District added 6 new photos from November 14, 2019 at 1:45 PM.

We will meet in the parking lot between the football field and the gym. This workday is our fundraiser for the team. Our goal is to raise enough money to buy team polo shirts for away games and hopefully have enough left over to build our savings for future years. We will be doing odd jobs, yard clean-ups, sweeping, hauling leaves - just about anything short of home renovation. We will start in SJ and work our way thru Endicott to LaCrosse during the day, depending on the jobs that have been prearranged. Please have your boys come prepared to work. While this is a fundraiser, it is also a TEAM activity. Please have the boys bring brooms, shovels, pitchforks, garbage cans, gloves, lunch, plenty of hydration fluids and a good attitude.

Last night, September 23rd, most of the students from the Agriculture Mechanics class attended the city council meeting to pitch their prototypes for safety flag holders to be installed at various busy intersections in town.

They prepared a informational pamphlet and two different types of flag holders to give the city choices to move forward with.

Our goal is to build and install these flag holders by October 31, 2019 (Halloween) so that our many trick-or-treaters will be visible and SAFE during their night time activities.

This week in Endicott the Preschool-6th graders were invited to participate in a Silverwood Read-A-Thon. The goal was for each student to read 150 minutes this week. We surpassed the goal by 3,000 minutes and haven't even included today's reading! Great job P-6th grade! All 72 students will be coming home with a free Silverwood pass for this summer.

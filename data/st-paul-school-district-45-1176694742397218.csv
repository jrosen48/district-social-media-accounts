Dear St Paul Community,

I hope this message finds you and your family well and that you have been able to adjust your schedules to accommodate this unprecedented school closure situation.
-Our district buildings, including the batting cages, will remain closed to the public with only essential staff allowed to report. Though our track and other outside areas remain open to the public I would ask that all recommended social distancing practices be followed by those who choose to come walk or run on the track. Our buildings are being disinfected this week and we are delivering food boxes to some of our families in need of supplies. If you are in need or know of a family that can use the district support with food during this closure please contact the school at 503-633-2541 we will do everything we can to support our community during the closure.

In Spring 2019, Oregon leaders passed HB 3427 known as the Student Success Act, which will increase revenue for K-12 schools. This winter, each Oregon school district will apply for funds from the Student Investment Account created by the Student Success Act. Applications will be available for funding in four key areas:

1. Increased instructional time
2. Student health and safety
3. Class size reduction
4. Well-rounded learning opportunities

This survey is one opportunity for you to share your priorities in the categories of investment allowed under the Student Success Act.

Dear. St Paul Community,

Superintendent Wehrli continues to recover from his accident. On Wednesday, he had surgery on his hip and is already able to sit up in a chair. The next phase of his recovery will include transitioning to an inpatient rehabilitation facility and then hopefully home for the Holidays. Mr. Wehrli is very thankful for all the support the community has provided and looks forward to getting back to work.

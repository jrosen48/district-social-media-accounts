So, I finally finished my project for St. Mary's Academy Charter School. This was a labor of love for me. I have a great time photographing people as much as I do wildlife. I had done this with 4, maybe 6 images before, but never with 82 layers, so it was a learning experience and I really had fun with it. My bosses really like it and it was finally completed last night 09/11/20. We still had one missing, but she said go on and finish it up, she wouldn't be down for sometime, she's in SA. I can always add her at another time. I volunteered to do this since the school was not able to do a standard ""group"" photo due to the CV19 restrictions, so this was the next best thing. It was fun!! Enjoy, maybe the students next. Naw!!! üòç #SMACS #stmarysacademycharterschool #SMACSbeeville",3.0,"If you'd like to see a bigger photo of the ""collage/montage"" :) s

As part of our economic livelihood mission, many thanks to everyone who supported and bought locally grown Bee County tomatoes, squash, and zucchini this past Saturday. Trevor Bowman from Bigfoot Landscaping was here in partnership with a local farm and the Coffee Barrel/Uncommon Table. Fresh, healthy, and affordable veggies easily get turned into awesome meals at home.

Once the health situation is over, the Coffee Barrel Community Garden will jumpstart again Uncommon Herbs with St. Mary's Academy Charter School, Ms. Nancy Cavallin, Ms. Regina Cortez, and the great students!

Photos by Jennifer Jones, thank you for allowing me to share Jennifer:

So proud of the Joseph H. Cowen Race Team at St. Mary's Academy Charter School. They participated in the Texas Greenpower F-24 Race Series Competition in Houston on 11/18/19. I couldn't attend, but a few photos were sent to me to make ornaments for their tree at the Christmas Tree Forest. Here is a video and photos by Jennifer Jones (Race Team Mom) of one of the cars and the kids participating in the competition. By the way, St. Mary's Academy Charter School, is the ONLY grade school in the Coastal Bend that participates so far. They had no one to compete against, but they were able to run the cars on the track. They were really putting on a show. Great job team!!! I'll be more involved with the group in 2020, there will be another race in the Valley in April, we hope!! ü•∞ BTW, the kids have a huge hand in putting the cars together and working up and applying the ""skin"", outer design!! <3",0.0,"Sylvia Garcia-Smith Photography added 20 new photos ‚Äî at St Mary's Academy Charter School.

Photos by Jennifer Jones, thank you for allowing me to share Jennifer:

So proud of the Joseph H. Cowen Race Team at St. Mary's Academy Charter School. They participated in the Texas Greenpower F-24 Race Series Competition in Houston on 11/18/19. I couldn't attend, but a few photos were sent to me to make ornaments for their tree at the Christmas Tree Forest. Here is a video and photos by Jennifer Jones (Race Team Mom) of one of the cars and the kids participating in the competition. By the way, St. Mary's Academy Charter School, is the ONLY grade school in the Coastal Bend that participates so far. They had no one to compete against, but they were able to run the cars on the track. They were really putting on a show. Great job team!!! I'll be more involved with the group in 2020, there will be another race in the Valley in April, we hope!! ü•∞ BTW, the kids have a huge hand in putting the cars together and working up and applying the ""skin"", outer design!! <3",2019-11-23 18:16:45,,

To be eligible, your household income can be no higher than 300 percent of federal poverty guidelines; that means $38,280 a year for an individual and $65,160 for a household of three, for example. There are limits for residents who receive other forms of public rental assistance. There are multiple options to begin applying:

1) Call 651-291-0211. Multilingual staff are available weekdays from 8 a.m.-8 p.m.

2) Apply online at www.housinghelpmn.org/

Thank you so much to SEF for selecting me to receive this scholarship. When I joined the zoom call, I was so excited to have found out I am the North Stafford High School recipient. I was at a loss for words when all of the committee members were being so uplifting. This was such a wonderful moment for me and I appreciated all the kind comments. This money will help me to further my education at Longwood University, where I intend to major in Special Education and a concentration in Elementary Education.
Again thank you so much,

As we look ahead to another unusual school year, many Stamford families are deciding whether the Hybrid Model or Distance Learning is best for our families Stamford Public Schools!

To help answer some of your questions, I chatted with Stamford Public School Superintendent Dr. Tamu Lucero and Medical Advisor to the City of Stamford Dr. Henry Yoon about the upcoming school year.

We talked about how the hybrid schedule will work, what the buses will look like, mask breaks at school and childcare for working parents among many other topics. Check out the video above!

Effective today the State of California has approved our county variance application. This new state approval will allow for our county to move forward into an expanded stage 2 with modifications such as:

▪️Destination retail (retail stores), including shopping malls and swap meets
▪️Dine-in restaurants (other amenities, like bars or gaming areas, are not permitted in Stage 2)

The opening of schools for in-person learning will be delayed, as more planning still needs to take place. The Public Health Officer engaged in discussions with local Superintendents beginning in March and continues the collaborative process to assess and plan.

With the guidance of Public Health, all public schools in Stanislaus County will remain open at this time. We recognize that this is an ever-changing situation and will continue to make decisions to keep schools open as long as we believe it is safe for students and staff members.

Even as we see colleges canceling classes, moving to distance learning, major sporting events and other large events being cancelled, or postponed, our public health doctors still recommend that our schools stay open. If a case of COVID-19 is confirmed, for either a student or a staff member, we will consult with the Stanislaus County Public Health Department to determine whether school closure is recommended, and for what length of time.

1 - Check-in with yourself...How are you feeling right now? Name those feelings, acknowledge those feelings. Then text, call, snap, OR message a family member or a friend and ask them how they are feeling...Do not accept ""good"" or ""okay"" as an answer. Say, ""I really want to know, how ARE you?"" Then listen with the passion that you want someone to listen to you.
2 - Write down on a piece of paper or in your notes on your phone or list in your head the disappointments you are facing on this day. Name them. Acknowledge them. Sit in the disappointment for a moment.
3 - Name at least ONE thing you are thankful for right now.
4 - Decide how and what you are going to do to have a positive effect on those around you each day. HINT: You could use the Blue Jay ""Live Your Best Life"" Challenge for ideas!

Stanley HS will do another locker pick up on Tuesday, March 24th. Please see the schedule for your pick up time. If you have more than one student in the building, choose the time that works best for you.

At this point, we are only clearing out instructional items your child may need for their off-site learning.

To expedite the pick up, we are going to use the street on the south side of the building. Please enter from the main parking lot on west side of the building and drive to the east parking lot. Turn left into the parking lot and wait for someone to come out of door #10.

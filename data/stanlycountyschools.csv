It’s not too late to fill out the FAFSA - Free Application for Federal Student Aid!

It’s the first step to free or affordable college. The entire month of June, our state has joined together to create a FAFSA Frenzy in North Carolina to get the word out.

Most jobs require training or education after high school. People with a degree or high-quality credential will double or triple their lifetime earnings compared to a person with a high school diploma only.

Many students don’t realize until they fill out the FAFSA how much money is available to pay for college. Many have to pay nothing at all to get an education.

It’s not too late to fill out the FAFSA - Free Application for Federal Student Aid!

It’s the first step to free or affordable college. The entire month of June, our state has joined together to create a FAFSA Frenzy in North Carolina to get the word out.

Most jobs require training or education after high school. People with a degree or high-quality credential will double or triple their lifetime earnings compared to a person with a high school diploma only.

Many students don’t realize until they fill out the FAFSA how much money is available to pay for college. Many have to pay nothing at all to get an education.

Go to FAFSAFrenzyNC.com to get started.

Remember, you are not alone in this.

Please note the update regarding SCS graduation plans to celebrate our graduates!

Please know that we have carefully considered the feedback we have received regarding graduation.

Each high school will hold a drive-thru graduation on June 12, 2020.
Stanly Early College High School will do a drive through graduation at 6:30 pm on June 9, 2020. * Tentative plan, pending SCC approval.

Each high school will communicate with the students the time(s) for their ceremonies.

In addition, graduates will be celebrated through a senior video, to be posted on the school’s social media and/or website on June 12, 2020.

Although a drive-thru graduation will not be the same, the purpose is to commemorate the end of our students’ high school careers and celebrate their many accomplishments.

If the mass gathering bans are lifted by August 1, 2020, we will still hold traditional ceremonies at the Stanly County Agri-Civic center.

Please note the update regarding SCS graduation plans to celebrate our graduates!

Please know that we have carefully considered the feedback we have received regarding graduation.

Each high school will hold a drive-thru graduation on June 12, 2020.
Stanly Early College High School will do a drive through graduation at 6:30 pm on June 9, 2020. * Tentative plan, pending SCC approval.

Each high school will communicate with the students the time(s) for their ceremonies.

In addition, graduates will be celebrated through a senior video, to be posted on the school’s social media and/or website on June 12, 2020.

Although a drive-thru graduation will not be the same, the purpose is to commemorate the end of our students’ high school careers and celebrate their many accomplishments.

If the mass gathering bans are lifted by August 1, 2020, we will still hold traditional ceremonies at the Stanly County Agri-Civic center.

Stanly County School District Board of Education Chairman Melvin Poole:
""It is with much regret that I have to announce that Dr. Jeff James will be leaving the Stanly County school system for employment with Iredell Statesville school system. He has been an asset to this county, constantly pushing the envelope on what we as a school system could accomplish. While I am sure he would give credit to all those in the system, the fact of the matter is many positive things happened on his watch. Increase program offerings increased growth in school scores, and expansion of grants to the system just to name a few. He has been fully engaged in our community in a very positive way. He has been the most knowledgeable on public education issues of any superintendent I have been associated with in my 22 years of service on the local board. I understand when the opportunity comes knocking, one must take advantage of the opportunity, and therefore, on behalf of the Board and community I wish him the best and God's speed in his new endeavors.""",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3215290571814580&id=295498907127109,,0.0,"Important Announcement

Tina Carter, North Stanly Architecture/Engineering Drafting Teacher, is making shields that cover the entire face & are designed so that the medical professional can also wear a face mask (N95) underneath the shield. For infection with Covid 19 to occur, it must come into contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth. Therefore, the key to avoiding infection is to have these areas of the face covered. The shield is a good deterrent. Face shields are simple, easily produced devices that will have a major impact on public health. Until we have a vaccine to prevent COVID-19, this may be our best option to avoid this infection. Carter is also making mask extenders.

The census is used to calculate funds distributed by the Federal Government to State and Local Governments and for our schools for many different programs. It also determines the number of representatives from North Carolina in the US House of Representatives. Many businesses use the data to decide where to locate and what services to offer.

As concerns grow regarding the spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) and it’s impact on the ongoing need to continue operations on providing food assistance to our community we will be doing a “no contact” distribution.
We ask that you drive up & we will take the food to your car. If we don’t see you for some reason please call or honk to let us know you are outside. On Wednesday we will be receiving our Senior boxes. So we will only be serving our senior citizens that day! For any questions please call the office at 756-3254!

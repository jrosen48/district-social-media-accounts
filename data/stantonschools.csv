ATTENTION parents/guardians of students entering 7th grade for the 20/21 school year!
The Montgomery County Public Health office and the Red Oak Methodist Physician’s Clinic are going to team up to get 7th graders their required immunizations.
The state of Iowa requires that all students entering the 7th grade must have both a Tdap (Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis) and a Meningitis (meningococcal conjugate A,C,W,Y) prior to the first day of school.
This will be a walk-in clinic held at the Red Oak Methodist Physician’s Clinic (1400 Senate Ave. Ste 105) on 7/22/20 from 4-7PM.
Please call Montgomery County Public health at 712-623-4893 if you plan to attend, so that we make sure to have enough vaccine available.
If you are feeling ill, please call to reschedule.

The Montgomery County Public Health office and the Red Oak Methodist Physician’s Clinic are going to team up to get 7th graders their required immunizations.
The state of Iowa requires that all students entering the 7th grade must have both a Tdap (Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis) and a Meningitis (meningococcal conjugate A,C,W,Y) prior to the first day of school.
This will be a walk-in clinic held at the Red Oak Methodist Physician’s Clinic (1400 Senate Ave. Ste 105) on 7/22/20 from 4-7PM.
Please call Montgomery County Public health at 712-623-4893 if you plan to attend, so that we make sure to have enough vaccine available.

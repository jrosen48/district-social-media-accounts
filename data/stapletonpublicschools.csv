Important highlights of the site:

Easy to sign up for 30 min free consult with a therapist.

Facebook group for people to support and encourage one another https://www.facebook.com/groups/532767604340716/ (70 people signed up in the first 12 hours).

WhatsApp group chat. Some felt they were more likely to text messages of encouragement – WhatsApp is especially important for our immigrant/refugee populations.

Phone and Zoom support group times during the week (for now Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday). The purpose is for social support and connection.

Fun tips of the day: Today’s is Pirate hour – during a specific hour of the day everyone has to talk with a pirate accent.

Podcast for support and ideas about strengthening individuals and families. First Podcast going up today, I hope.

Simple and easy tips and resources so people don’t have to sift through mountains of info.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3098425736891871&id=564417560292714,Coming Together for Wellness,0.0,"Check out this website shared with us: https://cehs.unl.edu/comingtogetherforwellness/

Attention Mav Supporters.

I am looking for a group of Mavs that would be interested in helping paint the football field in Stapleton for our first home playoff game in CoOp history. I will bring over the stencils for the Big SV as well as numbers and hash marks. But this is a time consuming process. If anyone would like to help make OUR field really stand out for the game, please contact me.

Thanks for the amazing support you have show all year!!!!

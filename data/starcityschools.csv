As we are organizing our supply closet for this school year we have noticed that we are running low on particular items, but are limited on additional storage space. This leads us to ask for what may seem like an unusual request. If you would be willing, we would love to have some gift cards to local stores to purchase emergency items (such as undergarments, etc..), as the need arises. This would allow us to easily purchase these items in the correct size as needed as opposed to stocking some of all sizes for Pre-K through High School. If you would like to donate, please bring any gift cards to the high school office.",4.0,"Bright Futures Star City

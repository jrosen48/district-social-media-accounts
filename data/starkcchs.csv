Students always say they hate math, they can’t do math and that they always make mistakes in math causing them to shut down and give up. What they do not understand or realize is:

They are not the only ones who make mistakes in math
There is a lot that can be learned from our own mistakes as well as the mistakes of others
Precise thinking and problem-solving skills are necessary to be successful which grow over time and with continual practice and support
Math is all around us and is seen everywhere

Look through the images below that have been found throughout the years in various advertisements, websites, stores/restaurants and additional real-world instances.

What do you notice? What do you wonder? Can you find the errors in each image?

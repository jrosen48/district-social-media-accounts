They taught themselves these songs and had coaching from me only through video.

The Starkville Oktibbeha School District was awarded a $900,000 grant from Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Mississippi to support the District’s overarching goal to create school environments that emphasize healthy living. The funds will be used to implement the Wellness Incentive for Starkville Partnerships (WISP) project, a comprehensive school health and wellness program, at the Partnership School.

The WISP initiative includes multiple school gardens & mobile kitchens to facilitate meaningful, hands-on experiences, including planting, harvesting, cooking and tasting opportunities. A GrOW (Gardening and Overall Wellness) classroom will introduce all sixth-graders to nutrition, gardening, wellness activities and healthy behaviors. Seventh-graders will have their own classroom “garden pod” that will be incorporated into academic subjects such as science, math and language arts. The initiative also includes plans for a greenhouse, school farmers’ market, family cooking nights and fitness classes.

Holocaust survivor encourages students to educate themselves, never give up",4.0,"What an amazing opportunity for our students to experience living history! We were honored to welcome Holocaust survivor, Sami Steigmann, to AMS and SHS last week to share his story and a positive message about the power of dialogue.

“This is the first time MSU's Holmes Cultural Diversity Center has brought a speaker to Starkville public schools, said Rasheda Forbes, MSU assistant vice president for multicultural affairs. Steigmann is part of the last generation of Holocaust survivors, and hearing his story is ""critically important"" for middle and high school students to connect it to what they have learned in their history classes about WWII, she said.”

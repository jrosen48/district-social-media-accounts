It's a beautiful day to celebrate our 8th graders!
It brought me joy delivering gifts and diploma's to them today. At the same time, it was sad to see their last year at the Middle School end without our traditional Graduation and Awards Assembly. Usually, the 8th Grade Chorus sings a final inspirational selection as a ""send off"" at the end of the ceremony.
Now that the diplomas and awards are delivered, I'm very proud to share this video.
It celebrates the power of music to lift our spirits. The lyrics remind us that when we are facing challenges, we can always reach out to others for support.

Well he had quite the weekend! Aiden Strasburg just received a $1500 scholarship and award from Tri Community! There was another senior - not sure if he’s a Starpoint kiddo or not - but they both received the award and scholarship. The award was the Chuck Hamor Award which recognizes leadership and dedication to the junior members. It’s been such an emotional weekend to see him be recognized like this. You always think your kid is great but to see them recognized puts that feeling to a whole new level.

The hard work and efforts of Miss Smith’s 7th and 8th grade ELA Lab students really paid off! They have been researching and brainstorming solutions to combat the dangers of plastic pollution and the negative effects plastic has on our ecosystem. They applied this knowledge to their everyday experiences here at Starpoint MS by writing letters and meeting with Dr. Croft to discuss the amount of plastic pollution we generate here at the school.

Dr. Croft supported their suggestions and has agreed to switch from plastic straws to paper straws throughout the district! Congratulations to Ms. Smith’s 7th and 8th grade classes for making such a positive change here at Starpoint! Look for paper straws, as they will be in all our Starpoint cafeterias soon!

Mr. Dunlop found out last night that after recommending Natalie O'Brien she will be recognized on the ice, this Saturday at the Sabres game, as the LECOM All-Star student, for not only being an honors student in the HS, but also for her pioneering effort which successfully landed Starpoint, NW, NT, and Lew-Port a Federation girls high school hockey team. At the end there is a link to an article briefly explaining the recognition.

As a part of the recognition, she gets a customized jersey, a blurb read about her prior to the Sabres starting lineup, and four tickets to the game. She is only one of 5 students to be recognized this season, so it's a pretty big deal.

If you see her or her mom in the MS, Diane, please congratulate them on this honor.

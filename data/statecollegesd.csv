Last night, our Board of Directors voted to not have school on Friday, Sept. 4. This applies to all students: in-school, remote and Virtual Academy. This is not a switch to full remote learning; it’s akin to a snow day for students with no instruction, and will be made up on Dec. 23. Because of the rising number of COVID-19 cases reported in our county yesterday, the Board took action to use Friday to further assess the local data we are receiving and better inform our course of action.

Right now, no decisions have been made regarding next week. Over the next couple of days, we will continue to evaluate COVID-19 cases in our community and let you know once we make a decision regarding Tuesday.

If in schools Tuesday, it will be an A-L day for secondary. Middle school Cycle day 3. Elementary Cycle Day 3.

Dear SCASD Community:

While we are under Governor Wolf’s stay-at-home order until April 30, we want to clarify the use of district facilities. To be clear, all playgrounds, tennis courts, and athletic stadiums are closed until further notice.

Because exercise and walking outside are allowed under the order, we support the community’s use of our grounds for exercise and fresh air, as long as you practice social distancing and do not use the playground equipment. However, group activities and any type of congregation are not permitted.

Both our police departments and school district request your assistance to share and support this closure for the well-being of our community. The police and our district administrators are working together to comply with the governor’s order.

We realize this may be an inconvenience, but we all need to have a hand in keeping our community safe and slowing the spread of COVID-19.

2nd PLACE AT PIAA-AAA STATE CHAMPIONSHIPS!!!🏆
What a show they gave us today! Couldn’t be prouder of these ladies. They’ve had the goal of being on the podium since last year when they took 3rd.
Over a sloppy course, they worked together and got it done. First through 1 mile, 3rd at 2 miles, and closed hard to finish in 2nd. State High’s best finish in 25 years!
Huge congrats to the girls who raced today and the entire team who all played an important role in this final outcome. And huge congrats to my amazing assistants, Susan Marshall and Artie Gilkes, our incredible booster club, and all the parents for their support throughout the season.

Your Student’s Artwork is Ready to View and Order!

In March your student created a unique piece of art that the PTO shipped to Square1Art to be made into stickers as well as other products that you may want to purchase. The stickers are free, and we will get those to your student when the situation allows. Due to the current stay at home order we will not be able to distribute or accept paper orders. However, you can order this artwork online by going to www.square1art.com. Once there, click on shop and search for artwork. You will need to put our state, school name, and student’s name into the search criteria. Orders must be placed online by April 17th. These orders will ship to school in May, and we will distribute them as soon as the situation allows. Proceeds from these sales are used to fund Fine Arts Day each year. We appreciate your support!

We hope everyone is geared back up and ready to start school tomorrow after this nice break we have had.

Prior to break, your child should have brought home information regarding their class basket theme for the School of Rock Fundraiser. These baskets will be raffled off at the event.

This event helped the PTO so much last year and we are hopeful it will be just as successful this year! Please help by bringing in an item or items that relate to your basket theme.

The event details are below and I have also included the flier that lists out the basket themes in the comments below.

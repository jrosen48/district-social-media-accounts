In his 2:00 news conference that just ended, Governor Northam has announced that all schools in Virginia will be closed for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year. I know that this raises several questions for families. Please understand that the Virginia Department of Education will be issuing more guidance to school divisions within the next 24 hours regarding what graduation will look like for our Seniors, including grades and G.P.A., and how learning will continue for the remainder of this academic year. We do anticipate that SOL testing will be waived for students this year. I will follow up with more information tomorrow. Thank you for your patience and understanding during these unprecedented times. Stay safe. Stay Healthy. And stay positive – we will get through all of this together.

Here are some fun and easy ways to celebrate the men and women who make our school days a little better:

1) Make cards (or download some from this site) for the cafeteria workers and have your students deliver them personally.
2) Have your class make paper-flower bouquets to hand out to their favorite staff member.
3) Write a list of why your lunch staff are awesome or create a Hall of Fame for the staff (for example: “Most likely to greet you with a
smile” or “Best chef”) and hang them up around the cafeteria.
4) Work with the teachers to take over the cafeteria during lunch and have your students act out a scene from one of the Lunch Lady
books.
5) Arrange for your students to serve lunch to the cafeteria staff.
6) Leave a huge thank-you banner in your cafeteria for students to sign as they come in for lunch.
7) Decorate the cafeteria with streamers and pictures of the staff’s kitchen utensils re-imagined as hero tools.

Hi, I’m Mrs. Hodge. I’ve been a teacher for 26 years, starting out my career in Cokato, Minnesota. After teaching twelve years at Cokato Elementary and getting my master degree in education, I moved around a bit with my husband Milton. I then taught in Kentucky, U.S. Virgin Islands, Colorado, and now the last three years at Saint Cloud Math and Science Academy.
It’s been wonderful to be back in Minnesota by my family of four grown children (and their spouses) and five grandchildren. We love to get together for simple things like dinners, camping, shopping, coffee, etc. When I’m by myself I like to quilt, read, surf on my phone/computer, decorate, paint, knit, play with my puppy Evie, watch baking shows, the news and all sorts of different series on TV, embroider dish towels, mix essential oil recipes, camping... Ha, ha! The list goes on...
I’ve taught every grade from 1st-5th. I’m part of the Leadership Team and teach Second Grade here at SCMSA. It’s a special, family centered place with the very best students and staff!",2020-08-26 09:16:21,,

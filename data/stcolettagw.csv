The holiday season is always such a joyous time! We showed you how our students celebrated during their holiday show, so take a look at how our Rockville adult program got in on the fun during their “Celebration Around the World” performance.

Our adult participants learned about Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, and Christmas, and then performed dances, sang songs, and recited poems! The staff really went all out on the decorations and costumes, and ensured that each participant not only had a role, but had a blast celebrating the season. We had a wonderful parent turnout, and were so excited they could enjoy the festivities with us.

Our holiday performances are a big hit, and they don’t just serve as a fun activity, they’re educational. From learning about various holidays, to rehearsing their performance for an audience, to practicing time on task while making decorations, it’s all encompassing.

None of this would be possible without friends like you, so we sincerely thank you for everything that you do for St. Coletta!",0.0,"St. Coletta of Greater Washington added 34 new photos.

As 2019 winds down and we prepare for holiday break, our students celebrated the spirit of the season during their holiday celebrations. These performances are always a blast for their families and our staff, and you can feel the joyous energy in the room.

The classes learn songs representing each holiday, play instruments, wear adorable outfits, and perform for their families and peers. The gym is decorated and transformed into a festive stage, vibrant tunes fill the room as everyone claps and sings along, and the students received a special visit from Santa!

The holiday celebrations aren’t just a fun way to celebrate the holiday season; they are another example of how our students are continuing to excel. Some of them shy away from attention and were hesitant to participate, but the music and the energy got them actively involved, playing instruments, and performing solos!

From career fairs and Black History Month fairs, to fashion shows and field days, we have something going on all school year. Recently, our students had a science fair with different stations full of fun experiments.

Inclusion is vital, so accommodations were made so that every student could participate in each experiment. They made lemon volcanoes and conducted a Skittles experiment to see what would happen when you added dye to one, and poured water over another. It was a hands-on day that even included some fun riding scooters! Our Science Fair 2019 album shows all the excitement.

Field days are fun filled days where every classroom gets the opportunity to get outside and get moving. The sun shines bright and the students enjoy countless activities, like hula hooping, sack races, blowing bubbles, ball pits, baseball and basketball. They got to dress up and take pictures wearing fun animal themed face masks and beads, and also get their hands messy with sidewalk chalk and snow cones.

We love the opportunity to get outside on a nice day and engage our students. Some worked with therapists on tasks involving fine motor skills, like bowling and the Go Fishin’ game, while others ran around and climbed through play tunnels. Our staff work together to create phenomenal field days for each age level, and you can see how much the kids thoroughly enjoyed their day!",0.0,"St. Coletta of Greater Washington added 33 new photos.

Remembering Joseph “J” Watkins

When those of us at St. Coletta think of our friend and board member, “J”, we remember his generosity of spirit and his willingness to do anything to help with our mission. But most of all when we think of him the word that comes to mind is magic. “J” was an enchanter. You were captivated in his presence by his mischievous grin and that glint in his eye. He was our own Puck always ready for a laugh and a good time. Being with him was special because he was special.

He had tremendous creative gifts that were enhanced by his ability to see beyond a vacant hotel ballroom into a world of make believe. Every year when we had our annual gala he amazed. His work with flowers and décor was so much an expression of who he was as a person, glad, unconventional, delightful. He had the ability to pull back the curtain of everyday and introduce you to moments of true wonder.
Flowers never last as long as you want them to and neither did he. Oh how he will be missed.

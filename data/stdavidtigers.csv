Good Morning!

I hope that you all had a wonderful weekend! This past Friday we took 10 FFA member to Curry Farms to participate in the annual FFA Chile Field Day. Students were tested on their Knowledge on the following: Soil, Plant Breeding and Genetics, Processing Plant Management, Chile Seed, Chile Pod and Chile Crop Production, and Disease Identification. Our students represented St. David well as we placed 3rd in the TEAM Written exam and received a plaque for this achievement. Additionally, a senior was recognized and received a trophy for placing 3rd high individual in the written exam. Lastly, at the field day there was a HOT Chile eating competition and our Jonah Lewis went home with 3rd place and $50 dollars in his pocket!

I am thankful to work with such wonderful students. I look forward to the year we have ahead of us to challenge our students and celebrate their achievements. Attached are some photos from the event. Please enjoy.

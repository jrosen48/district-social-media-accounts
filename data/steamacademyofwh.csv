On Monday, April 20th, Governor DeWine extended the closure of all Ohio schools through the end of the school year. The action was taken to contain the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19). Now that this decision has been made, we are excited to announce our more permanent home learning plan platform (Canvas).

Until the end of the year, supplemental and teacher guided instruction will be provided through this online platform. Canvas will be replacing the weekly Choice Boards. A MODIFIED SCHEDULE will be rolled out on Thursday and Friday of this week. Each family should expect a call from teachers with student login information and schedule details. Students should login and enroll in the orientation course when they initially login.

Below is a link with specific instructions on how to access Canvas. Please let me know if you need any assistance.

INSTRUCTIONS TO LOGIN TO CANVAS HAVE BEEN SENT TO PARENT EMAILS.

Respectfully,

Dear STEAM Academy Families,

Following the Federal Government‚Äôs extension of social distancing guidelines, Governor DeWine extended the closure of all Ohio schools through Friday, May 1st.

Your child‚Äôs continued learning is important to us, and we know it is to you as well.

Our teachers have been working extremely hard to develop and facilitate lessons for all of our scholars.

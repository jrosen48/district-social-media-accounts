After two days of college visits across Atlanta, Steel City scheduled a tour of The Voting Rights Museum and The History of Slavery Museum in Selma, Alabama. The two buildings were on opposite sides, but connected by the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Our students had the opportunity to explore each museum guided by the first hand stories of Reverend Sam Mosteller who was just 11 during the time of Martin Luther King Jr.'s arrival in Selma as an organizer and who led the famous march across the Bridge. Our students after learning, reflecting, and experiencing had the chance to walk over this bridge. Just as the students got to the base of the bridge on what had been a hot, sunny, Alabama June day, the sky opened up and poured down on our students. Instead of turning around and going to the bus, our students marched together over the bridge arm-in-arm, and then ran to the bus to escape the rain. #GetOutAndVote #AncestorsFoughtForThis",,,0.0,"On this VOTING day, we found it fitting to share a special story that included our Class of 2020 end of the year trip to #Selma.

We know being in Quarantine has us all staying inside, but being physically active during this time is especially important for our physical & mental health! Show us what creative ways you are using to stay physically active. Pictures & Videos should be submitted to squad leaders by or before Thursday @ 3:30pm. The squad leader will submit to Ms. Sad√© for entry. Friday the winner will be announced and prize will be issued to the winning student.

Currently no school days have been cancelled, however, we are keeping a close eye on all recommendations from the Indiana Department of Health and Indiana Department of Education. As of now, we will continue with our normally scheduled Spring Break from Thursday, March 26th through Friday, April 3rd. We will use this time for an intensive deep clean of the building. The safety of our school community is of utmost importance and I will continue to keep everyone in the loop! Thanks, Ms. Kirley",2020-03-12 12:06:51,,

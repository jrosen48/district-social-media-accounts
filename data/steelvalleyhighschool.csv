This is a message from Steel Valley High School. Any student in grades 9-11 that haven’t selected their courses for next school year, please do so by May 15th. A copy of the student handbook and available courses are on the district website. All requested courses should be emailed to scheduling@steelvalleysd.org. Parents please continue to encourage your students to do the best they can in their remote learning classes. There are only 3 weeks left to earn the passing grade for the nine weeks. In the coming weeks, we expect Governor Wolf to relax the stay at home order. Once this order is lifted, we will prepare an organized plan for students to clean out their lockers and return books. More information will be provided in the future. I hope this message finds you well and we look forward to the day that all students can return to classrooms.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2764072920371236&id=601766329935250,,0.0,"Your weekly update from Mr. Strom:

Hi friends! I have some book news—EVERYTHING I THOUGHT I KNEW now has a release date (10/13/20) and a cover! I love how this cover turned out and I’m so excited to finally be able to share it... if you want to preorder (which is great for authors!) you now can do so through Indiebound (this allows you to order through your local independent bookstore), Amazon, Barnes & Noble and Target. I’m feeling a little emotional! 😭❤️😭

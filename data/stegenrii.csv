A fake letter is circulating, claiming to be from the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. The letter states that all students in Missouri will have to repeat their current grade if they do not complete final exams in a classroom setting or complete all curriculum established at the start of the school year. This is false.

This letter is a hoax, and it is a poor attempt at inciting confusion and alarm. As the letter was dated April 1 and signed by a Candice B. Fureal, it seems to be someone's April Fool's scheme.

After reading “Balloons Over Broadway” by Melissa Sweet and learning about the history of the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, the students worked in pairs to decorate balloons with notes and artwork on the people and things for which they were thankful. That’s where the coding comes in! The students had the opportunity to use the library’s new Bee-Bots, a robot designed for young children to teach sequencing, estimation and problem solving! Students use directional keys on the top of the robot to enter up to 40 commands, including sending the Bee-Bot forward, backward, left and right. Ms. Gettinger’s students created a simple route and sent the balloons through a parade around the classroom!

We would like to spotlight seventh grader Bennett Walls, who has donated his time over the past several weeks to helping raise funds for a faculty member in need.

“I’m in Student Council, and in that group we try to make a difference,” Bennett says. “So I just wanted to do the same here, make a difference.”

Bennett came up with his own creative plan, organized the logistics through the middle school office and spent his Advisory time each week raising funds. Bennett decided to create his own type of carnival game, where his fellow students could pay to spin a wheel to see how many pieces of candy they could choose. He even dressed the part to garner visitors! Through this endeavor, Bennett was able to raise over $300. We’re proud of you, Bennett!

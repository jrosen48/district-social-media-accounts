However, the legislative leadership extended the statutory waivers/suspensions of the Open Public Meeting Act (OPMA) cited in Proclamation 20-28.4 until 11:59 p.m. October 1, 2020. Based on this extension, meetings that are open to the public must be held remotely. The September 9 Study Session will be held via a Zoom webinar.

No decision making is undertaken at a Study Session, and Study Sessions do not offer a Public Comments section. All viewers will be placed on mute for the meeting.

The Family Academy is a series of interactive sessions designed to help families and caring adults support their student learners. We are all in this together and a strong connection and collaboration between the school and the family support system is critical. We are limiting the size of each session to ensure families can interact with our session facilitators - but resources provided in each session will also be available on our website for all families. We look forward to seeing you!

Graduation was originally scheduled for May 30th; however, due to the current situation with COVID-19 graduation will either be postponed until later this summer or we will host a virtual ceremony. With that being said, Dr. Lovell and everyone at MECHS would prefer to host traditional graduation with virtual being the absolute last resort. We are working with the University of North Georgia for potential new dates and times. Once we have more guidance from Governor Kemp and the Department of Education, we will communicate that to all of you.

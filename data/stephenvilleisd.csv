BEFORE & AFTER SNAPS OF A WONDERFUL COMMUNITY PROJECT –– Stephenville School Resource Officer Benny Payne saw a need for picnic benches at Henderson Jr. High for the Life Skills students to be able to have a place to sit and work outside on nice days. The kids thrive when allowed to work outside but didn't have a place to sit that accommodated their needs. Officer Payne was able to get two benches destined for the dump from the city of Stephenville, McCoy's Building Company donated supplies and Bruce Nation, the Construction Technology and Architecture at Stephenville High School, and his students refurbished the tables. Staffers at HJH said they believe this project ""is a continued testament of how giving our town is when a need is presented.""

The Honeybee Soccer team may have an opportunity to play for the State Championship on Thursday at 2:30 pm in Georgetown. As a district of innovation, SISD has the flexibility to adjust the district schedule and provide our families and friends with a full day off to support the team on Thursday.

Also, we would like to invite the community to meet by the courthouse on the square tomorrow to give the team a huge Stephenville sendoff! Please be on the square tomorrow by 10:20 so you don’t miss the excitement! The bus will travel east on Washington and turn right onto Graham street.

While working on her film Hastings’ used the inspiration of the angel and demon as your conscience. She wanted to convey the point “people never go away, and you can let them drown each other out and lose your sense of reality.” Hastings goes on to say, “In the end what the video is trying to convey is you. You are telling yourself these things, and if you focus on your demon, you need to fall back and listen to the other shoulder.”

Hastings stated the message of the film to be “Always look for the light positive. It will be okay in the end.”

Since the concert had to be canceled we bring you a brief slideshow from a previous performance to recognize this ensemble.

Auditions for the Baroque Ensemble and Viol Consort are usually held in September of each year and practices are held outside of school hours under the direction of Orchestra Director Enrique Vilaseco and Dr. Phillip Serna. Student-musicians in this group also perform at area venues and usually travel each summer to the Boston Early Music Festival.

In addition to a harpsichord and other period instruments, ensemble members have the opportunity to play the theorbo. From what we know, Stevenson is the only high school in the country to have this unique early instrument for students to experience.

Holmes was nominated to compete in a national fan vote contest with the winner awarded a trip to the High School Slam Dunk & 3-Point Championships in Atlanta during the weekend of Final Fours. RJ garnered enough votes to win all of his brackets and made it to the finals. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the final contest was ended early and resulted in both finalists being named 2020 High School Slam Dunk Fan Vote Winners. Holmes was interviewed virtually for Sunday's broadcast.

RJ shared a note of appreciation for the Stevenson community who supported him in this contest:

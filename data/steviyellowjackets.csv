Seniors and Senior Families,

Just a reminder that tomorrow from 9am-3pm, we will be checking in/out all senior items. Seniors, when you enter through the front entrance of the building, a para-educator will give you a map and directions pertaining to checkout, as well information for our graduation ceremony. Next, you will check in your Chromebook, classrooms books and supplies, grab your locker contents, collect your fees and fines sheet from Katie, and get your graduation cords/gowns, and graduation doughnuts from Vickie! Finally, there is a chance our Yearbooks will be in today, so if they are, Jackie Bauman will hand them out to seniors tomorrow instead of Friday morning.

Look forward to seeing you all tomorrow!

Seniors, when you enter through the front entrance of the building, a para-educator will give you a map and directions pertaining to checkout, as well information for our graduation ceremony. Next, you will check in your Chromebook, classrooms books and supplies, grab your locker contents, collect your fees and fines sheet from Katie, and get your graduation cords/gowns, and graduation doughnuts from Vickie! Finally, there is a chance our Yearbooks will be in today, so if they are, Jackie Bauman will hand them out to seniors tomorrow instead of Friday morning.

Look forward to seeing you all tomorrow!

Just a reminder that tomorrow from 9am-3pm, we will be checking in/out all senior items. Seniors, when you enter through the front entrance of the building, a para-educator will give you a map and directions pertaining to checkout, as well information for our graduation ceremony.

The buses will be located at Burnt Fork Market and at the intersection of Airport Rd & Illinois Bench to hand out breakfasts & lunches from 10am until 12pm!

These meals are FREE for all of the children in Stevensville!

Come on down, give us a smile and get some food!

Spread the word!

You may notice some repeat meals as we get closer to the year end.

You may notice what you get at the bus stop isn’t the exact same as what you get on the bus route.

We are working on getting through some of the items we would like to use before school is out for the summer! So, we are packing the same or similar meals a couple of days in a row.

Senior Parents,

Thank you for your feedback in regards to the graduation situation. After looking through the responses, it’s clear that our parents and students would like to have graduation on May 30th, at the SHS gymnasium. We will navigate all the construction as it happens and plan accordingly.

The post and survey was an opportunity for you to voice your opinion about a very important ceremony. The school was placed in a difficult position, to have to make decisions based on the most recent construction timelines. Our job at SHS is to give your child, the best experience possible when it comes to this ceremony. This was the purpose behind the survey.

Sincerely,

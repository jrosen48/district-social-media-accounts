I want to take a moment to express my sincere appreciation for the jobs you do. Teaching is not an easy job and in recent years, the job has only become more difficult. I know there are days you question why anyone would want to do what you do. At the end of the day, you are where you are because you have big hearts and love children. You love to see them grow and learn. You want to make a positive difference in their lives. As a former teacher, I realize there is no better feeling than having a former student come up to me and say, ""you helped me, you made a difference in my life, I appreciate what you did for me.""

Please know I am thankful for you and the wonderful jobs you do. Our students are in the best hands.

Pleased to announce that Missouri will fully reopen and enter Phase 2 of its “Show Me Strong Recovery” Plan on Tuesday, June 16, 2020.

It is truly incredible to think about how far Missouri has come since March. At that time, no one knew what to expect. There was a lot of uncertainty, worry, and concern. Here we are today, just over 90 days since our first COVID-19 case in Missouri, and I am proud to say we have overcome all of these challenges and more than met our reopen goals.

During Phase 2, there will be no statewide health order. All statewide restrictions will be lifted, though local officials will still have the authority to put further rules, regulations, or ordinances in place.

We must remember that COVID-19 is not gone. It is still extremely important for everyone to continue social distancing. Be proactive. Avoid large, congested crowds, and if you can’t social distance, take extra precautions to protect yourself and those around you.

It is up to us to take responsibility for our own actions.

School will be in session at “The Nest” on Wednesday, February 5, 2020.

We understand the excitement that is surrounding Kansas City’s Chiefs first Super Bowl parade in 50 years. However, the Stewartsville C2 School District will be open (weather permitting) when the Chiefs hold their celebratory parade tomorrow.

We have made our decision based on what is best for our families as a whole. It is never our intention to create unnecessary stress on families who may lack the work flexibility or child-care availability, except when student and staff safety is of concern.

Thank you for your understanding and patience, and Go Chiefs!

It is crazy to think we are now 20 years into the 21st century, but even crazier; we are about to begin the 2nd semester of the 2019-2020 school year. As we return to #TheNest, let’s remember the amazing opportunities we have presented to us daily. We have opportunities to engage in each other’s lives positively, to impact those around us academically, socially, and emotionally. Finally, we have opportunities to decide how we are going to work through trials and tribulations. Interestingly though opportunity by itself does not guarantee success, it only guarantees opportunity. My challenge for each of us as we return to “The Nest” is to seize on our opportunities with 2020 vision and continue to have a mindset that says “Yes I can,” and be prepared to push ourselves to be the best we can be not only for ourselves but most importantly our students. #TheCardinalWay #CardinalVictory

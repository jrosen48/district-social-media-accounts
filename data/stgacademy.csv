These flowers and trees were planted last fall and are now getting ready to burst forth with the life of a new season.

Now for some plant philosophy: We have always planned for the grounds at SGA to serve as a learning environment and already we are reminded of one of the first lessons Mother Nature gives us. What you sow and carefully tend to, will give abundant reward. We've had a lot of bleak, stormy, cold winter weather. If given what they need all these plants pictured come back stronger and more vigorous after a period of vernalization (cold harsh weather.) Sometimes life gives us challenging circumstances, but if we endure them we are made better equipped to thrive in our lives. At St. George Academy our goal is not merely to give information to students, but to help them learn to approach and relish challenge; to equip them with confidence and skills that we hope will serve them abundantly in their future lives.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1218320164932540&id=709572449140650,,0.0,"Had the most beautiful spring-like day today at The Academy.

As the disconnect between the high school experience and the college's expectations continues to grow, universities are starting to change what they look for in the students they offer admissions to. Many schools no longer require pre-admission tests like the ACT. According to this article, some top-tier universities will no longer offer credit for AP courses citing that even though students may perform well in these courses and on the AP exams, they are still unprepared for the university experience.

This reality is more confirmation that public education's model of industrial schooling is failing to adequately achieve its stated goals and students are increasingly being left unprepared. If high school isn't preparing its students, what exactly is it doing? Saint George Academy is built on the premise that the purpose of an education is an education and our mission is to prepare our students for success at tomorrow's universities.

Huge shout out to the crew from Game Haven St. George. They were simply incredible. They brought a truckload of games and mad skills. If you haven't been to the new Game Haven St. George - go and check it out.

Everyone attending had a great time, except Emma K who lost to the Director in rummy. It was a perfect way to bid adieu to 2016 and the first of many events coming this year to The Academy. Stay tuned for our next student event at St. George Academy.

Have a great end to the holidays, SGA. Stay smart. We'll see you soon.

It is with an incredible amount of excitement, and relief, that I am able to share with you that we received our last and final vote today from the State Charter Board allowing us to open our doors for 2016! You are the first to know! This is a huge accomplishment in the life of St. George Academy and one that has taken an amazing amount of work. 12 schools started in this process over a year ago, 5 schools made it through. This is fantastic news for our families and education as a whole in Southern Utah.

Please share this information with friends, family, or whomever you know that has an interest in the quality of education we wish for our children.

Thank you again for your interest in St. George Academy. I will see you all next week, Wednesday evening, 5:30 pm, at the informational evening hosted by George Washington Academy.

Morning all! It's a Thrilling Thursday to day this April 16th.

Joke of the Day:
Why did the boy cut a hole in his umbrella? So he could see when it stopped raining.

Random Fact of the Day:
The brighter the star, the shorter its life span.

A couple of things to remember:

1. Buses run at 1:00pm on Tuesday and Thursday for packet delivery and return.

2. Every student of St. Ignatius Elementary must remain in contact with their teacher during the Covid 19 closure. We have permission from the State of Montana to continue educating through our proposed plan so it is imperative that we maintain daily contact during the weekday with our students and families. Try your best, check in daily and you'll be fine!

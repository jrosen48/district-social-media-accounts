Spring Conversation Cards: Why is asking and answering questions important?
We ask questions in order to learn more about a topic and we answer questions to provide information. To answer questions, students think about the meaning of the question, form an answer and speak the answer they formed. To ask a question your child has to think about what they want to ask, form a question in their mind and then produce the question they want to ask.
Asking and answering is part of how we learn! It is important to form complete sentences that have meaning.

The lights are a beacon to show the Senior Class we are thinking of them and to remind them there will be a time where we will be all together once again.

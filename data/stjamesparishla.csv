7AM Monday: What can we expect from üåÄ Marco üåÄ today? Marco is significantly weaker this morning and is located off the coast of SE LA. We still have the potential for heavy rainfall and coastal flooding/storm surge. Some gusty winds are possible along the coastal areas.

Heavy Rainfall:üåß
There is still a threat of heavy rainfall today, particularly along the SE LA coast and MS coastal areas.
-3 to 5 inches with locally higher amounts of rainfall is possible today.
-This is dependent upon where any bands associated with Marco set up today.

Storm Surge/Coastal Flooding:üåä
-There is the potential for 2 to 4 feet of storm surge/coastal flooding from Morgan City to Ocean Springs
-There is the potential for 2 to 3 feet in Lake Pontchartrain and Maurepas
-There is the potential for 2 to 3 feet from Ocean Springs to the AL state line.

Tornado Threat:üå™
-There is also still the threat for tornadoes today inside thunderstorms/banding from Marco.
-These tornadoes would be short-lived and fast moving.",3.0,"US National Weather Service New Orleans Louisiana

It's moving toward the west near 14 mph (22 km/h), and this general motion is expected to continue today. A turn toward the west-northwest at a similar forward speed is expected tonight, with this motion continuing through the rest of the week.

Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. Gradual strengthening is forecast to take place during the next 48 hours, and the depression is expected to become a tropical storm later today. When that occurs, it will be named Josephine.

Juneteenth is a celebration of freedom and justice and it is a reminder of the strength and resolve of African Americans throughout history.

Honoring Juneteenth gives us all an opportunity to develop a greater and deeper understanding and appreciation of the experiences of African Americans. As we take time to reflect today, may we all recommit ourselves to the ongoing fight for equity and justice. #Juneteenth #lagov

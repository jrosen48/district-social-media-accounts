If you ever wondered about the impact our schools have on the community -- the efforts underway this week offer a small glimpse at the many services provided throughout the district. This week we've seen students stepping outside with signs just to let teachers know they miss them, staff members loading up sack lunches to make sure kids are fed, school resource officers jumping in to help because they care about the wellbeing of students and many others working remotely to provide distance learning. Thank you to our amazing teachers and staff, and to you - our families - for helping from home. We know this hasn't been easy, but we will get through it together.

We would love to see your photos too! Teachers and parents -- send us pics through a direct message to show us how you're adapting to distance learning.

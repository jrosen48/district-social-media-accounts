Dear Parents/Guardians,

Governor Walz announced this afternoon that the distance learning period will continue through the remainder of the 2019-20 school year.

He has also ordered that student instruction not be held on Friday, May 1 and Monday, May 4 to allow teachers to prepare for the remainder of the school year in a distance learning format. Emergency Childcare will still operate on those days.

School Principals, Program Managers, and Teachers are all working through creative ways to reimagine events and celebrations to honor students at the end of the school year. Schools and Programs will share updates about each event as plans are finalized.

Class of 2020 Parents/Guardians - you will receive a separate message this evening from Principal Meyers outlining end-of-year plans for graduating Seniors.

Please know that we are thinking about you and are here to support you and your students in any way we can. We appreciate your continued partnership and support of St. Louis Park Public Schools.

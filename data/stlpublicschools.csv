Today marks a special time for the DEFINE Family. It‚Äôs the beginning of Socktober; a month dedicated to providing awareness to homelessness in its many forms.

We are pleased to announce The St. Louis Public School District has partnered with us in this annual awareness campaign.

Here is how it works: For every pair of socks sold this month, we are donating a pair of socks to the SLPS Students in Transition Program (SIT). We were so impressed with the great work the SIT program has done for thousands of students in the district who are routinely hidden and often overlooked, that we had to get involved and show our support.

Happy Socktober and please share this post about the hidden gem that is the Students in Transition Program for St. Louis Public Schools.

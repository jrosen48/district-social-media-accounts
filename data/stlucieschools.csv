The Project Citizen National Showcase was recently held, where students from Massachusetts to Arizona tackled problems in their community. Students from Mrs. Wright’s 3rd period Civics class from last school year earned an Exceptional rating on their project, “Water We Waiting For?” Last January, Hannah Dorval, Devin Habyan, Alexia Morgan, and Caleb Chuquillanqui represented their class at the district showcase, where they presented the class project, seeking to combat the high rate of child drownings in the state of Florida by proposing changes to public policy. They were interviewed by multiple judges and answered questions about their proposed policy, which helped the project advance to the state competition. Then, over the summer, Alexia Morgan and Hannah Raymond presented the project at the state level, where they were interviewed once again and their efforts advanced the project to the National competition, earning an Exceptional rating. Congratulations to all, they worked so hard on all parts of this project. We are so proud of our rockets!",4.0,"Congratulations!

Washing your hands is easy, and it’s one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of germs. Clean hands can stop germs from spreading from one person to another and throughout an entire community—from your home and workplace to childcare facilities and hospitals.
Follow these five steps every time.

1. Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap.
2. Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
3. Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the “Happy Birthday” song of the ""ABC"" song from beginning to end twice.

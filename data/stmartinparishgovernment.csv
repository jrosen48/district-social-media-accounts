I am compelled to clarify a MISCONCEPTION which many people have relative to screening/testing sites for COVID-19. The site at the Cajundome in Lafayette Parish IS FOR ANYONE. It is not limited to only Lafayette Parish residents.

You should go to the site only if you are experiencing symptoms of coronavirus (coughing, shortness of breath and/or temperature greater than 100.4) and considered high risk. Therefore, if you experience any symptoms associated with COVID-19, call your family physician or 211 for guidance.

The common symptoms of COVID-19 are:
• Fever
• Cough
• Shortness of breath

Individuals who are at a high risk of severe illness associated with COVID-19 are:
• Healthcare workers with direct contact with confirmed or suspected COVID cases
• Pregnant women
• Patients with immunocompromised conditions
• Age 60 years or older
• People living in communal settings (nursing facilities, shelters, etc.)

We are also looking for kids toys such as outdoor play-sets, pack-n-plays, cribs.

They do not have to be in the best condition, we just ask that they are intact, not water logged so they can be moved around, and able to add an element of realism to our trainings.

We are striving to add as many elements of real materials to our 'Fire Simulations"" so the men and women of our Fire District can simulate the most accurate conditions and scenarios when training.

We are also looking for kids toys such as outdoor play-sets, pack-n-plays, cribs.

They do not have to be in the best condition, we just ask that they are intact, not water logged so they can be moved around, and able to add an element of realism to our trainings.

We are striving to add as many elements of real materials to our 'Fire Simulations"" so the men and women of our Fire District can simulate the most accurate conditions and scenarios when training.

If you have anything that you would like to donate please contact the St. Martin Parish Fire District Office through Facebook Messenger or by phone: (337) 332-1314",2019-08-15 12:30:21,,

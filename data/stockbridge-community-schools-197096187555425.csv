Late Last night, Governor Gretchen Whitmer and State Superintendent Michael Rice announced the closure of all Michigan PK-12 school buildings, public, private and boarding, starting Monday, March 16 through Sunday, April 5. Limited staff may be in the buildings, but the buildings will not be accessible to the general public or any student.

Today we will be open for school.

We ask that all staff and students take home their personal belongings from their lockers, classrooms and office/desk spaces at the end of today.

We are still working through the details of this announcement. We will continue to communicate with staff and families through our school messaging system as more information is available.

Expect an additional message later today.

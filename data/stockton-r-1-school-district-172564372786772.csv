Please complete the following survey to help us in developing plans for opening school in the Fall. At this time, we are working on a number of ways to provide education services to students in a safe manner. While we all hope school looks the same as it has in the past, we need to prepare for a number of scenarios. The information provided in this survey will help us formulate those plans.
When completing the survey, please do so with your student(s). We would like to have feedback about our strengths and weaknesses during virtual learning at the end of the school year. There is also a comment section at the bottom of the survey and we encourage you to provide information you feel is important. This information will help us make local decisions along with the guidance provided by the state and the local health department.
Please have the survey completed by Monday, July 6th. Thank you for your time as we prepare for next year.

The Invitational was comprised of 28 teams from the Greater Southwest of Missouri. They went 6-3 in pool play coming in third in their pool, and went into the consolation bracket against Strafford in a close game that came down to the wire in the 20th Round on the tossup question. They lost, but went on to win the next two matches against Strafford B and won a rematch against Richland to finish 8-4 on the day and a 7th place in the tournament. Michael Brown received a medal for tying 7th amongst point leaders averaging 52.4 points a game in pool play and his second medal so far by placing 5th in points per game at districts at Forsyth in early February.

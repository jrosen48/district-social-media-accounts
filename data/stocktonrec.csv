1) Beginning Monday, March 16, SRC Fitness Center hours will be limited from 430a-1pm and 3pm-9pm. We will be closed from 1-3pm to deep clean and sanitize the facility. The front door will be locked and your key card will not work during 'closed' times. We will return to 24hr access when able.
2) At this time, we will plan to remain open. It is up to YOU to practice safe 'social' distancing and cleaning practices when you are the Rec. Again, no snot wiping, hugging, butt slapping, etc. while you're here. Continue to clean diligently after your conclude with workout equipment..
3) At this time, PLEASE do not bring children while you work out. This will be strictly enforced.
4) Members 12-15 still must have an adult 18+ present in the facility. This has and will not change.

Now to start some challenges to help develop some good habits. (And to make things interesting) We invite you to do it along with us. You won't win a prize but you sure may feel better.

This week. 2 out of your 3 meals MUST include a serving of veggies and fruit. No, they can't be fries (or potatoes for that matter). So add some broccoli, green beans, salad, apples, bananas, blueberries, or strawberries to your meal. Maybe dragon fruit if you're adventurous. On the side is fine. Be better to replace something. Fresh or frozen is best. Not fried (duh).

It is with the heaviest of heart that we share the news of a Mighty Oak Tree that has fallen. Today our beloved Mr. Philip Izlar, Sr., better known as PC suffered a heart attack and has earned his heavenly wings.

Mr. PC was usually the first person to greet families as they would drop their children off at school. And he would always greet every person with a smile. And oh what a smile it was. Mr. PC found the good in every human being that he came across. He had a heart of gold. He would take care of others before taking care of himself. PC was a man of ineffable sweetness, a constant source of unabashed love and unashamed joy in a world that rarely appreciates such qualities. His was the beating heart of a community. But that heart has come to a stop.

Dear Stokes School Community,

We are working to maintain a safe, healthy environment within our school community. We reiterate daily with staff and scholars the importance of:

proper hand washing;
avoiding touching eyes, noses and mouths;
sneezing/coughing in elbows or tissue; and
staying at home when we are ill.
Additionally, our cleaning company follows CDC recommendations for cleaning and disinfecting our buildings.

Despite these steps, there may still be a Coronavirus outbreak in Washington, DC. We are preparing for the possibility that the DC government may close the schools.

As we plan, we are working to ensure that staff has remote access to work and that scholars have access to learning. We ask that you complete this brief survey about your children's access to technology at home. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdltRY-zX2NFZLOPjd4OUjIa85w0eIxsN3Xqkkk_jehcEGezw/viewform

We are working to maintain a safe, healthy environment within our school community. We reiterate daily with staff and scholars the importance of:

proper hand washing;
avoiding touching eyes, noses and mouths;
sneezing/coughing in elbows or tissue; and
staying at home when we are ill.
Additionally, our cleaning company follows CDC recommendations for cleaning and disinfecting our buildings.

Just pick the time that's best for you, park in the lot, and come to the main entrance with your masks on.

Just pick the time that's best for you, park in the lot, and come to the main entrance with your masks on.

If you have not already done so, please fill out this form for each of your children by this Friday, August 14, 2020. It is extremely important that all families respond so we can place students in the correct mode (hybrid or virtual). To be clear, all children who do not have a completed form will be placed in the hybrid model and in a cohort initially based on alphabet.

If you have not already done so, please fill out this form for each of your children by this Friday, August 14, 2020. It is extremely important that all families respond so we can place students in the correct mode (hybrid or virtual). To be clear, all children who do not have a completed form will be placed in the hybrid model and in a cohort initially based on alphabet.

Design a Rube-Goldberg Machine that uses multiple steps to complete a simple task. The basic concept that we’re exploring is that of a chain reaction. This open-ended challenge employs the engineering design process.

Get inspired, solve a problem, gather supplies, design and build your machine. Learn more here:

https://sites.google.com/stoughtonschools.org/spssummerlearning/home

Contest requirements:

1) Submit a picture of your Blueprint and a Video of your Rube Goldberg machine in action by July 26, 2020.
2) You may work in a group with others (family members encouraged to participate)
3) You must submit your entry into the category of the oldest student who participates (ex: if you have a 5th grade and 7th grader work together, the machine will be entered into the middle school category. Grades are determined by which grade you will be entering in the fall.
4) Winners will be announced on or before August 1, 2020.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3426604204017679&id=752923291385797,,0.0,"Check out the July SPS Rube Goldberg Challenge and Contest!

I hope everyone is doing well so far this summer! Just a brief email update on planning for the fall.

Attached, please find a document from the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education that is organized as an FAQ, and does a good job of covering a number of areas where people may have questions. The answers also give a clearer sense of the current thinking and guidelines from DESE that we are using in Stoughton to develop our plans for the fall. As the Commissioner describes, we are required to present three plans; full in-person learning with precautions, a hybrid model (both remote and in-person simultaneously), and a fully remote model. We have several teams working on those plans now. As mentioned in my last email, we'll be sending out a survey shortly to garner your feedback as well.

The best way to prevent EEE is to prevent attracting mosquitoes and mosquito bites. The recommendation is to wear long sleeved shirts, pants and socks when outdoors. Use a repellent with DEET, and remove all areas of standing water. If going to a town where EEE has been detected, avoid being outside from dusk until dawn whenever possible.

PARENTS AND GUARDIANS: Does it feel like Groundhog Day in your house yet? Each day a fresh chorus of “I’m bored!” and “I miss my friends!” and perhaps even “ I miss school” (gasp!). Do you find yourself losing track of what time it is, what day it is? Are your eyes getting bleary from binge-watching or lost in FB land? Let’s all hang out together in our collective misery to find support, comfort and laughter. Support groups have no obligations and no expectations except treating each other with tolerance and respect. Show up as you are - stay as long as you like. Drop in to our free, virtual support group for a safe space to connect with peers, moderated by a licensed mental health professional.

Let’s all hang out together in our collective misery to find support, comfort and laughter. Support groups have no obligations and no expectations except treating each other with tolerance and respect. Show up as you are - stay as long as you like. Drop in to our free, virtual support group for a safe space to connect with peers, moderated by a licensed mental health professional.

PARENTS AND GUARDIANS: Does it feel like Groundhog Day in your house yet? Each day a fresh chorus of “I’m bored!” and “I miss my friends!” and perhaps even “ I miss school” (gasp!). Do you find yourself losing track of what time it is, what day it is? Are your eyes getting bleary from binge-watching or lost in FB land? Let’s all hang out together in our collective misery to find support, comfort and laughter. Support groups have no obligations and no expectations except treating each other with tolerance and respect. Show up as you are - stay as long as you like. Drop in to our free, virtual support group for a safe space to connect with peers, moderated by a licensed mental health professional.

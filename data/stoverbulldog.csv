Jason will be the new Band Director, He received his BS degree in Instrumental Music Education (2008), his MS in Education Theory and Practice (2010), and his Specialist degree in Education Leadership (2013) all from Arkansas State University.

When asked why he was excited to be teaching at MCR-1, he said, ""For the last four years I have been keenly aware of the many great things happening at Stover thanks to my wife, Trisha Payne, a 3rd-grade teacher in the school. Clearly, MCR-1 is a great school with dedicated teachers, administrators, and faculty, and I am so excited to join that team and begin working towards the mission statement of striving for the best so we can rise above the rest.""

Welcome to the #BulldogNation Mr. Payne! We are excited to have you as part of our family!

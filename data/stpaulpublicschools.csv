We have had some calls about the ""fees"" notifications that are being sent out to families.

Here is the process for fees: When a child is assessed a fee by a teacher or coach it is entered into Infinite Campus. Then you as a parent/guardian receive an email/call with the notification.

In order to see what the fee is, you will need to log into Infinite Campus, on the left side of the portal there is a button called ""fees."" Click on that button and you will see a list of fees assessed to your child...for details, click on the fee on the right side and it will give a description. If you have questions please email Mr. Kleinsasser: don.kleinsasser@spwildcat.org

To pay fees, please take the payment to the High School Office (Wardyn) or the Superintendent's office (Townsend). They will take your payment and remove the fee from Infinite Campus; all fees need to be paid by the end of the school year.

Thank you

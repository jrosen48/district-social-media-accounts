We miss you ALL and have been working hard to prepare materials and put plans in place to support our students. As you are probably aware, the Springfield-Greene County Health Department, Greene County, Christian County, and the City of Springfield have issued a “stay at home order” for our area starting on Thursday, March 26 and lasting 30 days.

Early childhood and elementary packet pick-up and/or chromebooks can now be picked up from the elementary carline on Wednesday, March 25th from 4:00pm-8:00pm. Parents will stay in their car and staff will deliver the items to your car utilizing our pick-up and go system.

If you are unable to pick-up your student’s materials at this time and need to make arrangements for someone else to pick up, please email elementary@straffordschools.net.

We miss you ALL and have been working hard to prepare materials and put plans in place to support our students. As you are probably aware, the Springfield-Greene County Health Department, Greene County, Christian County, and the City of Springfield have issued a “stay at home order” for our area starting on Thursday, March 26 and lasting 30 days.

With this new information we are moving up our distribution times for material pick-up. Early childhood and elementary packet pick-up and/or chromebooks can now be picked up from the elementary carline on Wednesday, March 25th from 4:00pm-8:00pm. Parents will stay in their car and staff will deliver the items to your car utilizing our pick-up and go system.

If you are unable to pick-up your student’s materials at this time and need to make arrangements for someone else to pick up, please email elementary@straffordschools.net. We appreciate your flexibility and are thinking of you all daily!",2020-03-24 22:01:09,,

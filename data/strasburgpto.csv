First, this event is a replacement for the Mom/Son Basketball. We will not be having a basketball game at a later date. I think there was some confusion about that. We are changing it up a bit to see if we can get a higher percentage of boys to participate!

Second, we could REALLY use 2-3 volunteers (not moms who will be attending with their sons) to help us out with various things during the event. If you could help us out, please message us or email strasburgpto1@gmail.com.

Third, please RSVP if you haven't already. It'll help us know how much pizza to order!

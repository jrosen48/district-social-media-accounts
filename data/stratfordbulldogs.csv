Students at the Middle School were welcomed back to school with a day of fun activities such as minute to win it/games, relay races, sidewalk chalk, corn hole/ladderball/giant jenga, rock painting and a photo booth. Hotdogs were served by parent volunteers and donated by Double A. Following lunch, the students had a chance to release some energy while showing off their dance moves. We ended the day with an awesome motivational message from Nick Waters.

The SMS staff would like to thank all who made today possible and such a success!! We are certain that the relationships we are building will make for an awesome year!!

A huge congrats to Stratford High School student Harli Jo McKinney, who is one of only five in the nation to be named to the inaugural class of Youth Afterschool Ambassadors! In her new role, Harli will work to raise awareness about afterschool programs.

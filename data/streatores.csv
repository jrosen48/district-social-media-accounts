Dear Kimes Parents and Students,

I would like to introduce myself as your new principal at Kimes Elementary School. I am a wife, mother of three, and I have been an educator for 19 years. It's been my goal to lead and become a principal and am so fortunate to start that journey here at Kimes. Everyone I have talked with on the phone and met in person have welcomed me with open arms and I couldn't be happier.

I understand that the school year will look a little different this year, but that won't stop the entire staff from making it the best year yet. As a mom and educator I worry just as much as you do so know that I am a phone call or email away to ease those worries. Can't wait to see our Dragons, the office is pretty quiet right now! Stay tuned for some more staff and school updates.

Sincerely, Mrs. Ketcham",5.0,"Kimes Elementary School

THANK YOU to the administrators, teachers, staff, volunteers, students, and parents of Streator Elementary School District #44 for your strength, dedication, and perseverance throughout these abnormal times. You are truly building a better world, one student at a time. I feel so blessed to live in a community that works so hard and cares so much about it‚Äôs children‚Äôs education.

Today‚Äôs news saddens all of us, and while it‚Äôs not the outcome we may have wanted we must understand that these decisions are made with the best interests of the children, faculty, and staff in mind. Please continue to stay strong and persevere through these unprecedented times.

I‚Äôm definitely not any kind of expert. I will be encouraging my kids to talk, journal, use alternative methods to foster relationships and will try to be understanding that we‚Äôre all going through some stuff right now. I will help my kids understand that this will pass and we will carry on stronger for it as we always have and always will.

If you need a paper copy of assignments, they are in marked bins at Northlawn starting today. The bins will remain outside until Monday morning.

Bins are on the north side of the building (entrance across from McDonalds) in grade level order. The 5th grade bin is nearest the 5th grade entrance.

If your child has individualized assignments given in a special education class ( such as Speech, CARES, and Mrs. LeRette‚Äôs classroom), the packets will not be outside. Those packets will be delivered to students soon if you haven't already received them.

We will release information on Centennial and Kimes as we receive it. Please remember everything is also online.

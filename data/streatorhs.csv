üëãüèªIt was so nice to see so many of you today. A few reminders for tomorrow:

* Enter the same way you did this morning. There is no need to get here too early as we let you in the building between 7:40am and 8:05am. Once you are screened and temperature checked, you will be allowed to go straight to your locker or to your 5th hour class.

* Tomorrow begins with 5th hour at 8:10am. It is a shorter day as there are only three periods so dismissal and lunch pick up begin at 11:39am.

* If you want to grab a lunch after school, you may pick one up at the exit by the buses on the north side of the building or in the Commons. You will show your student id for this.

* You may exit ANY door of the building after school.

I hope all went well. Please ask any staff member if you have any questions. #SHSDawgs",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2718249314941877&id=389957164437782,,0.0,"üêæA message from Mrs. Mascal:

Anybody who initially rsvp'd for a graduation ticket, but then DID NOT graduate because of incompletes, failures, or not meeting all graduation requirements, they are the ""non-graduates"" that I was referring to and their tickets have been deactivated. Their tickets will not be accepted at the gate tonight and their tickets may not be transferred to anyone else because they have been deactivated and pulled from the system.

Hello Students!

I just wanted to remind all of you that tomorrow, Wednesday, May 20th, is the deadline for ALL work completion for the school year. The deadline is 3:00pm tomorrow to submit completed work.

Remember, your grades for the semester cannot be lower than what they were posted as for 3rd quarter, so that means you will either end up with that very grade, a higher grade, or an incomplete ( if you have failed to do enough work during the E-learning time, regardless of what you had 3rd quarter - if you were in this situation, you did receive a certified letter). If you are unsure of your status on incompletes, you need to reach out to your individual teachers as each department has set their own thresholds for what is considered ""complete"".

Good luck!

At Streator High School, we will continue with E-learning and will have more details and announcements for you early next week as we are able to iron out some details regarding the end of the school year.

That being said, please keep in mind that all work is continuing to be graded. Grades cannot be lowered by work done during remote/E-learning, however, please be advised that doing NO work or doing insignificant amounts of work for your classes may result in receiving INCOMPLETES for the 4th quarter or the semester. An ""incomplete"" in a class on your transcript means that you DO NOT receive credit for that particular class (it would be similar to receiving an F as a grade).

If you have questions regarding your current status in each class, please reach out to your teachers who are available on weekdays from 9am-2pm.

Monday: Random Acts of Kindness Day.
Tuesday: Spirit Wear Day/ Wear BLUE to show RESPECT

Senior Jazz Band 1:
Jacob Green, alto sax

Senior Jazz Band 2:
Bryce Bryner, tenor sax

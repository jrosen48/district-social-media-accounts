1. There is NO SCHOOL tomorrow, April 10, and Monday, April 13. You do NOT need to check in with teachers these days. This also means that there is no school lunch pick-up, and no bus stop lunch deliveries those two days.
2. The second packet pick-up for distance learning will be on Tuesday, April 14. Drive through the pick-up line between 8-2 and we will bring your work out to you - just like last time! Do not return your old packets when coming through.
3. It is very important that you do your work and check in with your teacher everyday so you are not marked absent.
4. We hope all of our families are staying safe and well. We miss you!",2020-04-09 17:07:53,,

P.A.T.H.S. (Parents and Teachers Helping Students) supports our students with funds for activities that might not otherwise be possible (field trips, assemblies, etc.).
In an effort to raise funds for this year’s activities, an online fundraiser has been set up.

Please consider going to this website and donating. We also hope you share this with family and friends. Any amount helps.

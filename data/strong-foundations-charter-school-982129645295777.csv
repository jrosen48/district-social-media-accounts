Strong Foundations is going to have a Scholastic Summer Read-A-Palooza Virtual Book Fair. It will run from now until September 4th. All book orders over $25 will receive F*R*E*E shipping.

The school will earn 25% of the book sales in scholastic dollars. The scholastic dollars we earn buy supplies for the benefit of the entire school, like wiggle chairs and classroom books and activities for after care. There are also great activity kits and workbooks offered by scholastic, which make great gifts. Please share the link to the book fair with family, friends and neighbors.

The spring book fair sold over $900 in books and earned the school over $200 in scholastic dollars. The goal for the summer would be to sell 250 books or more!

Thank you so much for your support, for your dedication at home, and for your kind encouragement. For several weeks I have been talking with staff and families about how everyone is doing while I tried to decide whether to just keep working through April vacation or whether to have us take the scheduled break that week.

We will be taking our April vacation as expected. My hope is that families and staff can use that time to relax and come back refreshed for the last six weeks of school.

Schools across the state seem evenly split regarding whether they will take the scheduled break. This approach seemed like the best approach for us.

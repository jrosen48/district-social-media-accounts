1) Begin the 2020-21 school year operating remotely due to the elevated health risk posed to students, staff and family members.
2) Discontinue extracurriculars such as sports, band, theater, choir and other activities during the remote learning period.

Mrs. Frey has been teaching in our District for four years. She started at Muraski Elementary in her first year and has been at Chapman for the past three years. Mrs. Frey earned her undergraduate degree from Slippery Rock University and her graduate degree from Youngstown State University.

“I love the curiosity and enthusiasm the students bring to school each day. As first graders they get so excited when they learn something new and I love being a part of their gaining confidence and independence,” says Mrs. Frey.

She adds, “ I love working with all of the staff at Chapman. It is a wonderful place to work. Everyone always works to do what's best for our students and is there to support, encourage, and celebrate others accomplishments. Chapman is really a family.”

Parents/Guardians,

Strother Public School will be requiring masks to be worn by students in grades 6-12 when changing classes. Once they are inside the classroom they will be able to either continue wearing them or take them off. The addition of this protocol will allow us in conjunction with our other protocols to better assist the health department in contact tracing when determining who will be sent to quarantine in the event of a positive case. We are also hopeful this will keep us from having to shut the whole school down in the event of a positive case, due to our ability to contact trace. So we ask that you please send a mask/face covering to school with your students in grades 6-12. I know people will want to debate this, but please don’t on this page. We are trying to put everything we possibly can in place to keep our children safe and our school open. Again we thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Favorite Memory: I am going to miss the people at Strother the most. I made some great lifelong friends, and reconnected with old ones. I've been to many schools, large and small and have never been surrounded by so many amazing personalities. I am extremely grateful for not only the peers I encountered, but also the teachers and staff.
Congratulations to Taylor Hall!

These last few weeks have made me realize upon graduating what I will miss the most is the daily routine of coming to school at Strother. I started at Strother when I was 4 years old. So, coming down the road to Strother almost daily really seems like it has always been a huge part of my life. Now, just like that, it never will be again. Feels weird!

This week's teacher spotlight is on Mr. Douthit. This is his 2nd year to teach at Strother and he graduated from East Central University. He teaches Math and of course, that's his favorite subject. He also coaches baseball and football. He enjoys going to the movies and watching sporting events, baseball and football. His favorite color is burnt orange, can you guess why? That's right, he's a Texas fan! His favorite book is Ready Player One and his favorite food is chicken. Fun fact about Mr. Douthit, if he wasn't a teacher he would be a film director or writer. A funny side note, he submitted a picture of celebrity Ryan Gosling as his picture for his page on meet the teacher night. He almost got away with it too, remarkable similarity. Mr. Douthit is married to Sara Douthit.

This week's teacher spotlight is on Mr. Douthit. This is his 2nd year to teach at Strother and he graduated from East Central University. He teaches Math and of course, that's his favorite subject. He also coaches baseball and football. He enjoys going to the movies and watching sporting events, baseball and football. His favorite color is burnt orange, can you guess why? That's right, he's a Texas fan! His favorite book is Ready Player One and his favorite food is chicken. Fun fact about Mr. Douthit, if he wasn't a teacher he would be a film director or writer. A funny side note, he submitted a picture of celebrity Ryan Gosling as his picture for his page on meet the teacher night. He almost got away with it too, remarkable similarity. Mr. Douthit is married to Sara Douthit.

Our hope is that you will get to know more about our amazing staff. This week’s spotlight is on Mrs. Kornelsen.
Mrs. Kornelsen is a new teacher at Strother. She will be teaching Middle School English this year. She graduated from Oklahoma Baptist University. Some of her favorite things are Mexican food and the color pink. Her favorite books are The Hunger Games Series and of course her favorite subject is English. She enjoys hunting and softball. She is an excellent softball player, I know because she played in a benefit softball tournament this summer. She is married to Ray Kornelsen and they have two little girls Ava, age 7, and Megan, age 3. She enjoys spending time with her family. Please help us welcome Mrs. Kornelsen to our Strother family.",2018-08-20 15:13:09,,

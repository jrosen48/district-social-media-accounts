I am highly encouraged by his report of the instructional practice occurring there. He was particularly excited about the teachers who invited him into their classrooms to witness the implementation of creative and innovative lessons utilizing technology. He has witnessed teachers using the station rotation model (AKA Hybrid Methodology), groupings based on formative assessment, differentiated lessons, student-centered instruction, and project-based instruction. Today he witnessed students using green screen technology, video, and video editing software to create skits based on dialogue they created. The skits will be shared between groups in Google Classroom, viewed like a flipped lesson, and then assessed. We look forward to all staff utilizing these processes and thank the early adapters for implementing district goals and doing what is best for our students!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=168545220545717&id=116443219089251,,0.0,"I was talking with Mr. Larthey, Principal at the Stroudsburg Junior High School regarding instructional practice.

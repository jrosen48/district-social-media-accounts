This gate is the first of its kind in the State of Louisiana installed in a residential neighborhood. With the installation of this gate, the gap in the levee system will now be closed during a flood event. This system requires no man power to operate, and is automatically activated by flood waters which cause the gate to rise and protect the area where the gate is installed. As the flood waters recede, the gate recedes as well. No man power is required to operate the system. When not activated, the gate lies underground, flush with the roadway, and residents simply drive over it. It is touted as a “passive, automatic flood barrier system that provides permanent and virtually invisible flood protection without human intervention or power.”

Chief Browning traveled to Calcasieu Parish today to participate in a press conference with Entergy and Entergy Louisiana where he reiterated the warnings about generator safety:

❌DON’T place a generator inside of ANY structure
❌DON’T place a generator near open doors and/windows
❌DON’T refuel a generator when hot

We’ve got 2,500 signs sharing the same message going up in more than a dozen parishes with more than 1,000 power outages remaining.

He also visited with city and parish leaders about how the SFM can help them start rebuilding.

A front will become stationary across the area for the holiday weekend. Occasional showers and thunderstorms are expected to develop each day, especially during the afternoon hours. A few storms could be strong with gusty winds, but the main threat will be the potential for very heavy rainfall in locations that receive multiple thunderstorms. While much of the area can expect 1-3 inches of rain by Monday morning, a few spots could see much higher totals.

The graduation ceremonies will be held on the same dates. Final decisions on times will be made by Monday afternoon.

School administrators are expanding their previous plans to best meet the needs of their individual school community and will provide additional details as soon as they are available on each high school’s website.

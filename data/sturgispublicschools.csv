The State of Michigan's School Reopening plan is set to be unveiled on Tuesday, June 30th and we would like to get started forging our plan on Wednesday, July 1st. Our hope is to form a team of parents and staff with diverse perspectives so that we have a well-thought out, safe, and comprehensive plan. Additionally, we will invite a staff member from the health department to sit on the team.

The team will meet virtually (via Google Meet) on Wednesday, July 1st from 10:00 a.m. until 12:00 p.m.; Thursday, July 2nd from 10:00 a.m. until 12:00 p.m.; and we will then schedule further meetings as needed.

If you are interested in serving on this team, please complete the Google Form linked below by Friday, June 26th. We will then select a well-rounded team from those that show interest.

County schools have been asked to pass on this information on behalf of Rebecca Burns, Health Officer at our Local Health Department. There is community transmission of COVID-19 in St. Joseph County and our number of positive individuals is currently rising rapidly. On Friday, June 12th there were 163 total known cases in St. Joseph county and we ended the week with 197. This is a total increase of 34 new cases or a 21% increase in just one week. Folks, we are losing to this virus right now. There are several things that you can do to help:

Wear a mask when you are out in public and insist that your family members do as well.

Do not congregate in groups.

When you are inside with other people for any period of time, wear a mask and if others are not wearing a mask, consider leaving.

There is also misinformation about testing. If you are in close contact to a person with a known case of COVID-19, you must go into quarantine for 14 days.

JOIN OUR ""MUSIC WALK OF FAME"". 2021 will be the 100 year anniversary for the SHS band. To commemorate the band and orchestra programs that the Sturgis Community Schools are fortunate to have, we will be building a music ""Walk of Fame"" at the high school, outside the band room doors. The funds raised will be used to purchase a directors stand on the practice field for the marching band. All supporters, friends, alumni, current students, future students, businesses, families or anyone that would like to support our music programs will have an opportunity to etch their names, place a meaningful inscription, or dedicate a brick in honor or memory of a loved one. When you sponsor a brick, you are creating a lasting legacy of your support. Bricks will be installed later this summer as an Eagle Scout Project by one of our students who is in both, band and orchestra. Go online at https://donationbricks.com/sturgisbandorchestra.

Ms. Arseneau explains, ""This project was inspired by Andy Goldsworthy's work, an artist known for his site-specific installations, utilizing natural materials and highlighting the passage of time.

(STURGIS) ‚Äì A familiar face will be taking over as the Sturgis Middle School Principal.

Monday night, the Sturgis Board of Education unanimously approved the hiring of Jimmy Lamb as the new Sturgis Middle School Principal. Sturgis Superintendent Dr. Art Ebert presented Lamb as the potential new SMS Principal and shared what steps were taken to get to this point. Ebert says the process consisted of application and resume screening. There was an interview conducted Monday with three candidates and 12 stakeholders.

Following the approval of the motion, Lamb made some comments to the Board of Education and the online audience.
Lamb says he is looking forward to this new chapter in his life, working with the great staff at the Middle School and the sixth through eighth grade students.

Lamb most recently was the Assistant Principal at Sturgis High School.

Lamb takes over for Christopher Gerbers, who took a position in Indiana.

So I‚Äôm Chris Gonzalez, I was President of National Honor Society and Captain of the Varsity soccer team. I enjoyed being at school a lot and seeing all my friends. Covid-19 really messed up my senior year because I couldn‚Äôt do my first year of baseball, be in the talent show again, attend my senior prom, attend senior night, or even graduation. After high school, I plan to attend the University of Michigan-Dearborn and then transfer to University of Michigan-Ann Arbor and study nursing.",0.0,"Sturgis Public Schools added a new photo.

My name is Melissa Soto-Ruiz, I‚Äôm an Early middle College student. Covid-19 has affected me in so many ways and it‚Äôs hard to realize that my senior year was taken away and that I didn‚Äôt get to finish it the way we all planned and this years seniors didn‚Äôt even get the last‚Äôs that we were supposed to get and enjoy with our class. I think the hard part of it all is that we didn‚Äôt even get to say goodbye to all the people we grew up with but I wish them all the best and I know we will all amazing things in the future. After everything goes back to normal I plan on attending glen oaks for my 13th year in the Early Middle College program and get my associates in general studies and then after I plan to transfer to a university for a degree in computer science.",0.0,"Sturgis Public Schools added a new photo.

In addition to our previous Chromebook distribution opportunities for families, we will be doing one last effort to provide a device to those families that need a device. We want to stress that this is for families that have extreme need for a device for their child to participate in the continuity of learning expectations.

There are two available times for you to pickup your device this week. Click below to fill out the form and this will be your spot to sign up. If you do not show during your scheduled time, there will be no other time for you to get the device.

Due to the health and safety and to conitnue to ensure that we practice social distancing - this will be our final distribution effort.

“Pop! The Invention of Bubblegum” by Meghan McArthy is the interesting story of how the gum ‘Double Bubble’ was invented. An accountant named Walter Diemer became curious about a laboratory next to his office. The company was trying to make a new kind of chewing gum. Walter started to experiment and ultimately created the very first bubblegum. Even though he hit some roadblocks along the way, he persevered and ultimately accomplished his goal of making children happy.

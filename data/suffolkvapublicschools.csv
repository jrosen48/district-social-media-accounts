Reach out to your child‚Äôs teacher.

Online education or learning at home requires family support. To support your child, set up a direct line of communication with your child‚Äôs teachers. Use email, text, phone calls, or maybe even video conferencing to connect.

Try not to worry that you‚Äôre interrupting. If you‚Äôre not sure how to do an assignment, don‚Äôt just guess‚Äîreach out to confirm. You may even want to set up a day and time each week to connect with the teacher. You can use this time to talk about challenges your child is facing, review upcoming instruction, and understand expectations. Being proactive is essential if your child is struggling in school.

Get plenty of exercise.

Exercise helps us think better. When we move and groove, our problem-solving, memory, and attention improve. Physical activity is a natural way to reduce stress and prevent anxiety. Experts say that when we move and get our heart rate up, it has a positive impact on how we think.

Look for family-friendly workouts you can do at home. Identify a time and place in your home for physical activity. The best time to exercise might be right before tackling schoolwork. It‚Äôs also good to take exercise breaks throughout the day.

Create a learning space for your child.

Does your child already have a special place to do homework? It‚Äôs important to set up a quiet, clutter-free area if your child is learning full-time from home.

For example, you can convert the kitchen table into a learning station. Turn off the TV and remove all cups, salt and pepper, and other kitchen items when your child is doing schoolwork. When it‚Äôs time to eat, put away the school supplies and use it again as a kitchen table.

Why is it important to clear away the clutter for learning time? Reducing clutter helps kids focus.

Set a routine.

Little kids need more structure, so make sure to let them know what to expect. You can create a visual schedule they can follow. Older kids can use a calendar, planner, chalkboard, or digital organizer to keep track of what's happening each day.

Have them follow a routine as if they're going to school (getting dressed, brushing teeth, etc.) instead of lying in bed in their pajamas, which could lead to less learning.

Have you ever wanted to ask an astronaut what space smells like? Or what they do with their free time in space? Or what stars look like in space?

Students in Debra Shapiro‚Äôs Career Investigations class had a once in a lifetime experience of getting to ask a real-life astronaut their space questions.

Retired astronaut Clayton Anderson, also known as Astro Clay, recently participated in a Zoom meeting with Mrs. Shapiro‚Äôs students. Students had prepared questions to ask which Astro Clay sometimes turned back on the students to engage their critical thinking skills.

He also shared with students how he applied to be an astronaut 15 times before becoming one, encouraging them to never give up on their dreams. #BuildingtheBestSPS",,,0.0,"DISTANCE LEARNING IN ACTION...

Forest Glen Middle School students were introduced to a ‚Äùnewer‚Äù game during PE class during the month of December. Tchoukball is a non-aggressive sport to include everyone in the game. Student learned the rules, history and observed 45 seconds of the Tchoukball World Cup 2011. ü§æüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Students quickly picked up the game with MUCH excitement! They used previous skills and knowledge from football, volleyball and even math to help them succeed. They are begging to play Tchoukball again and again! #spsk12proud #BuildingtheBestSPS",2019-12-18 11:00:38,,

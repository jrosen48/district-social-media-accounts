Yesterday we had the opportunity share with high school students at Sugar Creek Charter School. Through the LeadCity program led by Dr. Temeka Brantley, they are learning how to effectively develop and deliver a business pitch connected to social need. We came in to share about Hope Vibes Inc, incorporating creativity into their pitch, identifying their niche and brand consistency. Then we had a chance to hear the students share the pitches they’ve been working on! Dr. T is doing such an amazing job!! 💕💕

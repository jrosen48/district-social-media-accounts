With this new information and with an abundance of caution, the Sweetwater Union High School District, along with school district superintendents from across the State of California, are taking a safety-first approach and immediate action to extend the school facility closures through the end of the school year. However, in the future, if the stay-at-home order is lifted and the COVID-19 situation improves, we will certainly do our best to reopen school facilities.

To be clear, the 2019-20 school year is not over, it has just transitioned from classroom instruction into distance learning. As we have been sharing, the specific details on distance learning will be coming in the next few days.

How about some GOOD school news? Some of our high schools in Chula Vista, National City, and San Diego ranked in the top 13% out of 20,000 schools nationally. That's something the Sweetwater Union High School District can hang their hat on.

The ranked Sweetwater Schools include Eastlake (#167 in CA and #973 in the U.S.), Olympian (#212 in CA and #1158 in the U.S.), Sweetwater (#308 in CA and #1,623 in the U.S.), Hilltop (#396 in CA and #2,036 in the U.S.), San Ysidro (#420 in CA and #2,172 in the U.S.), Castle Park (#441 in CA and #2,270 in the U.S.), and Montgomery (#453 in CA and #2,356 in the U.S.).

We're looking forward to second semester! Take a look back at our most recent event, the 2017 South Bay Pumpkin Smash ""Game of Throws”!

SUHSD students teamed up to win honor and prizes by hurtling leftover Halloween pumpkins with both distance and accuracy using homemade Medieval-style technology.

This friendly festival of flying fruit provides young people with the opportunity to learn #science, #technology, #engineering, #art, and #mathematics (#STEAM) by participating in a fun hands-on project that will challenge their imaginations and develop their skills in engineering, design, and construction.

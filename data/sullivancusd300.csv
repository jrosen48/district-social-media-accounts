Brycen Wildman was a fantastic student all year, but I am really proud of his work during e-learning.

Although we weren’t in the classroom for the fourth quarter, he didn’t let that stop him from staying connected. Brycen logged onto both of my Zoom sessions each week, and continued to stay on top of his homework. He watched the instructional videos posted and would email me for any clarification or help that was needed.

Congratulations to our SHS wrestling team! The Turks finished in 11th place overall, second among Region 1 teams behind 10th place Mt. Baker. The Turks had 4 wrestlers medal, including 2nd place finishes by Aidan Fleming and Tyler Deason, a 3rd place finish by Luke Weaver, and an 8th place finish by Kameron Weaver. Skyler Talik and Donald Dennis didn’t medal, but did win two matches on Friday to advance to Saturday’s competition. CJ Vas also recorded a win at State on Friday. Hunter Jones and Cooper Johnsen competed hard but fell short of individual victories. Kiana Kendall also opened up the Championship Round Saturday night with another outstanding performance of the National Anthem.

The Sultan School District is involved in the search process for the next principal of Sultan High School. In August, 2018, the district hired Sarita Whitmire-Skeith as Interim Principal of Sultan High School. The decision was made at that time to re-post the position this spring to attract the best candidates possible.

We would like input from students, staff, parents/guardians, and community members on the characteristics desired in the next leader of Sultan High School. Please help us by completing the “Sultan High School Principal Selection Survey”.

Your responses are anonymous. Survey results will be used by administration when screening, interviewing and ultimately when choosing the next principal of Sultan High School. Interviews are tentatively scheduled for the week of February 25, 2019. The survey will close on Friday, February 15, 2019.

New Assistant Principal at Sultan High School!

Sultan School District facilitated an in-depth interview process for four potential Sultan High School Assistant Principal candidates last night. The candidates participated in an intensive interview and a teaching and learning activity. These exchanges provided us with extensive information to make a clear decision.

We would like to re-introduce Ryan Malone to you as our new Assistant Principal at Sultan High School! Ryan taught English at Sultan High School for four years before getting his administrative credentials and taking an administrative position with Spring Academy. We are excited to welcome Ryan back to SHS and our Administrative team. He looks forward to meeting our SHS Turks, Parents, and Community Members in the upcoming weeks.

We would like to thank Walmart Vision Center in Monroe for sending two managers to help with our student vision screening this year! They spent three full days at our schools: one day at Sultan Middle School, one day at Gold Bar Elementary, and a third day at Sultan Elementary.

This year Washington State schools are mandated to test near (reading) vision as well as distance vision for all kindergartners, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th and 7th graders. The nurses also test hearing for these grades.

Just before the end of 1st period today our fire alarm activated. As a safety precaution students and staff were evacuated to the stadium as the fire department responded. It was determined the alarm was activated by the science lab. All protocols and procedures were being followed, we just have old sensors that trip easily. At no time were students in danger. As always, our Turks did a great job throughout the evacuation and return to class.

She has always been very involved in her son‚Äôs education and very supportive of Summit Academy. Gwnell has two children with special needs, including one who is nonverbal.

During the current health crisis, she still contacts the school to see if any families are in need of having meals delivered; and will personally deliver them.

Gwnell checks in with Principal Ralph Grant and Sarah Pavis, the IEP Coordinator, each week to see if there are extra meals.

She delivers the surplus meals to needy families in her neighborhood and throughout the community.

She always goes out of her way to make sure the food is delivered to those that are in need of meals.

We are so thankful to have a parent that has been so supportive of others at this unprecedented time.

THANK YOU, Gwnell! You truly are an inspiration!

She has always been very involved in her son‚Äôs education and very supportive of Summit Academy. Gwnell has two children with special needs, including one who is nonverbal.

During the current health crisis, she still contacts the school to see if any families are in need of having meals delivered; and will personally deliver them.

Gwnell checks in with Principal Ralph Grant and Sarah Pavis, the IEP Coordinator, each week to see if there are extra meals.

She delivers the surplus meals to needy families in her neighborhood and throughout the community.

She always goes out of her way to make sure the food is delivered to those that are in need of meals.

We are so thankful to have a parent that has been so supportive of others at this unprecedented time.

THANK YOU, Gwnell! You truly are an inspiration!

I like this little drawing challenge so I thought I‚Äôd share it with you. If your child decides to use it, it will give them something to focus on for a little bit of the next 25 days!

Your child might be a budding artist and take great care on each of the drawing tasks below. It might provide them with sense of calm and be relaxing for them. Alternatively, your child might be more of a doodler and each task may not take them 5 minutes. They might just draw for fun and use it to have a break from other learning they have been given to do.

Either way, drawing has many benefits for children:
- It helps to Develop Fine Motor Skills (small, intricate, controlled movements made by the hands and wrists).

- It helps improve their concentration.

- It improves hand-eye coordination.

- It can be a form of release and a way for them to express themselves. Children can‚Äôt always describe their feelings and emotions in words, but find it easier to in their drawings.

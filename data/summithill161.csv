After reading ""A Long Walk to Water"" by Linda Sue Park, Ms. Farrahi's and Mrs. Boudreau's students quickly wanted to find a way to help the cause of bringing fresh water to those in South Sudan. After months of fundraising and raising $2,300 from our community, a water well has been built in the Village of Panyuon in Aguok-North County, Gorgrial State. The village chief Majok Wol Majok sends his sincere gratitude to our students for making a difference in the life of all of his people. To see the village, you can use the GPS coordinates of 8.707364 and 28.363945.

Thank you to our community for participating in our fundraiser and for showing our students that Anything is Possible. It is the Walker Way!",2020-05-05 11:12:55,,

March 14 (3/14)

Whenever students are asked what pi is, inevitably they reply ""3.14"". While this is the approximation of pi, few students can give its exact meaning or definition. Pi is actually the ratio of the circumference (distance around the circle) by the diameter (distance across the circle). Since all circles are proportionately the same exact shape, the value of pi will be exactly the same for every perfect circle. Our pi day activity gave students an opportunity to explore this idea. Students in Mrs. Nance's accelerated math class collaborated by measuring the circumferences and diameters of various circular objects and dividing them. While measurement is never exact, the values commuted representing pi should approximately average 3.14. Our computations actually averaged 3.2, which is pretty close. Through this activity students got hands on experience computing pi and gained an understanding of its true meaning.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1712861968855569&id=686452534829856,,0.0,"Happy Pi Day!!!

When winter settles in and the holidays are around the corner, what’s a second grader at Indian Trail School to do but get ready to celebrate? And they are doing just that!
We’ve got snowmen and handmade ornaments, holiday head wear and crafts galore! We’ve made t-shirts with reindeer, we’ve done scavenger hunts, and there’s still so much more left to do!

Like math, grammar, reading, spelling, social studies and science. Well, we’ve got to get the fun in too, right? Happy Holidays!",2019-12-17 16:57:28,,

Within all the fourth-grade classrooms, students worked on creating a multiple intelligences wheel with Mr. Schneider, Technology Teacher in Integrated Technology. There were many steps involved including narrowing down the top two intelligences after taking an online questionnaire. From there, students focused on designing their very own personalized multiple intelligence wheel in Power point. Students had to insert text boxes, change word art and shape styles, insert online pictures, take a picture of themselves using the green screen, and finally writing brief paragraphs about their top two intelligence's! What an innovative project!

First grade students at Indian Trail School are preparing for Thanksgiving! We discussed the importance of family and friendships. Students learned the history of Thanksgiving. Creativity was displayed in an activity in which students designed their own turkeys along with a poem to display in the hall. In technology class, first graders had the opportunity to use their computers and Wixie to write about what they are thankful for, draw a picture that related to their sentences, and narrate their work via the audio function. We shared our projects together and discussed the importance of being thankful. First graders wrote paragraphs about their families and illustrated their writing. During parent-teacher conferences, feel free to stop by the first grade hallway where our giant turkey will be displayed with a feather designed by each and every first grader explaining what they are especially thankful for this time of year.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1597672357041198&id=686452534829856,,0.0,"INDIAN TRAIL SCHOOL

Indirect characterization is the process of describing a character through that character’s speech, thoughts, actions, and looks. An author will use this type of characterization to guide the reader in making their own conclusions about a character. Sixth grade uses the acronym STEAL to teach this concept. The students in Mrs. Becker’s class uses the novel Flush to demonstrate mastery of this learning target. Students selected a character from the novel, and then found evidence support a character trait demonstrating each part of STEAL. Indirect characterization strengthens writing by showing, not telling. This learning target helped the students draw their own conclusions as well as having to support their thinking with evidence.

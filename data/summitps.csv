We cannot let luck or circumstances dictate our children’s futures.

When I first visited Summit Public Schools in 2014, I was struck by how the school helped prepare students for future success through a tailored learning experience that's deeply rooted in the science of how people learn and develop. Summit Learning was created by parents and teachers, including Diane Tavenner, who wanted better options for children to develop both academic and life skills.

In her new book, Prepared: What Kids Need for a Fulfilled Life, Diane shares lessons she’s learned over the years as a mother, teacher and while leading Summit Learning.

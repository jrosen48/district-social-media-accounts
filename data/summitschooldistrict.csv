Harry is a player who displays outstanding stick skills along with a very good lacrosse IQ.

Zach Silberstein - Tennis

From Boys Tennis Coach Bill O'Regan:
Zach enjoyed playing JV tennis as a Hilltopper from the time he was a freshman. It did not matter what was at stake or who he was playing. The simple act of being out there, competing and having fun, was enough. Although Zach never had an opportunity to play as a starter, his role on the team was anchored by a quiet confidence that reminded everyone about the pure enjoyment of just playing the game. Zach always gave everyone his best game and never complained about a lack of playing time, understanding full well that nothing can be taken for granted. The four years Zach spent as a Hilltopper nurtured the beginning of a life-long love of tennis. We expect Zach will lead a fulfilling life where his best game of tennis awaits him on the horizon. #gohilltoppers",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2762948620591987&id=1441671379386391,,0.0,"SENIOR SPOTLIGHT - Summit student athletes

Eray Sabuncu - Boys Volleyball (Capt)

From Boys Volleyball Coach John Ross:
Eray has been a dedicated member of the boy's volleyball program for four years and was a captain for this season. He is a selfless player who only wants what is best for his team and teammates. He works hard to represent the team, the school and the Summit community in the best light possible. Eray works hard to get better every day and take his game to the next level. Eray was ready to start all six positions and contribute in all aspects of the game; offense, defense, and serving. His leadership both on and off the court will be impossible to replace. #gohilltoppers",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2732399476980235&id=1441671379386391,,0.0,"SENIOR SPOTLIGHT - Summit student athletes

David Staub - Tennis

From Boys Tennis Coach Vinnie Turturiello:
David is a two year varsity starter at the doubles position. He has won many close matches with his ability to keep the ball in play and allow his opponent to make the error. David brought another style of play to the game by having the ability to take shots deep into the court down the line and hit winners in the alley of the opposing court. Last year he won most of his matches at second doubles and would have held the position this year. This year I am sure he would have been a contender in the Union County and the NJSIAA state tournaments. #gohilltoppers",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2720709068149276&id=1441671379386391,,0.0,"SENIOR SPOTLIGHT - Summit students athletes

""The mission of the New Jersey Scholars Program is to reach out to able and enthusiastic students who come from a broad cross-section of the state’s population. The program creates an intense, interdisciplinary intellectual experience that will change students’ lives by teaching them to think in a new way — relating disciplines instead of dividing them. Scholars participate in lectures and small-group seminars where they actively engage with the disciplines. They also have extensive reading assignments, and pursue research at world class libraries and museums. They write essays and work closely with a faculty member to produce a 10-15 page interdisciplinary research paper. They are also stretched as they hone their creative talents in art, music, writing, drama and public speaking by contributing to an Arts Festival that is thematically related to the Program topic.""",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2681384418748408&id=1441671379386391,,0.0,"Congratulations to SHS Junior Sara Yoo for being chosen as a 2020 New Jersey Scholar!

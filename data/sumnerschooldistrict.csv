April 1 is the day the Census Bureau uses to determine who is counted and where. Have you completed your questionnaire yet?

Here's why the census is important for schools and students:

The 2020 Census count decides how much federal funding our schools will receive over the next 10 years, and how much money our state will get for our parks, neighborhood improvements, public health, transportation, and many other programs and services our students and families depend on.

School- and child-specific programs include:
- Special education, Head Start, after-school programs, and classroom technology
- Food assistance, including free and reduced-price school meals
- Maternal and child health programs

As we prepare for the 2020-2021 school year, this is a friendly reminder that if you have a student entering Kindergarten or 7th grade this fall please make sure their immunizations are up to date. This is a Tennesseee state requirement and every year our local Health Department and pediatrician's offices experience a heavy influx of appointment requests for August. Any student entering Sumner County Schools for the first time must have up to date immunizations AND a check up within the last year to register.

Congratulations to Rucker Stewart Middle School student, Chyna Senter! She finished in second place in Ron Clark Academy’s Amazing Shake National competition.

From the Ron Clark Academy Page:
The Amazing Shake is a competition that places an emphasis on teaching students manners, discipline, respect, and professional conduct. Prior to the competition, students learn the nuances of professional human interaction as they are taught skills such as how to give a proper handshake, how to “work a room,” how to give a successful interview, and how to remain composed under pressure. The goal is to prepare our students so that they are able to present themselves exceptionally well for opportunities today as well as those that will come in the future.

The Amazing Shake National Competition is open to any student in the 5th-8th grade during the 2020-2021 school year.

Parents, you will have access to your child's school May 11- May 14. Your child's school will communicate specific times, so we can work around social distancing protocols. You can expect to hear from them in the near future. Schools will do it differently, based on their size. This is also an excellent time to turn in everything that you need to - library books, textbooks, technology, etc.

Some schools will have their yearbooks published and printed and available for pick-up. Others are still being printed. If your child's yearbook is not ready, the school will arrange a pick-up time.

Please be patient with us as we maneuver through this unprecedented time. There are several kinks to work out and safety is our number one priority.

Beginning the week of April 7, 2020, we will be changing to a two day a week pick up schedule for our Grab and Go lunch program. We are making this change based on feedback from parents in order to make pickup more convenient and to avoid the need for a daily pickup.

On each pickup day you will be given meals for each day until the next pick up day. Seven days worth of meals total will be provided over the two pickup days.

The new pickup days will be Tuesdays and Fridays, starting the week of April 7, 2020.

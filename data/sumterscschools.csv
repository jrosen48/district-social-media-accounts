Here is a snapshot of our teachers trying to make those important early connections with our students. It is so much harder to teach to a computer screen but they are doing all they can to make it work. These are some incredibly dedicated and loving staff members working hard to educate, feed, and keep students safe in this unusual time. You will see our dedicated cafeteria, and office staff as well as one of our IT guys all working to keep this train moving. Thank You also to CVS who came out to the school today to give flu shots to the staff that needed them it was very much appreciated.

Just remember if the teachers are by themselves in their classroom teaching they do not have to wear a mask... but they are very good about masking up where necessary.

One of their big projects in recent years has become the Hailey Bordeaux Memorial Scholarship, set up to honor a Sumter native who tragically lost her life before fulfilling her dream to become a teacher.

Sumter School District administration surprised three district teacher of the year finalists on Friday afternoon with personal messages on their recognition, and two were delivered right to their doorstep. With schools being closed since mid-March because of the pandemic, Superintendent Penelope Martin-Knox and her staff had to get creative. They came up with the idea of the personal home visits outside in the front yard. The district plans to name its district teacher of the year in August, just before the beginning of the new school year.

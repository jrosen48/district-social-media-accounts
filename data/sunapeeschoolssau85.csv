We are so excited to welcome to the Sunapee Central Elementary Kindergarten program. In the past, we held our screening process in the spring but due to COVID-19, we moved it to the end of the summer to Thursday, August 20, 2020 starting at 9:00 am at SCES. When you and your child come, we have a number of activities for both of you to participate so everyone is ready to start school on Monday, August 31st. It will take approximately 40 minutes to complete this informal screening. Below you will find a link to a Sign-Up Genius page so you can sign up for a time. Unfortunately, due to timing, we are unable to offer another date or time. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at either 763-5675 or at whuston@sunapeeschools.org.

The Sunapee School District is holding its fourth public community forum on Wednesday,
December 11, 2019 at 6pm at the Sunapee Middle High School Gymnasium. This will be the
final community forum before the January budget hearing, February deliberative session
and March voting.

At the October 30th forum Banwell Architects discussed two different proposals to address
the one-site option: one with an auditorium and one without. The December 11th forum will
present the modified building plan for a PreK-12 one-site facility as well as the plan for the
district sports fields. A revised cost estimation will also be given.

Because of your strong interest in the Sunapee community, we would like to personally
invite you to the December 11th forum to see the plans which are being prepared for the
March, 2020 warrant.

There will be childcare provided by the Sunapee National Honor Society students from

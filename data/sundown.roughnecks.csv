I am very excited to announce the following young men have qualified to compete at the Regional Powerlifting meet that will be here in Sundown next Saturday, March 14th. These kids had to finish in the top 12 in their respective weight classes to qualify. Our region is massive and has over 80 schools who compete in powerlifting, so this is quite a feat. This is by far the largest group I have had advance since I have been here, so I am extremely proud of this group of kids. Lots of hard work and effort has gone into this group as well as all of our kids who competed this season. I am looking forward to seeing us compete next week and hopefully you can catch them as well. The regional qualifiers are as follows:

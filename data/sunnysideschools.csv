Each day, whether at school or in our professional lives, we interact with people who have different opinions, values, life experiences, and cultures than us. Before we can get along with each other or work toward common goals, we must know, understand, and respect each other.

Did you know ""See Something, Say Something,"" is our district‚Äôs motto when it comes to student safety?

The hard part when asking students to report dangerous or suspicious activities of others, is their worry of being a tattle-tale or nark, reporting something that might turn out to be nothing, or the fear of getting someone in trouble.

To help with this, the SSD Tipline, available on all school websites and the District homepage, offers an anonymous option through phone, text, and email. School and District administers receive instant notification of a tip and are able to respond and ask additional questions through the system, while maintaining the tipsters anonymity.

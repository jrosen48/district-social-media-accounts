Sunray NHS Member Spotlight: Senior Yaritza Villareal

If you look closely, you might see one of Yari's projects around town. Yari has been spreading joy and brightness in the community by painting Kindness Rocks. She has placed 55 rocks in the area so far. She has also been grocery shopping for her neighbors and checking on them to see how she can help.

Yari stated her favorite part of school was getting to interact with her classmates and teachers. ""We created so many memories in the classrooms, from Connor sitting in a trash can and getting stuck and Michael making homemade lemonade in Mrs. Zerby's room.""

Her plans for the future are to attend Amarillo College and transfer to West Texas A&M to major in animal science. ""After majoring in animal science, I will then decide if I want to further my education to become a veterinarian.""

There are several items that were found lying in the hallways, in lockers without names, the gym, etc. Items that do not have names will be placed on the picnic tables spread apart for you to claim. As I bagged up lockers and found items that belonged to the school (library books, dictionaries, athletic clothes, etc.), then I kept them and labeled them with your student's name.

If you have a personal band instrument, we will have those outside too.

If you have items at home that belong to the school, please keep those items somewhere safe. We will make a plan on how we will have you return those items (athletic clothes, library books, classroom books, etc.) at a later date, but please do not throw them away.

Cayman has been a busy lady! During the past month, she has provided meals for the elderly, cleaned the FFA barn, made 172 face masks and 284 face mask holders for a hospital in Amarillo, and ""egged"" houses for Easter. She donated over 85 hours of her time serving the community.

She stated her favorite part about community service is seeing the impact she can have on others. ""I have been very blessed to be able to help others, so it is very rewarding to see it do good for my community.""

Cayman is also involved in playing softball and showing pigs. ""These keep me very busy throughout the year, and they are two of the things I am very passionate about.""

A little late posting.. but Sunray FFA went to Fort Elliot last week for the Top O’ Texas District Banquet.

Morgan Overstreet retired his position of Vice President on the Top O’ Texas district officer team..
But we are thrilled to announce that we have another member on the officer team again this year!
Ella Strickland ran for district office and received the Sentinel position!! Congratulations to Ella Strickland and the rest of the 2020 Top O’ Texas district officer team!

As everyone knows, the past few months have presented drastic changes for all our teachers. From the start of virtual learning, Phillipsburg Primary School Art Teacher, Natalie Steckel, has challenged herself to take this time to learn new technology.

She learned flip grid and screencastify, became better with using the Google suite and most recently created a video lesson for NJTV. Her lesson on landscapes will air on NJTV at 9 am on Monday, June 1st. While the lesson is geared toward 3rd grade students, it is easily adaptable for a broad age range.

As we continue to discuss the end of the school year, please know that we are giving special consideration to those parts of May and June that are extremely important to students, specifically our seniors.

For now, I want to share some great news about our graduating seniors who have arrived at the end of their journey as the Top 10 graduates of the Class of 2020. The list of this year’s Top 10 is below, but I would like to also call special attention to PHS Valedictorian, Michael Gomez, and Salutatorian, Mark Gural. As tradition dictates, they will have a special place of honor in our commencement ceremony (in whatever form that may be).

This cabaret was directed by broadway star Lauren ""Coco"" Cohn, who is best known for her role as Rosie in Mamma Mia on broadway.

“A Class Act” is an award winning acting studio based in NY, providing a variety of education from the working professionals currently in the industry. They host off broadway main stage shows, cabarets, intensives, and one-day workshops. These are just a few of the many things they provide, but they offer quite an extensive list of expertise. The cabaret took place at the Triad theatre, an off broadway theater located in New York's upper west side.

I just wanted to let everyone know that Service Electric has made a commitment to join the ""Keep America Connected"" pledge to:

• Not terminate service to any residential or small business due to the inability to pay their bill.
• Waive late fees that residential or s mall business customers incur because of their economic circumstance related to the coronavirus pandemic.

He envisioned that all children would receive equal and equitable access to a quality education and here, in the Phillipsburg School District, we are committed to inspiring and preparing all our students for success.

No doubt that one of the highlights of the year is when 500 wooden toys get delivered by our HS students to all our preK-K students at ECLC! This year, under the outstanding leadership of Mr. Bill Noble & Mr. Tom Nagy, teachers at PHS, and many other staff members, students and community members- 500 Crayon Trains were built.

Around 9am this morning, our HS students delivered them to each room for each child at ECLC! The joy on their faces (both HS and ECLC students) was priceless! Great job to Mr. Noble, Mr. Nagy and everyone who assisted to make this special tradition happen in 2019. Also, thank you to the art department at PHS for designing a coloring book for the students!

A special thank you to the nonprofit ""Brothers Before Others"" organization for their AMAZING generosity yesterday at ECLC! The volunteers transformed the ECLC school gym into a winter wonderland, including fake snow, inflatable Christmas characters, Santa hats and candy for the children and even music. Each one of our students left with a personalized gift.

Brothers Before Others consists of more than 4,000 active and retired law enforcement officers. It was founded in 2014 to provide flower arrangements for the families of every police officer killed in the line of duty. To date the organization has raised more than $275,000 worth of flower arrangements.

ECLC was chosen as a beneficiary community since the organization plans on moving its headquarters into Phillipsburg in 2020.

Over 300 family members participated in Mouse House Voting, creating an owl craft, creating #OneStatelinerStory testimonials, photo opportunities, live animals, reflection, refreshments, and raffles!

2 families took home a LIVE Poppy complete with habitat, bedding, and food. The most popular raffle item was the set of POPPY books that complete the series. High and Low tech surveys were available to families to share their thoughts on this initiative.

We ended the night with a Dimwood Forest Dirt Cup and Pond Punch. I think Poppy would be pleased. #OneStatelinerStory

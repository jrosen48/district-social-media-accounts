Wednesday, April 29th between 3-6pm
We hope you are all safe and healthy.
With the relaxation of some of the Covid-19 restrictions we would like to collect all of the rental ski equipment we rented out in November.
Please bring your rented skis, boots and poles to the high school this coming Wednesday, April 29th between 3-6pm.
We will be checking that equipment in at the downstairs door on the east side of the building.
To keep social distancing you can drop the equipment outside the door and we’ll bring it inside.
We will also have a $10 coupon for you if you return the equipment on Wednesday, you can use the $10 off towards next years rental.

Today I hosted a call with Montana press to provide an update on Montana's four positive COVID-19 cases and share additional response efforts.

I’m pleased to report that all four patients are at home and recovering.

The state lab is performing testing 7 days a week.

I amended Montana's state of emergency to align the effective timeframe with the federal state of emergency announced by the President. This means that our state’s emergency response will be in effect as long as necessary to allow us to continue to mobilize state resources.

I can’t stress enough the importance of the role of the public in helping us mitigate the impact of this virus. The small sacrifices we make now – missing out on a cancelled event, avoiding crowds and enjoying time with small groups of healthy family and friends, and staying home if you feel sick – means keeping more folks healthy in the long run.",0.0,"Governor Steve Bullock

Recently we have had a lot of no shows (kids signing up but not showing up for the bus) this makes planning for the number of buses difficult.
If your child signed and will not be going PLEASE let us know via email, Facebook or our new Remind app so we can plan for the right number of buses.

If you or your child has not signed up for our new Remind app, now's a good time. We’ll be testing it out on the mountain tomorrow.

A seven year old comes home from school to learn that Mom is in the hospital Dad says, “she’s done something stupid.” The kid begins to create a list for Mom. A list of everything that’s brilliant about the world. Everything worth living for. As time passes and the list grows, what began as a naïve attempt to make Mom happy becomes an epic chronicle of life’s little wonders. A tribute to the irrepressible resilience inside all of us and the capacity to find delight in the everyday, Every Brilliant Thing is a funny, clever, and surprisingly uplifting play about the lengths we go to for those we love.",0.0,"Polson Police Department

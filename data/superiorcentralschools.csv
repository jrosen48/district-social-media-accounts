A couple of things from the Superior Central Athletic Department.

1. We are very hopeful the U.P. remains in Stage 5 and that the rest of the state will eventually join us so that we can have statewide athletics in the fall. In preparation to get our student athletes back on the fields, trails, courts, and tracks we have developed, using guidance from the MHSAA, a ""Return to Athletics"" document. We are confident that we can get our athletes working out again while keeping them safe. You can find the document on our website at on the ""Athletics"" page.

2. Mrs. Kristine Nutting Bray would really like a Junior Varsity Volleyball Coach to join her program. If you are interested or know somebody who is, the job posting can be found on the ""District Information - Employment Opportunities"" page.

I hope this post finds you in good health.
We've created a survey to help us better understand the technological needs of the families in our district. We are not sure where the state is going to go with online learning; if anywhere. There have not been any decisions made by the legislature. We at least want to have data on the technological infrastructure of our district. With that said, would you please take a couple of minutes to complete the survey linked below? We know that not everybody is on Facebook or has internet accessibility. I have been working with our app publisher on being able to send a call to all of the parents in our district and hope to get that call out this afternoon.

Good Afternoon Online Learners,

I hope this email finds you healthy and in good spirits. Today I had a meeting with the Superintendents in Marquette and Alger counties. One of the topics of discussion was students who are currently in online courses. Late last week there was some confusion about online learning. The issue arose when the idea of switching to online school for everybody was brought up at the state level. Initially, the conversation was that there can be no online learning. A clarification later came out that the state only meant schools couldn't switch entirely over to online schools. Individual students in individual classes could, and should continue. So, carry on with your online work. It will help keep you busy while you are locked in your house. If you have any questions feel free to shoot me an email. I miss seeing your smiling faces everyday.

After a webinar yesterday and much discussion again today, we have been told to cease all student activities including coursework and enrichment activities until this State closure comes to an end. They have directed that we cease activities because we cannot guarantee that all students have access to appropriate learning devices or access to the internet or that we can successfully support the needs of all learners. Michigan Department of Education will be providing additional communication regarding resources that can be shared with parents for additional practice in a home setting. Once we receive more information, we will get it to you. Until then, treat the next 3 weeks like we are on a really long Spring Break.

Here is a quote from Lily Harris from Munising High School. Lily is interning at Munising Mather Elementary School:

"" An internship means a chance to learn, a chance to explore a career, a chance to meet new people, and a chance to prove yourself. Internships are important because they allow teens the chance to prove themselves in a career setting that someday they may choose to be in. Internships give teens an opportunity to learn out of a school setting, in a hands-on way. My internship experience has made me understand all that goes into teaching, and how it impacts the students. It has also made me more patient with other people. Every student should have the opportunity of an internship because it will change the way they perceive the career they choose to intern with and because it is an amazing opportunity to learn and thrive.""",0.0,"So glad that our students are able to take advantage of the internship program through MARESA!

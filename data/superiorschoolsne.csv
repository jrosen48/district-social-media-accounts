I'm married to my husband Jamey who farms and we have 3 daughters, Haylee, Myka, and Tenley. We enjoy attending K-State football games as well as doing things around the farm.

I love teaching at SPS because we are truly like a family and it's great to see us all work together.‚Äù",2020-09-04 07:00:05,,

‚ÄùCindy Adamson, reading specialist para for Kindergarten, 1st and 2nd grades.

Career experience: dental assistant, retired nurse, and now 2nd year at SPS.

I am married and have one daughter, Jodie, and three grandchildren. Evan and Sage belong to Jodie and Henry is my step-grandchild.

My hobbies include collecting and dressing up teddy bears, and writing poetry, and spoiling my three cats.

Fun facts: I grew up on a farm. We had 2,000 chickens most of the time as my Dad was a main supplier of eggs for many businesses in Superior and other towns. We also had about 40 cats!

I love teaching at SPS because it is a rewarding job and the staff has always been very nice from day one when I started. It is exciting to watch the kids learn.‚Äù",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2700958920166530&id=1545310725731361,,0.0,"Check out another #FridayStaffFeature! #NebraskaWildcatNation

Social distancing means putting distance between yourself and others. Staying home and staying away from groups of people will slow the spread of the virus and save lives.

Everyone can help reduce the spread of #COVID19 and other respiratory infections by doing the following:

‚û°Ô∏è Avoid close contact with sick people and stay home if you are sick.
‚û°Ô∏è Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based sanitizer.
‚û°Ô∏è Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
‚û°Ô∏è Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze then throw the tissue in the trash.
‚û°Ô∏è Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

The purpose of the study is to identify good educational practices, determine areas for improvement, and to chart new directions for education. Surveys were recently emailed to the classes of 2014, 2015, and 2016; fourteen surveys were returned. Questions were asked regarding educational and employment activities since graduation, future goals, and recommendations for improvement.

The time and effort former SHS graduates expended completing this survey is notably appreciated. Suggestions will be shared with staff, administration, and the Board of Education, as SPS continues to provide a quality education for all students.

Please feel free to stop by the Guidance Office to view the results of the survey.

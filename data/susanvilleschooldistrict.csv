Thank you Sears for donating a washer and dryer to Diamond View School. With the help from CCC donating backpacks, we will soon be able to provide backpacks with a mesh laundry bag to students. Students who need a clean set of clothes will be able to bring a school backpack with some laundry they need done. While they are in class it will be washed and they can pick it up before they head home. We have some work to be done to get this installed, but hopefully it will be up and running soon.

If you would like to be a part of helping us set this up, we could use high efficiency laundry pods/detergent, fabric softener, and small mesh laundry bags. Please drop off any donations in our front office.(850 Richmond Rd.) Thank you!!

Students who need a clean set of clothes will be able to bring a school backpack with some laundry they need done. While they are in class it will be washed and they can pick it up before they head home. We have some work to be done to get this installed, but hopefully it will be up and running soon.

If you would like to be a part of helping us set this up, we could use high efficiency laundry pods/detergent, fabric softener, and small mesh laundry bags. Please drop off any donations in our front office.(850 Richmond Rd.) Thank you!!

Susanville School District Board Members: Jenna Aguilera, Camille Buehler and Pam Woodworth joined Superintendent, Jason Waddell at today’s ribbon cutting ceremony at the brand new community pool. The Honey Lake Valley Recreation Authority Board Members presented Susanville School District with a plaque, thanking the District for donating the property to build the new pool. Board Members and administration from the District worked with the City of Susanville and the County Board of Supervisors for several years to help bring this project to fruition. As part of the process, the old Roosevelt Pool Complex was demolished and abated so that the beautiful new community pool could be built.

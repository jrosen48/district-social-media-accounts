He talks about:

1) What behaviors can parents from elementary school children expect?
2) What is the impact of COVID?
3) What are some solutions?

He reassures parents that regression is typical in these atypical times, and while it might not be welcome, it is not uncommon. He talks about the Three A’s of Anxiety and understanding the F’s of anxiety.

He also discusses the fact that kids are resilient; talks about what parents should do if they suspect that behaviors are not a normal reaction to an abnormal situation or are indications of more significant problems; talks about screen time, - amount, impact, type, and supervision.

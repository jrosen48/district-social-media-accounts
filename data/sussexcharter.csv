Through these efforts, we can eliminate the conditions that cause and perpetuate sexual and domestic violence in our community. Today, we focused on respect and what constitutes a healthy relationship.

Over the last couple of weeks the 7th grade STEM classes have created scale models of the Banaue Rice Terraces located in the Philippines. Each group was required to do research on the benefits and reasons behind the construction and use of the rice terraces. The group were given constraints and only able to utilize specific materials. Each material used was worth a certain amount of points. The students main goal was to create a multi-level free standing tower to successfully transport 10 wooden beads from the top level to the bottom with the force of 1 liter of water. After each group presented their research and presentations, as a class we tested each groupâ€™s structure. They then found the difference of the points they earned for the amount of beads traveled down each layer of their structure and the amount of points in materials used to create their structures. #STEMClass #Science #Technology #Engineering #Math #STEMFun",,,0.0,"Thirst for Knowledge Thursday!

Through a number of presentations and panel discussions, trustees learned about recent developments in the charter school sector, changes in school law and regulation, the impact of the charter school movement on social justice, and strategies around communications, advocacy, and media. Perhaps most importantly, trustees had the opportunity to meet informally with their peers from other schools to share practices and compare notes.

Project Ideas: Gardening
Students will be selecting an environmental issue and generating an Eco Project goal they can carry out for their project. One environmental issue that students may want to address is gardening.

Some Eco Project goals to consider:

Plant trees along a highway or busy roadway to prevent noise pollution
Plant wall shrubs and climbing plants by the walls of your school to help insulate the building
Install rainwater barrels at your school to collect water for trees and plants
Work with the school or another local organization to convert from gasoline-powered tools to push mowers, hand clippers and rakes to reduce air pollution
Start a local produce coop to reduce carbon emissions and support local farms and gardens.

Once completed, I transferred to Centenary University- Graduated Summa Cum Laude with my B.A. in Criminal Justice. When I took the LSAT in September of 2017, I passed with flying colors.

As many of you already know, Oregon Governor Kate Brown announced today that schools will continue to be closed for the remainder of the year. With this in mind, the Oregon Department of Education has outlined a clear pathway for Seniors to graduate on time. Seniors and their parents will be contacted by Sutherlin High School staff before April 30th with the details of this pathway. All other students will be expected to participate in “Distance Learning for All” that begins on April 13th. Thank you for your patience and understanding.

Thanks to great supporters, we have all wood material donated and ready to go! WHAT WE NEED is mattresses and new bedding to go to these families!

HOW CAN YOU HELP?

We are looking for help with our service project this week! Please share!

The Sutherlin FFA Chapter is partnering with our CTE-Woods program and Sleep in Heavenly Peace (SHP) to build bunk beds for families and kids in need this Friday! Our goal is to BUILD 100 BEDS in one day, and we know our members are up to the challenge!

Thanks to great supporters, we have all wood material donated and ready to go! WHAT WE NEED is mattresses and new bedding to go to these families!

HOW CAN YOU HELP?
1 - Pledge a dollar for every bed we build, up to 100 beds.
2 - Sponsor a mattress ($55) for someone
3 - Donate twin-sized, new bedding items (blankets/sheets/pillows - no used bedding please).

Please help us hustle this week and make a difference for so many people in our community! You can contact the school or message this Facebook page. Help us make a difference! And check back Friday to see how it went!",2019-04-15 22:44:01,,

Back to justanotherTuesday...

The day ended with 12+ students heading to collect acorns for partnershop project to propagate oak trees for oak savannah restoration with the Friends of Ford's Pond! A great diversity of trees were collected that will hopefully result in hundreds of future saplings - special thanks to Allison and Craig for the help. This is just the start to this multi-year project!

Before then, students in Intro to Ag toured and tried on different CDEs as part of the Great CDE Days, Vet Science modeled macromolecules in the study of how ruminants work, Ag Business prepped and practice some tough interview questions, and work continued on the second greenhouse!

Wildcats, Teachers, Parents, Grandparents, Guardians....we did it!! We had a great first day of distance learning! It took all of us working together, but we made it happen. Thank you for your support, patience, and willingness to troubleshoot! There were a few hiccups and some glitches, like there always will be with technology, but there were far more successes yesterday than there were challenges. We know this is a challenging situation for everyone, but we appreciate all the effort everyone is putting into making sure that our Wildcats have the best opportunities they can have, given the circumstances.

Reasons to love Sutter Football:
A 66 yard touchdown by Colton Dillabo with a two point conversion last October against Gridley High School. We are hopeful that our Sutter Football team will get to play together soon, however, crowds are uncertain... worry not, SUHS Live Streaming has you covered!!!

CDE has just released an online resource to help local educational agencies (LEAs) address questions related to distance learning pursuant to California Education Code 43500–43511 (resulting from Senate Bill 98). These Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) can be found on the CDE Distance Learning FAQs web page at https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/dl/distlearningfaqs.asp, and more FAQs will follow in the coming days.

Later this week, CDE will also release the Learning Continuity Plan Template, Instructions, and Guidance in addition to an FAQ for LEAs. The template is intended to support the planning that districts are already doing as they prepare to begin another academic year and hold to the promises of the Local Control Funding Formula. The Learning Continuity Plan replaces the LCAP for the 2020-21 school year.

As a reminder, CDE will host two upcoming webinars for LEAs to better understand Learning Continuity and Attendance Plans. Details can be found here: https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/tuesdaysat2.asp.",0.0,"California Department of Education

Coming soon to an online FFA fair sale near you!!! Tyler's project for fair this year. The kids unfortunately cant show but they're still having the auction. A LOT of kids didn't finish, they just gave up and stopped. Tyler brought his home and put in the work to get it done. Please consider hopping on and placing a bid on this awesome homemade piece of work once we have the link.

*He MAY be able to paint a red or blue line upon request for our first responders but we dont want to mess up the quality of the finish*

Hoping for a local buyer for delivery ♡

2020 has been quite the year. Bailey Leverett was super excited to start her little herd and lost ALL her sheep to a dog attack. She regrouped and with the help of Stacey McWilliams Dutra, Pat Estudillo McWilliams and Denise Mayo she was able to purchase Asher. With the in person fair and auction going virtual, she will be showing and selling via the online platform and auction. If you would like to purchase lamb, he is gorgeous and was raised with the utmost of care. Information of the sale can be found in the link. Add on's are also available to support the kids. These are just a flat fee donation to show your support. Any amount is appreciated. Thank you all for taking the time to check it all out ♥️ A link with more info is in the comments.",0.0,"Kim Rudd Leverett

Her Fourth Grade students used their engineering skills to design and build a structure to hold a raw egg. The structure was not only for holding the egg, but for keeping the egg from cracking when it was dropped from a height above their heads.

Mrs. Pennington’s first graders conducted an experiment to observe raisins “dancing” in soda! They began by making a prediction about what they thought might happen when they added raisins to a container of ginger ale. Students were excited to see the reaction caused by the bubbles in the soda. To extend the activity, students added raisins to a container of water and saw that no reaction happened. Afterward, students illustrated their observations in their STEM journal.

""Last week, we incorporated social/emotional learning (SEL) with STEM concepts. We read, ""Have You Filled a Bucket Today?,"" by Carol McCloud. Then we discussed how to be “bucket fillers” and not “bucket dippers.” This means we make others feel better by doing and saying kind things. Next, we designed and created our own buckets, and tested their strength by filling them with pennies. The only materials students could use were scissors, construction paper, a chenille stem (pipe cleaner), and up to 12 inches of tape.

2021 Seniors please see the message below From Mrs. Griffith:

I have been given permission to start having meetings with students and parents. The meetings will be held in the cafeteria so that we can do social distancing. I also ask that you bring your own pen or pencil. I will be cleaning tables and chairs in between meetings as well as any other precautions needed. Please call me at 386-647-4003 to schedule an appointment. Suwannee High asks that you don't just show up to talk to me. I will need time to prepare for any meetings.

RIVEROAK Technical College is a recipient of Coronavirus Aid, Relief, & Economic Security (CARES) Act funding.

Under the CARES Act, all schools that participate in the federal student aid programs have been allocated funds to make emergency grants to students who meet the requirements to receive federal student financial aid for expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to Coronavirus (COVID-19).

This week we have been issuing relief checks to all our adult postsecondary students in an effort to supply financial assistance during this difficult time.

On Wednesday, February 26th, Suwannee High School and Branford High School attended the Northwest Florida Construction Career Day in Jacksonville, Florida.

In total, close to 300 students represented Suwannee County at the Career Day. While at the Career Day, students visited multiple hands on learning labs where they were able to complete projects or partake in activities to learn about the day-to-day life in the many careers available.

Students learned that many of these jobs pay well above minimum wage, provide benefits, pensions, and required a High School diploma and a willingness to learn and work. Students had the opportunity to speak with possible employers and take home information about apprentice and internship programs in Northeast Florida, some even as close as Lake City.

Captain Chip Leathlean, of Suwannee County Fire & Rescue, went out of his way for our sweet Jakhyriana. When the Captain noticed she was not engaged in the fire safety presentation like the other children, he took it upon himself to help her really see by touching things. He kindly pulled her aside to let her hold and touch part of the hose. Her face lit up! It made her day and I am sure it made his, too.

So thankful for our First Responders and their loyalty and commitment to our community.

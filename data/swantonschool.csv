i have had so much fun sharing time with you and your students, in person when i could, electronically when we had to. it has been such an honor to be invited into your classroom to participate in learning together. i loved the laughter, the epiphanies, the ability to be ok with making mistakes and using it to make discoveries, and the enthusiasm to share it with each other.

happy last days, happy summer, happy every days.

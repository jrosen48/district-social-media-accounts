For the Minecrafter workout, if you do not have a heavy box, substitute another stable and durable household item to lift.
No box to jump on to? Do tuck jumps (knees to chest) instead. A chair or couch will do just fine for tricep dips and leg-pull ins.

Afterwards, stretch out with the Care Package routine. Do not forget to do both sides.

All Swan Valley School District families and community members are encouraged to safely participate in this event by staying home and turning on their porch and flood lights at this time.

Try out a tabata or two. A tabata is a high, intense muscle or lung burner, or both. It is 4 minutes long and definitely a time saver! The protocol is 8 rounds of 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off (rest). You can choose one exercise to perform the entire tabata or alternate with another movement every round. There are even tabata songs you can find on Youtube. Linked is a sample tabata song.

Here is a sample tabata workout:
-Tabata Air Squats
-1 Minute Rest
-Tabata Pushups
*Your score is the total number of air squats and push-ups. Record, and try and improve next time.

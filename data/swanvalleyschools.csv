All participants will be muted and placed in the waiting room until the meeting begins. District administration will review a powerpoint highlighting the plan and there will be an opportunity for Q & A at the end.

There was also a dance off, corn hole game and photo booth for treats, but the most popular was the Pie in the Face to Mr. McRae!

With that being said, we can only allow 100 people outdoors on our campus at a time so we had to divide our graduating class into two groups.

Happy last day of school for the 19-20 school year. Although the end of this year was not what we had envisioned when we first began it, I am super thankful for the hard work of all of the teachers, parents, and students. You all did such a great job during the learning from home. Although we don’t know exactly how the Fall will look yet, I am certain that together we will do great things! I’m looking forward to seeing you all again soon! Sincerely, Mrs. DuRussel

I’m so glad that rather was a home visit from your teacher or you getting to stop by the school on Wednesday that we were able to see so many of our students and families before the summer began. ￼

This Friday night, April 17th, Swan Valley High School and Athletic Department will honor its seniors and senior athletes by turning the Football Field lights on at 8:20 p.m. The lights will be turned on at 20:20 military time for 20 minutes and 20 seconds to represent the Class of 2020. All Swan Valley School District families and community members are encouraged to safely participate in this event by staying home and turning on their porch and flood lights at this time. Every attempt will be made to livestream the Football Field on the Swan Valley Athletics Facebook page for those families living out of district.

Although this does not do justice in recognizing our Viking Seniors for their years of blood, sweat, and tears, this is the least we can do to honor a brave and amazing class.

Adlar and Sam were participants in Rotary Youth Leadership Camp last summer. They also spend time tutoring younger students, lead charitable causes at school and are involved with Business Professionals of America among several other worthy causes. Adlar is headed to SVSU and Sam has narrowed down his options to Wayne State and Central Michigan. Both plan to continue their education in STEM.

Activities/Sports/Clubs: Student Council
Favorite Memory from school: My favorite memory from school would probably be taking Composition my junior year. There was never a dull moment, and there are quite a few inside jokes between a few classmates and I that were made during this class.
Hobbies: Drawing, training/riding horses, hunting, and spending time with my family, friends, and animals.
Who is your hero and why? My hero is my uncle, Mark Vilinski. I have been through a lot in my life, and he has been there and supported me through it all. He is always trying to make the best out of bad situations by making jokes or just being his crazy self. I don’t know where I would be if I didn’t have him in my life.
Best part about attending Swanville Schools: You get to know everyone really well.

We hope by now all students in grades 3 through 12 have checked in with either their homeroom teacher in grades 3 through 6 or your second hour teacher in grades 7 through 12. Just a reminder you will need to do that daily when school is in session. If you are having any issues, please contact your teacher or the main office and we will do our best to help.

Some updates on events. Prom has been postponed on the April 18th date. We are looking at May 16th as a possible new date, depending on what happens with orders from the government. Please know if this would also be postponed that we will still try and make prom happen. The senior class trip is a wait and see, as is the Lions Senior Honor Banquet. As of now, graduation is still slated for May 22nd at 8 p.m.

Easter break is still on for Thursday April 9th, Friday April 10th and Monday April 13th. We will not provide the following services on those days: meal delivery, daycare, classroom instruction.",2020-03-30 13:01:43,,

NEW!! Beginning January 2020, Swanville Schools will be starting the “Art Student of the Month” award. Art SOM will give recognition to a student (grades 7 -12) that shows excellence and distinction in the visual arts.

Zavanna Holmquist -

Zavanna has been chosen as January’s Art Student of the Month. Zavanna is a very talented artist, and she is especially skilled at drawing. Along with using the proper drawing methods, Zavanna puts a lot of emotion and meaning into her drawings! This is what makes her work so compelling and interesting to look at. It can sometimes be difficult to express your emotions through art, but Zavanna does it in a way that speaks to a lot of people.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1536404873182123&id=380662162089739,,0.0,"Art Student of the Month -

You may notice that many of the questions are the same as those that appeared in the first parent survey distributed on April 3, 2020. This is intentional in that it will help us to monitor perception over time. Please take a few minutes to help guide our District in providing the best virtual learning experience that we can for your child. We still have many weeks of new learning ahead of us and your input is critically important to us. Please complete the survey by Saturday, May 16, 2020.

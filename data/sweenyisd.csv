All of the events will be livestreamed at TeachersCan.org/events, unless indicated otherwise there. And get some sleep , because your schedule of events starts at 7:30 each morning, including tomorrow. You don't have to be a teacher to participate, but we are doing this specifically to pay tribute to our awesome Texas teachers.

The Sweeny High School Marching Band had their final competitive performance of the season this afternoon in Ganado, Texas. All the students performed well, and the band received an Excellent rating.

We are so thankful to our students for all the hard work, time, and dedication they gave this season’s Superspy show. We’d also like to thank all of the amazing band parents, administration, community members, clinicians, and more than anything our junior high Band Aids for all of their support for these outstanding kids. This band could not exist without everyone’s help.

- Districts are to provide learning supports and supplemental services to students and families during the closure period.

- School districts may call on public school educators and employees to deliver limited learning and support services. Each district will pay all their regular employees during the closure.

- The Oregon Department of Education, Oregon Health Authority, and Department of Human Services are directed to support public schools in the continuity of mental health services.

The governor made the announcement this evening with a new executive order.

Along with extending the school closure for six weeks, the order issued further guidance to the state’s public schools including:

- Districts are to provide learning supports and supplemental services to students and families during the closure period.

- School districts may call on public school educators and employees to deliver limited learning and support services. Each district will pay all their regular employees during the closure.

- The Oregon Department of Education, Oregon Health Authority, and Department of Human Services are directed to support public schools in the continuity of mental health services.

The Sweet Home School District is working on a plan to comply with the Governor's executive order.

Thank you for your cooperation and understanding during this challenging time. As always, we will continue to keep you as updated as possible with information.",2020-03-17 20:31:52,,

Oregon Public Broadcasting featured Sweet Home in a recent story about school districts with improved graduation rates. It’s worth noting that Sweet Home had the highest overall graduation rate among the districts mentioned. Portland’s graduation rate was at 80.5 percent, Bethel was at 75.5 percent, Crook County was at 72.9 percent, Estacada was at 66.1 percent and Coquille was at 61.1 percent.

Oregon’s statewide average was 80 percent, an all-time high since the state tightened how it tracks the graduation rate more than a decade ago.

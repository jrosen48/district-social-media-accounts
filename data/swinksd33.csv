After May 7th students who have finished their work or are content with their final grade at that point will be finished. Teachers will continue to work with students for the remaining two weeks to complete or improve upon unfinished work. We will have a check out schedule similar to the pick up schedule used in March. Checking out will take more time so the schedule will be spread over several days. We will begin checking out students who have completed their work starting on the 11th of May. A more detailed check out schedule and procedure will be posted soon.

Since the last update was posted Governor Polis has issued an executive order that extends the break until April 17. This executive order does not affect our basic plan. We will plan to roll out remote learning for all students starting on March 30th. Remote learning will be in effect until at least April 17th. Continue to check the web page and school Facebook for updates.

During the next week we will be investigating the interest and feasibility of continuing school meal service. This would most likely be a take out option. Look for more information soon.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an Order to prevent evictions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Order says that landlords cannot evict certain tenants affected by COVID-19, or they could face penalties. The Order applies only to those tenants that have not paid rent. Tenants that are evicted for engaging in criminal activity can still be evicted.

It is important for you to know that the moratorium only prevents you from being evicted for non-payment of your rent.

You still owe rent. Your landlord can still charge and collect late fees, penalties, or interest. You can also still be evicted for other violations of your lease that do not involve payment of rent.

For more information on evictions, San Antonians can call 210-207-5910 or visit https://covid19.sanantonio.gov/Assistance/Residents/Housing-Evictions

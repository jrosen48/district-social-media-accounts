The State is asking us for success stories from our classrooms and I thought my past student Hannah Silverthorn would be a good example. I asked her to relate her experiences. What she wrote is beautifully compelling. I’ll provide more later, but here are a couple of quotes. “I realized I had no education and would be stuck in a toxic work environment.” “It’s hard when you realize as a young adult that life’s just started and you’re already failing.” “When you first meet Rich he is kind of intimidating but I wouldn’t have chosen anyone else to be my instructor.” “My career is set and I’m ready to take sail.” This is exactly why I get such joy from my job.

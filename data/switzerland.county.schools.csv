RE: Washington DC Trip - Cancellation Notice
DATE: April 7th, 2020

Dear Parents,

Due to the concern of the “coronavirus” and the situation that our community, along with the country, finds itself in, the 8th Grade Washington DC Trip scheduled in June has been cancelled.

The school has been in frequent contact with the Ohio Valley Travel Agency (OV Travel). Over the past few weeks we have attempted to negotiate our release from our commitments connected to the trip. At this time, the trip is cancelled. The contract states we will receive a full refund minus $90, which consists of a hotel and the insurance fee. When the refund is returned, we will issue your check.

Any additional individual reservations, outside the group, you may have made you will need to cancel.

We appreciate your patience and understanding. Our decision is in an attempt to come up with the best outcome for everyone involved.

If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.

Thanks,

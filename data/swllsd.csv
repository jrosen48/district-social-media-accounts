With so many people now out of work the need is even stronger. If you need help with groceries or know someone that does, we are here to serve you. We are pre-boxing the food and working on a curbside service. Just drive up to the Storehouse, stay in your car, we will come out and get your information, load your groceries and you’re on your way. Praying this coronavirus passes soon and the doors will be opened again. We miss praying and talking with the families. The clothing section remains closed until all restrictions are lifted and we can open the doors. Praying for everyone to stay healthy.

The Southwest Licking Schools Education Foundation is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization which provides funding and/or materials for projects that advance the curriculum of the Southwest Licking School District. We started last January by awarding each school building with an impact gift (STEM/Technology carts) to let people know who we are and what we do. We just finished our first cycle of grant reviews where teachers submitted funding requests for various materials to enhance their curriculum. The group reviewed several requests and selected a recipient for funding. Ms. Margret Savage of Watkins Middle School received the award during her 4th period class. Ms. Savage requested funding for pianos for her classroom and has some wonderful ideas on enhancing students' access to piano lessons.

Have you heard about our Drug Free Club?

Watkins Memorial High School students are invited to apply for membership in the Drug Free Club. The purposes of the club are to:
- reward students’ good choices and
- provide students with tools to help stay drug free.

How it Works
A student volunteers to join Drug Free Clubs of America, which requires passing a drug test and submitting a $20 annual membership fee. Members are eligible for school and community perks throughout the year. Random resting of members continues regularly, and as long as members remain drug free, the perks continue. If a student tests positive for drugs, parents receive a phone call directly from the doctor who analyzed the sample; club membership is placed on hold until the student regains active membership by passing a subsequent drug test. Parents are also provided with a list of community resources. Results are never shared with the school.

In light of the racial injustices going on today, we strive for peace and equity within our schools. We hope and pray that we can encourage our students to love each other, because we know together we can make a difference. We will continue our passionate pursuit of excellent education for all children and use that as a means to change the dynamics of a broken system. There is no place for racism, hatred, or social injustice in our school and in our world. We ask that you join us in the commitment to keeping these promises to our students and families.

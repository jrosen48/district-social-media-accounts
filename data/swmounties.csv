District students are receiving their iPads this week in school. The devices will go home with students every evening so they can continue to access school work on remote days.

We are excited to offer this program to our students, staff, and families. We understand it is new and there will be questions about the devices and programs. To help, a new district web site with resources for all students is now accessible under the channel ""Students and Families"" and ""Digital Learning"".

Although the spring production of The Little Mermaid by the Syosset High School's Association of Creative Thespians was cancelled due to COVID-19 restrictions, the cast, crew, and orchestra performed on what would have been opening night to a very limited audience. The performance was recorded and now you can experience this beloved family classic from home. Join the community in support of the SHS Theatre Arts Program on Thursday, July 30th at 7 p.m. for only $10 per view! Please purchase one “ticket” per device to be used to view the production. Your contribution will aid the Association of Creative Thespians as they continue to bring wonderful theatrical productions to the Syosset stage in the future.

The District immediately reported the matter to Homeland Security, who deemed this to be a false report and confirmed there is no threat and they are not engaged in an investigation. Homeland Security is now looking into the origins of the false report.

Days ago, the State designated today as a “Day of Remembrance” to encourage observance, discussion and education in the classroom of the historical events that took place 18 years ago. Our school calendar initially had an event scheduled for this evening, which we ultimately concluded may hinder too many families from attending their own remembrances and memorials. The event was rescheduled to a later date. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this late decision to reschedule may have caused.

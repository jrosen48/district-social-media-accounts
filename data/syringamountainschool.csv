Over the summer we have had some bitter-sweet moments: We have done some celebrating and we have hugged and said goodbyes. Over the course of the summer, we have said goodbye to some of our Syringa families as job opportunities have taken families away from the Wood River Valley to places where wages are higher, and the cost of living is lower! We have said goodbyes as families have relocated their children all to the same school within the valley.
As a result of these movements, we find ourselves with openings at all grade levels except 4th. As a school, we still remain invisible to many families in the valley.

We have placed all clothing items that were found during the school year on the fence. If you think you are missing a shirt, coat, gloves etc. it is now time to 'walk the fence line'. Any items still remaining by Thursday will be offered to teachers to use as spares or back up clothes for students in need. After that, we will donate items to families who want the clothes or to a local non-profit.

There are no names on the clothes and, by the time you read this, students will have walked past the 'found' items a couple of times.

Cheers,

Nigel

P.S. Please try and find a way to label your children's school clothes or at least initial so we can return items. If I purchased the items on the fence. as new, I suspect we have over $1500 worth of clothes looking for a home.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2228416957173403&id=719529991395448,,0.0,"Parents,

We have placed all clothing items that were found during the school year on the fence. If you think you are missing a shirt, coat, gloves etc. it is now time to 'walk the fence line'. Any items still remaining by Thursday will be offered to teachers to use as spares or back up clothes for students in need. After that, we will donate items to families who want the clothes or to a local non-profit.

There are no names on the clothes and, by the time you read this, students will have walked past the 'found' items a couple of times.

Cheers,

Nigel

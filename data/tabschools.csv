Parade Day and our final day of Kindergarten Camp was a great success! These cubs are ready for September (no rush though)!!!! 😎

Many thanks to our amazing parent and sibling volunteers for helping to make this program a success as well as our Administration and custodial and secretarial teams for all of their support and efforts! Lastly but definitely not least, a HUGE thanks to our incredible teaching staff, who come back during the first week of their summer break to support this program and “camp” with the incoming Kindergarteners - this program is not possible without them!!!!",0.0,"Tabernacle HSA

A HUGE thank you to everyone who came out last night to support our Bingo event and the many volunteers and coordinators who made the night a success!

This event surely takes a village and our village is one of a kind! From our amazing administration, teachers, staff and custodians to our Seneca student volunteers, ticket sellers, snack stand and candy bingo helpers and BOE members. A very special thank you to Michele Levin Bottiglieri for once again hitting it out of the park and coordinating a fantastic night for our community!!!! Also, huge thanks to our many sponsors and door prize donors- we truly appreciate the continuous support you show our schools.

Congrats to all of the winners!

If the transfer is approved, Tacoma Housing Authority will continue to engage the community in the ultimate vision and master plan through extensive community engagement, including a Community Advisory Board.

The purpose of this survey is to collect a large sample of thoughts with the goal of presenting information to the Tacoma School Board in the fall of 2020.

The idea of renaming the school came about when alumni and community members voiced concerns after press about Princeton University officials deciding to eliminate Woodrow Wilson's name from their campus. Alumni contacted the Tacoma School District superintendent and Wilson principal about the policy and process for renaming. The committee members, who will make a recommendation to the school board, include staff, students, parents, alumni, community members and a historian.

Principal Taylor said the supply kits will be a “little piece of Manitou” in every student’s home. The kits are designed specifically to meet the needs of remote learning.

“To know that I have this much support from the community, it just makes me feel like—I have people behind me who are in this work with me, who believe that my parents are the most amazing parents in Tacoma and want to support that,” said Taylor.

Distribution plans are still in the works and will be shared with Manitou Park Elementary families in the next few days.

- Closing opportunity gaps for specific student groups
- Growth and progress from one year to the next
- Showing high performance in measures including
English language arts (ELA), math state test scores and
graduation rates

In her neighborhood, people know her as the “Hilltop mama,” a person who’s going to notice when things are going well with families in the area, and when they’re not.

She’s been known to leave hot meals and diapers on her porch for neighbors to grab as they need them. When families don’t have transportation, she’ll pick up a box of donated supplies and make sure they’re delivered.

“There’s a lot of us out here just being the mamas to everyone,” Coates said. “In the summer, we make sure that kids are fed. In the winter, we make sure they have coats and shoes. Now - with everything people are going through - is just an extension of that. It’s just what you do. We’re ‘momming’ together.”

“Emily serves the entire Hilltop neighborhood,” said Bryant Montessori Family Liaison Jenna Buswell. “She’s always on patrol. People tell her what they need and she makes it happen, making sure kids are safe and well. She’s an emotional bright light.”

Thank you, Emily, for looking out for Tacoma’s kids. We appreciate you.

Each volunteer delivers hygiene products to Tacoma students in need. They do what they have to do to get students the supplies they need to feel clean and comfortable.

In 2019, Raising Girls provided 1,200 hygiene supply bags to our students. Only four months into 2020, they’ve already provided 2,000. The need is real, and it’s significant at our middle and high schools.

Lincoln High School Principal Pat Erwin can attest to that, and he’s grateful for the support Raising Girls provides his students – both female and male.

“The thing that I really appreciate during the COVID-19 crisis is that everyone who has a tendency to care is caring even more,” Erwin said. “But I appreciate organizations that exist outside times of crisis, too. Kids don’t have a choice in a lot of the things that affect them, and we need to be able to serve them no matter what.”

“One of the hardest parts of this experience so far has been missing the shared space and community that my students and I have built in our classroom together. I have had the privilege of being able to build and grow a community this year with some of the most incredible, creative, hilarious, empathetic students I have ever met. I miss getting to witness their discoveries, vulnerabilities, mistakes, realizations and laughter in real time.

I hope that students and families take away that all of the things they're feeling are okay, and also how much all of us in education who can't be with them are thinking about them and want to support them however we can. None of us are alone in this.”

Riya created more than a dozen hand-written cards for MultiCare Health System doctors and nurses. She said, “I feel like sometimes they are not as appreciated as they should be and so them seeing these cards, and seeing these words, I hope it just lifts them up to a point where they feel appreciated. It’s like pushing them to keep going. It also makes me feel happy at the end of the day that I was able to spread some encouraging words.”

Our first topic is stress management. Here’s a quick mindfulness exercise. You can do this when you need to calm your mind or body.

Get into a comfortable position and close your eyes. Focus on listening to your breathing. Feel the air entering through your nose, filling up your lungs and blowing out of your mouth.

Inhale slowly through your nose. Place your fingers gently on your ears to block out sounds. Breathe out through your mouth, saying “buzzzzzzzzzzz” for as long as you can. Repeat.

Try a different sound such as “hummmmmmm” or “ohhhhhhhhh”.
Repeat the bumble bee breathing until your body is calm and relaxed.

We need your feedback--parents, students and community—for our Board of Directors to update the district’s strategic plan for 2021-2025. Our strategic plan provides the road map for TPS, guides where we invest time and money, and currently includes four focus areas: Academic Excellence, Partnership, Early Learning and Safety.

But what, there's more!
This week the Bonney Lake High School girls basketball team was in a playoff game at Washington High School in the Franklin Pierce School District--right before the Lincoln vs. Yelm girls game.
As the game started the Lincoln Cheer Team noticed that the Bonney Lake team didn’t have its cheer team at the game. So the Abes decided they would cheer for their league mates Bonney Lake. Fresh off their state championship, they rocked the Washington High School gym and got the Bonney Lake fans going…
And guess what? Bonney Lake won to advance to the next round. Bonney Lake was very appreciative of the LHS Cheer Team's support!

Jasmyne Walton, Wainwright Intermediate
“Building relationships is the cornerstone of my role as a school counselor. It's an honor and privilege to work with students, families, and staff; especially during a time of high need. When students are at their most vulnerable moments they trust me to listen with empathy, genuine concern, respect, and compassion. I can do so because I value them and who they are. Our students are important to me. I know what I say or do can resound with them for the rest of their lives, whether I remember that exact moment or not. I put my all into building relationships with students because they are worth it. Our students are why I became a school counselor. They are why I return day after day, ready for whatever the day may bring.”

Ravi Jaskar, Stewart Middle School
“I have had the pleasure of working as a School Counselor in Tacoma Public Schools for the past 13 years, 11 of which have been at Stewart Middle School. Students in middle school make a huge amount of growth and begin making connections to what they want to be and where they want to go. As a middle school counselor, I work to provide opportunities for students to discover and explore their interests. My favorite event of the year is our Annual College and Career Week in March, which gives students a chance to see future possibilities. Helping students make the transition from elementary to being high school ready is my passion. “

Though smaller and rural, the district is expansive. The daily bus runs cover 979 miles.

“We are doing 1,200 meals a day,” said Christine Costa, president of the local union. “The kids look forward to it. It’s a great thing for the community. And we pulled (the planning for) this all off in a matter of hours once school was closed” by the pandemic.

Taconic Hills SRPs — like in Albany and other districts statewide from Long Island, to northern New York to Buffalo — prepare, pack, and deliver meals to students and families in need. They thoroughly clean and maintain the district’s facilities. Teacher aides help prepare lessons. And SRPs also provide childcare.

Taconic Hills SRPs — like in Albany and other districts statewide from Long Island, to northern New York to Buffalo — prepare, pack, and deliver meals to students and families in need. They thoroughly clean and maintain the district’s facilities. Teacher aides help prepare lessons. And SRPs also provide childcare.

Mr. Hamm grew up in the district, attended school at Taconic Hills, and was a music teacher for 30 years. Lyle was also a great family man, lifeguard, instructor, civic icon, and volunteer who went on to substitute at the school he loved for 16 years after his retirement. He loved Taconic Hills and all of its students. He was a wonderful caring man with a great sense of humor and passion to teach students.
Mr. Hamm left an indelible mark on countless students during his life. Many have fond remembrances of their experiences with ""Hammie"".
There are plans to set up a scholarship in his name and honor his legacy in the coming months. The family will hold a private burial and will be hosting a public memorial service at a later date. Please keep them in your thoughts and prayers during this time.

Mr. Hamm grew up in the district, attended school at Taconic Hills, and was a music teacher for 30 years. Lyle was also a great family man, lifeguard, instructor, civic icon, and volunteer who went on to substitute at the school he loved for 16 years after his retirement. He loved Taconic Hills and all of its students. He was a wonderful caring man with a great sense of humor and passion to teach students.

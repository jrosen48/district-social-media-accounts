Encuesta de comidas durante el cierre de la escuela",2.0,"¡NECESITAMOS Y QUEREMOS TU COMENTARIO!

En Taft Union High School District, uno de nuestros objetivos principales durante estos tiempos difíciles es garantizar que sigamos brindando comidas nutritivas a nuestros estudiantes. Con inquietudes sobre COVID-19 y los cierres escolares correspondientes, no queremos agregar ninguna ansiedad a nuestros estudiantes y sus familias.

Queremos asegurarnos de que la disponibilidad de comidas NO ES ABSOLUTAMENTE una de esas preocupaciones. El Departamento de Educación de California nos otorgó una exención para proporcionar comidas durante este tiempo a nuestros estudiantes y a los miembros de nuestra comunidad de 18 años de edad y menores, y planeamos hacerlo completamente. Cómo, cuándo y dónde lo hacemos depende de USTED.

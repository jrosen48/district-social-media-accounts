As mentioned here before, the state of Texas has gone an extra mile to ensure the safety of our students participating in any physical activity by requiring a physical.

The Family Wellness Clinic will offer physicals for us for $20 on Wednesday, July 31, from 1:00-3:30. A parent signature is required before the physical is performed.

Alternatively, the Covenant Healthcare Clinic in Plainview will do them free of charge if you’re interested.

Any student entering year 1 or 3 of high school must have a physical examination signed by a physician and on file with the district before being able to participate in any type of marching practice.

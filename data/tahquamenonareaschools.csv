Don't worry about rushing out though. You will not be charged fines on the those items until late August.

Please note that items returned in the book drop will not immediately be removed from your account. Due to required item quarantine procedures there will be a lag in when the books are returned and when they are checked in. You will not receive fines because of this.

If the book drop is full, please try to return those items at a later date. You will not be penalized. There are a lot of people with outstanding items and the book drop might reach capacity if everyone returns items at once.

Working Wednesday: Choices are a powerful parenting tool. Offer your child two choices you are okay with, such as carrots or peas for dinner? Or do you want to do your homework now or later? If your child won't choose, you choose for them. Choices should be given before a child resists and shouldn't be used as a punishment in disguise. Choices reduce resistance, share power, provide boundaries, strengthen relationships and increase decision making. #extensionextras #workingwednesday https://www.canr.msu.edu/resources/the-power-of-choices-for-children",0.0,"MI Stronger Family- Michigan State University Extension

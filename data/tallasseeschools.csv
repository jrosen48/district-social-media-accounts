Tenor Saxes, Trumpets, Trombones, Baritones, Tubas, and Percussion will meet from 1:30 - 3:00.

You will need to wear a mask to rehearsal. You also need to bring the show music that I already passed out to you.

When you arrive on campus, please come to the front steps of the music building. Mrs. Skeen and I will take your temperature and complete a checklist before you will be allowed to stay for practice.

We will be rehearsing in the auditorium to allow for social distancing purposes.

""(I'm) very proud of the team,"" head coach John Mask said. ""The 'Beach' was a very tough tournament. I think it will help at the end of the season. Wrestling tough teams always pays of at the end.""

Tallassee was third best among 18 teams at the McPhillips tourney. Four THS wrestlers placed in the top three in their weight classes; Mason Bell (154), Zak Haynes (134), Brendon Emfinger (115) and Land Bell (106).

This week, the matters will have three home matches on consecutive days before the first regional dual this weekend. Tallassee is now 18-6 on the season.

The advent of 2020 brings on the second season for Keiven Mixson's No. 8 ranked Tallassee Tigers basketball team. It's time for area play.

Tallassee opens the area season vs. Valley on Tuesday, Jan. 7. It will tip off a stretch of four straight area games over a nine-day stretch.

The Tigers are battle-tested with ten games vs. 6A or 7A competition. After winning the Elmore County Tournament for the second consecutive year, Tallassee put up a strong showing in Montgomery's Dwight Madison Tournament. Their record is now 15-3, but Mixson is not satisfied.

""We're not playing great,"" the coach said over the holiday break. ""We're not peaking. We've got a long way to go. Guys are playing hard though.""

Tallassee's first three area contests will be at Stumberg Gym. After the Valley game on Tuesday, the Tigers play Brew Tech on Thursday, Jan. 9 and Beauregard for Senior Night next Tuesday, Jan. 14. Tallassee travels to Valley on Jan. 16.

Tanque Verde High School has been awarded an Expansion and Innovation Fund grant, designed to support students significantly disrupted by COVID-19.

The grants, awarded to 18 schools, were funded by an initial $1 million contribution from Gov. Doug Ducey’s Emergency Education Relief fund through the federal CARES Act to improve access to high-quality teaching and learning this school year.

The first round of awards are worth a total of $850,000.

A second-round grant cycle for district, magnet, charter and private schools is expected to open soon and will be supported by philanthropic and private contributions.

“A for Arizona’s Expansion and Innovation Fund supports school leaders and educators who find creative, effective ways to serve vulnerable students and work toward closing the achievement gap,” Ducey said in a statement.

If you're not already familiar with Remind, it's a classroom communication tool that makes it easy to stay involved with your child's learning. Remind is free to use, and you'll be able to get and send messages on any device—even a simple text from your phone!

As part of this roll-out, we are asking PreK-12 parents to join by responding to the invitation from your student’s teacher(s). Secondary students received an email on August 6th, via their TVUSD student email account from Remind, with instructions about how to claim their account in coordination with the start of the school year.
We're excited to make connecting with our families more engaging as we Return to Learning for the 2020-21 School Year!

Made this schedule to keep myself and my family sane through the unprecedented weeks ahead. Funny how everything works - it’s gotten picked up by behavior groups, doctors, teachers, and has been shared more than 10k times that I know of. I feel like I just got an official mom trophy 😂

Posting here because maybe it will help some of my family clients, too. I made it based off my kids ages and our family, use as-is or as a jumping off point for your own. Whatever we can do to help each other through whatever is coming!

I’d love to hear what you are doing for your kids? How are you planning to manage the inevitable difficulties that come with two weeks away from activities and friends?

We’re joining together to keep Arizona’s kids, families, and school communities safe and healthy. Arizona is united, and we’ll get through this. Superintendent Kathy Hoffman

This decision is not made lightly, but it is the right thing to do to bring certainty and consistency to all Arizona schools. With schools closing, we are working together to provide assistance during this time and lessen the impact on all Arizona families.

It’s important for families & parents to know that while this will address operational issues, closing schools will not stop the spread of #COVID19. It is the recommendation of public health officials that kids who are not at school remain at home to the greatest extent possible.

For more information on ways to stay safe and healthy, visit http://azhealth.gov.

March 15 at 4:14 PM ·

We’re joining together to keep Arizona’s kids, families, and school communities safe and healthy. Arizona is united, and we’ll get through this. Superintendent Kathy Hoffman

This decision is not made lightly, but it is the right thing to do to bring certainty and consistency to all Arizona schools. With schools closing, we are working together to provide assistance during this time and lessen the impact on all Arizona families.

It’s important for families & parents to know that while this will address operational issues, closing schools will not stop the spread of #COVID19. It is the recommendation of public health officials that kids who are not at school remain at home to the greatest extent possible.

For more information on ways to stay safe and healthy, visit http://azhealth.gov.

There is a new parking/drop off/pick up map this year. District rules have changed and buses can no longer be in the parking lot. Please refrain from dropping off in front of the school and use the drop off lane instead. This is for the safety of our students.

On the first day of school the parking lot will be full! You may park along Limberlost and walk across at the cross walk. Please do not park on Homestead as this is where the cars coming out of the drop off lane will be driving and it is not safe for our students to be walking here.

We realize that some of our families may need time to collect information to support their decision for their child to attend in person or virtually. For families in this position, we respect your need to hear the details of the Return to Learn Plan before committing. Attached to the email portion of this call is a letter with safety protocols for our current phase, Phase 4, that we have drafted for in-person instruction for our initial plan. Please know that these may change as we continue to adjust to this situation.

All information that is usually shared during orientation will be shared and made available digitally through the skyward portal towards the end of THIS week.

""Carley Bolen, a graduating senior from Tawas Area High School, is a strong yet humble forward/striker. Carley has the ability to outscore and outrun almost any girl you would dare to compare her to, scoring over 40 goals in just one season, and helping to lead her team to become the 2019 Season District Champions. She has spent all three years of high school as a varsity player and is also a three-year all-district and all-academic player. Last year as a Junior, she was the offensive player of the year, and this year as a senior she was sure to be one to watch, likely taking home the award for MVP. Carley is very athletic and talented, playing multiple sports throughout the school year, and has a drive like no other. She will continue her soccer and basketball careers this fall at Delta Community College.

7th and 8th grade pick up 11:00 - 12:00

5th and 6th grade pick up 12:00 - 1:00

They joined 151 other students to work with Dr. David Rayl, Professor of Music and Director of Choral Programs at MSU, and perform a concert this evening.

At this event Kirsten and Luther also got the chance to audition for the State Honors Choirs and I am excited to announce that Kirsten was chosen to participate in the SATB Honors Choir. Her next performance will take place January 18th at the Michigan Music Conference in Grand Rapids.

At this point they have decided that their Blackboard system will not work for the virtual experience. They have agreed to use our students' Taylor Prep emails instead of the WCCCD emails and will be reaching out to them by the end of this week. They will be establishing a google meet that will be the platform they will use to instruct students. The meet codes will be sent out at that time. Students will need to reply to the email that the instructor sends out in order to be counted as present and enrolled in their course.

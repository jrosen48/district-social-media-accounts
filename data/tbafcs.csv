Need your help!
For the past ???? years we have decorated the gym in the elementary school like a town (Christmas Town) the week before break. We use play money and the kids are able to go around the town and ‚Äúbuy‚Äù things (toy store, pet shop, restaurant, sports store, car shop, gas station, clothing store etc). In the clothing store we have different items that the kids can ‚Äúbuy‚Äù and wear around the town. The most popular items are Halloween costumes that people have donated. Well, our costumes need an upgrade üòÅ!!! If anyone has any old costumes that you don‚Äôt have a use for and are looking for something to do with them, I would love to take them off your hands!! I would be happy to come and pick them up or feel free to drop them off at school. Sizes can be for Pre-K through 6th grade.

Need your help!
For the past ???? years we have decorated the gym in the elementary school like a town (Christmas Town) the week before break. We use play money and the kids are able to go around the town and ‚Äúbuy‚Äù things (toy store, pet shop, restaurant, sports store, car shop, gas station, clothing store etc). In the clothing store we have different items that the kids can ‚Äúbuy‚Äù and wear around the town. The most popular items are Halloween costumes that people have donated.

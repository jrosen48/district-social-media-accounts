Hey all! I know we are living in a crazy time right now and I wanted to make it easier for everyone to contact me (if needed) and for me to provide information and resources to everyone!

Since I'm new to TC I just thought I would introduce myself! I'm Joni Hannon the TC school nurse. I joined the TC family in December! I have been a nurse for 12 years and prior to coming to TC I was a surgery nurse at PRHC for 10 years and before that I was a Med/Surg nurse there. I'm a mom of 3, my oldest Easton is 9 and I have twins Liam and Kella who are 4. My husband Brad is an engineer for Musco. Outside of work I love to run and be outside with my family!

I hope you are all doing well. I am certainly missing all of our students and staff and can't wait til we can get back to school. If you having any questions or need anything please feel free to reach out to me!

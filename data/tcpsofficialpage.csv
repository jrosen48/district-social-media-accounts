Attention Seniors

I would like to take a moment to congratulate the young men and women of the graduating classes of Twiggs County High School and Twiggs Academy. Through your hard work and perseverance, you have earned your high school diploma and reached one of the most important milestones of your lives.

I know many of you maybe apprehensive of what the future holds, but I would encourage you to look to that future with a determination of success and continue to persevere. Chase your dreams and know that you can catch them. Learn from those who have gone before you and be a mentor and an inspiration to those who will come behind.

I wish each of you success in your future endeavors and I pray the Lord will guide your steps and pour out His blessing upon you.

A change has happened and we all must adjust. Staying home for a while might have been fun at first, but many of you may have started to feel a little bored. Do you want to go on an adventure? Visit a place you've never been before? We've got the answer. Read a book! Books take you wherever you want to go. We have refilled the Little Free Libraries across the county. Check them out! Get a book. Read a book. Return a book. No cards. No late fees.

This meet gave us a chance to compete as well as get our numbers so that we can set future goals. Makayla Davis and Zarek Burney participated in the field events: Shot put. Nadia James, Jeremy Curtis, Malik Dupont, Cheyenne Warner, Makayla Foster, and Antonious Burney competed in sprints: (100m, 200m, & 400m) Jeremy placed second in the 100m sprint with a finishing unofficial time of 11.4, Makayla Foster also displayed a strong finish in her 100m sprint. Malik had a strong finish in the 200m sprint, and expectations are high. Antonius and Cheyenne both competed in the 400m race and did well, displaying great potential for the future meets.

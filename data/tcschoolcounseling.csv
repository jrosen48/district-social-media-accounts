School starts in 1 week, August 19. Please send a visor, baseball cap or a hat with a rim with your PK-6th grade child. We will provide each child with face shield that clips to the hat. Students will be asked to wear face shields only when they are in a small group or student pair. We hope that wearing a hat will make this a ""little"" fun for the students. Of course, all students are welcome to wear a facial mask or shield at all times and at the request of a parent.

Teachers will wear face shields or facial masks whenever they are within 6 feet of a student (which will be pretty much all the time 😀)

Also, PK-6 rooms will also have desk shields.

We have compiled a desperately needed and frequently requested list of mental health providers that are doing telehealth AND taking new clients. All schools absolutely need to be posting this list to their websites and sharing with families. They need it and they need you to share it. Hurry and share with your networks, because you do not know who needs it the most right now. Please do not wait for them to come to you. The complete list can be found on our website:

Since I'm new to TC I just thought I would introduce myself! I'm Joni Hannon the TC school nurse. I joined the TC family in December! I have been a nurse for 12 years and prior to coming to TC I was a surgery nurse at PRHC for 10 years and before that I was a Med/Surg nurse there. I'm a mom of 3, my oldest Easton is 9 and I have twins Liam and Kella who are 4. My husband Brad is an engineer for Musco. Outside of work I love to run and be outside with my family!

I hope you are all doing well. I am certainly missing all of our students and staff and can't wait til we can get back to school. If you having any questions or need anything please feel free to reach out to me!

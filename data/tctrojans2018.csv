Dear Parents,

Friday, September 4, is Parent/Senior Night for football and cheer. We will honor our senior athletes and recognize parents before the football game at 6:45 P.M.. Parents of cheerleaders and players will get into the game for free as usual, however, they will not be allowed to come down on the field. We ask parents to stand when their names are called and their son or daughter will go to the sideline and face the crowd.

Senior parents - Please meet your child at the gap between the fence and the bleachers on the South end. Seniors will meet their parents on the track and social distance from the rest of the group.

Contact the school if you have any questions or concerns. Masks are highly encouraged at the game. Thank you for your support of Trojan Athletics.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3168274853256617&id=590030224414439,,0.0,"Parents/Senior Night -(Football and Cheer)

Activities for Teens During Quarantine",3.0,"Happy Sunday! I found a website which lists several ideas specifically for teenagers. How cool! A few of the ideas to practice while you are at home are to create your own ‚ÄúChopped‚Äù challenge, another is to practice mindfulness with journaling, and even decluttering your closet. Most of these are family-oriented which I am fond of. Enjoy! ~Ms. Berg #tcpride üñ§üíõ

Something I think you might enjoy. Similar style to how I make one. I do a pinch bow vs the one she made. I will be sending you photos throughout the week via text on the phone. Let me know if you would rather receive it by email. The material I share with you is things we would have covered had we been in school.

Hopefully we are back in school by May 1. Until then- stay safe. This virus is serious and it will get to our area.

The flower for this week is a daffodil. You might recognize the photo location. In front of my machine shed.
The daffodil is a bulb plant that can survive our cold winters...meaning you do not need to dig them up in the fall. You plant them in fall and they come up each year at or around this time. The idea of a perennial flower bed is to have blooms starting in early spring through late fall. COMING SOON- iris blooms. ( I bet you can't wait!!)

This week is Severe Weather Awareness Week. TC wants to remind you to discuss safety plans with your children in the event that a severe weather warning is issued. Have a plan in place for the family. Know where to go when warnings and watches are issued.

WATCH: BE PREPARED!
WARNING: TAKE ACTION!

Also since everyone is spending more time at home, this is a good time to remember to check your fire alarms. Many fatalities happen when alarms are not maintained. Take time to go over emergency action plans with children:

How to evacuate?
Where to go and set up a meeting spot away from the hazard?
DO NOT RETURN INTO BURNING HOUSE
Run a drill with your kids using the fire alarm.
(It is disturbing to find out how many kids do not wake up to an alarm)

Sometimes the little thing are overlooked. Enjoy the day and be safe TC community.

I think we can all agree that being in isolation sucks. Being stuck in isolation with the kids and trying to work from home at the same time? You know what. I can't even think of a word strong enough to fully describe that pain.

So here are a few games and activities that will get your kids moving even while stuck inside.

I hope you are all doing well. For middle school reading class I recommend that you continue reading the second Percy Jackson book, that we have been reading aloud in class. I also think that now would be an excellent time to find a good book that interests you. Additionally, I would be more than happy to review any stories that you would like to write during the closure. Just write about whatever inspires you. Email me your stories so that I can look them over and give feedback. Of course this is optional and will not be apart of your grade for class.

Stay healthy and don't be afraid to reach out.

Congratulations to Triad Community Unit School District #2 for their recent order of three Motiv-powered Type C school buses!

Ameren Illinois, a leading electric utility with a strong commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship, will be assisting with the installation of Triad's charger and charging infrastructure. Triad's electric fleet will also be net-zero, as it will be powered by a newly built solar system.

Triad's new Type C school buses are based on our EPIC F-59 chassis with BMW i3 lithium-ion batteries, built by Starcraft Bus, and sold by Creative Bus Sales.

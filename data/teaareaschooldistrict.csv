Titans,
It is hard to believe this year is coming to a close. I am still not sure what day, month, or time of year it feels like, but today was the last day of school. We are glad you are Titans. We are already busy planning for the next school year.

Please remember your exchange time on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
I believe signup genius will send you a reminder the day before your signup
time. Please do not hesitate to call the buildings beginning on Monday if you
have any questions. We are here to support you and your student.

Thank you for a wonderful and memorable school year. This year will be remembered in history for a long time to come.

Titan Families,

Happy Teacher Appreciation Week! We appreciate our Titan Teachers and that includes each of you. Parents, grandparents, friends, brothers, sisters, and neighbors are all teachers. We appreciate how Titans have all come together to take care of one another and especially our students. We appreciate the planning, leadership, and care of our faculty. We are successful only because we are together providing a high-quality solution for our Titan student. Thank you to being part of our Titan Team.

Titan Care Team Tip of the Day:
Do meaningful things with your free time. Learn a new skill, create art, journal, play puzzles or games, or cook something new. Think about something you have wanted to learn or do for a long time. Having a goal or task to work on can help you relax.

Have a wonderful evening,

My update is short on this beautiful evening. I hope each of you are all doing well.

Please find our Titan Care Team:
Practice relaxing in the present moment through mindfulness. Mindfulness involves focusing your attention on the present moment and accepting it without judgment. There are many types of mindfulness exercises, but each typically involves finding a quiet, comfortable place where you can observe your thoughts and focus on your breath. Some apps to explore include Headspace, Calm, Simple Habit, and Liberate. This Mayo Clinic mindfulness program https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/covid-19-tips-for-mindfulness-coping-with-anxiety/ is a great place to start.

Titan Families,

I spend most of my days on multiple conference calls or phone calls from my office desk with other adults talking, planning, and brainstorming. Today, I had the opportunity to join Mr. Knudson, Mr. Preheim, and the senior class officers as they collaboratively reviewed senior class feedback. Our students are incredible, respectful, and care deeply. Two of the three students were 4th-graders when I was principal at the Intermediate School. It is amazing to see them grow and become young adults. Education is the greatest profession in the world because we get to watch, nurture, push, and grow our next leaders. Today, the call rejuvenated me as our halls are empty but they refilled my energy and spirit.

By the end of the week, we hope to release a comprehensive plan identifying how report cards, transcripts, graduation, and item pick-up/drop-off will work. We sincerely appreciate your patience.

Titan Families,

Happy April Fools Day! It is a good thing that COVID19 crisis did not start today or no one would believe it was real. Sadly, it is quite real and now is the time to take care of one another in unique ways. Facetime, google meet, old fashion letters are wonderful ways to take care of one another!

As a reminder, our playgrounds are locked and equipment is closed. Please support the city and the district’s efforts to keep people safe from this invisible enemy. Please do your part to be part of the solution. We care about each and everyone of you!

Today is Census Day! It is very important to take part in the 2020 census. As a member of the chamber board, I know businesses consider towns when they officially reach 5000 people. Tea would benefit if we were officially identified as a community over 5000. I believe you can do it right here: https://my2020census.gov/

Remember the District Parent Resource Guide is the centralized location for information and resources.

The purpose of this email is to provide an overview of Tea Area School District's COVID19 response and centralize our parent resources.

The attached resource is a ten-thousand foot overview of our technology, instructional program, and community resources. The attachment is also available by clicking this link. The linked document will be updated as we learn from each other.

As a parent, I strongly encourage you to identify a learning area for each of your children. This area should be consistent, free from distraction, and appropriate for devices. We already lost a power cord at our home, but it was easily found as we have not gone anywhere. Now, I have a storage bin by each of their learning areas to keep their school items together.

Your principals and teachers will be in contact with you on Sunday and Monday with specific information. I am grateful for their work and organization.

Thank you all for your support and grace,

These first-time welding students are a part of the newly formed CTE program at Tea Area School District.

But, they more than that. They are the future of a valuable skilled trade and the manufacturing industry.

We hope we were able to continue their desire to learn more about welding and possibly plant a seed on pursuing a career in manufacturing.

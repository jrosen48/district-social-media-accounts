How cool are these face shields?

These shields were made by a 3D printer that belongs to the Robotics Team at Gentry High School! (Go Rams! 🐏)

Thank you to the Gentry High School Robotics Team for thinking outside the box and sharing your cool and clever invention with our hospital staff, but most importantly, thank you for spreading acts of kindness throughout the community.

If you know anything about Indianola, you know that our community is quick to rise up and respond to the needs of its residents. We would like to thank everyone for all of the thoughtful outreach of support and help that you have so graciously given to us. From meals, donations, prayer, and words of encouragement, your support is impacting South Sunflower County Hospital greatly during this time. We are humbled, amazed, and so very grateful for this community we get to call ours.",6.0,"Way to go Mr. Cochran and Delta Overload!!!

Yesterday, it was announced that Mississippi’s schools will not reopen for the remainder of this school year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, this means no prom, no senior class trips, and no commencement ceremonies for graduating seniors. Graduation day is the one day that all students dream of and work hard towards their entire life. I would like to use my social media platforms to recognize graduating high school and college seniors from the second congressional district of Mississippi. Please refer to the attached flyer for details and allow me to help celebrate your accomplishments. Class of 2020, I am very proud of you! The times may be uncertain but always keep the faith! #MS02Grads",14.0,"Seniors

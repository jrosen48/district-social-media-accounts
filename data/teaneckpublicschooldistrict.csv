The National Weather Center has issued a TROPICAL STORM WATCH, a TORNADO WATCH, and a FLASH FLOOD WATCH for our area today.

Anticipate tropical storm force winds 35-45 mph with gusts up to to 73 mph until early this evening resulting in downed trees, power outages, and flash flooding from heavy downpours.

Take down all temporary structures, including outdoor dining tents and umbrellas. Secure loose furniture and other objects. Charge your electronic devices now.

The situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes. Stay within your shelter keeping informed of the latest tornado situation.

Remember, a tornado ""warning"" is issued when a tornado is imminent. Usually that means signs of an imminent tornado have been spotted on radar.

We started off the day by doing a simulation for what it was like for the people living in Germany during the time of Hitler’s reign. We handed out different colored blocks the students had to hang around their neck and then we had students go in silence, single file, through the tunnels under the MinnWest Technology Campus and came out through the depot building and back to school where they were sorted to either the left or the right.

Life update for all my family and friends:

I’m doing great, college is going good, and I am on track to graduate Spring of 2020. That means I will graduate from the social work program at SMSU at the age of 20!!! I am wanting to go into child protective services somewhere near renville county! Along with graduating spring of 2020 means that I have to take some risks! Next semester I will be taking 23 credits with 3 of those credits from Bradman University in California! (And let me tell you that it is the most expensive class I will ever take!)

I am blessed with lots of love and support from all of my friends and family, and Grandpa in heaven. 💕

It’s going to be a tough rest of the year, but I know I got it under control! Only 3 more semesters left for this college girl!! I’m going to need lots of support! Let me know if you would like to send me a letter or care package! I would love to receive them! It makes my week so much brighter☺️

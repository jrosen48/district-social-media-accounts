Today is the first hard copy, paper packet pick-up opportunity in the TPS Continuity of Learning Plan. Materials will be available at Tecumseh High School and at South Early Learning Center during the normal food distribution times from 10:30 to 12:30. The packets will not be available at the mobile bus delivery sites. Paper packets will continue to be available at THS and South, every Tuesday and Thursday until June 9 and will be handed out in an area different than the food pick-up lines. Please look for the signs at each building with specific directions for paper packet pick-up. We did this so as not to overwhelm our already hardworking food service employees. Other TPS staff will focus on the hard copy materials. Please be patient as we attempt to serve all families who wish to have the paper packets at this time.

Residents at Cambrian earn Gareth bucks (play money), when they participate in activities at Cambrian. The bucks are named after one of the owners, Gareth Zebley. During this event they used the bucks at a live auction!

Each box was taken around the room and displayed so residents could see them. The boxes were auctioned off by a special guest, Judge Schaedler! So much fun for all ￼involved! ❤️

According to public health, students attending school should have a temperature less than 100.4. The questionnaire will help screen for students that are experiencing or have been exposed to COVID-19 symptoms. These symptoms include fever or chills, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, cough, fatigue, muscle or body ache, headache, new loss of taste of smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, diarrhea and nausea or vomiting.

In light of the recent protests around our nation, I feel compelled to say how proud I am to live in a community that is able to address this recent tragedy in a peaceful and productive manner.

We have all seen the effects of racial inequality in our society. It is important as educators and as a community that we teach tolerance, civility and social justice to our next generation and that we provide that example in our own actions. Tehama County educational leaders constantly strive to provide equity to all of our students. With that being said, there is still work to be done.

As we focus on the social and emotional needs of students and adults, it will be helpful to provide support for our community, but more specifically our education community, to process thoughts, emotions and feelings that stem from these events. The Tehama County Department of Education is committed to staying the course in leading the charge of social and emotional support throughout Tehama County.

I hope your summer is going well. We have been working hard on planning for the challenges we will face as we move closer to having students back at school in August. A core group of educators and board members have been working on the aspects that will go into next school year. Included in our plans are scenarios in which 100% of students will be on campus in the fall, 50% of our students on campus and a final scenario would be remote learning for all of our students.

We would like you to take a few moments to fill out a parent survey so we can get your input as we finalize our plans. Plans will be published at the end of July or the first part of August.

To take the survey click on the link provided. The Survey will close July 10th at 11:59 PM. Your input is greatly appreciated.

Highlights of our 2019 FFA year! I am so proud of each and every one of you. I know that this year did not go as planned, from having class and meetings on the stage to rescheduling LDE's to cancelling state because of Covid 19. Your hard work and passion for agriculture does not go unnoticed and we are building a great chapter. I miss each of you and hope you have a fantastic summer!

To My Seniors- You guys will never truely understand how much you mean to me. Without you Tekamah-Herman FFA would not be half of what it is. You guys have been through so much, 2 teacher changes, classroom transtions, and now Covid... I can't even begin to explain the important role each of you played in getting the Ag Program through those transitions. Each of you are going to do absolutely incredible things in the next coming years, and I cannot wait to hear all about it. Don't forget where you come from and know I BELIEVE in each of you.

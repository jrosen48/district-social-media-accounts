As you know, the State of Arizona has required all public schools to close for a period of time to allow coronavirus to subside. As a public school, Telesis will be closed through April 10.

Through this closure time, our teaching staff will be contacting you in a variety of ways. I have asked them to pick the contact method or methods of their own that meets the needs of all students. Teachers will communicate effectively in an effort to connect you and your child with instruction and assignments to continue the last half of our second semester beginning on Monday, March 23.
You may have heard from some of them already as they are anxious to move forward with their classroom instruction in a new way for your son or daughter to make this a successful experience.

Please watch for contact from your child’s teachers through email, ParentVue, and StudentVue.

Wishing for you and your family the very best of health as we all do our best with the challenge before us.

""When sad or frightening things happen, all of us have an opportunity to become better people by thinking about others. We can show them we care about them by saying so and by doing nice things for them. Helping others will make you feel better, too.

I want you to know how much I care about all of you. Be kind to each other, take care of each other, and show your love for each other.""",2019-09-11 11:17:30,,

From Mrs. Nash: Students came up with strategies to push through something tough rather than give up. We talked about this in terms of school goals, personal goals, or anything that could involve new learning and struggle. It's easy to just 'give up' rather than push through, so we discussed ways in which we already do this and shared strategies with each other.

The 8th grade class completed the long Growth Mindset poster with famous/historical figures who have changed the world because they persevered. After discussing strategies for pushing through when we are stuck or having difficulty, students colored their pieces and wrote strategies on each piece along the lines.

The 6th & 7th grade classes completed the Growth Mindset brain posters, writing their strategies in the space provided.

I would like to announce a new ambassador program for all our Telesis families!

It’s not a secret that we think your children are special and we want more of them, so please help us invite new students to Telesis.

When a new student enrolls at Telesis next school year, we will give them a new Telesis t-shirt, but for the family that invites them to Telesis, we will present a new Telesis backpack with the Tiger logo embroidered on the bag for every Telesis student in their family. The backpacks aren’t for sale and can only be earned by bringing a new student to Telesis.

If you know of students whose family would like a tour of our campus or more information about Telesis just call Mrs. Dawson, our registrar, so she can get your name on her list of Ambassadors. We want to present the Ambassador backpacks to you during our Meet the Teacher Night on August 1st. GO TIGERS!

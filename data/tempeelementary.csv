The children care for her daily and take turns making sure she has a clean litterbox, food and water twice a day, as well as a clean hutch and bedding. They also sit and observe her when they need a break in their work and she needs time outside of her hutch. Pumpkin Spice has even helped comfort younger children when they have had a bad day. The students also wrote letters to AHS talking about their love of Pumpkin Spice, taking her for walks on her harness, and watching her ‚Äúbink‚Äù when she is happy. We are so happy that Pumpkin Spice found the perfect ""family"" at Meyer Montessori!

I absolutely love the kindness of my kid's hearts! Just look at the words they shared with their peers.

I introduced a new activity called ‚ÄúWeekly Reflection"".

They have to reflect on their week, but also give at least one compliment to another student in the class. On the first day of the following week, I hand out the compliments they received from their peers along with their reflection from Friday.

Not only did EVERY student receive a compliment (aka they decided / asked if they could give compliments to multiple peers), but the words they said to each other made me super happy.

I think the biggest / unexpected lesson that I received from them is such an easy thing:

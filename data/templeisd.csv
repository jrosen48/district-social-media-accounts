In the fall of 2019, the Callaway Foundation presented TEF with $26,000. This money, along with other funds from a previous scholarship from the Callaway Foundation, allowed TEF to give a total of eight $5,000 scholarships to Temple High School graduating seniors this spring. Thank you to the Callaway Foundation and their commitment to young people. Today, the Callaway Foundation is run by Kevin and Hope Koch.

This week is Teacher Appreciation Week!

During these difficult times, our teachers have worked really hard to change the way they do things to make sure we are still providing a meaningful learning experience for our students. This week is an opportunity to thank a teacher in creative & safe ways for all the hard work they have put in this entire school year... especially during our extended learning period. Need some ideas? See below:

Say thanks through a note via email.

Make a teacher smile or laugh with a picture or video message via Google Classroom

Give a teacher a digital gift.

Share an inspirational song...sing it and send a video link.

Spread love for a teacher on social media with a shout out.

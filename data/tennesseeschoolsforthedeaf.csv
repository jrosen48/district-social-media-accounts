Families, Students and Stakeholders,

Keeping our students safe and healthy is our top priority here at TSD. As you may be aware, due to COVID-19 we will not be having any sports this fall season. Currently, it is too risky to have our students travel to other schools and sometimes other states to play sports. Since we will not be having football this season there will not be a homecoming celebration in the fall. We are currently monitoring the number of visitors who come on our campus and will not be able to host large groups here at the school at this time. Due to the ever-changing circumstances, in October we will make decisions about winter and spring sports and possibly have a homecoming during the winter sports season. Thank you for your patience.

Sincerely,
Vicki Kirk
Superintendent

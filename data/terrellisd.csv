We know this is a disappointment to our families, but we hope you are able to still able to cheer on the Tigers via live stream from the link we posted earlier today (also available on our website www.terrellisd.org) or by enjoying the game from Film Alley (see post from earlier today for details).

The online ticket company we have worked with has assured us they are working through the technical issues on their end to provide a better buyer experience for our fans.

Many of our TISD families may be eligible for this great resource from the State of Texas. We have received word that the deadline has been extended to July 31, 2020 and that there is still funding available for families who apply.

Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer (P-EBT) provides eligible families with a one-time payment for each child who previously received free or reduced-price meals. P-EBT works the same way Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits do and will help families get the food they need during the current pandemic. P-EBT will be administered by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, Texas Department of Agriculture and Texas Education Agency. The application for P-EBT will be open until July 31, 2020.

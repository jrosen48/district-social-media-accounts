ALL USD 240 Students - Food Service Announcement

The USDA made an announcement this week stating schools could provide a free breakfast and lunch to ALL students regardless of their status from now until December 31, or when the state/federal funding runs out. We have applied for the waiver and have been approved to begin providing this service to all students starting September 4. No lunch accounts will be charged until this funding source is no longer available.

We will not reimburse lunch account funds at this time as those dollars will be used once this program is over.

Because of other funding programs, we still request you complete the free/reduced application form and submit to your school as soon as possible. These reports assist in funding Title and At-Risk services and add additional dollars to our schools. Application Link: https://www.usd240.org/vimages/shared/vnews/stories/594930b04f342/20-21%20HouseholdApplication.pdf

USD 240 has the option to order additional masks for students, however we don't want to submit this order if everyone already has enough masks. These masks would be in addition to the school specific masks we have coming for each school, and will be a generic color not specific to a school.

Please add a comment if you are interested. If there is enough interest, we will submit an order. We will have the disposable masks available until our orders arrive.

UPDATE: Our intentions are to order these masks if there are enough students that still need a mask or two. We are using covid funds to make the purchase so we will not be allowed to sell them. They will be available for those that need them.

Attention Twin Valley patrons. We have a company coming into the district to resurface the tracks in Bennington and Tescott during the months of May and early June. They will be starting in Bennington as early as Monday, May 4. After they are done there, they will proceed to Tescott and address that track. It will take approximately 3 weeks per location.

During the time the renovation, those areas will be off limits. We will announce when the public is allowed to begin using the tracks after the work is complete.

Contact Mr. Van Ranken if you have any questions or concerns. We are very excited to get these completed for Twin Valley kids next year!",0.0,"Twin Valley Usd 240

We are excited to announce that Kansas teachers, students and parents just got a new partner in their continuous learning efforts.

Thanks to the support of Kansas Public Broadcasters, Kansas students will receive supplemental education content by way of a new television program produced by Kansas PBS stations and KSDE, and hosted by local teachers. The new program called Learning Across Kansas will begin airing the week of April 20.

Each 30-minute segment, individually produced for elementary, middle school and high school students, will feature grade-specific educational content delivered by our very own Kansas teachers who serve on KSDE’s Continuous Learning Task Force.

Teachers, students and parents/caregivers, tune in for short, fun and engaging lessons. Plus, you just might see one of your own teachers presenting!

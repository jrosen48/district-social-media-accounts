The email also provides information regarding virtual senior honors night and what is needed from each senior.

I do want to remind everyone that it is the district’s intent to host a traditional ceremony at a later date.

I am writing to address an incident today at Teutopolis High School involving police and assure you that your child is safe and not in danger.

The police were at the high school because the district notified law enforcement of a possible inappropriate social media contact with a student and adult male. The adult male — who is not an employee of Teutopolis School District and does not reside in this area — was taken into custody in the parking lot by police.

The safety of our students and staff is our top priority, and I want to assure you that at no point did the adult male come into contact with any other students at the high school today.

Because this is an ongoing criminal investigation, I cannot comment further at this time.

A potential serious situation was avoided today due to several of our students stepping forward with information and looking out for their fellow students. We are grateful for our students looking out for one another!

Thank you for your support of our students.

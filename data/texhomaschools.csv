Please congratulate them. It is very difficult to get up in front of a crowd and give a speech. I am extremely proud of this group, and I know we will represent at state. I want to thank my amazing hubby Ty McBride and Connie Miller for being my rocks, supporters, and encouragers. It's a great day to be a Red Devil!",2020-03-02 17:30:57,,

Dale Carnegie said, “There are always three speeches, for every one you actually gave. The one you practiced, the one you gave, and the one you wish you gave.” The only people who will wholeheartedly understand this quote are the people have had to give a speech. I am proud to say that 20 students from Texhoma High School understand this quote completely. My speech team has come such a long way since August. Some have accomplished something that they never imagined that they would. Speech is terrifying and exciting all at the same time. I am so proud of my team. Even though we only had two people qualify for regionals today, each student accomplished something huge! Congrats to Jarrett Burrow and Olivia Turcios for receiving 2nd place in Humorous Duet.

Thomas-Fay-Custer Schools cheerleaders volunteered at WFRC today. They swept and mopped the market, halls, and offices, they cleaned the bathrooms, hung up flyers, organized grocery bags, organized the office supply closet, and giggled the entire time. These girls served with gladness in their hearts and we enjoyed every minute of their gift of time. All the dirty work that these ladies did today is necessary to #FIGHTHUNGER and #FEEDHOPE.

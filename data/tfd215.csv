Today is a great day in the State of Illinois! Governor JB Pritzker signed into law Senate Bill 1970 aka the “Student Vote” bill. This comes after push back from school administrators during a “March to the Polls” in 2018. Students from T.F North and Thornton Fractional South High School rallied to pass the bill out of committee last year, and some were there to see it become law today.

Together we are breaking down a barrier that has long made it difficult for our young people to make their voices heard during elections. I hope this will excite students throughout the state and encourage them to take their civic duty as voters seriously.

I would like to thank my colleague in the House State Rep. Nicholas ""Nick"" Smith for helping to secure passage of the bill along with Thornton Fractional High School District 215 School Board Member LeeAnn Revis and Instructor Emily Biegel for educating and organizing such brilliant and talented students. #Serving17

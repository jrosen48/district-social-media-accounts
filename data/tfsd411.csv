""Today was rough. I think calling school for the year was the right thing...but I’m so sad about it. 4th quarter is my FAVORITE. It is so fun. It is the payoff for all your hard work...both for teachers and students. I have certain books I read them and traditions and activities we do. I cement my relationship and lifelong love for them. We bond. We had a whole quarter stolen from us. It’s not fair. ""

We all feel like we are missing out on something during this time and it is important to be understanding as everyone is coping with these emotions. Even though she was struggling, this teacher decided to jump in and support her students in different ways. She made this video of one of the books that made her feel better and is continuing to read books, chapter by chapter, through videos.",,,0.0,"Being away from students can be hard on teachers too! On this #MissYouMonday we want to share a post from a couple of weeks ago when the decision was made to close schools. The teacher said:

""Today was rough. I think calling school for the year was the right thing...but I’m so sad about it. 4th quarter is my FAVORITE. It is so fun. It is the payoff for all your hard work...both for teachers and students. I have certain books I read them and traditions and activities we do. I cement my relationship and lifelong love for them. We bond. We had a whole quarter stolen from us. It’s not fair. ""

We all feel like we are missing out on something during this time and it is important to be understanding as everyone is coping with these emotions.

Hey everybody,

While there is still some uncertainty about how next school year/marching season is going to look, we are going to plan to have everything as normal unless we are instructed otherwise. There will inevitably be some changes but the extent of those changes remains to be seen.

That being said, we will have:

-Leadership Camp- Monday July 20th

-8am-12pm

-Percussion and Color Guard camp July 20th-July 24th.

-7/20 2pm-6pm

-7/21-7/24 8am-2pm

-Full Band Camp-August 3rd-August 7th

-8am-4pm

Exact times may change

Also: Over the course of the summer, I would like to have small rehearsals periodically to start getting ready for camp and marching season.

During these rehearsals, we will spend as much time as possible outside and obey all social distancing and number restrictions.

I will post times here as well as through remind when those are set.

These rehearsals are not mandatory but will be a great time to see some fellow band members and start working towards next season.",0.0,"Thayer Bands

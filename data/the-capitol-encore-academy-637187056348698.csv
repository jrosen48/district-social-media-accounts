Thank you for helping us to create a successful start to virtual learning this week. Please continue to communicate with us to help guarantee that all students are connected and actively engaged in learning.

We are continuing to refine our practices, and a key component of that is parent feedback. We are preparing a parent survey that we will share at the end of next week in order to gauge what’s working well and what can be further refined.

Please make sure that you (or your student) are completing their daily attendance form by 8 AM. This form is our most efficient and accurate method for monitoring student attendance for accountability purposes.

Have a wonderful weekend!

Sincerely,
Gerard Falls

Today, on this 50th anniversary of Earth Day the Lorax’s message is even more relevant. Dr. Seuss’s beloved story teaches all of us to speak up and make a difference. The Lorax tells the story, in a playful and hopeful way, of the beautiful Truffula Trees and the danger of taking our earth for granted.

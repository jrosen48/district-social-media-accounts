Thank you so much for the very generous gift of water bottles for our students to use at school. As a safety measure we shut off our hallway water fountains and students have a water bottle we fill up throughout the school day. We are two weeks into the school year and this has worked well because of your donation to us.

Wendell Elementary sure appreciates working with you, a local business. Our students know you gave them this water and together we are making a safe school for Wendell students to attend.

Leap into Kindergarten!!
Kindergarten is going to look a little different this year. The 1st week of school, August 24th-27th each Kindergartener will only come to school for one day. This will give the Kindergarten teachers a chance to get to know each child, introduce them to the school, and be able to do their screener. The Kindergarten teachers will work together and have every child placed into their classroom by Friday the 28th. Each parent will be notified by that day what teacher they will have for the school year. Then on August 31st Kindergarteners will begin with a regular schedule.

I wanted to inform you last week the school board adopted the attached school and activity guidelines for reopening our buildings in August. I'd highly suggest you read through them.

Our administration, supervisors, and WEA are meeting next week to finalize/discuss details of the guidelines. We are ALL excited to have our children back in our schools!

We have purchased masks and face shields for all staff. We will provide hand sanitizer throughout all facilities. Our custodians will continue to deep clean and disinfect the buildings. Safety will be a priority!

Thanks for all you do. WE ARE GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC TOGETHER. We are Wendell ""tuff"" and it's going to be a great year! Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Estudiantes y padres -
El personal de WHS trabajará toda esta semana en preparación para el aprendizaje remoto y distante que comenzará oficialmente el lunes 6 de abril. Sin embargo, este jueves los maestros de TAG de sus estudiantes llamarán a casa para hacer algunas preguntas de una encuesta. Las respuestas a estas preguntas son cruciales para darnos una mejor comprensión de cómo apoyarlo a usted y a su familia durante el cierre de la escuela por el COVID-19.

¿Qué se puede hacer mientras tanto? Asegúrese de que la computadora portátil de sus estudiantes esté en funcionamiento y lista para ir entrar a Google Classroom, que será nuestra principal plataforma educativa. ¿No tienes internet? Por favor, avísele al maestro de TAG el jueves y tendremos otro plan para apoyar a todos.

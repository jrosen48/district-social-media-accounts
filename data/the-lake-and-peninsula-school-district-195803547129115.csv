‚ÄúHello, I am Audrey O‚ÄôDomin from Perryville, Alaska born and raised, currently married with 3 kids. I am a Lake and Peninsula School District graduate class of 2003 from our districts southern most school. I am the preschool teacher and have been for Perryville School since 2005. I honestly love my job, my 2nd group that I‚Äôve taught are going to graduate next year. Right now, I have taught everyone attending school except for one. I chose LPSD because it gave me the opportunity to work in my village and I haven‚Äôt looked back since (aside from a phone call from our then principal Adam who decided to call me up and pack my bags that I was off to King Salmon in a couple days for training lol). My family is semi subsistence lifestyle so we are outdoors a lot. I am also working on revitalizing our language with help from elders within our village I have so far taught my kids how to count to ten and along with some simple words and phrases as well.‚Äù‚Å£

‚ÄúHello, I am Audrey O‚ÄôDomin from Perryville, Alaska born and raised, currently married with 3 kids. I am a Lake and Peninsula School District graduate class of 2003 from our districts southern most school. I am the preschool teacher and have been for Perryville School since 2005. I honestly love my job, my 2nd group that I‚Äôve taught are going to graduate next year. Right now, I have taught everyone attending school except for one. I chose LPSD because it gave me the opportunity to work in my village and I haven‚Äôt looked back since (aside from a phone call from our then principal Adam who decided to call me up and pack my bags that I was off to King Salmon in a couple days for training lol). My family is semi subsistence lifestyle so we are outdoors a lot. I am also working on revitalizing our language with help from elders within our village I have so far taught my kids how to count to ten and along with some simple words and phrases as well.‚Äù‚Å£

I planned on working in LPSD ever since I decided to go into education. My family had been in different locales in Alaska and I knew that LPSD was the best fit for me. The relationships that are developed among our school staffs are the kind that last well beyond work. Teachers working in small communities are able to reach out to others across the district for help and support. The administration works hard to make opportunities happen for staff so that not only are professional needs met but they also help teachers be successful community members. They realize that teachers have personal lives. Being a teacher in bush Alaska can be difficult, but our district assists in tackling the problems that we face so we can focus on the reason we're really here. ‚Å£",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2813328648709912&id=195803547129115,,0.0,"Ms. Hannah Ward!‚Å£

Mr. Nate McArthur!‚Å£
‚Å£
‚ÄúI have been working with LPSD since 2017. I got my Master's Degree in 2019 through an internship program with a district principal and UAS. I have supported district programs focusing on student success and involvement. ‚Å£
‚Å£
Why I Stay with LPSD - I stay with LPSD for the trusting freedom, continuous support, and unique experiences I have here. Teaching a classroom of just five students and getting to teach them every subject creates an authentic learning environment that I haven't witnessed before. The staff, though hundreds of miles away, are always there for you and offering support and ideas to improve. ‚Å£
‚Å£
Words of advice - In any new position, there is a learning curve. Seek training and guidance to steepen that curve; the quicker we can excel as teachers in this unique environment, the faster our students can excel as well. Keep your focus on what's best for students, your communities, and enjoying this beautiful countryside.‚Äù‚Å£

I've worked at Nondalton (almost 1 year), Chignik Lake (5+ years), Pilot Point (1 year), and now here in Perryville. I've visited a lot of sites while traveling as a coach, such as Newhalen, Port Alsworth, Kokhanok, Chignik Lagoon, and Egegik. I've never made it further than the flight line, but I've stopped in at Port Heiden, Chignik Bay, and Levelock. The only place I've never visited, even for just a touch down, is Igiugig. ‚Å£
‚Å£
This district is a great place to work - great kids and colleagues. I like the community spirit here, both in every village I've worked in, and within the LPSD community at large. That's what keeps me coming back year after year. ‚Å£
‚Å£
We may be spread out, but we are (as we say in Perryville) ""Better Together‚Äù‚Å£

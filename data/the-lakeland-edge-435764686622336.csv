WOW it's cold! I am lucky to have a warm home and plenty of food to eat. There are others that are not so lucky. Here's something you can do while you are stuck inside today: go through your drawers and closets and clean out the clothes that don't fit. Clean out your old toys that you don't play with. The items that are still in good condition could be donated to the Lagrange County Food & Clothes basket to help others!

Oh, you better let your parents approve your donations! I don't want anyone getting in trouble!

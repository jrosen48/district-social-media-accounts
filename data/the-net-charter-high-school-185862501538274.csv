Louisiana is reopening the Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer (P-EBT) program for families who did not apply in May and June. Families of children who receive free or reduced-price school meals may be eligible to receive financial benefits for meals missed in 2019-2020 when schools closed due to the pandemic. Apply from September 8 at 8 a.m. to September 29 at 5 p.m. These one-time benefits total $285 per child of families who were eligible for free and reduced-price meals during the entire closure last spring. Parents who started receiving free and reduced-price school meals in May will receive $91.20 per eligible child. The online application is simple. The information submitted must exactly match the information on file with the school system in order for the application to successfully submit. #louisianabelieves

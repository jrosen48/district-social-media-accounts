You can help students be ready for testing by encouraging them to get plenty of sleep the night before. We want to remind you that breakfast is available for students in school. If students are feeling anxious, you can reassure them that the assessment gives them an opportunity to demonstrate their learning and helps teachers plan the best possible instruction for them.

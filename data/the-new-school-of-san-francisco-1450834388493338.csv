The New School of San Francisco is a first of its kind public school working to bring inquiry-based teaching to all children -- regardless of their background. Now in our 4th year, we serve 240 children from all corners of San Francisco. And as a laboratory school with a partnership with the Exploratorium's Institute for Inquiry, we are sharing our tools broadly to impact children and educators around the world.

We believe that education is our most powerful tool to change the world. Through inquiry and social justice, children develop the problem solving skills to be the change-makers of tomorrow.

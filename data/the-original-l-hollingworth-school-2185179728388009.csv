Hollingworth School!

My name is Danielle Robertson and I am a licensed therapist through Linking Families Therapy Group located at your school. I know many of our students are worried regarding the events of COVID-19 so I wanted to share that I am readily available to you and your family during this crisis in-person AND via telehealth. What's telehealth, you ask? It's a web-based form of counseling in which you can use your phone, tablet, or computer to engage in face-to-face interaction with your therapist or doctor. If you're interested in getting started, please check out my profile on Psychology Today ( https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/danielle-nicole-robertson-toledo-oh/484226 ) to learn more about me and the services I provide. We can discuss how to get things started via phone call. Stay healthy!

We have had a few people wanting to cheer the band on, as they leave for Denton on Saturday morning. It has been decided that individuals are going to meet at the pocket park (corner of Walker and North Breckenridge Ave) to cheer the band on, as they come through. We will be leaving the band hall as close to 8:30 AM as possible. The Fire dept and/or police dept will be escorting the busses on our way out. You have no idea just how much it would mean to these students to have some ""fans"" cheering them on. If you can spare a few minutes on Saturday morning, we would appreciate your support.

Jose was chosen because of his great work ethic and positive attitude. He is a wonderful asset to The Pride of Breckenridge Marching Band! Fun fact: The Marching Band is nothing new to Jose's family. He has a sister who graduated in 2018 and played the bass clarinet. At the present, Jose has two sisters in the BHS band. One is a Senior and plays the Vibraphone and the other is a Sophomore and plays the clarinet. He also has a sister in the BJHS Band. She plays the saxophone. The tradition will continue!❤

I got some really good shots of the band tonight. We took a great group photo, which will be in the football program. I'll add it to this page after the first football game. Some of the other photos I took tonight will be added along the way. There will be a weekly featured individual(s). This week's main feature will be our amazing Band Directors! Check back tomorrow night for that. Next week will feature our awesome Drum Majors. Then, I'll cover our wonderful Color Guard. When the football games get started, our featured person of the week will be the ""Marcher of the Week"". There is a lot of fun stuff coming up throughout the next few months!

For now, here are just a few photos that the kids asked me to take tonight. I will be trying to get different students and sections each time I am at practice.

Today is Shakespeare's estimated birthday (as the first and only documentation of his birth is his baptism on April 26, 1564) and also his death day seeing as he died on April 23, 1616. Cheers to 456 years!
Also, big shout out to our seniors being honored these next few days. I know that this is a tough time for you as you're missing out on your senior year. Just know that we miss you, love you, and support you during this time. Once a Whippet, always a Whippet! üß°

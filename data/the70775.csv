Part of our new normal will mean wearing a mask or face-covering in public. Wearing a mask in public is just like holding a door open for someone, it's being kind and courteous, and it will be critical to Louisiana moving forward.

When I say mask, I mean wearing some sort of cloth facial covering. We've seen creative folks make masks out of t-shirts or other household materials, and I am encouraging everyone to begin the process now to start getting them for yourselves and your families.

Take this time to make sure you and everyone in your family has a face covering, you can buy or make masks. Remember, unless you are a healthcare worker, you do not need to wear or purchase N95 or surgical masks. #lagov #MaskUpLa",0.0,"Governor John Bel Edwards

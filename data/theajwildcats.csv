This Wildcat Wednesday we're glad to take the opportunity to recognize Zach Stokes with a gift card to Sonic because he's clearly a reason we're #AJProud

To further honor him and his random act of kindness, we'd like to hear from you. In the comments, please nominate someone to win a $10 Hebrewz gift card.

Two teens must learn the “art of killing” in this Printz Honor–winning book, the first in a chilling new series from Neal Shusterman, author of the New York Times bestselling Unwind dystology.

A world with no hunger, no disease, no war, no misery: humanity has conquered all those things, and has even conquered death. Now Scythes are the only ones who can end life—and they are commanded to do so, in order to keep the size of the population under control.

Citra and Rowan are chosen to apprentice to a scythe—a role that neither wants. These teens must master the “art” of taking life, knowing that the consequence of failure could mean losing their own.

Scythe is the first novel of a thrilling new series by National Book Award–winning author Neal Shusterman in which Citra and Rowan learn that a perfect world comes only with a heavy price.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=523985948152375&id=179232635961043,,0.0,"Join the A-J book club on December 5 for a discussion about the current book choice--Scythe by Neal Shusterman.

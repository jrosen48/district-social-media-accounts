Homecoming mums were first given in the early 1930's at high school homecoming football games across Texas and soon became part of Texas Football history. Boys offered real chrysanthemum flowers to their dates in the form of a corsage.

The simple look of the first mums have changed but the tradition continues. This week in Hillsboro every flower shop is working from opening until closing time to create unique mums to be worn during Homecoming this year.

These mums were photographed at It Can Be Arranged by Gary Evans at 115 East Franklin street. He shared that the new trend is that seniors wear silver mums! Most of the mums are still traditional but continue to get bigger each year and some mums now are made with several colors instead of the traditional school colors!

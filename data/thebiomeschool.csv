In partnership with EdHub STL, today we host our Chinese language and culture class for students and teachers from The Biome School! Kids learnt some fun facts about China, and the panda! They learnt how to say and write numbers in Chinese. They played puzzle games and did kung fu with us! It was so much fun to see the connections and interactions between our teachers in Tianjin, China and the 45 lovely elementary students in St. Louis, US. We hope to see them next time! #nihaochinese #edhubstl #chinese #edtech #chineseisfun #dualinstructor",2019-06-10 09:44:16,,

This is EdHub STL.

Kids from the The Biome School, a public school in STL, are hanging out at Innovation Hall STL, learning Mandarin through an instructor based in China who is teaching through video chat!

It's super creative --educators have the best ideas!

Love seeing kids in the Cortex Innovation Community.

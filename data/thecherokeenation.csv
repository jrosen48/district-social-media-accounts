Cherokee language is something that must preserved. In this 2015 video, hear a conversation between the late fluent Cherokee speaker Durbin Feeling and Cherokee language student Patrick Rochford, spoken completely in the Cherokee language.

The video is brought to you by Cherokee Nation Translation Department as part of an Oral History Grant Project. This project featured students from the Cherokee Nation Immersion School and the Cherokee Degree Program at Northeastern State University having conversations with elders speaking only in Cherokee.

We hope you enjoy listening to Cherokee conversations as much as we do! Wado!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3116985911760499&id=114167895375664,"YOUTUBE.COM

The Maryland and DC school closures have posed unique problems for our students. Many of our students lack devices and Internet connectivity to access online learning while their schools are closed. The Children’s Guild Alliance is committed in this crucial time to give our students the needed resources to continue their education. Help us purchase 1,500 Chromebooks in the next two weeks. $250 puts a Chromebook in a child’s hands and $50 buys a WiFi hotspot for a family without Internet. $5,000 buys a classroom set of Chromebooks for students. Support our kids and donate today: https://kidsfirstamerica.org/chromebooks/",2020-04-07 16:07:43,,

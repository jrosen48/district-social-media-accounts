We hope you all are continuing to stay healthy and strong as we continue to fight against the COVID-19 virus. TDA‚Äôs Board has approved our Return to School Plan. As such, students will be learning five days a week, whether in school or at home. Because MI is in Phase 4, we are offering 2 options: (1) Home supervised Remote Learning, where students will be online with their teachers from home OR (2) School Supervised Remote Learning where students will be online with their teachers from the school building. Option 2 is ONLY available for PK-5 students whose parents/guardians are working and their children need a safe space to learn. Option 2 is 1st come, 1st serve. For Middle School, it will be on a case by case basis. Please see the link below that will take you to The Dearborn Academy 2020-2021 Student Learning Options survey.

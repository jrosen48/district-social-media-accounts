We are very bummed that we could not have the kids in today. We were all looking forward to a new year and to get a great start.

The decision to delay the start was made due to the uncertainty that we have right now.

As of right now, we have two staff members that were considered in contact with the positive case. Both are quarantining and both have been tested (awaiting results).

If both are negative, we should be ready to roll on Monday with the 7-12 students.

If one, or both, are positive, we may need to make further adjustments to our starting plans. If either test positive, there is a chance more of our staff (and maybe some students) will need to quarantine.

While we do not want to cause any panic, we wanted to keep everyone as informed as possible. We WILL get the kids back into the building, but don’t feel it is best until there is less uncertainty in the risk of bringing them back.

Hopefully we will get through this relatively quick and can get the kids in the building as soon as possible.

Students that don’t wear masks run the risk of having to quarantine due to a classmate/staff member testing positive.

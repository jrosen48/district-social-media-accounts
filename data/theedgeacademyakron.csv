If you are a parent who has requested transportation we have our independent contract finalized with Petermann busing to start this Monday. If your child is a bus rider they will receive a yellow card with the bus number, stop and pick up time. We have not received the drop off time for bus riders because those times may vary the first few days. Those of you who get alternative transportation through the independent van service will receive a phone call or text message with your new pick up time.

Please remember the students with yellow bus cards will start riding the bus Monday morning.

Thanks you,

I know that this is not the end of the school year that we all expected. It has been a long and stressful last quarter of school. This end of year has brought lots of challenges to both the staff and you as a parent helping your child remain engaged with their schooling at home.

I know many of you are anxious to see what next school year is going to look like. At this point I don’t have a lot of answer for you. What I will tell you is that the administrative staff, board of directors, the co-founders, and myself will be working all summer to ensure that when your child(ren) returns to school they are safe. Your child’s safety is our number one concern and always will be. We will continue to update you of our 2020-2021 school year plans on our website and other social media outlets.

We are also working on a way to possibly have a virtual graduation for our 8th graders so that we can find a safe way to acknowledge their achievements.

Every year the staff at The Edge Academy and Akros MIddle School donates $20 to be able to wear jeans on Fridays during the school year. The staff picks a charity to donate the money to that is making a difference in the community of Akron. This year the staff decided to donate the funds collected, to Christ Child Charities of Akron. Each year Christ Child Charities of Akron help our families by donating uniforms to students in need. Christ Child provides uniform pants, shirts, and often winter coats to over 15 families each year. The staff collected a total of $700 and the funds raised were matched by Dave Dudas the co-founder of The Edge Academy and Akros Middle School for a total donation of $1,400.

Spring Picture Retake day will be Thursday, May 10th! We are changing this up a little this year. If you missed the original date, you will be able to get your child's picture done on May 10th. The only catch is, you won't be able to get a retake due to timelines. However, Murphy's Photography is AMAZING and work very hard to get the best pic possible!

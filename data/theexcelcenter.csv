Ana Gonzalez not only graduated from The Excel Center Goodwill's Adult High School, but she found she had a passion helping others reach their goal of earning a high school diploma and took a job at The Excel Center after graduation. Pictured with Ana is her Goodwill Guide, Chris. Goodwill Guides act as life coaches and help students overcome their barriers to education. We're so thankful for the perseverance of our students and the Goodwill Guides' willingness to go the extra mile.

Grant has been a Falcon since Kindergarten. He has been involved in multiple sports, but baseball is his passion. He is a 3-year letterman (so far!) and still holding out hope for a shortened senior season. He is also a member of National Honor Society and an Academic Letterman. Without a doubt, his favorite high school memory is being a part of the undefeated 2018 baseball season and helping Firelands win their first District baseball championship! He was also excited to earn 1st team All Conference and 1st team All District baseball recognition in the 2019 season.

Grant will be attending Clarkson University in upstate New York this Fall to study Mechanical Engineering and play baseball. He loves the beautiful campus with lots of surrounding room to hunt and fish!

Proud parents – Chris and Shelley Price

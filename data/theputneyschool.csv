In his piece on observing the night sky (“Eyes on the Sky,” p. 10), Glenn Littledale ’76 writes, “A piece of pipe can look like a rectangle when viewed from one direction, or a ring when viewed from another.” Reading this, I was reminded that our perception of the world around us always, inevitably depends on two factors: where we stand in relation to what we observe, and the lens—borne out of our life experience—through which we look. What happens when that perception is challenged? What happens when someone takes our shoulders, shifts our position just slightly, and suddenly we see a cylinder instead of a rectangle? It was there all along. How had I not seen it? Sally Munger Mann ’69, on page 6, writes powerfully about this moment, her awakening under the teaching of Jeffrey Campbell during her time at Putney. Working, living, and learning at Putney is an exercise in constantly shifting one’s position.

Hello LMS Families,

November 25th & 26th are regular school days, we encourage you to send your child/children those days for engaging and interactive lessons.
When your child/children miss school they miss important instruction. We want students here everyday to learn all that they can learn in order to be all that they can be!

We wish you and your family a Happy Thanksgiving! Be safe!

Hello LMS Families,

November 25th & 26th are regular school days, we encourage you to send your child/children those days for engaging and interactive lessons.
When your child/children miss school they miss important instruction. We want students here everyday to learn all that they can learn in order to be all that they can be!

We wish you and your family a Happy Thanksgiving! Be safe!

Mrs. Evans, Principal",2019-11-20 10:48:18,,

I was honored to be on hand this past weekend at Lancaster County High School as the guest speaker for their graduation ceremony. Seeing four years of dedication and hard work of so many young people realized that day was incredible.

One of the things I told them was to make a difference in their communities. To try and to make mistakes, glorious mistakes. From those mistakes, they will learn and become better.

The goal of every high school should be the “Three E’s:” enrollment, employment, and enlistment. One of my top priorities is ensuring that our students are connected to the resources they need to realize those goals.",0.0,"Rep. Rob Wittman

This apron is 1 of 20 given, out of over 20,000 applicants. It represents courage, passion, ambition, and most importantly, a memorial to my brother Chris, who passed away before we could audition together... After I had given up cooking for over a year and a half, I talked myself out of the audition, and not-so-coincidentally, my audition date landed exactly on my brother’s birthday. This apron is a symbol that you should NEVER permanently give up, and ALWAYS follow your dreams, no matter how scary or crazy—no matter how the odds are stacked against you. The opportunities that scare you the most have the biggest rewards. MasterChef is a small stepping stone to a gargantuan lesson that I had forgotten under the perils of life’s hardships. I will never forget this moment, and what it gave back to me ❤️ Thank you so much @gordongram @chef_aaronsanchez and @jbastianich for being 3 “Yes’s” in a world rampant with “No’s.”

In addition to an interest in golf, the Foundation’s selection committee also considered academic achievement, outside activities including community service, as well as an essay outlining the influence of golf on the applicant’s life.

Funding for scholarships is generated primarily through the sale of the VSGA VIP Golf Card. Since being launched in 1984, the program has awarded nearly $2.4 million and benefited more than 1,000 students.

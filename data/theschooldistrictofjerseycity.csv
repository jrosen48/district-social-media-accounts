This was his first visit anywhere other than to the doctor and Rutgers. He was so moved by his experience in JC, he devoted an entire chapter of his book to his visit at our school. Shortly after, CBS sports television came to our school to interview me and some of our students. Our interviews appeared on tv and at the RU football stadium for years.

Thank you to Mr. Wally Marte, LHS Physical Education/Health teacher and Volleyball Coach for this sweatshirt. This pandemic has almost cancelled all spring sports. This sweatshirt represents the past two seasons where Lincoln has been public school champs. This also would have been Mr. Marte’s last season coaching volleyball. We have to do something special when we get back to school. We miss school.🦁💙🦁💙

Beginning Wednesday, April 15 the Shawnee Mission School District (SMSD) Pickup and Go Meal sites will distribute breakfast and lunch on Mondays and Wednesdays. There will be no meal distribution on Thursday, April 16 or Friday, April 17.

This means after April 15 families will be picking up:

On Monday- two days of breakfast and lunch meals

On Wednesday- three days of breakfast and lunch meals

This change in service allows families and community members less human interaction, providing an additional measure of support in following current Stay at Home Orders, and limiting travel in the community.

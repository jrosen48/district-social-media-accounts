The shutdown of schools due to COVID-19 has affected us all in countless ways. Our department has suffered a loss of our annual High School Theatre Festival and the loss of our spring musical, and our fellow Warriors have had to suffer with the cancellation of sports games, tournaments, prom and so many more events that we were looking forward to. We wanted to provide perspective for our Troy Community who we value and miss. Here’s what Theatre Ensemble is up to.

Troy High School NJROTC was honored to host the return visit of CDR Lara Bollinger, USN, a 1998 graduate of Troy High School and one of the original members of the Troy High School NJROTC program. After high school, CDR Bollinger attended the University of San Diego, where she was commissioned through the NROTC program. CDR Bollinger currently served as the Public Affairs Officer for the Commander, Navy Recruiting Command in Memphis, TN. She engaged the Cadets in discussions ranging from Troy teachers and class work to Navy adventures and opportunities. Her visit was a success, as several cadets have now expressed an interest in serving our nation. @troyhighnjrotc #thetroydifference",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2387559314819118&id=1498857217022670,,0.0,"Repost: Troy High NJROTC

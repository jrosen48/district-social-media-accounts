We wanted to share some quick tips to make sure that the students who are participating in this week's Junior Olympics are safe, healthy, and perform to the best of their ability.

First, sleep is important so please make sure they get plenty of rest.

Second – nutrition is key - eat a healthy and hearty breakfast.

Third – it’s going to be warm, so drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration. Bring sunscreen and more water to beat the heat.

The event starts at 9am on both days at Silverado High School in Victorville and you are all invited to cheer on the kids.

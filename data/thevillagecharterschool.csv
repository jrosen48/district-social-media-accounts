Recently the State of Idaho received notification of a state wide bomb threat targeted at schools and
airports. The threat was not specific to any schools or locations. We deemed that the threat was not
credible to our school, but always find it best to err on the side of caution. Our first step was for
school administration to complete a perimeter check, which was done upon our becoming aware of
the stated threat, and all school areas were found to be secure. Next we have notified all staff to
practice additional vigilance in and around the campus and to notify administration immediately if
there are any questionable factors observed during the current day and going forward this week.
That said, presently we can state all classrooms and the general campus are safe. As always the
safety of students and staff are on the forefront of our minds and appreciate your support. If you still
have any questions, please contact our school administration directly.

there are any questionable factors observed during the current day and going forward this week.
That said, presently we can state all classrooms and the general campus are safe. As always the
safety of students and staff are on the forefront of our minds and appreciate your support. If you still
have any questions, please contact our school administration directly.
Thank you,
Tony Richard

We want to take a minute to say a huge thank you to all the amazing things our PTO has accomplished this year. Thank you for the endless hours of packing and moving over the summer. For all the amazing events that created another year of fabulous memories. And most of all thank you for your support of our staff and families to make our school community one of the best.

Dear Patrons,

As tomorrow is our TVCS Carnival, no parking will be permitted on school grounds after 1:00 p.m. on Thursday, May 17, 2018. We regret any inconvenience this may cause you; however we need the school parking lot for our carnival booths. If you need to park, please use the parking area that was originally part of the Marie Calendar Restaurant. The section is located directly behind the school. You can also park in the Winco Parking Lot, just be sure to make a small purchase in their store if you use their parking spaces.

As for the end of the day pick up, we will be running the student pick up as we have been doing, so nothing will change in the process. Anyone arriving after 4:30 p.m. will have to park and walk in to pick up their child, as the entire parking area and drive thru loop will be closed to traffic.

We hope to see you at the carnival, as it is a lot of fun for the entire school.

Best regards,

Tony Richard

There is no school for Kindergarten on the 26th; all other grades have school. Goal Setting Conferences were originally scheduled for the 13th of October, however, due to popular demand for a formal Parent Teacher Conference without students present and our Ribbon Cutting event in such close proximity, we decided to postpone Goal Setting Conferences until later in the year. You will be receiving an online sign-up form via email shortly from your student's teacher. Thank you for your flexibility and we look forward to seeing you then!

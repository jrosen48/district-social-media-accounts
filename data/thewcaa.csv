Your Abney Scholar's first Kids Read Now book is on it's way, if not delivered already! We are very excited about your student's participation in this program and can't wait to hear about all the books they are reading.

Included in your first mailing should be a Parent Guide on how the program works. It's as simple as Read, Report, and Repeat!

Also, keep an eye out for information about a virtual Family Book Event with Kids Read Now coming soon.

Happy Reading! 📚

Prior to the closing of school, all 1st through 6th grade Abney students were given a March is Reading Month Reading Tracker. Students were to read each day and record their reading on the tracker to earn tickets to a Whitecaps game!

When the Whitecaps season is able to begin, students have the opportunity to redeem two tickets to a game with the completion of their Reading Tracker! You can redeem tickets to any game during the 2020 baseball season. Redeeming tickets can be done online, by mail, or in person at the Whitecaps ticket office when normal hours resume.

Please visit the West Michigan Whitecaps website for more information.

Monday night, Governor Whitmer decreased the School Aid Budget by eliminating the $240 per student increase for all charter schools, yet traditional public schools will still receive the funding increase as originally proposed.

As members of the William C. Abney family, I would imagine that you are in favor of charter public schools receiving the same funding as traditional public schools.

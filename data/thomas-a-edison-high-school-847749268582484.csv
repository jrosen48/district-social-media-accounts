You and Your Child’s Safety Depends on It!

Safety on our school campuses is a shared responsibility; especially when it comes to vehicle safety. We continue to address traffic issues on campus during student drop-off and dismissal times. In monitoring cameras and listening to the feedback from our staff trying to assist, that are often treated with disregard or sometimes even disrespect, we continue to see vehicles that ignore traffic signage on campus. Vehicle operators are placing students at risk.
Our campuses are very congested, and we have limited options for traffic patterns, due to the physical constraints which are a reality. We respect the fact that parents have busy lives and want to expedite your child’s drop-off or
pick-up from school. However, preventing an accident or tragedy on campus, and maneuvering in a safe and controlled manner, should far outweigh the desire to beat the clock. A few extra minutes each day, and exercising patience, may make a life-long difference to you or your loved one!

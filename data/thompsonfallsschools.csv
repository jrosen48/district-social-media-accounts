Class of 2020… we blinked and you started Kindergarten, we blinked again and you are graduating High School. We sought to give you roots and wings. Our hope is, that both are strong enough to help you realize your dreams and help you make a difference in this world. The world truly is your oyster, but only with a bit of grit, will you end up with that pearl. You will make mistakes, but they do not define who you are, unless you let them. They are just experiences to learn from. Life doesn't come with a road map, don't be afraid to ask for guidance. Remember the past and learn from it. Live in the present and be present for those you're with. Electronic gadgetry will never fill the void that was meant for human connections. Look to the future, it's one big adventure that someday you'll look back on. How you live it, day by day, will determine whether you look back with smiles and laughter, or with regret. This really is the beginning of the rest of your life. Wishing you all the very best!!",0.0,"Diane Hedahl is with Gracie Claridge.

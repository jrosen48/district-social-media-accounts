The Thompson Education Foundation’s Help Kids Succeed Supply Drive program provides the backpacks to students in the district whose families are in need. This year organizers added water bottles because students cannot drink from fountains at school as a precaution against COVID-19. They also added a take home bag of supplies in case kids end up learning from home. Once the backpacks are delivered to the schools, they will sit for one week before they can be given to students, for public health reasons. The earliest that families will be able to access the bags of supplies is Aug. 3, organizers said. Parents should check with their child’s school for a pickup date.

Episode 1: TikTok’s Allure and How Two Teens Cut Back
Time on TikTok has been skyrocketing. Why is it attracting such huge numbers of teens? What positives can happen on the app, and what are some of the risks? The sheer amount of time it consumes is what most young people say is TikTok’s biggest downside. On today’s show, Dr. Delaney Ruston speaks with two teenagers, Marie and Manisha, who answer these questions and others. Delaney puts on her metaphorical doctor’s coat when both girls share that they want to change their behavior on TikTok. Delaney helps them decide a plan of action, and then we flash forward to hear how they did with their goals.

Grade: 2

We would like to commend Anne Messerli, our son’s second grade teacher from Big Thompson Elementary. We were fortunate to have her for first grade as well as second, and feel incredibly grateful. In normal circumstances she is a wonderful educator, but with the changes brought on from Covid-19, she continues to bring the classroom together. She is the heart of the class, and because of her dedication, the class is able to still be a unit and enjoy learning as a team with morning calls. The smiles and joy she brings to each of her students every morning is irreplaceable.

Miss JoAnn has been a teacher of my 3 kids. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to her for preparing my kids for a lifetime of success. She is the best early-childhood education teacher I've ever known! I'm so grateful for her patience, enthusiasm, and passion. I really appreciate her work. And how she cares about her kids , she is always there for them and I am more thankful because with all of this happening she takes the time to call her students. FaceTime them and asking how they are doing!

The district Prom committee has been dedicated to providing an experience for our community to honor the class of 2020. We want to ensure students have the opportunity to participate in something, but understand the experience of Prom will never be replaced.

Understanding that, we will be holding a Spirit Week where Juniors and Seniors are able to win prizes from the Prom-A-Rama committee when they tag #MORPTSD and their school (i.e. #MORPLHS). The most exciting post will be chosen by each school's administration team on a daily basis.

While many of us have the privilege to self-quarantine and try to stay healthy, many of our healthcare workers in our community do not have that privilege. They are true heroes! We’d love to honor these individuals in our community and say thank you.

Please pass on your messages of what it means to be a hero, or any other messages you’d like to tell our doctors, nurses and other health care workers. This could be a letter, short story, poem, or quick video sharing your appreciation for these individuals. Maybe you’d like to draw a picture of our healthcare workers as heroes, or include your ideas on what a hero truly is.

While schools are closed, first responders, healthcare workers and others providing critical services to Larimer County during the COVID-19 pandemic cannot choose between going to work and staying home with their families. Their service keeps us all safe and healthy, so we have stepped up to give them a place to send their kids while they fight on the frontlines of this pandemic. With tremendous support from the Larimer County Health Department, Banner Health and many other community partners, we are operating two sites for youth ages 5-13 whose parents or guardians are first responders, healthcare workers and others providing critical services—one in Loveland, one in Fort Collins. We are following all official guidelines, including proper sanitizing and social distancing. To keep everyone safe and healthy, these sites are ONLY for the kids of first responders, healthcare professionals and others providing critical services.

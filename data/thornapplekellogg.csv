FACE MASK DRIVE FOR TK SCHOOLS

While our administration is hard at work developing their plans for the 2020 - 2021 school year, they've already communicated that plans for in-person learning will require safety protocols which will include the wearing of facial coverings (requirements will vary by grade).

Because of the importance of masks and the need for students to wear them, I've started a Mask Drive to collect new, reusable masks for TK's K - 12 students. Adult and kid size masks are needed. Masks can be purchased or homemade.

A drop box is available at Left Field Café On Main for your donations. All masks collected will be delivered to school admin to distribute as needed. Thank you for your support.

In the upcoming weeks we will be making videos and “shouting out” some high school seniors who are awaiting to go to Navy boot camp. These future Sailors are going to have a little culture shock pretty soon so we want to give them words of encouragement and let them know they are not alone!

If you have any changes to request please email Mrs. Laurence and she will do her best to get back to you early next week.

When I was in seventh grade, my older sister, Kylie, was a freshman. Her friends encouraged her to join FCCLA so she could be a part of their Parliamentary Procedure team, and that very first year, she and her team made it to nationals. They flew out to San Diego that summer, and I thought that was the coolest thing in the world, to fly out of the state with a group of my friends. Naturally, when I was a freshman, I joined FCCLA and got a few of my friends together. We formed our own Parliamentary Procedure team and with the help of my sister‚Äôs team and though our own hard word and dedication, we made it to nationals and flew out to Atlanta.

The FCS class, child guidance, showed me that being a teacher means that you are responsible for developing the students learning skills. It helped me find creative ways to teach new material to the students and make sure everyone understands it. Being in a classroom showed me that a teacher has to be a person who can handle all types of personalities, and it taught me how to discipline a child so they can know right from wrong. Child guidance prepared me to be more understanding, patient, attentive, considerate of students needs, helpful, a leader, caring and creative to help children learn and be successful. #myfcclafuture #fcclaweek - Megan Sumbillo",0.0,"Celebrating FCCLA Week!

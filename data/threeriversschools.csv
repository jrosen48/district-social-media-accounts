The golf outing is just 12 days away! If you have not registered do so ASAP. If you are already registered make sure we have everyone's name, who wants steak or chicken and if you will be playing in the top flight division or amateur division. If you are going to be a sponsor or donate a raffle basket please get these items to Coach Ryan, Coach Miller or Coach Holland by early next week. If you would like to volunteer to help also let us know. It is going to be a great time! Hope to see everyone there!!",0.0,"Taylor Wrestling

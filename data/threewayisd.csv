Student drop-off will be located in front of the flag pole next to the admin office. Students can then enter the cafeteria/gym for morning breakfast and assembly. Three Way ISD asks that you enter the school via CR 207 through the chain link gate located next to the white house. You will then exit through the pipe fence gate located directly in front of the school.

For student pickup at the end of the day, we ask that you enter the school in the same way, forming a line that begins directly in front of the admin office. Please remain in your vehicle moving up in the line as staff places children with the appropriate parent/guardian vehicle.

Our plane projects are fun and engaging - students have taken ownership and are passionate about what they have built. Building the planes, our students have learned how-to:

+ Read engineering drawings.
+ Identify different types of wood and their applications.
+ Understand different adhesives and applications.
+ Use different tools: saws, calipers, sander, grinder, drills.
+ Measure angle relationships: polyhedral and dihedral angles.
+ Install equipment: electric motors, servos, control rods & control horns.
+ Solder & build wiring harnesses.
+ Program radio transmitter: adjust sub trim, servo reversing, travel adjustment.
+ Calculate longitudinal stability and aerodynamic chord.
+ Measure electric motor power output in watts.
+ Apply heat shrink covering to the aircraft structures.

+ TEAMWORK - working together and everyone doing the part.
+ PERSISTENCE - never giving up.
+ FAITH - faith in engineering principles.
+ GRIT - digging down deep and pushing forward.

....& CONFLICT RESOLUTION.

WE ARE PROUD OF OUR STUDENTS!!!

Shout out to our amazing students at TWISD!

Our students made Valentine’s days cards for the residents of Oakwood assisted living. Our JH Student Council went and delivered them today.

They were well behaved, were respectful and put a smile on the resident’s faces. The students loved hearing their stories and spending time with them!

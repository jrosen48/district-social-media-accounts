Last week TCS did a virtual spirit week so this week we thought it would be fun to do a spirit week with social-emotional learning in mind! You and your student(s) can celebrate Mindful Monday, GratiTuesday, Wellness Wednesday, Thoughtful Thursday, and Fun Friday!

Attached you will find an explanation for each day along with some activities to try, you can certainly think up your own activities as well. These are just for fun and to give your family something new to try at home.

Heck of a game tonight to end the regular season. The Tigers played solid defense and locked down the region leading CEB Braves to their lowest score of the season. We fell just short, losing on an unbelieveable last second shot by CEB.

The C team was able to end the season wuth a win, while the JV capped off the year with one final win to finish the season undefeated!

Tiger fans have a lot to be proud of. We will start off our postseason at home on Tuesday. Nothing is official bit it looks like we will most likely be playing Crow Creek. GO TIGERS! 🐾🐯🏀",0.0,"Great games tonight Tigers!!

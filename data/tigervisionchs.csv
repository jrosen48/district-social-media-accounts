CHS Junior Class-Scratch Cupcake Fundraiser

Scratch Cupcakes are AWESOME!! Buy some for yourselves or for a gift. Have a birthday or anniversary coming up? They are perfect for all occasions.

Due to COVID, kids going door to door to sell anything is being discouraged. However, we'd still like to see a great response for this Junior class After Prom fundraiser.

Please reach out to a Junior class kid or Junior parent if you are interested in ordering. Contact Jennifer White-Jorgensen or Ann Polking Vincent if you have any questions. Kids will be selling until October 2. With delivery on October 23rd. Make checks payable to the CHS After-Prom.

Thanks for supporting the Junior Class After-Prom!",9.0,"Get your Scratch Cupcakes ordered here!!

Hello Tiger Family,
With many other schools only seeing their students a few times a week and others completely remote, we are grateful that we have the opportunity to have the students back in our buildings learning face to face.
I want to thank you for the patience you have shown during the beginning of this school year as we try to figure things out on a daily basis.

If you had the view that I have, you would see the love for children the CCSD staff at Adams and Fairview Elementary have as they have been working so tightly together, our children have been under constant supervision and support as they have returned to learning.

My team has listened to your feedback, suggestions and recommendations in the past couple weeks and we will be making a couple tweaks to the parent pick up lines to try and smooth out the process.

Remember ~ PICTURES ON TUESDAY and have a safe Labor Day weekend.

Yesterday was our season opener at the Bondurant-Farrar tournament. It was an extremely competitive tournament with 4/6 opponents being preseason ranked and most having a strong tradition of excellence. We went 3-3 on the day with victories over Perry, Pella Christian, and Bondurant-Farrar and close losses to Gilbert, Pella, and Holy Trinity Catholic. I am proud of our growth and competitiveness, but we are hungry for more! Can't wait for our HOME conference opener Tuesday night against Gilbert!",0.0,"Go Tigers!!

Sign Up Google Docs are Live for the Grab and Go Meal program for May 4th - 22nd (3 weeks) (no meals served May 25th - 29th)... You are able to sign up for all 6 pick-up days.... sign up for next week ends Sunday at Noon so don’t forget... ☺️

If you sign up for one of the 6 days and your plans change just reach out to the school you are signed up for and let them know you won't be picking up. This helps out tremendously if you communicate with us in the event you are unable to pick up meals. Menu for Fairview is posted.... the Kuemper menu is super similar with only a few small differences. Once their menu is done I will share.

Sign Up Google Docs are Live for the Grab and Go Meal program for May 4th - 22nd (3 weeks) (no meals served May 25th - 29th)... You are able to sign up for all 6 pick-up days.... sign up for next week ends Sunday at Noon so don’t forget... ☺️

If you sign up for one of the 6 days and your plans change just reach out to the school you are signed up for and let them know you won't be picking up. This helps out tremendously if you communicate with us in the event you are unable to pick up meals. Menu for Fairview is posted.... the Kuemper menu is super similar with only a few small differences. Once their menu is done I will share.

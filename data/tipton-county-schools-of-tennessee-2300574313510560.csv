Today I was made aware of a situation that appears to be trending on social media involving some of our middle and high school students. Through the use of Snap Chat, inappropriate pictures of students are being shared on bogus accounts. Our concern has been shared with local law enforcement and because this information is happening outside of school, we are communicating with parents to make sure you know to be vigilant.

As appropriate, we encourage you to speak with your child about his or her cell phone usage, picture sharing, and social media citizenship.

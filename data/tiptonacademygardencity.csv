Welcome BACK!!

Today our Tiger team walked back into the building to begin our 3 week journey of preparing for an innovative 20-21 school year. We worked in groups to paint representations of our school‚Äôs story while learning about staff safety protocols. We then had an overview of what life will look like through the eyes of a student. We learned that even though school will look very different, we can still work, laugh, and learn together as a family!

Our formal announcement will be made by tomorrow morning along with a selection form to confirm and request our plan to offer 100% virtual, a hybrid schedule (2days a week in-person and 3 days virtual) and a full week schedule with minimal spaces for families that absolutely need it. We are hopeful the plan meets all the needs of our Tipton community and enforces all of the safety protocols from the MI Roadmap for Schools and the Wayne County Health Department.

Thank you for all of your understanding and patience. We are working with and for our families.

Our formal announcement will be made by tomorrow morning along with a selection form to confirm and request our plan to offer 100% virtual, a hybrid schedule (2days a week in-person and 3 days virtual) and a full week schedule with minimal spaces for families that absolutely need it. We are hopeful the plan meets all the needs of our Tipton community and enforces all of the safety protocols from the MI Roadmap for Schools and the Wayne County Health Department.

Thank you for all of your understanding and patience. We are working with and for our families.

These Tigers laughed, cried, ate movie üçø style snacks, and viewed their virtual graduation on the big screen. It was a perfect night and one that will go down in the history books! It was so much fun that it just may have started a new tradition!

Last week we hosted a drive-in movie style graduation üéì for the class of 2020. It wasn‚Äôt our typical ceremony, but we certainly celebrated and enjoyed our time together!! These Tigers laughed, cried, ate movie üçø style snacks, and viewed their virtual graduation on the big screen. It was a perfect night and one that will go down in the history books!

We have had many celebrations over the last week that we will be sharing soon, but we needed to say thank you for helping us to complete a successful school year! One that brought many uncertainties and yet we made it through because we all came together in a time of adversity like family always does. Thank you for your continued support and whatever next year brings us, we know we will be in it together doing the very best we can for the children we all love!

It‚Äôs Principal/VP and Lunch Hero Appreciation Day!

We have the BEST of BOTH!!!

Where would we be without these SUPERHEROES saving the day?! Lost! They answer the call of duty and then some! There truly aren‚Äôt enough words to say thank you for all they do for us and our school! Each of them have chosen to put the needs of our Tiger family ahead of their own and they do it day after day!!

Our staff showed them some love today during our staff meeting! Try to see how they did it!

Please help me show them some love and appreciation in the comments!

Blood donations are more important than ever during this time. We have worked closely with the Red Cross to continue to support this lifesaving event. We are in need of healthy donors and due to the circumstances, only scheduled appointments are available. There will be no walk in‚Äôs permitted.

Safety measures will be in place to limit contact, exposure, and ensure this is done in the safest way possible. Please see the attached flyers for details and please, if you are healthy and able, consider signing up to donate.

Unfortunately, to protect our community, there will be no Tipton volunteers permitted. Mrs. Randles will be our only onsite representative.

A special thank you to Mrs. Randles for ensuring we can still help in this way.

I'm hoping this finds you warm inside your home because while the snow was pretty today, it's a cold day in April! Please read the attached letter with your Friday update and reminders.

Something I did not include in the Friday update is that we have a family that has experienced a house fire this week. All of the family members are safe, but they have had to relocate. The school is working closely with them on current needs. If you could keep them in your thoughts and prayers (if you do). This has made a tough time even tougher for them.

As always please don't hesitate to reach out and let us know if you need something. We are a family and we are truly all in this together. We will always help in any way that we can.

We have received word that two of our Tiger families have a household member with confirmed COVID 19. As far as we know, both are at home treating their symptoms. Neither are current Tipton students, but are our family. At this time, we would like to ask for your extra thoughts, well wishes, and prayers (if you do) for these families.

Please be extra diligent about staying home, washing your hands, and wearing a non-medical face covering if you need to go out. If we all act as though we are the carriers of it, it will help us protect ourselves and each other.

Sending virtual hugs to all of you and especially these two Tiger families.

I know it's late, but better late than neverüòâ. Here is your Friday update. I've also attached a resource for self-care and a link to a project you may want to work on with your kiddos and family over the spring break. It is a ""do it yourself"" blog with ideas for a time-capsule. Instead of creating for their birthday, they can create it for living through a school closure, through a pandemic, or however you are age appropriately explaining it to your child. Right now your children are living through something that will be in history books well into the future and it would be a great way to move through it by capturing it from their perspective and as a family.

I‚Äôm sure many of you have heard about the closing of our school buildings for the remainder of this school year. I know you have many questions about what this means. The quick statement is that Tipton is on the right track! Thank you to all of the staff, students, and families for helping us continue to move forward! I am very proud of our entire Tiger family and the effort we have put forth!

I have been in several meetings throughout the day and have some scheduled for tomorrow, as well, to ensure clarity of all of the components in the executive order prior to any formal release.

Please continue as you have been with the programming and support in place for your Tipton student. My formal Friday update will come tomorrow addressing today‚Äôs announcement.

Enjoy today‚Äôs sunshine as much as you can while practicing safe social distancing!

I hope you are all staying safe, healthy, and in place at your homes as best you can. Attached is an update of where we are at with some of the ongoing changes to our lives that are impacting school. Please read the attachment and if you have any questions or needs, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly by email at angela@trgschools.com.

As always please wash your hands often, practice social distancing, stay away and off of playground equipment and other things that may be a place that spreads the virus. Refrain from playdates, and visiting people that do not live in your home as much as possible.

I look forward to us all being together again in the future and seeing and hearing the laughter and smiles of our families.

Thank you,
Mrs. Angela Gilbert

‚úÖCharter students (and all others funded at the state minimum) are slated to receive a $225 per-pupil increase. Also included in the budget is extra funding for things like poverty/trauma & special education.

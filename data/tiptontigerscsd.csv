This project is made possible by the collaboration of Cedar County Conservation, Cedar Soil and Water Conservation District, ISU Extension and Outreach Cedar County, Pheasants Forever and Alliant Energy.

If you have a third grader, live in Cedar County and have not received your tree please let us know (email Miss Sarah at naturalist@cedarcounty.org)! We still have 200+ trees waiting for a great home. And yes, we are doing our part to social distance as well :)

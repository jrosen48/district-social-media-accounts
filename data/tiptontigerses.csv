Here is what library is looking like for our Elementary students.

Ms. Courter will go to see THEM on their library day (1 time every 6 day cycle) and they will be able to check out a book (preschool & kindergarteners get one) or books (1st-3rd graders get two). Books will be due back by their next library time OR they may renew it then to keep it longer.

4th(-8th graders) are still able to come into the library and browse for their books to checkout. They will be coming in as small groups though, no full classes at this time.

We are not using the blue cards that tell when the books are due. Parents may still receive an overdue notice via email but no fines will be collected during the pandemic.
Students will still be responsible for books that are lost, not returned or are damaged.

New this Year!! Any students that are doing school online--may sign up for a Tiger Box (curbside pickup of a box of books selected for you).

With the possible winter weather on it's way here's a Plan B for Veteran's Day...

IF we have a 2 hr delay we will have the ceremony at 10:35. If school is on time the ceremony will be 9:30 as normal. Thanks, we have been debating possible options and we really don't want to cancel the ceremony. It's such an important community event with lots of pride put into it so we are trying to do the best we can. If you know a Veteran coming tomorrow can you please spread the message about this possible change.

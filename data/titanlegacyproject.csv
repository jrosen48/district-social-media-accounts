The Okoboji No Boundaries team is putting on a speaking event on May 28th, and are looking for speakers! This event is geared towards middle school to college-aged students. Being a speaker would require you to create a talk, memorize it, and present that talk in front of an audience of around 100 people. If you have an idea worth spreading, the link to the speaker application is included in this post. Applications are due February 10th.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns feel free to email us at 24emquan@student.okobojischools.org or 21cahins@student.okobojischools.org‚Äù

Gov. Burgum gave a shout-out to K-12 education and distance learning during his Wednesday, April 15, news conference: ""We are really pleased from what we're hearing from parents and school teachers and superintendents about how distance learning is going … Schools are on a great path right now with the distance learning and we don't see any change in recommendations relative to schools through April."" Note: The governor's executive order affecting K-12 education said schools were to be closed until further notice; his statement implies that schools will be closed until the end of April at the earliest.",2020-04-15 21:05:51,,

News from Gov. Doug Burgum and State School Superintendent Kirsten Baesler today: Public K-12 schools are ordered closed indefinitely to all except essential personnel. Schools are required to draft plans for providing distance education, and distance education instruction will count toward a school’s required minimum amount of instructional time. (Right now, distance learning does not generally count toward minimum instructional time.) Those plans must be submitted to the Department of Public Instruction by March 27. Schools will not have to make up instructional hours lost from the state’s schools being closed from March 16 until April 1.

With school closing for another week the Library would like to help parents and grandparents out. We are putting together activity boxes with 3-4 crafts for your kids/grandkids. The crafts will vary depending on age. Please let us know if you would be interested in an activities box and we will start putting them together. Some of the crafts include perler beads. Rainbow loom bands, origami, and popsicle sticks.

Governor Doug Burgum announces the closing of North Dakota’s schools, public and nonpublic, for one week, beginning Monday. The governor and State School Superintendent Kirsten Baesler explained the reasons for the shutdown Sunday night. The decision will be revisited Friday. The order does not apply to day care facilities. #COVID19

Some of the reasons for the school closings:
—The Centers for Disease Control has tightened its guidelines for large gatherings that should be avoided.
—Over the weekend, there have been reports of more North Dakotans being refused tests for COVID-19. This week-long school closing may help increase COVID-19 testing capability in North Dakota, and help to provide more information about the presence of the virus in North Dakota.
—State officials have a “more comprehensive” understanding of the ND health care system’s ability to handle a “spike” in COVID-19 cases.",8.0,"Update from Governor Bergum: No school this week. Please stay tuned for further updates.

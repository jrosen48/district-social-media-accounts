Children’s Hunger Alliance",12.0,"Free Meal Pickup at Dayton Metro Library Locations

(June 17, 2020) -- The Children’s Hunger Alliance is sponsoring a free meal program with weekly pickup available at 12 different Dayton Metro Library Branches. Starting June 23rd, parents will be able to pick up 10 meals (2 meals per day) per child, at the designated times. No registration is needed.

Since you might be stocking up on frozen foods right now, here's an FYI. Frozen food retains most of the nutrients of fresh—and you won’t have to worry about it spoiling. If you don’t want to freeze it yourself, many kinds of packaged frozen food (including corn kernels, green peas, lima beans) are much easier to use and less expensive, than fresh. Just look for bags of vegetables-only, without added butter or sauces.",0.0,"ChopChop Magazine

Most produce keeps better if you don’t wash and cut it until right before you’re going to use it, but sometimes, it’s better to have it already prepped and ready to use! See which works better for your family.

Try prepping vegetables when you get home from the market: put washed apples and peaches in a bowl in the fridge, wrap washed lettuce in a paper towel before storing it in the fridge in a plastic bag; peel and chop winter squash, broccoli, and carrots; put clean celery in a container of water for snacking. Notice if the food gets used more quickly, or if it spoils before you can get to it.",0.0,"ChopChop Magazine

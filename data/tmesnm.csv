As a school we wanted to offer some ideas for engaging your child while our campuses are closed. We hope these ideas and curriculum will assist you in these trying times.

Take a look at our website and tell us which ideas you are most excited about! Then share a picture of your family doing something fun together (anything!) below. Let's show off our beautiful families and how thankful we are for each other today. We are so thankful for each of our TMEMS/Casita families so please show us some smiling faces below. ü•∞üòÅ

Did you know that our 8th graders are going to Poland this year? They are having one last Applebee‚Äôs fundraiser to help with their trip expenses and need it to be a BIG success! They are sending two 7th grade ambassadors as well on this trip to serve as mentors for the next class to embark on this trip. The group will be leaving May 7 and returning May 21. They will be visiting Auschwitz, Krakow, Warsaw, visiting a school in Warsaw, visiting the Museum of Polish Jews, taking kayaking trip and working on a farm among other things.

The Applebee‚Äôs fundraiser will be April 25th from 8-10am. Applebee‚Äôs is opening exclusively for just our school! Middle school students will be serving as waitresses and waiters and will be hosting the event. We would love to eat breakfast with everyone!

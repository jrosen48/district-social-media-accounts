Good evening Parents and Guardians,

Please Save the Date for Virtual Orientation for new and returning Middle and High School students this Thursday, August 6th at 4pm. A link will be sent to your email addresses later this week.

Additionally, please make sure that if you have a Middle School student, you have completed the Academic Enhancements Preference Form which allows you to select electives for your student. If you do not choose electives, the Dean will assign electives for your student.

Thank you to those of you who have completed our Remote Learning Information form, however, we are still in need of many responses. This form is very important as it not only helps us determine how many chromebooks and other devices need to be available for students, but it also tells us how comfortable you and your student are with remote learning. If you have not had an opportunity to complete this form, please do so as soon as possible.

We look forward to seeing you soon! Thank you and have a great night!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2636325789921337&id=1450999078454020,,0.0,"SAVE THE DATE:

The Triad Math and Science Academy's Middle School Grading Policy Survey has previously been shared with you.

Per the guidelines, students in grades 6-8 will be awarded a PC-19 or a WC-19 for all Middle School courses. Middle School students who are taking High School courses have a choice for how the High School course final grade will appear on the report card, with the understanding that a numeric grade will not be calculated into their high school GPA. This very important survey regarding how you would like your student's grades to be recorded is attached again with a new Spanish version below. If you have already completed the form, you do not need to submit again. If your preference is not submitted by May 22nd, a PC19/WC19 will automatically be attached to your course.

Middle School students who are taking High School courses have a choice for how the High School course final grade will appear on the report card, with the understanding that a numeric grade will not be calculated into their high school GPA. This very important survey regarding how you would like your student's grades to be recorded is attached again with a new Spanish version below. If you have already completed the form, you do not need to submit again. If your preference is not submitted by May 22nd, a PC19/WC19 will automatically be attached to your course. Please read the form carefully and contact your counselor or Dean if you have any questions!

Thursday, May 21: 7th and 10th graders
Friday, May 22: 8th and 11th graders

Many North Carolina colleges are waiving their application fees next week. That means you and your senior could save a lot of money. Be sure you have your applications prepped and ready!

UPDATE: Please note that Elon University is not one of the schools waiving application fees during College Application Week. Saint Augustine’s University has been added to the list. See our updated graphic in our new post for the most recent complete list of schools. Thank you.

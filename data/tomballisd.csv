In an effort to keep our community informed and out of an abundance of caution, we have made the decision to cancel the final curbside meal distribution, originally scheduled for Wednesday, June 24.

The decision to cancel was due to several factors, including a confirmed COVID-19 case within our school community, rising cases across the area and potential threat of inclement weather.

Tomball ISD has worked hard to make sure proper protocols are put in place to ensure the health and safety of our staff and families during curbside meal distribution over the last several months.

While the curbside meal service has come to an end, we have thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to serve our community and our families in a time of need.

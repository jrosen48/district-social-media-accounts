This morning on a TUSD bus route, a student showed a toy gun key-chain to friends. This toy sparked interest with a few of the other students, and the bus driver was notified.
The bus driver contacted school administration as well as local law enforcement to make sure the situation was dealt with properly.

Please understand, the toy was not used in an aggressive manner and at no time was anyone in danger.

TUSD would like to use this as a learning opportunity for students so that they understand the severity of bringing anything that can be interpreted as a weapon.

This morning on a TUSD bus route, a student showed a toy gun key-chain to friends. This toy sparked interest with a few of the other students, and the bus driver was notified.
The bus driver contacted school administration as well as local law enforcement to make sure the situation was dealt with properly.

Please understand, the toy was not used in an aggressive manner and at no time was anyone in danger.

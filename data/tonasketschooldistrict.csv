HUGE kudos to the Tonasket community for loving our seniors!! We had our first ever senior celebration parade on June 6, 2020 at 3 p.m., the time the seniors would have graduated.

Big thanks to the Tonasket Fire Department, City of Tonasket, WA DOT, WSP, and Okanogan County Sheriff's Office for supporting this event.

Convertibles, antique rigs, pick-ups, cars, ATVS, and even an ice cream truck rolled through the town to present our Tigers :)

We cannot wait to see everyone at our graduation ceremony on July 11, 2020 at the football field.

Senior Spring Sport Athlete: Heidi Cruz

Spring Sport: Track and Field

Event: 4x1, 200M, Long Jump

Favorite thing about Track and Field: The ability to work independently and focus on your weaknesses to improve in each event but still being able to reward the team and yourself if you reach your goal.

Goal for Senior Season: To go to state in 3 events

What does playing a sport at THS mean to you: It means that I can demonstrate my support to represent our community by being hardworking and showing my passion for sports.

Any words of advice for your under class teammates? Nothing worth having comes easy and never hold yourself above anyone else. Always try to be your own strongest motivator when you feel like giving up and use that mentality to lift others who need a leader.

Funny Spring Sports Story you want to share from your years at THS: Finding a photo of myself after our cashmere meet, passed out, clutching a half eaten subway sandwich in my hands.

Senior Spring Sport Athlete: Jennifer Cosino

Spring Sport: Track and Field

Event: Discus and long distance

Favorite thing about Track and Field: Meets for the competition and meeting new people.

Goal for Senior Season: To go to state

What does playing a sport at THS mean to you: New opportunities. Meeting new people having new experiences by traveling.

Any words of advice for your under class teammates? Participate in sports because that is one of the funnest things you can do in high school.

Funny Spring Sports Story you want to share from your years at THS? I would go to watch boys soccer and scare people with my dog because he was so big.

Senior Spring Sport Athlete: Cody Clark

Spring Sport: Tennis

Position: Singles and Doubles

Favorite thing about Tennis: How easy it is to enjoy practices, and how quickly the game flows.

Goal for Senior Season: I wanted to make it past districts.

What does playing a sport at THS mean to you: Playing a sport for Tonasket is a great way to challenge yourself in competition while being surrounded by your friends.

Any words of advice for your under class teammates? Don‚Äôt quit now because it‚Äôs too hard because your time will come.

A Favorite Tennis memory: One time at practice our assistant coach Brad found a flat tennis ball so he hit it as hard as he could up into the air and somehow hit a bird off of a telephone pole. The bird survived but the entire team went crazy over Brad‚Äôs amazing show of his talent.

Senior Spring Sport Athlete: Austin Cox

Spring Sport: Baseball

Postion: Outfield

Favorite thing about Baseball: I love how the whole team comes together to make the play. Even if one person wasn't out their in their position, we wouldn't be able to make the play.

Goal for Senior Season: My goal was to do the best that I could. And just have a fun season for my senior year.

What does playing a sport at THS mean to you: It means that no matter what, we always build each other up. Even if someone messed up the play, we always build them up. If someone gets hurt, we are always their to help them. THS sports, we always work as a team.

Any words of advice for your under class teammates? If you are going to do a sport, even just for fun, try your hardest. You will learn that you can do a lot more than you think you can. Never give up!

HELLO!!!!

We are participating in a NATIONWIDE campaign to celebrate and honor our SENIORS and their academic and extracurricular accomplishments!!

On Friday, April 10th (that's tomorrow), we will be turning on the football field lights at 8:20 p.m. for twenty minutes. Why 8:20? That represents 2020 in military time! This is one way to show our support for the Class of 2020.

Students and community members CANNOT come to the football field because we are not allowed to assemble in any size group at this time. If you drive by to see this event, please remember to practice physical distancing. Be safe!

As well, Diego has agreed to use the drone to video this, and we will post a video on our school FB next week for those who may not be able to witness it in person.

Together we are stronger!

While the Coronavirus (COVID 19) is not currently a US emergency or high risk in NCW, there is a lot of information circulating. We would like to share with you reliable resources to help keep you informed.

Reports on the status and responses to COVID-19 change daily. The WA State DOH (Department of Health), Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and the World Health Organization (WHO) are your best resources.

Local and State Health Departments would provide guidance on how to handle an outbreak if one was to happen in our area. WA is still considered a low risk area per DOH.

As with this and any other illness, the best thing to do is to wash hands often, stay home when you are sick and clean surfaces regularly. ~ Steve McCullough, Superintendent

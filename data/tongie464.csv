He served the students and staff at Tonganoxie High School for more than 20 years and left an indelible mark on all that he crossed paths with. We are proud of all he accomplished and we are all better people for having been able to work with him. Happy retirement Mr. Smith!! His wife Cherryl will also be retiring.

This school year will be my 6th year teaching, my precious 5 years were spent teaching Chemistry at Wyandotte High School in Kansas City, Kansas. I attended Park University and Pittsburgh State University for undergrad and graduate school.
In my free time I enjoy camping, reading, and doing anything outdoors with my family. I also spend a lot of time playing tennis at Chieftain Park. During the winter/spring I referee competitive club volleyball.

As individuals, communities, and a nation, we have been deeply affected by recent tragedies, including the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which are grim reminders of the social and racial injustice that continues to exist in our world.

Kansas schools have been enriched by the growing diversity of our state. As education leaders and citizens in our communities and state, we have a responsibility to increase our own social awareness and amplify previously underrepresented voices and perspectives.

Dr. King said, “The ultimate tragedy is not the oppression and cruelty by the bad people but the silence over that by the good people.”

As education leaders, we must not be silent. Our students, especially our students living these injustices, need to hear our voices, more importantly we must listen to the voices that have not been heard.

THS would like to thank Greg Lawson and the Tonganoxie Police Department for facilitating a parade to honor the class of 2020. He even filled out the parade permit for us.

How do you thank teachers that suddenly find themselves teaching in a way they never imagined or were prepared for during a pandemic? We think our teachers deserve more then we could ever give them...we’re only the PTO...so we decided the best way to appreciate our teachers and support our local community this year was to let each teacher pick a local business they would like a $25 gift card from.

Teachers, thank you for all your hard work. You are amazing. We hope you enjoy your gift cards and have a fantastic summer. Y’all deserve it.

Here are the local business the TMS PTO was able to support. We would also like to give a special thanks to Brothers Market, Flashbacks and Mr. Tire for your donations...our goal was to support all of you by keeping our money local...but you insisted on helping us and we really appreciate it.",0.0,"Tonganoxie Middle School PTO

TES Parents, staff and students,

Please enjoy this week's message.
One minor correction for all my Braves- our ABC's are Attitude, Behavior and Character. I said Commitment in the video, which isn't a bad thing, but needed to point that out.
Keep working hard, and I want to thank all the parents out there for working with our teachers during this difficult time. Your children are lucky to have you in their lives. Thank you!
Enjoy and have a great weekend!

The student body was able to watch the Fire Department extract injured persons (student actors) from the crash, as well as police arrest the student drunk driver. The student role players did a phenomenal job in creating a realistic scene that impressed how to never drive impaired. KDOT also brought a speaker that spoke to the students during an assembly. Thanks to the students that participated and orchestrated this event!

Special thanks to Alvy Wise Salvage who donated the cars, and Heartland Tow Inc. Auto Repair & Service who moved them around for us!",2020-03-05 21:08:21,,

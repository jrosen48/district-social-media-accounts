Face masks must be worn, even when an individual is able to physical distance, except in very limited circumstances.

Face shields may only be worn without a face mask when the ability to see the mouth is essential for communication, including for an individual who is deaf or hard of hearing or while participating in speech therapy.

National History Day Executive Director Dr. Cathy Gorn said, “At the conclusion of this course, Mrs. Rivera will be able to share with her students key strategies for researching, supporting, and presenting historical arguments backed up by these primary sources.

National History Day Executive Director Dr. Cathy Gorn said, “At the conclusion of this course, Mrs. Rivera will be able to share with her students key strategies for researching, supporting, and presenting historical arguments backed up by these primary sources. This is a crucial skill in teaching and learning good history, and is especially valuable now when so many students and teachers across the country are engaged in remote learning due to the coronavirus pandemic.”

As one of the selected teachers, Mrs. Rivera received free tuition, graduate credits, and materials for the online program.

Today, Governor Herbert announced school dismissal will be extended until the end of the school year.
We know there are many unanswered questions. We have been discussing various solutions and alternatives if school dismissal would be extended. Knowing now we will not be coming back to school (in-person) we will begin finalizing those plans and provide additional information about graduation, grading, and more as it becomes available.
Thank you for your patience and support during this unprecedented time.",2020-04-14 16:37:14,,

We just wanted to pass on some really cool news that we received this week about one of our runners on the XC Team.

Carson Belnap has been selected as the Gatorade Player of the Year for Boys Cross Country for the State of Utah!
This is an incredible honor for him and what he has accomplished this year (so far), and this award is one of the most prestigious in all of HS sports. Carson is not one for recognition or fame for what he does, but we wanted you to know what he has recently accomplished as a student at our school. A side note, he has also accepted a full ride scholarship to BYU! Thanks!

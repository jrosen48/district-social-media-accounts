This afternoon the Governor and the state School Superintendent announced that the school closure has been extended until April 10th.

That being said, the Teachers will be meeting with me Monday morning to discuss how best to move forward to educate our students. I would like to implement online instruction as soon as possible. To do so I need to know who has internet access and who does not for all Kindergarten through 6th grade students. Please email me at jwarren@topockschool.com and let me know if you do or do not have internet access at home. This will assist the teaching staff to make the best plans moving forward.

Packets of school work for those that requested them will be available for pick-up on Monday along with meals starting at 10AM.

Thank you, and enjoy your weekend.

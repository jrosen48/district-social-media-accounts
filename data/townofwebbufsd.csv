Old Forge at 8-1 in the league is a game ahead of Hamilton in the standings. With only 1 game left, Monday at New York Mills this means the Eskimos have clinched atleast a share of the CSC IV division league title. It is the first league title in 34 years and only the 5th in school history.

A win Monday secures a 3 seed in sectionals and clinches the league title outright.

Jimmy Connell is 35 points short of 1000 points for his career. He would be the first player to reach 1000 since Joe O'Donnell in 1995 who scored 1070.

Jimmy's mom Kathy Connell (Clark) is the schools leading scorer at 1099 points. Mike Gaffney is the only other 1000 point scorer from Old Forge with 1027 back in 1990.

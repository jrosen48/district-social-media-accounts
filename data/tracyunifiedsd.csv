We have been monitoring the air quality by the hour and communicating as needed to the school sites. We have thoughtfully considered whether or not we should be closing schools at this time. Believing that the Tracy community consists of a high percentage of parents who commute to work, we have determined that it is best to keep schools in session at this time. It is in the best interest of our students to be supervised at school rather than left alone at home because parents are unable to find daycare on short notice. None of these decisions are easy but we are trying to make the best decision for our students. We are collaborating with our neighboring districts, Banta, Jefferson, and Lammersville, and we are all in agreement with this decision.

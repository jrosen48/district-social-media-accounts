What a crazy busy weekend. We took 33 students to Utah to compete in the FIRST Robotics Utah Regional Competition. In the end we placed down in the ranks, but were picked up by the fourth team alliance. We made to the semifinals before losing.

There are many things happening at these events in addition to the robot. There are judges wandering the venue asking teams questions about business plans, engineering notebooks, safety features, and more. We have team who presents Chairman's a contest where we showcase our outreach, growth and more. At one point we had judges in the pit, talking to the team, in the stands and up in the main stands.

What a crazy busy weekend. We took 33 students to Utah to compete in the FIRST Robotics Utah Regional Competition. In the end we placed down in the ranks, but were picked up by the fourth team alliance. We made to the semifinals before losing.

There are many things happening at these events in addition to the robot. There are judges wandering the venue asking teams questions about business plans, engineering notebooks, safety features, and more. We have team who presents Chairman's a contest where we showcase our outreach, growth and more. At one point we had judges in the pit, talking to the team, in the stands and up in the main stands.

The first two “Lunch with the Principal” days this March. These Foxes demonstrated our core values and chose to place their Character Champion awards in the bag to be selected to eat lunch with Mrs. Chizauskie and Miss Andrews. Ms. Lyn even made us homemade chocolate chip cookies to make the celebration even more special! 💜🦊 Travis Unified School District",0.0,"Foxboro Elementary School

And we are all at home

Feeling alone

It is the opportunity to build a Culture of Kindness With a Day of Service from Kindergarten to Seniors.

When Treetops students spend a day focusing on helping others, they see their own capacity to make a difference in their community.

The students love this day, and there's a great sense of pride.

Every single student understands how easy it is to provide those services to a multitude of organizations within this area.

We owe our students that commitment to help them realize what they can do to be well-rounded citizens.

Just another example of what makes Treetops a special place.

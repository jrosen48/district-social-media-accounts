Given the forecast and timing of tomorrow's potential weather, the District has elected to go with a delayed start of one hour for Thursday, Jan. 17. Busses will run 1 hour later than normal. Classes will begin at 9:00 in all schools.

Road conditions in the Tremont area are generally pretty good despite all of the recent snow. However, there are several inches of snow piled up along the shoulders and some areas create a few additional issues for our buses. With a forecast of ice and snow on top of what has already been received, we'd like to plan now for the delay. The extra hour will ensure more time for preparations around the building, sunlight for our drivers, and an additional hour to assess weather conditions regarding a full cancellation.

Thank you for your cooperation. It's not always possible, but our hope is that the early decision can assist families with the adjustments necessary in the morning routine.

More concerning is the fact that negotiations and/or further legislative action appear to be at a standstill, despite the fact that schools are opening across Illinois over the next two weeks.
Our schools can open on time without state funding. Using our reserves and local dollars, we will be able to operate for much of the year before all funds are depleted.
There are many districts across the state that need funding immediately. Why are we still having these numerous man made crises in Illinois month after month after month? The political posturing using school funding as a bargaining chip is maddening and unacceptable.

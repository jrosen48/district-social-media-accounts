In the wake of the world wide pandemic, our teachers put on their creative caps to figure out how best to educate our students in new ways. In an effort to help with the transition, teachers taught teachers how to create and use Google Classroom, how to use Zoom, and how to create and manage their own teacher webpages. All of our paraprofessional staff including our maintenance crew, piled into the computer lab to earn their “Food Handling” certificates so they could help with student meals. The selflessness I’ve seen, the long hours, the way they’ve helped each other for the sake of our students, has been inspiring and heart warming to witness.

Please welcome Ashley Dennes

""Hey there, name is Ashley Dennes and I am so excited for my first year at Trent! This is my second year teaching and my first year teaching middle school. Previously, I taught 4th grade in Austin and coached middle school volleyball. I was raised as a military brat, so I don't really have a place that I call home. In high school and college I played volleyball, basketball, soccer, and cheered for a competitive squad. In my free time, I love to go to the gym, teach Zumba, and hang out by the pool or lake. This year I will be teaching 6th, 7th, and 8th grade Reading and Writing and coaching High School cheer. I am looking forward to what the next school year will bring. Go Gorillas!""",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=482091405505383&id=477949252586265,,0.0,"Trent would like to welcome another new teacher to our community and school.

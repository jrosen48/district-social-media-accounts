Her favorite things about high school are spending time with her friends and talking to Mrs. Parrish. She enjoys eating and sleeping in her spare time.
She has been accepted to East Georgia State College and in 10 years, she sees herself graduated from college, getting a job in her field, getting married, having a family and being very financially stable.
She would like to thank Mrs. Parrish and some of her close family members because they believed in her more than she believed in herself.

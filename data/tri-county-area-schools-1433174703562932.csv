As we wrap up this first week of learning at Tri County, we would like to thank you for your work and support . Whether Viking Traditional or Viking Virtual, there has been a lot of change, and we appreciate the support and communication from our parents. We know there have been some technology challenges and major adjustments for Viking Virtual learners. We will continue to look for ways to improve
and make this the best experience we can in light of the challenging circumstances.

Please continue to look for communication from the district, buildings and teachers as we continue to work forward this school year. Thank you again for your communication, support and patience as we began this new school year.

Sincerely,

Do you know what an incredible community we live in? Due to a partnership between the Mac Baskets program, Feeding America, and the United Way, our amazing volunteers have been able to reach out and help 945 families, 3380 individuals, 350 senior citizens, 1,116 children, and 40 veterans, with daily necessities from the food trucks that have been provided over these past 7 weeks. THAT’S AMAZING!!

A special thanks goes out to TC’s own Nancy Johnson, from the Mac Baskets program, who has worked tirelessly with the Feeding America program and the United Way to provide these food trucks. And, a HUGE thank you to all the amazing volunteers who helped make this possible. We are PROUD to be part of this caring community! We Are TC!

Best Picture- Samantha Patin and her dog on Black Tie Day

Best Participation- Isabel and Abby Schuster, Jordan and Stephanie Pierce, Grace (and LuAnn) Ebenhoh

If I missed ANYONE who participated at least 4 days last week, just let me know. It's very possible I overlooked someone.

With that said, we still have 4 tags that did not get picked up. We are putting this out there in case you or someone you know wanted to participate in this wonderful program, but didn’t get a chance to pick up a tag. Here’s your chance!

Please call Sherry Wheeler at the ESC at 616-636-5454, ext. 6002, or Connie Butler at the high school at 231-937-4338 if you would like to adopt one of these students. We will need to hear from you by Friday, and gifts will need to be returned no later than Monday afternoon.

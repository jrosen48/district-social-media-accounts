As many you know we are not hosting a Back to School Night or an Open House this year due to Covid-19. We will, however, be allowing parents the option of dropping off their student's school supplies early. If you would like to take advantage of this, parents may drop off supplies near the front office either Friday, August 28th or Monday, August, 31st from 8AM - 3 PM. Bring supplies in a plastic bag or sack with your child's first and last name written on it. Please note that you will not be going to homerooms or touring the building at this time.

Open gym/conditioning will start tomorrow morning in Piper City from 9-10:30 by the football field. We will play this week by ear as we have some possible inclement weather on the horizon and some possible announcements from the IHSA. Please bring shoes that you feel comfortable running/conditioning in. The volleyball net will be set in the grass so for the volleyball portion, shoes will be optional. Remember that if you are experiencing any symptoms or do not feel comfortable attending, please stay home. There is NO penalty for not participating. Please send messages out to any HS girl you think is interested in volleyball. See you tomorrow!

Now that we have the okay, we are planning on starting some open gym/practices beginning on Monday morning of next week. We will try to go M-W-F from 8:30-11 each day. Fridays will more than likely be week to week decisions. Currently we are going to start in Kempton on Monday and Wednesday however we will also be practicing a lot outside once our outdoor net system arrives that was graciously purchased by our Booster Club! Please spread the word to any girl you feel is interested in volleyball at the HS!

- If you are experiencing any symptoms at all, please STAY HOME!
- Arrive on time, we must take temperatures and fill out forms daily
- Bring your own water bottle, water fountains are off limits
- Bring your masks. They do not have to be worn while you are participating however.
- There will be no locker rooms to change in. Come prepared

$1 from every shirt will go to Feeding Illinois‚Äô COVID campaign supporting regional food banks throughout the state. Another $1 will go to the IHSA Foundation, which is a separate entity that holds a golf outing each year. Those golf outing funds help underwrite the cost of the IHSA SAC Student Leadership Conference, as well as scholarship programs like the All-State Academic Team.

The SAC also hoped to have anyone who bought the shirts wear and share them on social media beginning on Saturday, May 16 through Saturday, June 13, as we would have crowned spring state champions on each of those Saturdays.

Good morning,

I want to take the time to thank everyone for a fantastic 2019-2020 season! I hope everyone feels like they improved as a player and a teammate. I am already looking forward to the start of next season both at the high school and junior high. Since our scheduled awards night is on hold for the time being, here are this season‚Äôs awards. I need to point out that even though each grade only has three awards, I truly felt that multiple players were deserving of each award. Trophies and certificates will be mailed to all players. Thank you again for a great season!

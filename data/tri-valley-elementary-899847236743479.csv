Our staff will be driving their cars through Colton, Lyons, Crooks, and Green Hills area on Sunday afternoon. They want to see as many students as possible on their driveways or in their front yards. Staff want their students to know they are thinking about them and they also want to pump them up for their flexible learning that will ‪start on Monday‬

Officer Lutter has agreed to lead our parade because he misses the kids’ faces too!

Staff can’t possibly drive by all students’ homes, but they will do their best to be seen by many. If you’re unable to be a part, please know you are on our minds and in our hearts! #GoMustangs #inthistogether

BLOW A BUBBLE MASTERPIECE
Supplies:
Bubble mixture (or make your own with one part dishwashing liquid to six parts water)
Food coloring
Large bowl
Straws
Paper
Pour bubble mixture and food coloring into the bowl so that it's about a quarter of the way full. Use the straw to blow air into the mixture - the way you might not want your kids to blow bubbles into milk. When the bubbles rise above the rim of the bowl, place a piece of paper on top and then lift off the paper carefully. Voila! A swirly colorful landscape appears on the page.
Haywood-Bird said you can expand the activity by asking kids to make predictions about what the bubble painting will look like or using the masterpiece as the background for another drawing you make together.

Today is the day! Tune in now until 6 and again Friday, 6am to 6pm. The times that Avery’s story will be on are listed below but please give a listen all day! They are stories of incredibly strong children and angels that fought much more than we as adults have ever had to. If any one of these stories makes you tear up or pulls at your heart, I encourage you to give back. Even if it’s a tiny amount! Every bit makes a difference to kids right here at the Sanford Children’s Hospital!

Sunday = Rest Day

Although, every bit of getting up and moving around for Avery is work. But every bit of it was fun for her today! She had her cousins, grandparents, sister and aunt and uncle to keep her moving and motivated! She was up and about more today than she probably has been since we’ve been here. She was having so much fun playing hide and seek that we may have gone over on her time in her wheelchair a bit. 🤷🏼‍♀️ Don’t tell the nurse! 😉

We were also able to celebrate Thanksgiving all together tonight. It was such a blessing to be together as a family. The kids had a blast and it was good to sit, eat good food and chat like we weren’t sitting in a hospital dining area.

It’s back to the grind tomorrow but her tank is full and my guess is, she’ll be ready to work!

Side note: I’ve had a couple requests for a mailing address here for Avery so I included it below! 😊 Thank you all again for all of the support! ❤️

Avery is out of surgery and in her room. The nurse said she did awesome coming off anesthesia! We spoke with Dr. Song and she said they tested 253 nerve rootlets (initially we were told on average they test 140-160 so they were definitely thorough!). They clipped 32% on the right (her weaker side) and clipped 29% on the left. She said it went really well and that Avery did great. She’s still pretty groggy but is enjoying some PJ Masks and delicious IV fluid. She had pain meds in the PACU and hasn’t complained of anything since being out of surgery! 🙌🏻💪🏻 Hope to update again later this evening. For now, I’ll let her rest. Thank you isn’t enough for all of the support we’ve received! ❤️",0.0,"#MustangStrongAvery

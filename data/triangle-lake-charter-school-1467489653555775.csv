We are working on a plan for what Fall 2020-2021 will look like. As you know, we have been dealing with complications/impacts from the pandemic since March. We initially provided Supplemental Education (which was review learning), and then moved into Distance Learning For All. During closure, we provide thousands of meals to students, checked out technology, and continued learning opportunities.

Last week, the Oregon Department of Education (ODE) provided an initial guidance document and we have to develop a plan that will need to be reviewed by our county health department, approved by the Board of Education, and a final application for reopening submitted to ODE by August 15.

We have 3 models to explore for the Fall: all on-site, all distance, or a hybrid of the two. There are comprehensive safety and cleaning protocols and specific parameters that must be met. As we work through what makes sense for TLCS and what we can realistically implement, we will be asking for your input. Please watch for surveys coming out very soon!

The fall season has come to an end with great success and fan-fare.

The Lady Lakers finished the season just out of volleyball playoff contention. A great season nonetheless. The Lady Lakers were fun to watch.
Our high school cross country team (Cosie) did well at districts, but did not make it into the top five, which would've qualified her for the state meet.
The middle school cross country team did well this season, and it sounds as if they had a fun time doing it.
The high school football team lost just one game all season. They finished 3rd in the state 6-man playoff at Madras Saturday.
The middle school volleyball team finished second in league in a playoff nail-biter. The final game went to the third match and was decided by who had the last serve.
The middle school football team went undefeated! The last game of the season was at Eddyville against an undefeated Eagle team. We won decidedly.
Great job to all the Laker teams!

Go Lakers!

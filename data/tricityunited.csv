This past Saturday, TCU students enjoyed an awesome day at Premier Jet Center at Flying Cloud Airport in Eden Prairie. Girls in Aviation Day was originally created to increase female participation and enthusiasm for careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, Math (STEM) and aviation.

Students took part in activities that encompassed physics, riveting, airspace, meteorology, and many more from industry leaders with a passion for aviation. In the exhibitor hangar, professionals shared stories and information about universities, engineering firms, military careers and much more!

Outside, the flight line was filled with airplanes ranging from a historical P-51 Mustang and T-6 Texan to Canadair Regional Jet and Cirrus SR-22 aircraft. There was something for everyone! Go Titans!",2019-09-24 15:06:25,,

She loved being a Teacher & supporting our students. Staff & those closest to her all feel that in order to best honor her passion for TCU activities, we will go ahead with tonight's TCU Titan football game. We will have a moment of silence and staff tribute.

As another means of honoring her and all she has contributed to our students, schools, and communities, we will not be charging a ticket fee this evening and instead offer those in attendance the opportunity to give a donation as a memorial or welcome you to make a donation to Tackle Cancer.

Thank you for your kindness & support.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2430510867038781&id=719135411509677,,0.0,"Dear TCU Community: We are saddened to share that a dedicated educator, Carol Lilla, had a medical emergency today & sadly has passed away.

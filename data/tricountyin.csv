While TCP will not have a kindergarten round-up or open house event, the TCP staff understands that a child’s very first day of school is an important moment for families.
Thursday morning parents of preschool and kindergarten students can walk their child to class at 8:30am. The afternoon preschool class can be walked to the classroom at 12:15pm. We prefer that first and second grade students arrive at school at their normal time so we can limit the number of people in the hallways.
Visitors will need to wear a face covering and go through our new Raptor visitor screening system before going to the classroom. TCP staff will be ready with a warm welcome for our new students and help them transition to being at school.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1924142714403186&id=361209000696573,,0.0,"Preschool and Kindergarten First Day of School

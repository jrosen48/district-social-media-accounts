Keeping staff and students safe everyday is our most important job. This afternoon, we learned that a high school student may have had a handgun in school yesterday. That student was not in school today.

Every measure will be taken to ensure the safety of staff and students, which will include not permitting the student to be on school property during the investigation and expelling the student for at least one calendar year if the allegation is substantiated.

Dear Parents,

The safety of the Tri-Creek students and staff is our number one priority. When we receive information that may compromise safety, we take that information very seriously and respond swiftly.

Today, at approximately 10:45 a.m., school administrators were made aware of a social media post that was concerning. To ensure everyone’s safety, our crisis response plan was enacted. High school administrators, the School Resource Officer, the Director of Safety and Security, and the Lowell Police Department acted quickly, conducted a comprehensive and thorough investigation, and deemed the information to be false.

We are thankful to the students who alerted the school administration of the post. We cannot emphasize enough that if anyone sees, hears, or knows something, say something. Speaking up can save lives.

Respectfully,
Carl Porter

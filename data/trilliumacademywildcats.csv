One of those was Beaumont, Trenton where Ms. Price's sister happens to be an ICU nurse. Her sister Megan and some of her fellow ICU superheroes sent us a picture of them with the supplies we sent in. Ms. Potter also created an awesome drawing to accompany the donated supplies. Way to go Wildcats! üíô #WeAreAllInThisTogether",2020-04-23 14:15:07,,

The MHSAA just sent information regarding eligibility, spring and summer coach/player contact, out of season participation rules, etc., that has been shared with our High School Head Coaches.

üö® Academically: HS/MS students must receive CREDIT for 66% of their course load to be deemed eligible next year during Semester 1. So PLEASE make sure we are communicating to ensure none of our student-athletes lose a semester of eligibility.

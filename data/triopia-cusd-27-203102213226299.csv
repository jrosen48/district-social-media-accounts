Today the IHSA released their ""Return to Activities 1.0"" plan for Illinois high school sports. The document is below. In order to attempt to have all sports for our student athletes this year, they have adjusted the calendar. In regards to sports that Triopia high school athletes can participate in:

Golf (at Virginia) is from August 10-October 24

Basketball, Dance, and Cheerleading are from November 16-February 13th

Football and Volleyball are from February 15th-May 1st

Baseball, Softball, and Track and Field (at Virginia) are from May 3-June 26

Other details about the number of contests, etc. can be found on the attached document.

At this point, the IESA has cancelled junior high baseball and softball. If this changes, you will be updated.

Outdoor summer workouts with social distancing can continue at this point until further guidance is given.

As always, if you have any questions reach out to my office.

The school year is wrapping up, and this is obviously not the way I had planned it ending. However, I've never been so proud to be a Trojan!! My kids rose to the challenge and continued to take pride in their education. They not only completed remote learning assignments but also participated in fun challenges along the way. To reward their hard work and dedication, I reached out to SafeCo Jacksonville to see about purchasing ""free donut"" coupons that I could raffle off to students. The response blew me away -- they donated a whole stack of coupons that I could give out!

This morning Hank and I randomly picked the winners of free donuts. I want to congratulate the following students: Brock Wellenkamp, Avery Garner, Kaylee Beck, Cody Miller, Ben Dixon, Jackson Gaines, Anna Miller, Alayna Williams, Gracie Hobrock, Ali Ballinger, Kimberly Gallegos, George Gallegos, Raye Greenstreet, Nate Doyle, Riley Booth, Jeris Wankel, & Wade Swan. Your cards are coming in the mail soon!!

All Triopia JH/HS students and parents: Our school closure has put a halt on yearbook production and, more importantly, coverage. Since the yearbook is designed to include the history of the school year, the yearbook staff is planning to have a section focused on this time. We need photos of Triopia students and how they are spending their time during the school closure. Are they working on things teachers assigned, doing chores, playing video games, getting extra hours at work, babysitting their younger siblings, staying fit for spring sports, or something else? Triopia faculty and staff can also join in! Please email photos to emorrow@triopiacusd27.org with a brief description of who took the photo and what is happening. Cell phone photos welcome, but please, no filters! You will also receive photo credit in the yearbook.

We also thank Matt Canada and Cub Scout Pack 137 for their recent food drive. A shout out is also in order for the First National Bank of Arenzville and the Chapin Christian Church.

I recently participated in a webinar with the Illinois State Board of Education with some new guidance. According to their presentation, work completed during the closure should not ""negatively impact a student's grades or academic standing"". Therefore, I have told teachers that work completed can be used to boost a student's grade if they so choose. I have told them to use their judgement on how they do this since grading practices can vary from subject to subject and from teacher to teacher. For specific questions, students should reach out to their teachers. Since this is recent news, give teachers a chance to come up with a plan if they so choose. I would argue this is good, because it should further motivate our students to complete their packets or online work.

Thank you,

The worldwide event from Scholastic and the global literacy nonprofit LitWorld calls attention to reading aloud and sharing stories.

An abundance of research points to how reading aloud is both beneficial and beloved. Widely-known guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends parent-child home reading beginning from birth. A landmark report also uncovered that reading aloud to children is the single most important activity for building their knowledge for eventual success in reading. Furthermore, the Scholastic Kids & Family Reading Report™: 7th Edition shows that more than 80% of both kids and parents love or like read-aloud time because they consider it a special time together.

DEPUTY DAVE SKADSON - THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE

Dave Skadson has been a Deputy Sheriff for Dodge County since 2002. He has spent much of his career here serving in both the Triton and Hayfield Schools as our School Resource Officer - originally being assigned to that position by Sheriff Thompson and then a second time by our Administration in 2015. He is currently serving in the schools and has really done a tremendous job with this program and his dedication to the safety and well-being of our community's kids.

Prior to serving here in Dodge County, Dave served our country in the US Navy as an engineer from 1995-1999 on board the aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67). During his service he completed a 6 month deployment to the Persian Gulf.

Thank you Deputy Skadson for your service to our country, and to our county. We are forever grateful!

As I mentioned in my brief message last week, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education released updated guidance on April 24th that will guide our remote learning through the end of the school year. After 'unpacking' the guidance locally, we have revised our Remote Learning Plan for this third phase of closure. I posted an update along with our revised plan on the main COVID-19 Updates section of the District Stay Connected page at https://sites.google.com/tritonschools.org/trsd/home.

As we navigate through the challenges that this current closure presents, there are many factors contributing to what student learning can and should look like. As a public education institution, our charge is to provide a Free and Appropriate Education (FAPE) for all students. With the schools closed, the only opportunity for learning is the ‘distance’ model. While access to technology and the internet is an obvious challenge in a distance learning model, the range of academic abilities and disabilities presents the most difficult obstacles to overcome.

To that end, we have established expectations for enrichment opportunities that will keep our students engaged and supported by their teachers and other educators. We have posted what parents can expect in regards to academic support from Triton educators during the closure on our website at https://www.tritonschools.org/#tab-id-2.

As always, if there are any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly at Brian.Forget@tritonschools.org.

This message is to keep our students, parents, and fans informed of our football game situation for next week.

Our Tri-Valley varsity football team was scheduled to play Pine Ridge next week, September 4th. Pine Ridge has decided not to play varsity football this year. Since we received that information, we have been working to schedule another game for our football team. We have pursued teams from both the local area and as far away as Hot Springs. So far, we have been unsuccessful in finding any teams that have an open date for next week that are willing and/or able to play.

If another (11-man) team should have to cancel their game for next week, we will do what we can to schedule their opponent. But, as of right now there is no game for the Mustangs football team on September 4th.

A TEACHER PARADE IS COMING TO A TOWN NEAR YOU THIS SUNDAY!

Our staff will be driving their cars through Colton, Lyons, Crooks, and Green Hills area on Sunday afternoon. They want to see as many students as possible on their driveways or in their front yards. Staff want their students to know they are thinking about them and they also want to pump them up for their flexible learning that will ‪start on Monday‬

Officer Lutter has agreed to lead our parade because he misses the kids’ faces too!

Staff can’t possibly drive by all students’ homes, but they will do their best to be seen by many. If you’re unable to be a part, please know you are on our minds and in our hearts! #GoMustangs #inthistogether

Here is the plan for Sunday: (times are very approximate)

Good Morning,

I understand that many different areas of our district are having a different weather experience right now. I have contacted the National Weather Service, and they only expect our area to deteriorate from here on out throughout tonight. Therefore, Tri-Valley will be releasing today at 1 p.m.

No decisions have been made on tomorrow and won't be made until a later time. But since tomorrow is a scheduled early release, we will not have a late start tomorrow morning. We will either be on time tomorrow or closed depending on the impact of the weather this evening and overnight. If closed, I will be sure to send that information out via all the regular outlets.

Sincerely,

Dr. Mike Lodmel, Superintendent",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2578507249043772&id=1780956485465523,,0.0,"11/26/19 -

At the April meeting, the Tri-Valley School Board passed a resolution calling for a special bond election for the purpose of a new elementary school and facility improvements at the existing site. This election will take place on June 11, 2019.

I’m sure there will be a lot of questions on what this all means and what this all entails. We will be holding several “town halls” to inform our patrons of all the facility building information as well as giving patrons an opportunity to ask questions. These “town hall” dates have not been set as of yet, but I would anticipate them taking place throughout the month of May.

We will be releasing the dates and locations of the “town hall” meetings as soon as they are set.

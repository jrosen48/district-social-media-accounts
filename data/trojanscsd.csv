my teaching license at BVU. Outside of school, I like going for walks, playing board games, and reading.
One of my favorite books when I was in Middle School was Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine. I still
like reading fairy tales and am currently reading A Thousand Beginnings and Endings, which is an

The LUCC philanthropy group consisting of members of WMCSD high school students provided a grant opportunity that couldn't be passed up by the MS/HS Art Department! Students create the most amazing visual works of art that with photography can be recorded and shared with others. The professionalism of how the images are captured is what Mrs. Sogge was hoping to gain through the grant opportunity. The LUCC members in conjunction with the Community Foundation of Marshall County~CFMC have provided the art program with monies to purchase equipment, such as backdrops, LED lighting and bounce reflectors. The specialized equipment will allow the art program to continue its path of digital professionalism for documenting students' works of art for competitions, college scholarship portfolios and digital portfolio evaluations.
Thank you LUCC for this grant honor! Mrs. Sogge",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1293150507541439&id=1048641311992361,,0.0,"Great Job!

I just want all my girls to know how much fun this season has been for me and how many great memories that we made in such a short period of time. Ashley, Liley and Kacie this May be the end of your softball careers but it is not “the end”. It is only the beginning of the rest of your life. You three girls are going to do great things no doubt. And you have the upper hand here, you will be sure to live life to the fullest and never take anything for granted because you will have known first hand what it feels like to have something you love so much taken away from you. I am proud of each and every one of my girls and how they have been staying in contact these past couple weeks. I hope that we will continue to do so until we are able to meet face to face again. Much love from Coach Weeks and Coach Goode. We couldn’t have asked for a better, more fun, more caring and unique group of girls this year!",0.0,"Troup Lady Tiger Softball

The Troup Lady Tigers went 1-4 in the Malakoff tournament this weekend, picking up the solo win against Elkhart and dropping 4 against Mineola, Grand Saline, Elkhart and Malakoff. Our girls played hard and never gave up. Although we did not have the outcome from the tournament that we were hoping for, many improvements were made in different areas and the team never once gave up on each other. I am proud of the fight that our girls showed through this weekend. Lady Tigers will open up district play on Tuesday against Arp in Troup at 6PM.

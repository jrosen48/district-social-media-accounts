Please see the calendar for the 2020-21 fall semester. The high school calendar is normally distributed much earlier; however, we are in a unique situation!

This calendar is a “best case” scenario, however we can fully expect to make a few modifications as we go! The band directors will continue to plan for a “normal” football season, playing in the stands, performing at half time, competing at UIL, pep rallies, etc. We will also plan for the numerous alternatives that may present themselves. Altered school calendar, modification to the football season, limited spectators, limited participants, health screenings, rehearsal procedures, extended breaks… the list could go on and on of potential hurdles!

Along with our school administration, decisions will be made to keep our students and families safe. Changes will be made well in advance, as best as we can, however some changes may happen without much notification. We just ask that we all remain flexible and positive.

It is time to turn in your child’s school work that they have completed so far for the 3 weeks of assignments that have been sent home (Week of: March 23, March 30, and April 6) If you have been able to send completed work electronically to your child's teacher you do not have to turn the work in unless you would like to. Please keep the workbooks, but tear out the completed pages. Be sure your child’s first and last name is on each page. If your child has gotten behind just turn in what they have completed. You may turn in library books that you currently have at home. Our times for drop off are Friday from 4:00 pm - 6:00 pm and Saturday 10:00 am - 12:00 pm. Drop off will be at the front 3rd-5th grade building, at the parent pick up line. Please stay in your vehicle. We will come to you to collect the work.

Attention HLSR and Rodeo Austin exhibitor families. There are alternate shows being set up for your exhibitors to show their livestock. Some of them are already set, and some are still in the works. We have had contact from Smith County Jr. Livestock Show officials as well, so there may be something in the works coming from that front as well. Only time will tell. What we do know is that there will likely be another opportunity for your kids to show their HLSR and Rodeo Austin projects, so IF you are interested in these opportunities, dont sell/process your animals just yet. We will do our best to relay information as it comes to us.",0.0,"Troup FFA

Our girls played hard and never gave up. Although we did not have the outcome from the tournament that we were hoping for, many improvements were made in different areas and the team never once gave up on each other.

The Lady Tigers did a fantastic job today picking up three wins in day 1 of the TASO Tournament. The energy was high and the dugout was LOUD. We had an “in the park” home run hit by sophomore, Maddy Griffin, to take back the lead in the Kerens game. Lindsay Davis was solid for us in the circle today. Jessie Minnix was also hot in the box today. Our entire team was working together finding ways to contribute and bring something to the table. So proud to have the privilege to coach such awesome girls! #alwayshungry #neversatisfied",0.0,"Troup Lady Tiger Softball

The Troup Lady Tigers hosted Brownsboro in their first home game of the season tonight. The Lady Tigers came from behind in the 6th inning to tie the game up 1-1. Going into extra innings for a second time this week, the Lady Tigers took the win in the bottom of the 8th inning with a walk of, by Jessie Minnix, that allowed for Lindsay Davis to score the winning run. The Lady Tigers did a much better job tonight putting the ball into play and taking care of business in the batters box. Lindsay Davis picked up her first win of the season, throwing the complete 8 inning game, while walking 1 batter, giving up just 1 hit, no earned runs and sending 17 back to the dugout with strike outs. I wouldn't be doing the team justice if I gave credit to just a few players, because it was a complete team effort. The loud and rowdy crew in our dugout kept our spirits up and the game alive! The Lady Tigers are now 1-1 on the season. Troup is set to host Eustace on Monday with a 6PM game start. Come on out and support our girls. They are so much fun to watch!

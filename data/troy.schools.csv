No, Really, Take the Meals…

Reasons why you should take advantage of the free meals our district is offering:

It saves you time shopping and preparing meals.

It is convenient!

It is comforting and familiar to your kids.

It is delicious and nutritious.

When schools order foods to make the meals it helps keep the supply chain flowing. This helps farmers, truckers, and local employees - including some small business we do business with.

Each meal served provides funding to your district’s Nutrition Services department from USDA – not local monies. If the Nutrition Service department has a shortfall it will need to be made up with local district monies. Taking a free meal can actually save your district money.

It may extend your household food budget.

These meals help to keep our staff employed if there is a closure or enhanced distance learning.

You are not taking food away from someone who needs it more; we have plenty!

We LOVE to provide meals to our students. It is what we do best and it helps us deal with the disruptions all around us.",29.0,"We look forward to being able to feed all of our students at NO CHARGE to them between now and the end of 2020.

I’m not superstitious, but this has to be a sign of good things to come for this school year!

So Mr. Johnson, Math and Science teacher on Team 6.4, is putting the final touches on his classroom. This includes going through and organizing textbooks. Inside the front cover of one book he sees a familiar name, his own! This was his book when he was a 6th grade student in Mrs. Shewman’s Science class here at Van Cleve just a few short years ago. Sometimes things come full circle when you least expect them to.

For its senior prank, the Class of 2020 wanted to leave its “mark” on Troy High School one final time.

While these cups in the parking lot are temporary, the legacy you leave behind most certainly is not.

This class has been through so much together. For all they faced, however, they never stopped making us proud.

They battled through the challenges with heads held high and an unmatched resolve. They refused to let adversity get the best of them.

We will never forget you, seniors. Your youthful exuberance and unfailing courage was the light in a world filled with so much darkness.

You will be missed and you will be loved wherever your paths may take you.

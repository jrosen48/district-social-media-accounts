Another Graduation Day. Regretfully, there are a few missing from this collage (no spring concert and a missed county band photo op) but 13 dedicated band members are closing their chapter with us. They have been hard working, dedicated, and persistent. They have willingly helped their peers and others, striven to achieve their goals, but never forgot to have a good time (so many laughs and shenanigans from this crew!)

While the end of your senior year has not closed the way anyone expected, there is no doubt that this group will continue to leave their mark.

From our Croman family to each and every one of you! #OneTeamTroy

I dreamed I stood in a studio
And watched two sculptors there,
The clay they used was a young child's mind
And they finished it with care.

One was a teacher; the tools he used
Were books and music and art;
One a parent with a guiding hand
And a gentle and loving heart.

Day after day the teacher toiled
With a touch that was deft and sure
While the parent laboured by his side
And polished and smoothed it o'er.

And when at last their task was done
They were proud of what they had wrought,
For the things they had moulded into the child
Could neither be sold nor bought

And each agreed he would have failed
If he had worked alone.
For behind the parent stood the school
And behind the teacher, the home.

There they rehearsed with a total of 160 of the best high school choral musicians in the region and performed an exceptional concert on Friday night of very challenging music.

Each of these singers was required to complete a 90 second audition upon arrival at the festival to determine who would be moving on to the State level.

Only the top 4 singers on each voice part qualify to move on to participate in the PMEA All-State Choir.

I am proud to report that all three of our singers placed well and Madeline Getola placed 4th in Alto 1 and WILL BE PERFORMING AS A MEMBER OF THE ALL-STATE CHOIR in the Poconos at the end of April!!

Please congratulate all of these singers on a job well done and for being such fine representatives of Troy!

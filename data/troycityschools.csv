The coronavirus has given you a graduation you will never forget and it’s released you into an uncertain future. I urge you to embrace the challenge. The world needs you, your country needs you. I know you’ve been dealt a hard hand but you can play it well. With a tough but open mind, and a caring heart, you can help keep us together. Help find ways to serve others, not run away from them. Help to unite, not divide. Help to build, not tear down. Help to support, not demean. If you do, you’ll find your own path to fulfillment and happiness, and in so doing, your example will inspire the world. So to the Class of 2020, I wish each of you Good Luck and Godspeed!

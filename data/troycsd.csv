Let's spread some cheer!

We are collecting artwork, cards, notes of encouragement for our seniors! With the Easter holiday around the corner we are looking to spread some cheer to our seniors while we are delivering home delivered meals to them. We will also be sharing the amazing pieces of art we receive with our residents at the Van Rensselaer Manor.

There are a few ways to participate:
1. Mail any pictures or cards to:

Per Governor Cuomo’s Executive Order, the Troy City School District will remain closed through April 14, so as to limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of right now, we are scheduled to return to school on April 15, even though this was originally scheduled to be our spring break.

Per the Executive Order, in order to meet the state regulation that requires our students to have 180 days of instruction, our school district must continue to provide remote learning, meals for students and childcare for essential workers each weekday through April 14. This includes Good Friday on April 10, and the week we had previously scheduled as spring recess. To be clear, due to this Executive Order, there is no spring recess this year.

The Governor has said he will reassess whether to extend the statewide school closures in two-week increments. We understand there is a real possibility that this closure may get extended. We encourage families to continue to check their email and our website at www.troycsd.org/coronavirus for additional information.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3970764806297259&id=837742959599475,,0.0,"April 1 update regarding Spring Recess:

Please refrain from double-parking.

The Troy Police Department has received an uptick in complaints from residents in the neighborhoods of some of our buildings regarding vehicles that are double parking, blocking driveways and, in some cases, parking on sidewalks. As an urban school district, we do understand there is very limited parking, but please be aware that these actions not only significantly and adversely affect local traffic and buses, but they're also illegal. Per Troy PD, parents may only utilize double parking for a short period of time for drop-off and pick-up so long as you do not block driveways or exit the vehicle.

Please help us to be good neighbors by obeying the New York State Vehicle and Traffic (VAT) Law, Section 1202: https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/VAT/1202

I am so excited to join the Truman community this year as the new 2nd grade teacher! I am originally from Mankato, and I attended Mankato Loyola. I graduated from Saint Mary's University of Minnesota in Winona in 2018, with a degree in k-6 education. After graduation I stayed in Winona and taught kindergarten for the last two years. This summer I moved to Truman in order to be closer to family! In my free time I enjoy being with family and friends, playing softball, and going on walks with my dog Ziggy!
I am so excited for a fun year in 2nd grade! During this year we will continue to improve our reading and math skills, as well as gain confidence in ourselves as learners.

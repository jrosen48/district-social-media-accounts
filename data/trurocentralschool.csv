Truro Central School Community,

Massachusetts State law requires all drivers to stop when a school bus has its flashing lights on and its stop sign out. This includes student drop off and pick up times on school grounds.

Recently, motorists have been observed driving past the school buses in the Truro Ceutral school parking lot, while the buses warning lights have been activated, and children are entering or exiting the buses.

The State Department of Health and Human Services reports that the majority of injuries to do with school buses are children hit by passing cars, with children between ages 4 to 7 at greatest risk.

In response, Officers of the Truro Police Department, in collaboration with the Truro Central School, will be present at the school during drop off and pick up times for the purpose of enhancing safety.

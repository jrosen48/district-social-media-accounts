Today’s #ToledoBalletSeniorSpotlight is Kendra!

Kendra is a senior at Toledo School for the Arts who has studied at Toledo Ballet for 6 years. Her favorite performances that she’s danced in were “Lights.Camera.Limitless” and New Beginnings. Aside from dance, Kendra teaches workout classes, coaches tennis, and is a part of the Toledo School for the Arts dance team.

After graduation, Kendra will be attending the Dayton Medical Massage School and also attend a training program at Dayton Ballet.

When asked about a favorite memory or valuable lesson that she’s learned at Toledo Ballet, Kendra says, “Toledo Ballet has been able to teach me what it means to be the dancer and person I want to be. I got the chance to assist Mrs. Ann’s Adaptive Dance classes and because of that, I have gained my strength, love, and respect for dance.”

Congratulations, Kendra! Best of luck in all of your future endeavors!",0.0,"<3 <3 <3

If you knew Jason Thomas then you know that he was a nurturer. He fed people. He especially liked to feed people pie on Pi Day, ‪March 14‬, because that represented an intersection of his love of science and preparing food for others. His peanut butter pie is almost famous if you ask his family, friends, and students. And so on this Pi Day we hope you will head to one of the Fowl and Fodder - Downtown Toledo restaurants – either the downtown location on Adams Street or the Sylvania location on Central Avenue – and partake in a Jason Thomas peanut butter pie in his memory. Using Jason’s recipe, Fowl & Fodder will be selling individual peanut butter pies for $3.14 each during their Saturday business hours of ‪8:00-4:00‬.

The world still needs Jason Thomas, so we’re doing our best to carry forward the love and lessons he imparted. Please take a loved one with you to Fowl & Fodder and savor life’s sweetness in memory of Jason.",0.0,"We miss you, Jason Thomas!!

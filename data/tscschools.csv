Are you looking for another good reason to sign up for the virtual Cupcake Run? Of course, the first three good reasons are: 1) it's good for my health to get outdoors and exercise 2) I get cool swag, including a Gigi's cupcake 3) my participation directly helps public school teachers in the community.

How about adding this reason...everyone that is registered for the run will be invited to sign up for a FREE virtual trivia night. It's going to be a ton of fun for the whole family...plus the winning team gets a $50 Arni's gift card!

Plenty of good reasons to sign up today!

SROs Are There for You

May 18 at 7:51 PM ·

Good evening everyone. This is too good to wait until Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. to post. I would not want to keep this from all of our FRIENDS that long. 😂😂😂

Our SROs are awesome and have been doing some great things for the schools while the buildings have been empty. Some of those things have included playing with items left around the building, a floor cleaning machine ride, and book reading. 😂😂😂😂 They really have been doing great things for our students and staff, and we are very appreciative of the work they do.

We all get a song stuck in our head, quote our favorite movies, or replace song lyrics with our own. Our SROs took one of the greatest TV series of all time, flipped the words to fit our current situation and had some fun doing so. I am sure the recent video they made is going to get you singing and reflecting of the good old days. 😂

Enjoy and remember to.....

Get along, talk nicely to each other, don’t take things that aren’t yours, and call us if you need us. We will be there for you.

We had a third grade student write a poem titled “Beautiful Leaf”. The poem has a powerful message about how we are all beautiful in our own way. The poem even talks about bullying and how when we get stepped on we get back up.

Deicy shared this poem with Mr. Partida and he wrote a song using her beautifully written words. He surprised her and shared it with her class today.

Our third graders got to enjoy the Penguin Movie for their field trip. The movie was about “An Adélie penguin named Steve joining millions of fellow males in the icy Antarctic spring on a quest to build a suitable nest, find a life partner and start a family. None of it comes easily for him, especially considering he's targeted by everything from killer whales to leopard seals, who unapologetically threaten his happily ever after.”

Each team will build a replica of the lunar module and use a remote-controlled drone to land it on an 8-by-10-foot map of the moon’s surface. Students will modify and program robots and drones to explore the lunar surface and bring back a rock sample. The students will use the drone to retrieve the team’s lunar module and bring it back to the starting line.
The competition will be Saturday, June 1st at Central Washington University.
Top teams will be invited to the state challenge in July at the University of Washington .

We are in need of some clothing to keep in the nurses office. These clothes are used whenever students have accidents, fall in the mud or spill dirt on themselves. We'd love gently used hand-me-downs as you are cleaning out your childs closet! Here are the sizes we specifically need.

Boys shirts and pants size 5-6, 7-8
Girls shirts and pants size 5-6, 7-8

If you have any items you'd like to donate, drop them off in the office! Thank you!!

So generous and kind.

Is a quality all too rare.
Yet you give of your time and talents,
For all in need to share.

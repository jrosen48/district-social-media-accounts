Hello Hazelbrook families!
We are preparing for a strong start to our 20-21 school year. Please help us make your child’s first day a success. All enrolled middle school students should have received a new course in their Canvas app on their district issued iPad. We need all students to complete this short course to ensure that they can start school online on September 14th. Sixth graders need to complete this before September 11th to make their 6th grade online orientation and middle school start as stress free as possible. We can’t wait to connect with you this year!

Open the canvas app and have your child begin “2020 Welcome and Be Internet Awesome”. This class will conclude on September 13th.

There are two kinds of tests related to COVID-19.

-- A viral test (also known as a PCR test) tests a sample from your nose to see if there is virus in your body. We rely on PCR test results for confirming and reporting cases of COVID-19 in Oregon.
-- An antibody test tests your blood for signs of past infection. There currently isn't enough evidence to suggest that antibody tests are a reliable indicator that someone has or had COVID-19 (or that they have immunity).

If you’ve wondered about what the most effective materials are for handmade face coverings, check out the graphic below for guidance.

And don’t forget: Masks, face shields and face coverings are currently required statewide for indoor public spaces (for example, grocery stores, pharmacies, public transit, personal services providers, restaurants, bars, retail stores, and more).

In addition, face coverings are required in outdoor public spaces when physical distancing is not possible. Children age 5 and up are required to wear a face covering. People with a disability or medical condition may request accommodation from the business if they cannot wear one.

Durante esta pandemia, pagar la renta o el alquiler ha sido difícil para muchos habitantes de Oregon. Como es el comienzo de un nuevo mes, queremos recordarle que la legislatura y la gobernadora Kate Brown extendieron la prohibición de desalojo hasta el 1 de octubre. También extendieron la fecha para pagar el alquiler hasta el 31 de marzo de 2021.

No puede ser desalojado por no pagar el alquiler, las tarifas o los servicios públicos que vencen entre el 1 de abril y el 30 de septiembre de 2020.

Infórmele a su arrendador por escrito tan pronto como sepa que no puede pagar. Aún tendrá que pagar su renta vencida, pero tiene hasta el 31 de marzo de 2021 para hacerlo.

Washington County entered phase 1 reopening within Governor Kate Brown’s reopening framework on June 1. The governor subsequently linked Washington County’s future progress toward reopening to that of Clackamas and Multnomah counties. Since that time, Washington County has performed poorly on several of the governor’s criteria for remaining in Phase 1.

The percentage of tests positive increased again to 6.6% from 6.2%.

Also of note: Large outbreaks in workplaces, long-term care facilities and other settings account for a diminishing proportion of recent cases. However, sporadic cases (cases not traced to another case) are growing. As of last week, 47% of cases in Oregon can’t be traced to a known case. That means the virus is circulating more widely in the community – diffuse and largely undetected.",2020-07-22 23:50:41,,

We’ve heard there is misinformation about businesses and the mask mandate and statements that were attributed to our office. We want to share the facts with you. Face coverings are required in outdoor public spaces when physical distancing is not possible. Masks, face shields and face coverings are currently required statewide for indoor public spaces. People with a disability or medical condition may request accommodation from the business if they cannot wear a mask, face shield or face covering, and the business should provide such accommodation without putting other individuals at risk – typically, that will involve accommodations other than entry into the space without the required face covering or face shield.

We continue to learn more about how wearing face coverings help prevent the spread of COVID-19. The growing evidence about face coverings, combined with our rise in cases since reopening show why it’s so critical that Oregonians follow the statewide regulations about face coverings.

Last week, the CDC released more information about a situation in Missouri, where two hair stylists learned they had COVID-19 after they had interacted with 139 clients. An investigation found that none of these clients were known to be infected with COVID-19. The hair stylists and clients wore face coverings, which likely helped prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Please share the social card below with your friends and family. Help us get that word out that wearing a face covering is one of the best ways we can work together to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Yesterday we released new modeling on COVID-19 in Oregon: http://ow.ly/PmNn50AvynL The newest modeling shows the continuation of a concerning trend of rapidly spreading COVID-19 throughout Oregon.

Cases are rising fast, and even a 10-percent reduction in the growth of infection would result in significant increases in new cases day after day.

The bottom line is that the disease is spreading more rapidly than expected and underscores the need for Oregonians to do more to flatten the curve of COVID-19. This includes imiting the size of gatherings; maintaining 6 feet of physical distance between people; wearing a face mask; practicing good hand hygiene and staying home if you are sick.",2.0,"Oregon Health Authority

With COVID-19 cases increasing in Oregon over the past several weeks, answering the call from a contact tracer is an important way we can work together to help stop the spread of the virus.

Contact tracers reach out to anyone who may have been exposed to COVID-19 to provide information and support. If you don’t answer calls from phone numbers you don’t recognize, don’t worry, contact tracers will leave a message asking you to call them back.

If you have been exposed to the virus, you will be asked to quarantine for 14 days after you were near someone with COVID-19, even if you don’t feel sick. This is because you can spread the virus, even if you don’t have symptoms.",0.0,"Oregon Health Authority

Keeping Oregonians safe is my top priority. Over the last month, COVID-19 spread at an alarming rate in both urban and rural counties. That's why I'm requiring face coverings in indoor public places in ALL counties, effective 7/1. We can and must reduce the spread of this disease.

I do not want to have to close down businesses again like other states are now doing. If you want your local shops and restaurants to stay open, then wear a face covering when out in public. It's up to all of us what happens next.

Please keep your 4th of July celebrations small and local. We saw a lot of new COVID-19 cases after Memorial Day weekend.

Es por eso que estoy requiriendo el uso de los cubrebocas en los lugares públicos interiores en TODOS los condados, a partir del 1 de julio.

No quiero tener que cerrar negocios nuevamente como lo están haciendo ahora otros estados. Si desean que sus tiendas y restaurantes locales permanezcan abiertos, usen un cubrebocas cuando salgan al público. Depende de todos nosotros lo que suceda después.

Por favor mantengan sus celebraciones del 4 de julio pequeñas y locales. Vimos muchos casos nuevos de COVID-19 después del fin de semana del Día de los Caídos (Memorial Day).

Today, we released our Weekly Report, which showed that during the week of June 15-21, 30,773 people were tested for COVID-19 in Oregon and 3.7 percent of those people had a positive result, up from 3.1 percent during the preceding week: http://ow.ly/TL2250AhatN

For the fourth week in a row, newly reported COVID-19 cases increased over the previous week. During the week of June 15-21, OHA recorded 1,263 new cases of COVID-19 infection, a 40 percent increase from the previous week’s total of 898 new cases.

In addition, 12 Oregonians were reported to have died, compared with 16 deaths in the preceding week.

However, available evidence suggests average severity of illness among reported cases is lower than it was early in the outbreak: Hospitalizations and deaths remain well below their peaks, even after reported cases have been increasing for four weeks, and the percentage of emergency department visits attributable to COVID-19-like symptoms remains below 1 percent.",0.0,"Oregon Health Authority

REMINDER!

Our photo speed enforcement program goes live on July 1st at two intersections:
• Pacific Highway (99W) & 72nd Avenue
• Pacific Highway (99W) & Hall Boulevard

There have been some rumors in the community that drivers going as little as 1 mph over the speed limit will get a ticket. That is NOT TRUE. Under Oregon law, the threshold for issuing a photo speed citation has to be at least 11 mph over the limit. Tickets can cost you anywhere from $165-$440 depending on how fast you’re going.

The things we say, and the way we say them, matter.

When negative stereotypes are spread about entire communities of people, there are very real health consequences – people are less likely to seek medical care and speak openly about things they may be experiencing.

So we want to be clear: COVID-19 does not discriminate. Your race, ethnicity or nationality is not a factor in getting or spreading disease.

In order to successfully fight diseases like COVID-19, we need everyone to feel welcome, heard and safe when seeking medical care.",0.0,"Oregon Health Authority

We know there's a lot of interest in COVID-19 data for Oregon, which is why we wanted to let you know that our Weekly Coronavirus Report now includes COVID-19 outbreaks in workplaces of more than 30 employees with five or more reported cases: http://ow.ly/au4t50zYhC3

The number of cases cited in a workplace outbreak includes cases among employees as well as cases among close contacts of employee cases, such as family members, customers and visitors.

An active outbreak means that fewer than 28 days have passed since the onset of the most recent case. State and local health officials work intensively with workplaces to help them take steps that protect the health and safety of workers and the public.

The identification of an outbreak in a workplace does not mean there's a risk to all the employees there, or to the customers. When an outbreak is reported or discovered, public health officials investigate to determine who has been exposed and notify those persons directly. Such persons are generally quarantined for 14 days following exposure.",0.0,"Oregon Health Authority

We’re open today (Tuesday) from 5-7 pm. The food is free and everyone is welcome - we’re located in Tigard at 9055 SW Locust St.

Volunteers (wearing gloves and masks) will bring sanitized carts with food boxes down to the parking lot. We do our best to accommodate food needs and preferences. Plus, each box will have a 'card of encouragement' made by someone special in our community.

Please share this post - it helps get the word out to those who may not know about BHOB, but require food assistance.

Although our state is gradually beginning to reopen, it's important to continue following health advice to keep you and your loved ones safe. Stay home if you're sick. Practice physical distancing by staying 6 feet from others. Wash your hands frequently throughout the day and disinfect high-touch areas. Try to avoid touching your face.

These continue to be important actions you can take to stay safe and strong. You should also wear a face covering or mask while you are in public and shared spaces. At work, business owners and managers must make sure you can keep physical distance from your coworkers and support good hygiene if they want to reopen.

People have asked whether it’s OK to host a small Memorial Day BBQ with close friends. A small backyard barbeque with family and close friends is a great alternative to traveling this holiday weekend.

Just remember: Keep physical distancing of 6 feet or more between anyone who doesn't live together in the same household, and be vigilant about washing your hands. If grandparents are joining, it’s safest for everyone to wear a face covering.

In Multnomah and Washington counties, social gatherings must be limited to 10 people or less. In other parts of the state that are now in Phase 1 of reopening, slightly larger social gatherings of up to 25 people are allowed and still require physical distancing.

Remember: Smaller is safer.

Drive safely this Memorial Day weekend! Tigard officers are focusing their efforts on traffic safety during the holiday and will be watching for impaired driving. Please #SlowDown, #DriveSober and put the phone down.

If you do plan to drink, please designate a sober driver who is down for the cause. Last weekend an officer pulled over a driver after seeing smoke coming from the passenger side of the vehicle. The driver’s tire was shredded after a collision. Her blood alcohol level registered .18%, over 2x the legal limit. She had just driven her friend home. Fortunately, no one was hurt.

Pantry guests are not allowed in the pantry to shop; instead volunteers (wearing gloves and masks) bring sanitized carts with food boxes down to the parking lot. We do our best to accommodate food needs and preferences.

Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. And, viruses cannot be spread through 5G mobile networks.",2020-04-27 22:38:50,,

A medida que aprendemos más sobre el virus que causa COVID-19, nos llega rápidamente nueva información. Lamentablemente, también la información errónea. Para combatir esto, la Organización Mundial de la Salud (WHO) ha creado una página que destruye los mitos para aclarar algunos de los rumores.

Continúan agregando información a medida que surgen nuevos mitos. Por ejemplo, un baño caliente te relajará, pero no ayudará a combatir el coronavirus. Rociar alcohol o cloro en todo el cuerpo no matará el virus que ya ha ingresado a su cuerpo. Y, los virus no pueden propagarse a través de redes móviles 5G.

Para toda nuestra comunidad que reside en Oregon:
Actualmente el estado de Oregon ofrece cobertura de salud gratuita, llamada el Plan de Salud de Oregon u OHP por sus siglas en inglés y está disponible para niños, adolescentes y adultos—incluyendo familias trabajadoras, mujeres embarazadas, solteros y más—que cumplen con los ingresos entre otro criterio. A demás, recientemente Oregón aprobó una ley que le da OHP para todos los niños menores de 19 años que residan en el estado sin importar su estatus migratorio. Puede obtener ayuda local gratuita para solicitar en su idioma preferido de un socio comunitario de confianza y certificado por OHP, llamando al 833-647-3678.
Nuestra comunidad debe saber que estamos buscando todos los recursos disponibles para ayudarlos. Es por eso que le pedimos que esté al tanto de las próximas publicaciones e información que estaremos trayendo. Próximamente estaremos con representantes de la autoridad de salud de Oregon, para hablar de toda la información importante en español que debe llegar a cada rincón del estado.

Thank you for asking about our most needed items now - the product categories are: condiments, personal hygiene products, diapers (sizes 4-5), and baby formula.

We know times are strange now, but if you can help, we'd be so appreciative. You can drop off anytime by leaving on the bench outside the food pantry (or sending directly via Amazon or similar).

Oregon COVID-19 infections projected to remain level into May, stay within current hospital capacity, if Oregonians continue social distancing

Oregon Health Authority
April 11 at 2:16 PM ·

Here's the latest: By following Governor Brown’s stay at home executive orders, Oregonians are preventing a surge in new infections that could overwhelm hospital beds if left unchecked.

New projections from health researchers estimate that Oregon’s “aggressive” social distancing measures have prevented as many as 18,000 cases of COVID-19 and 500 hospitalizations. However these restrictions must be maintained into May to prevent new cases from rising above current daily levels of active coronavirus cases.

Packed with Pride is a joint effort of The Foundation for Tigard Tualatin Schools, TTEA, the Tigard-Tualatin Student Union, and TTSD Schools Board Chair Maureen Wolf and I. We are coordinating with local churches and service providers, too. We‘ve had 400 people sign up to help in just a couple days, we have contribution commitments over $4,000 in about 24 hours, and we have secured over 1,500 books to send home in food boxes for kids. Unreal. I’m feeling hopeful and inspired watching everyone come together to pull this off.

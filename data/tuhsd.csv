Happy Teacher Appreciation Week!

Westview High School is very fortunate to have her on staff. Ms. Brown also enjoys being part of Westview's PBIS and the Knights for Knights peer mediator program. She loves being able to work with students to help them plan for their future.

Earlier this month was National School Counseling Week. In honor of the counselors who work tirelessly to prepare our #FutureSunDevils for college, we're taking the time to highlight them and the work they do throughout the month of February.

Meet Kristeena Torres. She's been a counselor for six years and is in her fourth with Sierra Linda in the Tolleson Union High School District.

Her goal is to help students find their unique path to their higher education degree so they can #thrive and find a career they truly want.

In her own words: ""Remembering students as freshmen and seeing their progress when they graduate is a great feeling, knowing I had a part of their pathway to help them to get to their goals small & big.""",0.0,"Access ASU

Dear Families:

I had hoped to share a reopening plan that would have been able to allow all students back in schools in person this fall. We know that most would like to be in school and that our staff miss connecting with them in person as well. However, since the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic we have been working on plans that will allow us to open schools and to make decisions on instruction for our students based on what the science has been telling us about transmission of this particular virus. We have been monitoring reports of increased COVID-19 cases in our community and are in close communication with King County Public Health, OSPI, The Puget Sound ESD, and neighboring school districts. Based on the current trajectory of infections in King County. I will be recommending to the school board that Tukwila School District start the 2020-21 school year in a distance learning model.

Yesterday was our first ever Bulldog Bullyproof Training workshop led by School Resource Officer Tran with assistance from our Gracie Survival Tactics (GST) cadre leader Officer Richardson and our Records Specialist Lea Park who is also a jiu-jitsu instructor.

The purpose of the training was to provide students with basic non-violent techniques to counter common assaultive behavior displayed by bullies or others seeking to do them harm. Skills include verbal assertiveness and using leverage-based control holds to counter and neutralize threats without violence or use of punches, kicks or other strikes. The techniques are meant for the students to be able to gain control of an assailant in a non-violent manner until help arrives should verbal de-escalation techniques at the onset fail.

Thank you to the students who attended. We plan on hosting more of these workshops for students and hopefully for members of the community as well in the near future.

Little visitors were able to engage in a variety of fun, hands-on activities with the Bright Start staff who visit their homes to deliver support services. The children danced, made reindeer ornaments, created Christmas tree paintings featuring their tiny footprints, and even braved sometimes tearful pictures with Santa and Mrs. Claus!

Officers from the California Highway Patrol also attended the event to provide parents with proper car seat and booster seat use information. The Bright Start Program serves more than 1,000 children, ages 0-3, with home-based services, including physical, occupational, and speech therapies, behavior and feeding therapies, and parent training.

The TISD Construction projects are going very well. The original plan was to demolish the entire Swinburn campus and build the two new gyms just west of the HS cafeteria. Through considerable discussion, the TISD Board approved the relocation of the new gyms to be south of Swinburn gym where the playground is located. This decision will allow the District to demolish the older portion of Swinburn facing Dallas street and keep the wing facing the parking lot/Hornet Place for future classrooms and office space. Estimated date of completion for the new gyms will be December 2020.

The new classrooms and office space at the front of Tulia High School is coming along nicely. Brick is being laid on the front and looks fantastic. This addition will include eight remodeled classrooms, a dedicated counseling center and new office area.

The TISD Construction projects are going very well. The original plan was to demolish the entire Swinburn campus and build the two new gyms just west of the HS cafeteria. Through considerable discussion, the TISD Board approved the relocation of the new gyms to be south of Swinburn gym where the playground is located. This decision will allow the District to demolish the older portion of Swinburn facing Dallas street and keep the wing facing the parking lot/Hornet Place for future classrooms and office space. Estimated date of completion for the new gyms will be December 2020.

First run under our belt, we didn’t do too well. Two of the boys didn’t get their tools loaded so we borrowed a few from Hereford to get us by. Rodney Ferguson is a stand up guy! He has helped us from the get go even knowing we are his competition. Thanks Rod! Even not having the tools we are used to the guys still ran the 4th fastest time of the day. We had some penalties so it wasn’t a clean run but the mistakes are some we almost never make so they should be easy to fix.

This past weekend our Fightin' Hornet Band competed at the Region 1 Marching Contest and earned 1st division ratings from all 3 judges! Our student musicians and their directors work tirelessly to master their craft and put on an amazing show!

They advanced to compete this Saturday, October 28th, in the Area Marching Contest at Dick Bivins Stadium in Amarillo at 2:30 pm.

They will battle bands from all across West Texas (and about half of the state) and take in home field advantage as the closest competitors, so come represent in large numbers and help push our Fightin' Hornet Band all the way to State! See you there!

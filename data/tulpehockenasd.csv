Good evening,

Two weeks ago I put out a notification that stated schools will be in session April 6-13 for make up days. Unfortunately, I did not put in the announcement that schools would be closed April 10. PA Code actually states that schools are to be closed on Good Friday. I apologize for the confusion.

Make up days will be April 6-9, and 13.

I hope this clarifies any confusion that was created. As always feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

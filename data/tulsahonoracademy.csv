Querida THA Familia,

Hemos tenido un número alarmantemente alto de estudiantes y adultos enfermos en las últimas semanas. Hoy tuvimos tantos miembros del personal enfermos que apenas pudimos mantener las operaciones escolares. Por lo tanto, estamos cancelando la escuela para mañana. Estamos haciendo una limpieza profunda del edificio para, con suerte, eliminar todos los gérmenes.

Por favor, asegúrese de que su hijo/a descanse bien, especialmente si están enfermos. Esperemos verlos a todos el jueves!

Sinceramente,

Sra. Elsie Urueta Pollock",2019-02-19 18:16:03,,

While at Bethany, he obtained a bachelor’s degree in Health and Wellness. Terrance now serves as a third-grade teacher at Tulsa Legacy Charter School and is the assistant coach for the Central Junior High football team. What he enjoys most about his career is inspiring the youth and helping them reach their full potential.

Last Thursday I had the pleasure of speaking to a group of 8th graders in Tulsa on Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day. They asked me all sorts of really good questions. One girl who has aspirations of becoming an animator, gave me a drawing she made of me while I talked to the group. My heart felt so full I thought it might burst! ❤️🤗

Shout out to Maia @collinsaerospace for arranging this visit and making it possible for us to connect.

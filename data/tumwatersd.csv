Club Families:
The registration process on Wednesday morning will be as follows:
We will send parents of current members with a short registration form for this All Day Camp. The form can be returned at pick up.
New members:
If capacity allows, the only new members who will be registered are those who are children of First Responders/Medical Professionals. New member registration requires full paperwork Wednesday morning, please allow time for this.
There is a fee for All Day Camp as we do need to cover costs the Club incurs for the extended hours of operation. The fee will be $85 per week per child, as always we have scholarships available to those who qualify. We will work with all families who need payment plans. Families who have made any payments for March will recieve a partial credit toward any balance incurred for the All Day Camp.
Space is limited as we need to practice as much social distancing as possible.
We ask that families only use the Club out of necessity.",2.0,"Important information re: Boys & Girls Club registration during the closure. Please take a moment to read this if you plan to register.

What a fun night in Tumwater! We started out at Black Lake's Trunk and Treat; it was a packed house. Then we saw Tumwater Hill's PTA team at their Trunk and Treat with the best costumes. Finally, the night ended with the Pioneer Bowl. A common theme tonight was the huge amount of support our schools get from their PTAs and volunteers from planning events to rolling the marching band uniforms back to the truck after their performance.

We are so proud of our own Erin Novak for starting a pilot Spanish program with EOE 1st and 2nd graders. The end of year fiesta was Thursday night and it was obvious this program was a success. Erin is fluent in Spanish and American Sign Language and taught the kids many songs to perform in both languages. The children passed along their love for the cultures they‚Äôve been leaning about and shared food from Spanish speaking countries.

We were honored to have State Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal come for the festivities along with two Tumwater School Board members, Kim Reykdal and Khalia Davis.

We are so proud of our own Erin Novak for starting a pilot Spanish program with EOE 1st and 2nd graders. The end of year fiesta was Thursday night and it was obvious this program was a success. Erin is fluent in Spanish and American Sign Language and taught the kids many songs to perform in both languages. The children passed along their love for the cultures they‚Äôve been leaning about and shared food from Spanish speaking countries.

The school and surrounding areas have experienced a power outage and at this time, Puget Sound Energy has not estimated a time it will be restored. As a result, we will be dismissing school today at 11:30. If parents want to pick their students up prior to that, you are welcome to do so. For bus riders, please know that students will not be dropped at their stop without an adult to meet them. If a student doesn't have an adult at their stop, they will ride the bus back to the school and a bus will run at the end of the day after our normal release time. We will transport Boys & Girls Club students to the Club. If they are unable to open early, they will ride back to the school and go back at the normal time. Y-Care on our campus has been cancelled for the afternoon.

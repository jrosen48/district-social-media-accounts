Each student planning to attend graduation today at Children's Mercy Park received an email with assigned seating. The venue is requesting that tickets not be printed and instead shown from your phone. *Please remember this is a ticketed event - you cannot enter without a ticket.*

The management of the venue also requests that we do NOT print and hand out programs. Students will receive an electronic version via email today.

We will follow the guidelines in place from the WyCo Health Department. This includes that graduates, families, and staff will wear masks when maintaining 6 feet of social distancing is not possible.

Congratulations to the Class of 2020! The ceremony is at 6:00p and graduates need to be there at 4:00p for rehearsal.",2020-07-19 13:24:16,,

Q: What do you love about being an artist/art class?
A: I’ve always liked art ever since I was young. Back then it was a way to show my affection towards my family with little drawings on sticky notes, but now I feel like its more of a way to show my feelings and put my emotion into something.

Q: What is your favorite piece you have made and why?
A: The Bernice Sandler portrait is probably my favorite at the moment. I like that I got to make something for somebody as influential as she was.

Q: Why do you think art is important?
A: Art is incredibly important. I feel like a lot of people think that art is limited to just drawing and painting but it is so much more than that. Art is architecture, books, clothing and so on. This world would be incredibly boring without it.

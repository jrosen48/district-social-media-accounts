Each student planning to attend graduation today at Children's Mercy Park received an email with assigned seating. The venue is requesting that tickets not be printed and instead shown from your phone. *Please remember this is a ticketed event - you cannot enter without a ticket.*

The management of the venue also requests that we do NOT print and hand out programs. Students will receive an electronic version via email today.

We will follow the guidelines in place from the WyCo Health Department. This includes that graduates, families, and staff will wear masks when maintaining 6 feet of social distancing is not possible.

New Story Church",,,5.0,"You may have noticed the Little Turner Libraries that were installed around the community back in December and January. These were designed, built, and installed by the Building Trades program students at Turner High School. It is a ""take a book, leave a book"" concept that anyone in the community can utilize. We appreciate all the community members who have donated books so far, and during this time of the public libraries being closed, our very own Turner Community Library has been dropping books off in them as well.

Thank you to our wonderful community partners for allowing us to install the libraries on their property! üíõ

A: The Bernice Sandler portrait is probably my favorite at the moment. I like that I got to make something for somebody as influential as she was.

Q: Why do you think art is important?
A: Art is incredibly important. I feel like a lot of people think that art is limited to just drawing and painting but it is so much more than that. Art is architecture, books, clothing and so on. This world would be incredibly boring without it.

Remind your child to maintain a safe distance (at least six feet away from the street) and wait for the bus to fully stop before approaching it.

Always remain visible! If children need to cross the street, make sure the driver can see them by walking at least ten feet in front of the bus. Also, never walk behind the bus.

Please be patient. Our bus drivers and transportation staff are doing their best to put student safety first while getting students to and from school. We so appreciate the work they do. If your child misses their bus, please contact your school secretary about it.",2020-01-23 13:01:55,,

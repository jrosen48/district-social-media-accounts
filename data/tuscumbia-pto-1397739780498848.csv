Water samples taken by our staff and the Department of Natural Resources have continued to be safe and free of any contaminants. However, in light of this ongoing situation and after careful consideration of the health and well being of our students, the school district has decided to issue a voluntary boil water advisory until we can find a more permanent solution to the drinking water system.

This advisory will go into effect on Monday, February 5th, 2018. We will have water stations located throughout the building and are encouraging students to bring water bottles until further notice.

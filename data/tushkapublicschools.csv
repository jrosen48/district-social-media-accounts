The State Board of Education voted to suspend school operations for public schools in Oklahoma. With this decision, Tushka Public Schools will suspend ALL school activities and close ALL school facilities until April 6th, 2020. We will continue to update as new information is available. I apologize for this inconvenience, however the safety and well being of our students is the top priority.

Looky there, Mr. Stewart and Mr. Moore wore the same Brian Stewart Memorial Tournament golf shirt today. Thanks for the reminder guys that our tournament is quickly approaching and we are still looking for more teams and sponsors. It's even more fitting, knowing that this years proceeds are going to benefit the Tuttle Education Foundation, whose goal is to support our teacher's right here in Tuttle!

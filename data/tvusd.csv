Down syndrome Awareness Day 11: It takes a village…and we love ours to pieces. Today I just want to give a shout out to all of the RAD people, past and present..who have touched Jack’s life in more ways than I can count…he has and continues to flourish and develop into this amazingly incredible human..and so much is because of them..nothing but gratitude. ❤ Temecula Valley USD Pauba Valley Elementary Vail Ranch Middle Chief Joseph Middle School

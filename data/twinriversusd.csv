To Staff and the Twin Rivers School Community,

When a team faces uncharted territory, traveling into the unfamiliar together, they rely on communication, cooperation and trust to achieve success. I think this describes precisely the situation that we face this school year.

Many people have worked to anticipate student, staff, and family needs, so that we could prepare to meet them. Yet I know—indeed, we know—that we could not anticipate all needs and bridge all gaps. I can tell you that this has been one of the greatest challenges of my professional career, and I am sure that my colleagues throughout the District and people in jobs all across our District, would tell you the same thing: we have never done this before, but we are going to face it with good intentions and humility.

To Staff and the TR School Community,

As we near the end of the academic school year, graduating seniors will tell you that few events hold as much pride and significance for them as their high school graduation. They look forward to the cheers as they walk across the stage, turning their tassels, and posing for pictures with jubilant families and friends.

Under normal circumstances, we would celebrate this important milestone in person. Unfortunately, that will not happen for the Class of 2020 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, physical distancing and stay-at-home orders. We are committed to ensuring a safe and healthy environment for the entire TR school community. Thus, we have made a carefully thought out decision to salute our graduates and their many accomplishments via an online platform that will feature many of the traditions that make graduations so special.

Dear Students and Families,

I hope all of you are safe and well. I’m writing to share more information regarding school closures. Today, with extensive consultation and support of the Sacramento County Department of Public Health (SCPH), all 13 local school districts and the Sacramento County Office of Education (SCOE) are extending the period of school closures through May 1, 2020, to help slow the spread of COVID-19.

We know students and staff were hoping to be back in school after Spring Break. That was our wish, too. However, protecting the health and safety of our Twin Rivers school community is paramount.

Therefore, our schools will reopen as soon as the Governor and the Department of Public Health give direction that it is safe to do so.

The health and safety of our students and staff is our top priority. Although we have no confirmed COVID-19 cases as of today, we understand the anxiety this is causing and want to assure you that Twin Rivers is following all directives and protocols from the California Department of Public Health and Sacramento County Public Health. Given these current directives and protocols, our schools are open and we have no planned closures at this time. Should this change, you will be notified.

We continue to stress the advice of public health, which includes:
• Stay home when sick
• Cover your cough with a tissue or sleeve and avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth
• Wash hands frequently with soap and water

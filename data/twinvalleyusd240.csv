We have applied for the waiver and have been approved to begin providing this service to all students starting September 4. No lunch accounts will be charged until this funding source is no longer available.

We will not reimburse lunch account funds at this time as those dollars will be used once this program is over.

Because of other funding programs, we still request you complete the free/reduced application form and submit to your school as soon as possible.

Good Evening Twin Valley Family!

I am excited to be here and working with all of you to serve the students and families that are part of USD 240.

I can honestly say that I never thought I would become a Superintendent during a pandemic, but here we are :-)!

I am planning to have a virtual parent meeting on Wednesday, July 8th at 6:30 pm. I'll post on Monday or Tuesday what format the meeting will be, either Zoom or Facebook Live. I'm still trying to figure out what we have and what's best to use to coordinate our communication.

We certainly don't have all of the answers, but we would like to share where we are with our planning process for reopening schools and our work to keep both staff and students safe. We will also discuss the timeline for when we will receive the KSDE guidance, as well as when we are hopeful to have a fairly vetted plan for the opening of the 20-21 school year.

I hope you can join us for the discussion!

Happy 4th of July!

Stay safe and have a great weekend!

Friday is National School Principal's Day. I have had the honor to work with 3 great principals in Curtis Nightingale, Craig Gantenbein, and Steven Kimmi for the past four years. They have dedicated themselves to serving the students and families at Twin Valley Public schools at a high level.

I am honored to consider them friends and colleagues!

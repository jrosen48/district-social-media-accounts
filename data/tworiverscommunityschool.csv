2nd grade is proud to announce that Oliver Shepherd-Powell won 1st place, and Gabriel Visingard won 2nd in the Every Drop Counts poster contest sponsored by the town of Boone. The boys spent time learning about the water cycle, the importance of fresh water, as well as ways to conserve it. Then, they created posters to teach others what they learned. The judges said it was a very difficult decision, as there were many beautiful posters submitted. Congratulations boys!

Kinders and 2nd grade chose to participate in the Certified Kind Kindness Challenge, sponsored by the ChooseKind organization (inspired by the book Wonder). Our challenge was to complete as many acts of kindness in our classrooms as possible and drop one marble in a jar for each. Kinders chose pompoms. We had to end early because of our school closure, but 2nd grade had completed 160 acts of kindness as of March 13th. Kinder had completed their second jar and had 243 acts of kindness! Enjoy the pictures of our classroom marble jar and of our Kindness chain. Both classes will receive a banner for their contribution to making this world a kinder, gentler place. #bekind #choosekindness #choosekind #wearecrewnotpassengers #wearecrew #tworiversway @ Two Rivers Community School",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2829451957120659&id=167859923279889,,0.0,"From Ms. Tina:

From Ms. Natalie:
On Friday, I posted a Director's Challenge on Facebook. This is something I'm doing to bring us together, even though we are apart. I'll try to do a few challenges a week. Let's give the first challenge a few more days (even though it's rainy):

Director's Challenge #1: Go outside and collect natural materials. Use them to write your name. Post a picture or e-mail to natalie@trcsboone. Anyone can do it- but I especially want to see TRCS kids! Extra Challenge: try cursive!!

Take Care!

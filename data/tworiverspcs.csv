http://www.learnwithtworivers.org/evening-of-learning-seminars.html

We are thrilled to partner with educators from schools around the city and region, including City Neighbors, DC International School, KIPP DC, and Washington Yu Ying PCS to create a culture of grappling at your school.

This event is free and open to the public and one of the many ways that we invest in District-Charter collaboration. See our model cited in the recent WestEd report, Putting Students First: https://www.wested.org/resources/putting-students-first-profiles-of-district-charter-collaboration/

How does a Responsive Classroom help us #ReclaimKindness? Because learning is made more meaningful by allowing students to make personal connections. There’s no standard teacher lecture. Lessons are built around student experience and interest. They are asked questions like, What do you notice? and What does this make you think? Students learn how to be engaged learners and also how to engage and support their peers. They ask questions, they listen, they grapple with new or conflicting viewpoints, and they develop strategies for working together.

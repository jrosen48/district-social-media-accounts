Cancer does not rest. It doesn't do a warm down at the end of a bicycle ride. Cancer doesn't sleep at the end of the day. It doesn't flee the cold for warm weather during school vacation. Cancer is relentless, showing no favorites and taking no prisoners. Wealthy or poor, educated or illiterate, young or old, it doesn't discriminate. Cancer has no friends, no allies, no comrades. It doesn't need any. It does its damage on its own. It is its own army. It is insidious, creeping into the lives of everyone, leaving a path of destruction and tragedy in its wake.

But out of tragedy can come inspiration. It can harvest acts, and deeds, and abilities beyond ones expectations. So I ask you to please open your hearts and help this young man and his family in this time of strife and hardship.

Thank You

When the state DMV centers open, students interested in taking their permit tests are permitted to do so. However, the available stations are typically going to be cut in half to provide for proper social distancing. In short, they can give permit tests, but the lines will be long, so please be patient. Remember, you must have a physical completed (found on the back of the application) in advance of your permit test as part of the permitting process.

Behind-the-Wheel training and testing will not begin again at the High School until we go to “Green” and are able to secure the safety of students and instructors. When the district has put into place an adequate system we will notify our students and families through all available media contacts. In the meantime, if you have a student driver be sure to give them as many opportunities to practice their skills as possible. The parallel parking area behind the HS will remain open and available.

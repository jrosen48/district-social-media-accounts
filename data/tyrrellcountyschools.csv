Can anyone help us make contact with anyone with connections to any Tyrrell High School students from 1959? *See screenshot of the PM received by CHS.

Here's a little history on the schools of Tyrrell County:

Tyrrell Elementary School, home of the Bulldogs, was not always an elementary school. Built in the early 1950’s, Tyrrell Elementary was originally named Tyrrell High School and served as the segregation school for blacks in K-12. It wasn’t until the 1969-1970 school year, that the building became renamed Tyrrell Elementary and served as an integrated school for 1st - 6th grade. A year later, Kindergarten was added to Tyrrell Elementary. Around the 1993-1994 school year, a new addition was built onto Tyrrell Elementary and 6th grade was moved to the middle school campus across the highway.",0.0,"Columbia High School

If you have had any changes in your income or you are waiting to receive unemployment, I would like to encourage all families who are not on free and reduced meal benefits to apply. Even though we are serving free meals to ALL students, families who are found eligible for free or reduced meal benefits will receive a Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer (P-EBT) as additional benefit from the State of Vermont during the school closure. The benefit totals about $25-30 per child per week. In addition, if you are found eligible, the free and reduced meal benefits carry over to October 13, 2020 before you need to reapply.

You may apply for free and reduced meal benefits through the Infinite Campus Parent portal by selecting More and Meal Benefits. The link to Campus Parent is below.

We are also happy to mail you a hard copy of the form if you prefer. Please email wcsufram@u32.org.

The orderly dismissal of schools is essential to support both the State’s response to COVID-19 and the needs of children and families across Vermont. We must ensure children are safe, nourished, and still learning even as the traditional structure of school is disrupted. The work of educators will be essential in this effort.

In times of crisis, we all need to make sacrifices. But Vermonters, and all Americans, have risen to the challenges before - and this time will be no different.

In February I shared with you that WCSU Central Office employees decided to participate in PBIS (Positive Behavioral Interventions & Supports) in support of the work our schools are doing using these methods.

One of the tools used with PBIS is to set an attainable and fun goal, publically recognize desirable behaviors that go toward meeting that goal, and then celebrate reaching that goal. The Central Office goal was 150 bananas in honor of the office mascot Bob the Minion (because Minions love bananas) and from the look of what I found in the office today, I will soon be heading out to our schools to take selfies with the kids.

I am really excited about showing the kids another way Central Office supports them. I am proud of our office for the work they have put into recognizing the good in their coworkers.

Hello folks -

First off I want to thank all of you who made it to last night's meeting. It was a great showing of local democracy.

I have had a few people ask me what is next for budgets and employee contracts. At this very moment, I can honestly say I do not know. I will say that I am reaching out to our boards (6 local boards) to learn if they would like to meet and discuss possible next steps for school budgets, specifically employee contracts, and other potential items affected by last night's action. As I know more I will let you know and keep you all up to speed.

What is keeping me focused is the kids and how can we help each and every child, every day. I know things are difficult when the path forward is not clear, but that is always what brings me back to our important work of serving the children of Washington Central.

First, I want to thank everyone for your flexibility this morning with the water main break. We found out at 7 am that we did not have water and by then our students were on buses and in cars on their way here. I appreciate everyone working out ways to get their kids taken care of on such short notice. We still do not have water service as I write this email.

Unfortunately, U-32 will be closed again tomorrow, Wednesday January 30 due to the water main break in Montpelier. With the boil order in place we will not be able to provide food service or enough water for drinking for all students and staff and therefore will need to close an additional day. We do not foresee any additional issues once the boil order is lifted. Students should take this time to read a good book, clean up their rooms, and even help out around the house. I am sorry for the inconvenience and I look forward to everyone getting back to school and back into learning.

Have a good evening,

There is a 4 level game board with their resources, terrain and 'opponents'.

We have been sourcing many of the game pieces and our school 3d printers have been hard at work. But it isn't enough. The small printers just can't handle the load.

We are looking for a connection to a local 3d printing company that might be willing to donate the printing for the rest of the stuff needed.

U-32 budget approved by five towns

The Times Argus | March 06, 2018

STAFF REPORT
EAST MONTPELIER — Voters in the five-town, six-school Washington Central Supervisory Union easily approved the $14.8 million budget for U-32 Middle and High School during Tuesday’s town meetings.

Ballots cast in Berlin, Calais, East Montpelier, Middlesex and Worcester were collected, co-mingled and counted after the polls closed at 7 p.m. in each community. Superintendent Bill Kimball said the combined result reflected voters’ decision to pass the budget for the East Montpelier-based middle and high school, 1,183-786.

The budget calls for a spending increase of $528,112, or 3.69 percent, but after accounting for anticipated revenue it will require raising $459,468 in additional taxes, an increase of 3.21 percent.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1675785345832358&id=760184770725758,,0.0,"Thank you!

Public Forum on school start times in WCSU

March 26, 2018 6:00-8:00pm at U-32

The research is clear, but what should we do with it?

Are you a teacher who has students falling asleep in your class? Are you a parent struggling to get your high school student up in the morning (and to sleep at night)? Numerous studies and articles have entered the public domain over the last 20 years and even the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) states that older students should start school later and younger students should start school earlier. A list of articles and studies on this topic is located on our website: https://www.wcsu32.org/domain/260.

With this unusually quick warm up we have seen in the past two days, please be aware that road conditions may not allow our buses to access all or parts of some roads due to ice and/or mud. Road conditions are highly variable across our area and if a driver finds that a road appears unsafe for travel, they will not pick up on that road. We will make every effort to communicate with families prior to pick-up time that may be impacted by unexpected delays or incomplete routes due to poor road conditions.

Students had an opportunity to participate in activity stations, class soccer competitions, bucket-drumming contest, and more. Teachers and staff shared with the Atoms at the end of the day their parody of a classic holiday song - ""Ten Days Before Break, My Students Said to Me.""

Atoms who were eligible to participate in the student lock-in, were invited to enjoy a pizza party, crafting their very own gingerbread houses, play board games, compete in a 'snowball fight,' and learned a Stepen hip-hop dance through Utica Dance.

Thank you to all the parents for the donations and all of those who made this day possible. Many fun and memorable moments to cherish just before winter recess.

High School Atoms recently read the play, The Crucible by Arthur Miller and visited the infamous town of Salem, Massachusetts. While in Salem, students investigated the difference between fact and fiction when comparing what they read in the play ... and what they saw at the Salem Witch Museum . As the play was written in 1953 and the trials took place in 1692, students learned that sometimes history has not always been recorded accurately, which can lead to varying versions of the truth and history. This was an exciting field trip for our Atoms and were grateful for the opportunity.

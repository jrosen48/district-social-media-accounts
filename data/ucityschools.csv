Our goal is to enroll as many new families in June as we can so they can join our remarkable U. City Schools family now.

If you know a new family either planning to join the District for the 2020-21 school year or know of families considering a schooling change, please share this post and tag them. New family online enrollment is open now at www.ucityschools.org/JoinThePride.

Any new family that enrolls this month will receive a special welcome packet from the District as well as important emails and other resources regarding the start of the school year!",2020-06-08 08:00:28,,

Parents, friends organize parade for University City High School graduating seniors

University City High School
May 12 at 11:56 AM ·

May 11 was supposed to be graduation night for University City High School's Class of 2020 until COVID-19 came on the scene. Thanks to the University City High School PTO and the work of school staff, our students were celebrated anyway with a socially-distanced car parade more than 100 cars long. Students parked their cars beforehand on both sides of Balson near the high school to watch the parade that lasted nearly an hour! The parade was led by University City Fire Department trucks and a very tall guy on stilts sporting black and gold. Check out the news coverage below by KMOV.

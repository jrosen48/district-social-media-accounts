Hello friends! I’m excited to announce that on Saturday September 12th, three releases from Potter’s piano and violin project will be featured on WSKG Classical Radio (Binghamton 91.5, Corning 90.7, Greene 88.1, Ithaca 92.1, Cooperstown 105.9). The host of “Play It Again, Sam” has offered to air pieces, composed by Potter, after the NPR news updates at 2pm, 3pm, and 4pm, and follow them up with some short words on the pieces as well as the performers (Carson Boches, Bryce Clearing-Sky, and Potter). I hope you’ll tune in to hear the latest contemporary classical music in the area, and support a great local radio show. You can also stream the show live or after the fact on WSKG’s website!",0.0,"Linda Smith Clark

With a determined team of building leaders and staff, the Graduation Ceremonies of 2020 were accomplished. Even a one-day postponement due to rain and a day-of rain delay didn't stop our UEHS Class of 2020 from receiving their diplomas in-person. Divided into seven ceremonies at about 25 minutes each, students walked onto Ty Cobb Stadium, heard a live speech from Superintendent Nicole Wolfe, and then pre-recorded speeches from Daniel Vriesema, salutatorian, Alex Cass, senior class president, and Cole Rivell, valedictorian.

Following each ceremony, students and families could travel to over a dozen sites around town to get more photos. These sites included all four elementary schools, JFS middle school, and many businesses and landmarks in Endicott.

This day couldn't have been possible without the efforts and dedication of so many U-E staff, including buildings and grounds, UEHS main office and guidance staff, district and building leaders, and the board of education.

In 2015, a group of dedicated educators decided to embark on a journey that would be known as Tiger Ventures. With the help of a substantial grant from XQ, Tiger Ventures was born and the first eighth-grade students entered the halls to learn in a way that suited their skills, their dreams, and their talents.

The program has grown over the years, in both enrollment and the business incubators that work with students on a career path. Adjustments were made, education was redesigned, recrafted, and rethought to meet individual needs while still meeting New York state graduation requirements.

And this year, a year unlike any other, Tiger Ventures celebrated its first graduating class with a small, brief ceremony in front of a limited number of family, friends, and U-E staff.

Congratulations to Ryu Luongo, Cassidy Richards, Brittany Kaczynski, and Allister Garner on being members of the Class of 2020, the very first Tiger Ventures graduates!

In past years, the annual senior awards ceremony has been held in the high school auditorium in front of friends and family.

This year, as is the case with so many year-end celebrations, this one was structured a little differently. Arriving in cars, students drove up to the front of the school, got out to receive their awards, were congratulated by staff, and then had the opportunity to say a few words on the awards they received.

This year, 99 students received 301 awards, totaling more than $250,000. Thank you to all the staff who made this day possible and to all those who gave monetary donations to our graduating Tigers.

A video with our seniors sharing their awards was produced as a way to commemorate the ceremony.

-Relentless: continuing and persevering no matter what happens. You will finish.
-Integrity: the difference between what you say and do. Lead by example.
-Service: sacrificing for the people around you. Everything you do is for the team, school, and community.

This podcast presents poems written in response to current news events. Madame Thornton's poem deals with the ongoing plight of Syrian refugees.
""Writing and the arts are very important in challenging times like these,"" Thornton says. ""We need to express our thoughts and feelings and try to stay connected in spite of forces that would divide and weaken us."" Through her experiences as a writer and educator, she asks her own students to find their voice both in and out of the classroom.

Daily connection, engagement, and enrichment are vital as students, staff and educational leaders navigate this new path we are all on. With the goal of providing resources for our students so they can stay connected, engaged and enriched, the district provided a Chromebook to every K-5 Tiger. Instructions were included on how to connect so that students can contact their teachers, visit virtual classrooms, and use google docs and classrooms to work on activities, review curriculum and read. Chromebooks will be delivered to any family who was unable to come to their elementary school.

As this situation continues to unfold, we are all doing things we've not done before. The district is committed to helping in any way possible. Thank you to all who helped with distribution, traffic control, coordinating student lists, and getting the Chromebooks imaged and ready for student use.

Before schools closed, JFS held its annual World Language Week celebration.

Italian classes in collaboration with the PALS program at UEHS and JFS made homemade spaghetti, potato & ricotta gnocchi, meatballs from family recipes, homemade desserts (pizzeles, ricotta cookies, and cannoli cups), and homemade pesto and red sauce. The students also tried prosciutto with pecorino cheese, carbonated water, and espresso from Italy.

Spanish classes made homemade tortillas for sopes, homemade tamales, refried beans, empanada dough and meat filling, flan, and fresh tomato salsa.

After making all the food, students and staff sat down to share a family-style meal.

The week culminated with World Language Night, where students and their families were invited to learn more the second language opportunities the district offers, eat some great food, and enjoy crafts.

Thanks to all who made this week of learning and food possible.",0.0,"Union-Endicott Central School District added 18 new photos.

Before schools closed, JFS held its annual World Language Week celebration.

Italian classes in collaboration with the PALS program at UEHS and JFS made homemade spaghetti, potato & ricotta gnocchi, meatballs from family recipes, homemade desserts (pizzeles, ricotta cookies, and cannoli cups), and homemade pesto and red sauce. The students also tried prosciutto with pecorino cheese, carbonated water, and espresso from Italy.

Spanish classes made homemade tortillas for sopes, homemade tamales, refried beans, empanada dough and meat filling, flan, and fresh tomato salsa.

After making all the food, students and staff sat down to share a family-style meal.

The week culminated with World Language Night, where students and their families were invited to learn more the second language opportunities the district offers, eat some great food, and enjoy crafts.

Thanks to all who made this week of learning and food possible.",2020-03-16 12:18:56,,

To help kick-off the assembly, fifth-grade class president Olivia Cass invited a group of UEHS Marching Band students to perform and talk a little about how perseverance plays a role in their lives as high school students and band members. Among the students who spoke were Alex Cass (Olivia's brother and the senior class president), Natalie Klem (her mom is a teacher at AGM) and Katie McGovern (also an AGM grad and one of the drum majors).

The band marched into the assembly, taught the students a cheer that goes along with the U-E Fight Song, and played a few other tunes.

The assembly also introduced a new attendance competition between the elementary schools. School community coordinator Kashif Summers talked to the students about the importance of being in school and challenged each grade in each school to compete for the best attendance by the end of the year.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2469095256530000&id=283679971738217,,0.0,"AGM recently held an assembly recognizing students who displayed last month’s word, friendship, and then introduced this month’s word, perseverance.

The first day of school has been changed to Monday, August 17, 2020. This change was made in response to the need for additional staff training and planning time that had originally been scheduled throughout the school year. We are in the process of updating the 20/21 school calendar. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.

Don’t forget that our Summer Food Distribution will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, June 24, 2020. Food for 15 meals will be provided for any child 18 years or younger every Wednesday at one location, Ukiah High School, from 7:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Food deliveries by bus will not take place over the Summer. Please remember to wear a mask and practice social distancing when picking up food.

We hope you are having a fantastic summer, please stay safe and healthy and remember to READ to your kids!

We’d like to thank the Calpella Cubs for inviting Detective Donohue to read “The Book with No Pictures” by BJ Novak.

As UUSD schools transition to remote learning due to the global coronavirus pandemic, students and parents are adjusting to learning at home.

We hope Detective Donohue’s reading provides fun and education to your families at home during the coronavirus outbreak.

We are excited to announce that we have been awarded a $2000 grant from Walmart Giving to support our Gang Resistance Education And Training (G.R.E.A.T.) Program.

G.R.E.A.T. is a 13-lesson middle school curriculum and 6-lesson elementary school curriculum which is designed as an immunization against delinquency, youth violence, and gang membership for children in the years immediately before the prime ages for introduction into gangs and delinquent behavior.

The funds from this grant will be utilized to supply our G.R.E.A.T. students with graduation parties to celebrate their completion of this structured program.

With sponsors such as Walmart, we can make an impact in our community together.

Hey Everyone!

We know that it's hard work caring for young children and we so appreciate our early care and education providers that do so everyday! We also know that right now it may be even more stressful as we navigate uncharted territory. In addition, for those staying at home it can also be stressful and a little chaotic if it's not the norm.

Family Connections wants to help! We will be hosting a live story time every business day, beginning tomorrow, March 20, at 11 am MST. While we can't come in and sub for you or give you a break in-person, we are hoping that we can give you 5-10 minutes of break that you can sit with the children and just breathe.

Stories will be appropriate for children 0-5 and will follow with a related learning activity.

Hope this helps, even just a little, and brings a smile to your face and the children in your care!",0.0,"Family Connections Montana

üí≤üí≤üí≤A Penny War üí≤üí≤üí≤
March 2nd - March 13

Bring Pennies to add to your classroom‚Äôs penny jar.
Each penny is worth one point.
If you bring any coins or bills that are not pennies those count against your pennies.

Ex. 8th grade class has collected 100 pennies = 100 points. Early Kindergarten puts one quarter = 25 points in the 8th grade jar. This takes the 8th grade total down to 75 points. So you want to put the pennies in your own jar and the other money into a different classroom jar.

The class that has the highest amount of points will be awarded a St. Patrick‚Äôs Day Float Party on March 17th, 2020. Their classroom teacher will also win a huge basket of prizes donated from True Brew, 3-D International Restaurant, and Staples!

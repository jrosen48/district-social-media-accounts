Educating our kids is not political. It is not a Republican issue or a Democrat issue. It’s an American issue. I understand that we are living in an incredibly divisive time. But, how amazing would it be if we all rallied together to support the education of our children? If we all worked together to make things both as normal as possible and as safe as possible at the same time? We’re going to have to make some compromises to make it all work. It is CERTAINLY not ideal. No one likes the situation we find ourselves in. But, for our kids, let’s come together and make the best of a very tough situation.

Also, if you know someone in education, please give them some grace for a month or two. August is always a stressful and anxious time for educators, but this August the stress and anxiety is off the charts. Please know they are working to both make things as normal as possible and make things as safe as possible in our schools.",0.0,"Justin Coffey

Seniors, this school year didn’t end the way we would have liked. But, let me be real with you for a moment. This is exactly how life goes. Life is not fair. Life can be difficult at times. Life is full of adversity. When life is difficult, it’s easy to mope and feel sorry for yourself (sometimes you have to mope and feel sorry for yourself for a day or two). The secret to living a great life is the way you act when life knocks you down. Your life will be exponentially improved if you express gratitude for the blessings in your life and if you find ways to serve and give to others. When you do this, it not only brighten someone else’s day, it also makes you feel better. That. Is. How. You. Change. The. World.

Seniors, here’s your chance. Let’s make something great out of a tough situation. Let’s change the world. I look forward to seeing your action!

We know during this time of uncertainty many senior students and families may have a lot of questions and concerns regarding post-secondary plans. The Kansas Board of Regents (KBOR) and Kansas State Department of Education (KSDE) are working together to develop resources to provide information to alleviate some of these concerns and answer important questions.

We developed a College Admissions Among COVID-19 document that provides helpful admissions and financial aid links and virtual tools from Kansas public and independent institutions, as well as college and career exploration tools and articles related to college-decision making for 2020 graduates. We hope that you find this resource helpful. The link will auto-update as additional information is added.

Every year the seniors are required to do a project that serves the community. My project was setting up a “school closet” so that high school kids in need of clothes, can come and get some for free. With lots of help from Jennifer Moyer Hegwood, the community, my peers, and teachers, I was finally able to get it up and running. We have lots of nice clothes that students can use for interviews, church, etc. We also have casual clothes for kids to wear around the house and to school. On top of that we have also had lots of soaps, and towels donated to us so that kids who don’t have access to showers at home can use the ones in the locker rooms if needed. If students are interested is obtaining some clothes, they can ask any teacher or administrator at the high school that they trust to unlock the closets for them and help them find their size.
If you’d like to donate any of your slightly used clothes, towels, or toiletries just take them to the UHS office. I am thrilled to have this project up and running, and to be able to give back to a community that has done so much for me.",2.0,"Adelaide Harrold

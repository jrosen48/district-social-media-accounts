Congratulations to Emily Brandenburg from Unatego Central School District! She was chosen as a School Safety Patroller of the Year thanks to her leadership qualities, safety skills, school involvement, volunteerism and patrol experience.

Here is a quote from her winning essay: “Being a safety patrol captain has taught me more responsibility and to be more organized which will help me as I continue to grow. I had to make sure that I was also following all the rules that we had set for the younger kids, and the rules the school has in place for all of us. At the same time, I had to keep my school grades up. I want to thank my advisors for believing in me and picking me to be a part of this amazing journey.”

Senior profiles for students in the DCMO BOCES Career and Technical education programs continue, giving us even more reasons to be proud. Next up, Alyssa!

Alyssa Feliu (Unatego): Security & Law Enforcement Program at the Harrold Campus

Alyssa plans on attending Suny Broome for Criminal Justice and would like to become a K-9 patrol officer.

She is involved in SkillsUSA and SADD, and she likes reading, being outdoors and Jiu Jitsu.

Alyssa had this to say about attending her CTE program: ""I’ve learned a controlled mind set and I believe it’s wonderful that we leave with one certificate that can truly jump start us on a career we truly want to pursue.""

Congratulations, Alyssa!

Mychaelah Christian (Unatego): Visual Communications Program at the Harrold Campus

Mychaelah plans on attending SUNY Delhi to pursue an Associates in Arts Degree in Liberal Arts & Science/General Studies then transferring into Veterinary Science Technology (AAS).

Her hobbies include derbies, dirt track racing, fishing and spending time with friends and family.

Dr. Davis presents Superintendent Richards with a check for $8,000 from the Unatego Science Foundation!

Dr. Davis, the President of the Unatego Science Foundation, presented the District a check for $8,000 this week. The foundation, created to provide Unatego with financial resources for students and teachers, has, since its founding in 2008, donated more than $59,000.

The funds have been used to purchase scientific equipment, materials, and supplies; technology; software; curricular materials; and provide fellowships to deserving students from the district. This past year, Foundation funds provided $500 scholarships to four Unatego students.

Despite the unforeseen challenges this academic year, our students continued their creativity in a virtual art class! This change has exhibited a remarkable way to communicate creativity in any situation. This year, our students were left to create without the luxury of an art room and familiar art supplies, and considering the circumstances, they have done a fantastic job!

It was great seeing and speaking with all of you today. How wonderful it was to connect and get updates on your lives and how well you are doing both at home and with your virtual lessons. I am touched that more than 95% of the staff joined the Zoom Social. It is important to maintain our connection through this pandemic. Our next Zoom will be towards the end of next month if we don’t resume our normal daily activity at Robert Waters School. That Zoom Social, I would like to invite your children and/or pets to partake in the Zoom since we don’t get to see your children. It is a perfect way to see how each of our families have grown....
Stay Well and Stay Safe❤
With love always.

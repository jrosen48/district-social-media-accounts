Thank you to @mtnorganization for bringing their food pantry to Jefferson Elementary School on Saturday, May 23rd from 10:00 am -11:30 am.

The pantry will be a drive-thru only with no contact. Patrons will drive thru keeping all windows rolled up, popping only their trunks. Volunteers will place a box of food in the trunk and once the trunk is closed cars will be directed out of the parking lot.
Each box will consist of non-perishables, fruit, vegetables, salads, bread, desserts, wraps, and meats enough for a family of 4 for a week.

A message from Mr. Ghiretti (Supervisor of Social Studies and Business): Dear Graduating Class of 2020:

Have you spotted a teddy bear in a window while walking around your neighborhood lately? It's a game that is catching on right now around the country as a way to help encourage kids to get out of the house for some exercise and fresh air. We're calling on all of you in the Township of Union - both residents and businesses - to help us make the Teddy Bear Scavenger Hunt popular here too!

All you need to do is place a teddy bear - big or small, whatever you have - in one of your windows that faces the street. As families are walking around they can search for the hidden teddy bears in their neighborhood. We need to stick together as a community during this difficult time and participating in fun activities like the Teddy Bear Scavenger Hunt are a safe way to connect with your neighbors.",,,0.0,"#Repost @twpunionnjrec (@get_repost)

They always looked for live cams of birds all over the world.

Today, the students learned how to draw a blue bird.

The first bird is from Amber St-Dic of Mrs. Saavedra and Ms. Regal's 3rd Grade Class. The second is from Leah Arana of Mrs. Saavedra and Ms. Regal's 3rd Grade Class.

The first bird is from Amber St-Dic of Mrs. Saavedra and Ms. Regal's 3rd Grade Class. The second is from Leah Arana of Mrs. Saavedra and Ms. Regal's 3rd Grade Class.

We are commited to meeting the needs of all of our school families this fall. Many families have expressed a strong desire for their children to return to in person learning. Under the governors return to schools roadmap, in person learning is possible when our district is in Phases 4-6.

There are others that prefer to keep their children at home until they are certain the crisis has ended.

We are committed to meeting the educational needs of all of the children in this district as well as keeping them as safe as possible.

We are offering both In Person and At Home learning options.

We're asking parents of students who plan to attend Union City Community Schools this fall to complete a commitment form no later than July 31st so that we may make preparations in time for our August 26th start date.

You can find the form online at our web site - www.unioncityschools.org. We will also be mailing the forms home in the next few days.

We are commited to meeting the needs of all of our school families this fall. Many families have expressed a strong desire for their children to return to in person learning. Under the governors return to schools roadmap, in person learning is possible when our district is in Phases 4-6.

There are others that prefer to keep their children at home until they are certain the crisis has ended.

We are committed to meeting the educational needs of all of the children in this district as well as keeping them as safe as possible.

We are offering both In Person and At Home learning options.

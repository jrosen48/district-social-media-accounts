The yearbook staff is wanting to do something hopefully very cool and special.

First, we have two pages dedicated to Prom. With the unknown as of now what will happen with Prom, we would like to still dedicate these pages to everyone that was planning on attending the UCHS Prom.

This weekend, April 3rd-April 5th, we are asking that everyone that was planning on attending prom go get in their prom dress or tux and go ahead and have that parent dance that has been a tradition at Union City forever.

Do that at some point this weekend and flood facebook/twitter/instagram with “prom with your parents” photos. Comment on facebook or send photos to c.schmidt@unioncity.k12.ok.us with a picture of you and your mom/dad/sibling dancing or doing that prom pose on the porch and we will put it in the yearbook.

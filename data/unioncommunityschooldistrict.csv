Yvonna Krutzfeldt of Crosspointe Church in Dysart, along with Jeff and Angie Hutton of Heartland Church in La Porte City, were the guiding force behind the meal preparation and distribution March 23 through 25.

Another huge thank you needs to go out to Union‚Äôs Food Services Director Tina Hanna, who worked tirelessly for many days trying to get approval from the State of Iowa and USDA so that the Union district could prepare and provide the meals. She and her crew are now working to make sure the nutritional needs of our students are being met each day.

Without the continued support from our community‚Äôs we would not be able to provide the many opportunities for our students.

Yvonna Krutzfeldt of Crosspointe Church in Dysart, along with Jeff and Angie Hutton of Heartland Church in La Porte City, were the guiding force behind the meal preparation and distribution March 23 through 25.

Another huge thank you needs to go out to Union‚Äôs Food Services Director Tina Hanna, who worked tirelessly for many days trying to get approval from the State of Iowa and USDA so that the Union district could prepare and provide the meals. She and her crew are now working to make sure the nutritional needs of our students are being met each day.

Without the continued support from our community‚Äôs we would not be able to provide the many opportunities for our students.

Due to newly-released USDA guidance, caregivers may pick up meals for children at Grab & Go meal sites effective immediately. This includes the sites at Union High School in La Porte City, and Union Middle School in Dysart.

USDA recognizes that in this public health emergency, continuing to require children to come to the meal site to pick up meals may not be practical and in keeping with the goal of providing meals while also taking appropriate safety measures. The Iowa Department of Education has submitted a plan to the USDA to ensure Program operators are able to maintain accountability and program integrity, and prevent duplication of meals served to any child.

Caregivers are to share the school name where each child attends that they are requesting meals for, if the children are of school age.

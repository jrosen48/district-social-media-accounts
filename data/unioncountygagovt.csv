I am always honored for the opportunity to make new sculptures for my home-town of Blairsville, Georgia! Here are three new sculptures in my Appalachian Sculpture Project for Meeks Park. These metal folk art floral sculptures have been gaining a lot of momentum the last couple of years, I am very excited to have some of these here now in my home-town.
With such a beautifully designed building that Garland Reynolds Jr. has done here, along with this gorgeous landscape designed by, Beverly Zoe Bradley, it really makes an old country boy‚Äôs work like myself look pretty good. Thank you, Garland and Beverly!
Meeks Park has been a huge blessing not only to my life, but to the life of this community! How fortunate we are to have such and outstanding park as this to call our own. So in closing, I just want to say Thank You, Meeks Park, for all you have done in the advancement of this home-town boy‚Äôs art career over the years. I am so grateful for all the exposure you have afforded me. I appreciate you all!

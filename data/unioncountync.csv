This state of the art design is the collective work of many people, including the Sheriff’s Building Committee and Union County Facilities working to provide input to design firm, Creech & Associates.

Turner, the company that will oversee construction of the project, created this video for all to visualize the finished project once complete in early Spring 2022. The new facility will be built on the same tract of land where the current office is located near Wingate.

Everyone involved in the design phase has worked diligently to remain fiscally responsible while identifying critical functions necessary to ensure Union County will continue to achieve long term success in keeping our citizens and community safe.

NCDHHS is launching new initiatives to expand #COVID19 testing and contact tracing. Testing and tracing are key components of NC’s strategy to responsibly ease restrictions, while continuing to slow the spread of the virus.

New online tools include:
🌡️ Check My Symptoms (www.ncdhhs.gov/symptoms) allows people to enter their symptoms to determine if they should consider getting tested.
🔎 Find My Testing Place (www.ncdhhs.gov/TestingPlace) allows people to enter their county or ZIP code and access a list of nearby testing site locations online.

NCDHHS also launched the COVID-19 Community Team Outreach (CCTO) Tool, a password-protected online software that helps people track their symptoms if they have been advised to do so by the COVID-19 Community Team. The tool also helps streamline and integrate contact tracing work across the state.

Don Moye takes pride in serving as Union County's Emergency Management Director. Don has led the Emergency Operation Center through multiple emergency situations since starting with Union County in 2012. Through hurricanes, severe storms, major events, dignitary visits, and now a public health crisis, Don has helped coordinate the County's response among numerous departments, agencies, municipalities, and organizations. Don is steady in the face of an emergency and works hard to ensure Union County residents are safe and informed. Don's lifelong dedication to public service is so very appreciated.

This dashboard includes all individuals who have tested positive including those who have come out of their isolation period. Because new CDC guidance encourages people with mild symptoms to stay home without potentially being tested, those individuals will not be counted in the official confirmed case numbers as reported from the NCDHHS. Union County Public Health has identified individuals who have contracted COVID-19 from community spread and anticipates additional cases. In accordance with the NC Stay at Home Order, residents should stay home and only leave for essential activities.

To be clear, no school district has a choice in making sure that all students and staff have face coverings if school is able to open for face to face instruction. Students DO have the option of wearing face shields instead of masks. We also have to maintain social distance which won't allow us to open ""as normal"" in the Fall.

There will be an opportunity for distance learning for those families that do not want to attend school for personal reasons. These students will be accountable for being engaged with home learning and completing work.

We are still working with the Yakima Health District and receiving guidance from the state in determining our Fall plan. As stated previously, a draft of the plan should be available in the next two weeks.

Families - tomorrow we are prepared to give your students (and you) resources to help keep your students academically engaged during our mandated closure. Resources that we could quickly assemble will be sent home in print tomorrow. Teachers will be engaged on their ClassDojo classroom pages so keep checking back for resources. Our COVID-19 page on our district website will continuously be updated with academic resources for you and your students over the coming weeks. Please check back frequently.

Your child will be bringing home all personal items tomorrow so classrooms can be cleaned thoroughly.

If your child has medication at school that needs to be picked up, please do so ASAP.

Be well.

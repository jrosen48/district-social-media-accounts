Today we did not receive near the wind and rain we were expecting. However, when it comes to our children we must always err on the side of caution. These calls are very difficult to make, but student and staff safety is our priority.

We were also concerned about losing electricity during the school day and the need to release students early. We did lose electricity today and it just recently came back on.

All campuses will resume classes tomorrow. If you did not receive a text message from the school about the school closing, please contact the campus where your child attends. The numbers are pulled directly from parent portal.
As always, we appreciate your cooperation and understanding.

UGISD will be suspending summer workouts for the remainder of this week as a precautionary measure and we will re-evaluate at the end of the week. An employee has experienced some mild symptoms and went in for a COVID-19 test today. The test came back negative, but they are sending the test to another lab. Out of caution, we will suspend workouts until we know more about this situation. The employee has been in contact with female athletes. During summer workouts UGISD employees have worked diligently to maintain social distancing and all equipment is thoroughly cleaned after each use.

I hope that all of you and your families are doing well. We certainly miss seeing your faces and having the opportunity to make music together on a daily basis.

We wanted to reach out to everyone to let you know our plan for collecting instruments so that they can be cleaned and repaired over the summer break.

All school owned instruments should be dropped off (drive-thru style) on Tuesday, May 19 at the sidewalk near the band hall. We would like for everyone to stay in their vehicle while on campus. A band director will be available to collect all instruments as you drive up.

All grade levels (6-12) can come during these times listed below.

Tuesday, May 19

9 am - Noon

5 - 6:30 pm

Please email me (garmonb@ugisd.org) if you have any questions or need any additional information.

Continue to practice and take care of yourselves. We look forward to seeing everyone again next school year!

Congratulations to Philip Douglas Bowden! Philip is a senior at the Union Site and plans to attend mechanic school after graduation. He enjoys working on houses and cars in his spare time. Philip's favorite quote is, ""If you listen to 10% of what I say, you'll be 100% ahead of the rest."" He would like to give a shoutout to Mrs. Gina Young and Mrs. Angie Burns for always supporting him even in his darkest times.

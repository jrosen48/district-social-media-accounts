Today from 4pm-8pm and tomorrow from 10am-2pm are the FINAL TWO DAYS to return a USEVS Loaner Chromebook!! Failure to do so will result in a school fee assessment for the replacement cost of the device!!

You can come on any of the days that work best for you!

Please bring the following items with you when you come to return your loaner device:
Chromebook

I agree that:
I understand that once the condition of my returned device is assessed by the Technology Department if there is any damage that appears to be caused by vandalism, abuse or misuse may result in repair charges being assessed.

Following Governor DeWine's order to close school facilities through June 30th, the OHSAA sent out the following directive in regard to the extension of the current no contact period. The no contact period, meaning no school activities can take place and there is to be no in-person instruction between athletes and coaches, is now extended through May 31st. The reason OHSAA did not go ahead and extend the no contact period through June 30th is to allow flexibility in case the June 30th facility closure is lifted early. As the May 31st date gets closer, if the June 30th facility closure remains intact, then OHSAA will extend their no contact period through that date as well, or as long as school facilities are closed.

If you have any children who need some free Wifi and live near our buildings (or can travel/park by), we have made certain zones around our buildings Wifi capable. This WiFi is for students-only, not free Wifi for parents/general public. Students need to join the ""USEVS"" WiFi network, like when we are in session. If they are using a device that they use while in we're in session, it should automatically join.

*East ES - park in spots around Gymnasium/Main Office/Mrs. Orians room
*South ES - park in spots around 1st/2nd classroom windows on the NORTH side, and around the modular bldg.
*Union/USMS - park in spots in the EAST side parking lot, near Library exterior entrance, and, park along curb on the NORTH parking lot by Mrs. Leonard's room, Mrs. Parlier's room, Mrs. Young's room
*USHS - park along curb on the west/backside of the building between Mr. McConnaughey's room and Mrs. Pohlman's room.

This program will continue until May 21st or until school is back in session whichever comes first. At this time we are not planning on continuing to offer meals into the summer months.

Mrs. Parrot noticed a change in cafeteria behavior and rewarded them with games in the auditorium! Since there are over 100+ students in the sixth grade, we will continue this challenge for months to come so they will have the chance to meet many classmates and to sit at all the different tables in the cafeteria!

Shelby Rice from The First Citizens National Bank helped kick off year #8 of our community partnership ❤️ Even though my students are only 11-12 years old, we are teaming together to prepare them for the workplace. On Friday, we focused on teamwork (Tower of Feetsa Activity)and communication (Survive on the Moon Activity). Shelby shared how she uses these skills while working at FCNB, and she also explained what could happen if an employee did not develop these skills. Thank you Shelby for a fantastic Friday!",0.0,"The First Citizens National Bank is at it again! They are teaming up with Mrs. Newell to help prepare her students for the future! Year # 8

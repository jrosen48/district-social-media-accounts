Dear Parents,

It was learned today one of our fourth grade teachers has contracted the Covid-19 virus. Also, the other members of the fourth grade team have been determined to be close contacts by our nursing staff and Health Department. Therefore, all four staff members will need to start the process of quarantining. As a result of this, students in fourth grade will continue virtual learning. Moving forward, the plan is to have our fourth graders back on Monday, September 21st, a blue day. We regret this turn of events, and we look forward to having the fourth graders back in the building then.

Stay safe,

Dear Parents,

I am writing to inform you about the results of a positive test for Covid-19 a cafeteria worker made known to us yesterday. Since learning of this news I have been in contact with the St. Joseph County Health Department. According to the Health Department, there is very little risk with the food you may have received during the period from Wednesday through this past Friday. Nevertheless, their recommendation is to continue to monitor your students as you would typically for any related symptoms.

The Food Service Department’s response was to thoroughly sanitize their service area and utensils before the distribution of food today. And, the crew serving the meals last week has been temporarily replaced with another crew while they self quarantine for fourteen days. I apologize for any concern this may cause you, but I felt it was important to make you aware.

Today the Department of Education sent out guidelines for safely reentering school this fall. The document can be found at https://www.doe.in.gov/sites/default/files/news/june-5-class-document.pdf. The Marshall County Superintendents and the Marshall County Health Department have been meeting weekly since early in May to discuss this as well. These discussions will continue at the same pace. Also, a team of our administrators, nurses, teachers and parents will take the information in the guidelines presented today, as well as the information gained from the Health Department, and create a specific LaVille plan. This group has set a deadline to present the plan at the July 27th Board meeting.

Our ultimate goal is to create a safe reentry for our schools and our community. Please stay tuned to our website and social media outlets so we can keep you informed as the plan unfolds.

LaVille will continue to offer free breakfast and lunch throughout June and July! We've updated the menu, please take a look at some of the new things we've added.
It's not too late to contact your building secretary, Mrs. Amor or Ms. Williamson to let them know you'd like your family (those 18 and younger) to be added to the list. They'll also need to know which of the 9 pick up locations you'll want to utilize. Locations and times can be found on the menu. If you've completed the survey that was emailed last week, you've been counted! We start the Summer program on June 1st!

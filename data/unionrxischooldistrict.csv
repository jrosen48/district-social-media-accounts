We are proud to announce the district decided to wipe out ALL outstanding balances and start each student with a zero balance this school year.

Additionally, we just received news from the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) that ALL PreK-12 students are now eligible for free breakfast and free lunch. This wonderful opportunity for ALL students, regardless of free and reduced status, will start on Tuesday, Sept. 8. For students who are doing virtual Wildcat@Home, more information will be shared in the coming days about how to take advantage of this opportunity.

Please note, this awesome benefit to our students will only last as long as money is available through both the state and federal government.

It’s our goal to have our typical food distribution at UHS from 10:00 am - 2:00 pm tomorrow, Tuesday, 6/9/20.

Having said that, we are also closely monitoring incoming weather which could bring heavy rain, lightning and thunder during our window of food distribution. Our priorities are of course providing this service to our community, but we also want to ensure the safety of all our team members who are distributing the food.

We will plan to do an update on our Facebook page tomorrow morning no later than 9:00 am about the status of food distribution for Tuesday, 6/9/20.

In the event we have to cancel tomorrow, we will work to provide this service on a date later in the week.

Thank you for your understanding. #Uproud",2020-06-08 16:47:12,,

Due to the overwhelming response to our meal distribution program today, we unfortunately weren't able to provide meals for all those in need. We did, however, end up serving over 15,000 meals today.

Having said that, families that came today that weren't provided meals were given a coupon to return to Union High School tomorrow, April 8 at NOON to receive their meals.

Only families that received a coupon today will be eligible for meals tomorrow.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and we appreciate your understanding as we work to support the children in our community.

**NEXT Tuesday, 4/14, for meal distribution, we are making a slight change. 10 meals (5 breakfasts and 5 lunches per child) will be distributed at Union High School starting at 10 am until 2 pm. PLEASE, if you can avoid the mid-day lunch rush, that would be helpful for our team members and would also limit your wait time.**

Having said that, with the possibility of rain tomorrow, we are closely monitoring the weather forecast.

A decision will be made FRIDAY MORNING about either going forward with the parade or cancelling the parade entirely.

IF the parade is cancelled, we will follow the typical one-hour early release Friday schedule.

Last night between midnight and 1:00 am police were notified of a possible threat to one of our schools. Union Police Department immediately investigated and determined the threat not to be credible.

District officials have been in communication with UPD and at this time all schools will operate as usual.

We wanted to provide this update for clarity and assure parents, students and staff that safety is our top priority.

Thank you for your cooperation and understanding.",2019-04-18 08:23:10,,

At our March Board of Education meeting, the Board of Education voted to increase the daily rate for substitute teachers in #unionrxi.

The daily rate has increased from $85 to $95 per day.

For long term substitute teaching positions (11 or more consecutive days for the same teacher), the rate has increased from $95 to $105 starting on day 11 if the substitute teacher does NOT have teacher certification.

If the substitute teacher has teacher certification and is doing a long term position, the rate is $200 per day starting on day 11 and days 1-10 are $105.

These new rates are active as of April 1, 2019.

We have a great group of substitute teachers, however, we are always looking for more student-centered substitute teachers. If this position is of interest to you, please apply here: https://unionrxi.tedk12.com/hire/index.aspx.

To be a substitute teacher you need to have a Content Substitute Certificate, which requires a minimum of 60 qualified college credit hours. Learn more here from DESE's website: https://goo.gl/NrNYIT.

We were just notified by Union PD that there is a police presence in downtown Union due to a potentially dangerous situation. At this time, we are uncertain of the status of the situation and don't have any additional details.

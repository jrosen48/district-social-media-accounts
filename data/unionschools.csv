These Andersen second graders mask up, pick up their meals in the cafeteria and return to the classroom to eat at their classrooms. Students in grades 2-5 pick up their meals to take their classrooms while adults deliver meals to the younger classes.

Meanwhile at the Union 8th Grade Center, lunch is split into four cohorts so there are only about 200 students at in the commons area at any one time. Each table has Plexiglas partitions to provide a barrier between students as they eat. Ropes between the cafeteria and the walkways also help students and staff to social distance. When students leave the cafeteria, crews clean the tables and Plexiglas partitions before the next cohort arrives.

Students and teachers have returned to learning in person at the Union High School Freshman Academy.

A number of students are also taking freshman classes virtually. In some of the pictures in this album, you might notice how teachers have combined a biology class in which students - both in-person and virtually - are being taught in the same cohort.

The school has made many efforts to keep students safe, from mandating masks to continually cleaning surfaces. In the commons area where freshman eat, plastic shields have been been put in place on the tables to help protect students while they eat unmasked.

In another scene, you will notice that wearing masks, did not stop students from engaging in physical activities like learning how to use a pogo stick. Keep practicing!

Union Family,

As we prepare for Back to School, this is usually the time that we are finalizing our Kickoff show to celebrate the people, accomplishments, and events that make us uniquely Union. This year, however, we will not have a kickoff extravaganza in the Performing Arts Center. Therefore, on Monday, August 17, all teaching staff and site-based support personnel will report directly to their school site at 8:00 a.m., unless you’ve been told to do something else. All Support Services and ESC employees will report to their work assignments as usual or as directed by their manager.

Although this isn’t the usual start to the school year, our focus is still the same—provide meaningful educational opportunities for every student entrusted to us. And our mission continues to be to graduate 100% of our students college and career ready.

I look forward to working beside you in the days ahead knowing that, “Together We Make a Difference.”

A neighbor and his two teenage sons came to mow Karen Simonson’s grass last spring during the most restrictive phase of Tulsa’s COVID-19 shutdown.

“Let us pay you,” she offered.

“No, no, no,” the neighbor said. Schools were closed. His work had gone online. And they were looking for ways to stay busy, he told her. They even put a notice online offering to mow other yards in the neighborhood for free.

Bong Kang and his family, however, had made a habit of being nice to their neighbors long before the coronavirus.

Wondering how you can do your daily activities safely while protecting yourself and your loved ones from COVID-19? The more closely you interact with others and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread.

So, think about:
How many people will be there?
Will the space be indoors or outdoors?
Will you spend a lot of time with others?

We will be taking temperatures everyday and stressing the importance of washing their hands. NO parents will be allowed inside the building unless they are a parent sponsor.

During camp -
We are waiting for an answer back from Union if we can put tape on the floor to space the girls out. Even if they come back and say no, we will still be able to spread out effectively because our numbers are down, 3 different spaces to utilize and with different groups that will help as well.

Parent Showing -
We are looking at the parent showing being outside because well the ever present Covid! I'm purchasing a sound machine to make this possible because I feel it's important.

It might not have been the graduation they planned, but the Class of 2020 still saw fireworks during their seniors-only graduation ceremony at Union Tuttle Stadium Thursday evening, July 23.

About 700 seniors in caps and gowns - and a variety of masks because of Covid-19 - participated in the seniors-only graduation program at Union Tuttle Stadium Thursday, July 23.

Each senior received a special mask, and a bottle of water as well to help cope with the hot weather. (Seniors were allowed to remove masks during their walk for picture-taking purposes.)

The ceremony started with celebratory videos, followed by a short introduction and recognition of seniors – from distinguished graduates to seniors of the month. Then, seniors – following social distancing protocols – walked across the stage to cheers as they heard their names called out for their friends and small number of family members just outside the stadium.

The graduation concluded with a singing of the alma mater and surprise fireworks from the top of the UMAC.

Finally- in compliance with the City of Tulsa mask ordinance, you will be required to wear a mask during the ceremony. We will provide a mask for you. Masks may be taken down when you are walking across the stage to get your picture taken.

We are looking forward to seeing you tomorrow night at 7:15.

Congratulations! Valeria Rodriguez!

She is our fourth winner for the #ulatinxchallenge.

Here is more information about Valeria in her own words: ""Hi my name is Valeria Rodriguez, I was born in Atlanta, GA, but my parents are from Aguascalientes, Mexico. Dance has always been a part of my life since I knew how to walk. The first classes I began taking were classic ballet and jazz. After a few years, I learned hip hop, and four years ago I joined Ballet Folklorico Sol Azteca at Saint Thomas Church to learn Ballet Folklorico. Ballet Folklorico (folkloric dance) is the traditional Mexican dances, that focuses on different states and regions of Mexico, with different music, vestuario (costumes), skirt movements, postures, choreography, feet, and body movements. Ballet Folklorico is where not only I love to dance but I get to represent my most beautiful culture through the Hispanic community, and I’m proud of that. The video I submitted represents the state of Jalisco with the song of La Madrugada (the dawn) and I’ve created my own set of steps and movements. Hope you like it! """,2.0,"Congratulations!

Tulsa will end our shelter-in-place program and begin Phase One of our recovery at midnight on May 1.

Over the last two months Tulsans have experienced two extremes: the absence of any social distancing practices, which would invite a public health disaster if left in place, and shelter-in-place, which has been effective in slowing the spread of the virus but is not sustainable over the long term.

Our local public health experts tell me we should expect COVID-19 to be with us for a while. The purpose of a phased reengagement moving forward is to identify the middle ground between the above extremes which we can use to go about our lives for the foreseeable future. Different industries have guidelines which will help them reduce risk for employees and patrons during this time.

The City of Tulsa will work with the Tulsa Health Department to enforce state and federal guidelines moving forward.

From 12 cases in Tulsa yesterday to 27 today. We should expect these confirmed cases to continue to rise in Tulsa over the next week as testing capacity increases. The labs that serve our local hospitals have increased their capacity to test patients, and the state is establishing increased testing through our state universities.

The day-by-day increases we will see are more a reflection of this increased capacity than an indicator of the rate at which the virus is spreading. These are not people that suddenly contracted COVID-19 - most of them already had it, but didn’t have testing available to confirm it.

I am told the best way to get in the queue for a test remains contacting your health care provider. If you don’t have one, you can contact 2-1-1 to be connected with a non-profit resource.

Even with increasing capacity, those prioritized first are those hospitalized or under observation by a doctor.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157716001676690&id=177939366689,"NEWSON6.COM

The day-by-day increases we will see are more a reflection of this increased capacity than an indicator of the rate at which the virus is spreading. These are not people that suddenly contracted COVID-19 - most of them already had it, but didn’t have testing available to confirm it.

I am told the best way to get in the queue for a test remains contacting your health care provider. If you don’t have one, you can contact 2-1-1 to be connected with a non-profit resource.

Even with increasing capacity, those prioritized first are those hospitalized or under observation by a doctor.

The proposed calendar has the first day of school starting on Thursday, August 13, which is about a week earlier than has been typical for the district. However, the upside is that it would enable families to take off the entire week of Thanksgiving, and if approved, provide greater balance between the first and second semesters. January 4, 2021, would be the start date for the spring semester. The last day of school – if no snow days were used – would be May 18.

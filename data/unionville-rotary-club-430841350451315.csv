What a wonderful day. Long drive to my club visit today. Saw my friends in Unionville, MO. They have gotten a lot more snow than we have. Very enjoyable visit. Saw the mural and the plans for their pocket park District project. When the snow melts it will be great. Saw the library where their People of Action award winning project took place last year. Delivered last year’s Rotary Citation to IPP Tom. Had a nice visit with AG Joel and President Clint.

The start of the mural and pocket park at the Northwest corner of the square. If all goes as planned the panels will be put up and primed today and painting will start tomorrow. We still have a need for more help--on the scaffolding painting and on the ground making sure the painters have everything they need. Call me at 660-947-7301, text me at 660-626-7803 or email me at tkeedy@nemr.net if you can help. We will find a time a job for you. We need you to be able to commit to at least a 2 hr shift.

Attention Shoes Enthusiasts of District 6040 - Please take a look at this thank-you message from Dickson Masindano, the Executive Director of Buckner Kenya. We send shoes to Kenya every year that include D6040 collections, but this year our caravan (coming up next week!) is specifically highlighting Kenya. He’s thanking our District all for all of the shoes we have sent in the past, and for all of the shoes we will collect this year. Please note -there is a huge danger of jigger parasites for children in Kenya, so the shoes we collect this year will not only send children to school but they will also keep their feet clean, healthy, and free from jiggers.

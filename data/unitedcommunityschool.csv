ALL Picture Days have been pushed back until NEXT WEEK due to this week's daily freezing temperatures. The new schedule will be coming later this week. My apologies, again, for the inconvenience, but we do think you'll be more pleased with your children's pictures when they are not outside and miserable in the cold/rain this week! Next week's forecast is much warmer, with high 50's and 60's temps 😊.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1424428684375234&id=159149137569868,,0.0,"PICTURE DAY POSTPONED!!!

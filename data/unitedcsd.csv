Dear United Families,
We are aware of the Governor’s announcement today that schools will remain closed for the remainder of the school year. This news does not change the plans we have in place today and for the next two weeks. Please continue with our continuous learning plan for the next couple of weeks and expect to get new information next week from your teachers and principal Rumor Clark about next steps. We recognize we need to address items such as technology, getting student items from their lockers and classrooms, and much more. Our team is working quickly so that we can communicate the next steps for United Community. We hope that you and your family are staying well during a difficult time.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1431096823764430&id=450618928478896,,0.0,"A message from UNITED COMM SCHOOL DISTRICT

Dear United Families,

As spring break comes to a close we are thinking about our students and what the next three weeks will bring. The principal will be conducting a virtual staff meeting with teachers next week to learn about the Department of Education recommendations related to this unexpected school closure. There will be further communication with families next week. Additionally we have applied for a waiver so that we too can add grab-&- go lunches to our school community. In the past United has never qualified for this USDA program so we have been working quickly to be able to follow the guidelines required to offer this program.

Our facilities are closed at this time so office phones are not being answered, but emails are being responded to daily. If you have a question, please email

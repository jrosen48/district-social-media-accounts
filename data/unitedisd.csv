I want to give a special thanks to our 3rd grade teacher Mrs. Perez De Llanos from Borchers Elementary. She has been a sweetheart to her class. Seeing the faces of her kids during virtual meetings was the best. Without knowing this pandemic made us realize and value all the great work teachers do. Mrs. Perez has made everything so easy for all her students. She did not only have to help her students she also had to teach us “parents”. She was always answering questions for us. Also, a special thanks to Ms. Lerma our PE coach she made these weeks so fun for our kids, I even participated on the physical activities with our son. Thank you, our counselor Ms. Beltran. All the material she sent would not only help the students, but I also help us as parents during these times of anxiety. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

Today our Athletics Department department handed out almost 200 meals to our UISD Athletics coaches for teacher appreciation week.

Coach Cruz said he was reminded of a couple of things today:
1. These fine hard working coaches are ESSENTIAL to our department and to our students.
2. I miss working alongside them and watching their teams compete and succeed.
3. I miss my amazing office staff of coordinators and assistants and I'm lucky to be surrounded by smart and fun people who put up with me.
4. If you offer food, everyone shows up! 😂
5. Our coaches and staff can't wait to get back to teaching face to face & coaching up our kids. AND
6. It was great to see everyone just healthy and happy to see each other.
Big thanks to Patrick Michael Santos at Pat's Kitchen and his wife for feeding our coaches today! Our coaches and staff appreciated it more than you know. Plus, we got to help a local small business today. WIn win! UISD PROUD! @uisdathletics beyond the X's and O's.",0.0,"United Independent School District added 8 new photos.

February 5th was World Read Aloud Day in our country. This day celebrates the importance of sharing stories in the literacy community. Aside from the joy that stories bring, there are many benefits in sharing a read aloud; so this day is now being observed by 173 countries and counting. Freedom Elementary honored this day, teachers chose a special reader to read a story to a neighboring class. Before the student began their read aloud, they were surprised by a letter from their homeroom teacher. This letter expressed the honor that the teacher felt in having such a great reader and thanked them for sharing their gift of reading to another class. The students were both excited and a little nervous at the beginning of the day. However at the end of the day the readers' smiles and attitude expressed the honor and pleasure of having been selected to read to others. It was a simple celebration but one that will be cemented in the memories of many students.",0.0,"United Independent School District added 6 new photos.

Former United South Baseball Pitcher and Panther Legend Roel Ramirez was inducted into the United ISD League of Legends Program in 2019. Unfortunately, he was unable to attend the induction ceremonies due to his baseball schedule. He paid a special visit to Panther Land on Wednesday, February 5, 2020. He was honored in a ceremony at the school's library, where he spoke to JV and Varsity Baseball and Softball teams about his experience at USHS and his successful baseball career. Ramirez is now in 3AAA baseball in the St. Louis Cardinals organization and is reporting later this week to the Cardinals Spring Training complex in West Palm Beach Florida and reporting with the Major League Team for the Cardinals. Pitchers and catchers report first to the major leagues to start spring training for the first few weeks of spring training. Then followed by the rest of the position players. After several weeks Ramirez will know if he will stay in the bigs with the Cardinals or reassigned to a Triple AAA team.",0.0,"United Independent School District added 5 new photos.

I have inserted the link to the survey below. Can you get this out to all of the agencies and ask them to share it so we can get more data? Please also ask them to let the individuals know that we would like persons taking the survey to only complete one, so if they have already done one they do not need to do another. Thank you!

Dear Pam,

Thank you for staying open and providing the small town of Bolivar with a grocery store. The rules you made really help stop the spread for example only letting one person at a time in the store. That limits big crowds. Also thank you for providing delivery. It really helps those who can’t leave their houses. A huge thank you for all you have done. I hope you and your husband stay safe in this difficult time.

A poem for my teachers.

The Pennsylvania schools have been closed since March 16.
All because of an unprecedented virus
called "" The Covid 19"".

Governor Wolf says we must continue
at home to study and learn.
I am hoping to do well, with passing grades I must earn.

I miss seeing, my teachers, friends and all of the United Schools staff!
I am finishing work for Mrs. Shomo, a
Science 8 study guide and graph.

Next is some work for Mrs. Sexton, some Math 8 review and chapter test.
I will show my work for each equation,
and email her the rest.

Now I have Mr. Cawley, a few English 8
assignments to complete.
A story, a DLR, and a paper on identifying parts of speech.

Lastly I saved Mrs. Shellhammers Social Studies 8 , a ""Lewis and Clark"" quest.
Now finalizing this project to say ......
Thank you!, to my teachers, who are simply ""the best""!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2270839146558799&id=1520041584971896,,0.0,"Credit: Clay Harkleroad

Thank you scientists and doctors at UPMC and the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine for helping with this virus. It is so incredible that you have created the first ever vaccine that doesn’t need refrigeration so that you can send it anywhere. Although it will take about a year to test on humans it is still incredible that the antibodies kill the virus in mice. Thank you for what you are doing and keep it up.

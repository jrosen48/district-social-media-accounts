How sweet it is! Or is it? In ‚ÄúSugar Shock,‚Äù representatives from Building Healthy Communities taught students from University Prep Science and Math Middle School all about sugar: what it is, where it is found, and different types and how they are digested in the body. Students investigated what ‚Äúadded sugar‚Äù means and what happens to the body when it gets too much of it. Then, students put their new knowledge to the test by examining food labels and calculating sugar content using sugar cubes. In many cases, they were shocked to discover how much sugar is in the snacks, foods, and drinks they consume. Finally, students got to sample tropical and berry smoothies. Sweeeeet!

It was important that we acknowledged the historic significance and cultural impact of our ancestors AND celebrated the magic that exists among our diverse black high school student body.

To launch our celebration and campaign, we released an all-senior photo essay, on display in the foyer of the Senior building, along with a mini-documentary chronicling the diverse students in our Anime Club.

Thank you for paving the way, Mr. Micheaux‚ÄºÔ∏èüôåüèΩ

OSCAR DEVEREAUX MICHEAUX (January 2, 1884 ‚Äì March 25, 1951) was an African American author, film director and independent producer of more than 44 films. Although the short-lived Micheaux Book & Film Company produced some films, he is regarded as the first major African-American feature filmmaker, the most successful African-American filmmaker of the first half of the 20th century and the most prominent producer of race films. He produced both silent films and sound films when the industry changed to incorporate speaking actors.

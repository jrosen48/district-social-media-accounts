The Danville School District is seeking input to prepare for the next school year in the event that restrictions remain in place for public schools that make it necessary to do 'schooling' differently.

It is VERY IMPORTANT that each family completes this survey in a timely manner. Some families may receive two emails (one to each parent) but need to complete the survey only ONCE PER FAMILY.

Please complete this survey on or BEFORE FRIDAY, May 29th.

It is possible 'schooling' may look differently for different grade levels/buildings. For this reason, if you have multiple children in our district you will be asked to complete certain questions for each of these children during this survey. You WILL NOT have to fill out this survey for each child you have in the district.

Here are just a couple of announcements for the week of July 7th, 2020. If your student still has any personal belongings at the school, they need to be picked up between July 8th and July 10th from 8 AM to 3 PM. We will be using the same process in place with our surrounding school districts. Any personal belongings not picked up by end of day, July 10th, will be donated to local shelters and clothing donation sites in our area.

Our next Parent Feedback Meeting will be held on Wednesday, July 8th at 6:00 PM. Please check out our Facebook page for the link. Be sure you have the Zoom app downloaded on your device.

Here are just a couple of announcements for the week of July 7th, 2020. If your student still has any personal belongings at the school, they need to be picked up between July 8th and July 10th from 8 AM to 3 PM. We will be using the same process in place with our surrounding school districts. Any personal belongings not picked up by end of day, July 10th, will be donated to local shelters and clothing donation sites in our area.

Our next Parent Feedback Meeting will be held on Wednesday, July 8th at 6:00 PM. Please check out our Facebook page for the link. Be sure you have the Zoom app downloaded on your device.

We hope you had a restful Spring Break! Learning across K-5 resumes today. Students in grades 3-5 should be actively logging on to their computers and engaging in Google Classroom learning. As we shared last week, students in grades K-2 will continue to engage in Instructional Packet learning. A new packet with two-week's worth of learning was mailed to all students in K-2 today. Those packets should arrive to families in K-2 within the next couple of days via postal mail so that learning may resume. We appreciate your continued support as we navigate this new way of ""going to school"" together.

To our many families and community supporters, the Gala Committee on behalf of Upper Mississippi Academy says thank you! Thank you for your generous support, be it financial or in spirit of our recent Spring Gala ~ Connections Count. Together we raised $14,997 toward our goal of $18,000. These monies will help equip Upper Mississippi Academy with newer and upgraded technology that students will use when in school or during distance learning. Students, their families, and the community will also be welcomed into our space with a green wall that you have made possible.

Your support is crucial and strengthens our ability to ensure ALL our students have the necessary resources so they can become the leaders, thinkers, partners, and doers so desperately needed in our world today. Connections Count, our theme for this year’s Gala, couldn’t be more timely as we educate students in what it means to help heal, engage, and work toward solutions.

6th grade students have been raising Rainbow Trout from eggs. Students have been in charge of taking care of the 460 eggs that we received by setting up the tank, insulating the tank, filling the tank, and starting the nitrogen cycle in the tank. The eggs arrived in December, and have grown over an inch in length! 🐟

Students perform tests on the tank almost daily to check the health of the tank, performing water changes as needed. They will release these Rainbow Trout sometime in May at a location in Farmington, MN.

Okay, technically it’s not a crossbow..

The students in Danr’s physics class were told to make a siege engine that measured no more than 4x4x4 feet. A siege engine is something like a catapult or trebuchet, but these kiddos decided to make a ballista instead; which is basically a giant crossbow on a stand.

It was built out of ash planks and 2x4s, and used paracord for the string.

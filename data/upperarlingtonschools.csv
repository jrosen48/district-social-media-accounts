Racism exists and harms our country, our state, our region and Upper Arlington. When we see the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, it reminds us that our African American brothers and sisters in America have fears that we, as white men in Upper Arlington, don’t have. When any member of our American family feels afraid to be in America – when they are afraid to do the simplest of things that the rest of us take for granted – we should all be afraid.

One email won’t erase our historic and current racism. Changing laws alone won’t fix it. But that doesn’t mean that we don’t acknowledge it…",3.0,"Racism permeates every area of society in our country, including schools.

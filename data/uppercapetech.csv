Upper Cape Tech began our continuity of learning through remote learning immediately after the announcement of closure until May 4th. Given the effort exerted by teachers, support staff, students, and parents we feel it is best to continue with the originally scheduled April vacation. Our hope is that teachers, students, and parents will utilize this time to refresh and prepare for whatever comes next as we continue to stay home and defeat this pandemic. This break will also give students who did not start at the onset the opportunity to catch up. In summary, we will not have remote learning occurring during the week of April 20 - 24. Remote learning will resume on April 27th. Students will be expected to check email and Google Classroom for the week's assignment on April 27th.

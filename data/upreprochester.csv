Steve Jobs once said, ""If your working on something exciting that you really care about, you don't have to be pushed. The vision pulls you!""

On tomorrow, we will experience the first tier of that vision being fulfilled!

As a class assignment, Mr. Bogarts CTE class is currently building a shed from the ground up to provide more storage space for our school.

Keeping students engaged is a vital part of UPrep’s program, and hands-on experiences help students both inside and outside of the classroom. Young men at UPrep learn important skills in culinary arts, machining, building trades and information technology through the Career & Technical Education Center (CTE), located on the school’s campus.

Through a two-year program, students gain foundational skills that prepare them for college study or to compete for meaningful employment. Students apply these experiences during their high school careers through opportunities like the Griffin Café, a student-run restaurant that is open weekly to the public.

UPrep works with local colleges to help students gain access to programs, such as machinery, following graduation.

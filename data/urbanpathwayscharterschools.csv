Mr. Kelley says:
Over the last several years I have watched as Danaya has transformed from a shy quiet student who sat in the back of the room and hardly said a word, to a young adult who is not afraid to speak her mind and yet does it in a respectful manner. One thing that has not changed is her desire to succeed, and succeed at a high level. Danaya continued to challenge herself, taking the “hard classes”, though sometimes hesitant in her answers, only because she never wanted to be wrong. Danaya has grown into a young adult that is passionate about her ideas, grades, future, and most importantly her love for all things chocolate.

Danaya, I am very sorry that you and the senior class missed out on an exciting 4th quarter, but more importantly being able to get the Reese's and Hershey Bar that was promised to you. I know whatever you decide to do in the future, you will be great.

Mrs. Kelley says:

When I think of Ronjanae I think of someone with wisdom and maturity beyond her years. Every time Ronjane speaks, she speaks with impact. There is deep thought and wisdom behind her words whether in class or outside of class. Although I had Ronjanae in English class, it was outside of the classroom where I would truly see her shine. She always sees the good in people, and I think that makes her kind. If someone was struggling, she would be there. If someone ever needed a real talk, she was there. If someone just needed a friend, she was there. And if someone was being picked on, you better believe that she was there. Ronjane knows this world is bigger than her, but that she can have an immense effect on the people in it. Her kindness has no limit. In this crazy world there are just some people who are good, and she is one of them!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2619612788142606&id=146220175481892,,0.0,"Please join us as we celebrate Ronjanae Stevens Day at Urban Pathways!

Celebrate by sharing your pride and joy for O'Sha in the comments.

Ms. Beck says:
I can’t even count the number of times I’ve told O’Sha how proud of her I am. If you knew who she was compared to who she is today, you would be proud too. I’ve seen O’Sha grow and mature and overcome all the drama and negativity she once easily engaged in. Today, she stands out as a leader and is willing to give advice to younger students she sees herself in. She recognizes them heading down that same path and shares her own experiences. I know O’Sha is interested in a career in business or maybe real estate, but I do hope she considers opportunities to be involved with youth and continues to be a mentor for young boys and girls.

O’Sha, I appreciate you always being respectful towards me. I thank you for your kindness and wanting to help. Although you’re not heading into news reporting like I always predicted due to your nosiness and knowing all the tea, I know you will be great at whatever you do. Again, I am proud of you and Congratulations!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2600616920042193&id=146220175481892,,0.0,"O'Sha Stanford Day is today!

When I first met you, you were very quiet and wouldn’t say much to me. I’m not sure if it was because you were shy or didn’t know how to take me. You decided to take Spanish and there is where we connected. I learned that you have a great sense of humor. I will always remember you asking “Why?!” whenever I would ask you something.

I want to start off by saying how proud I am of you. You have really broken out of your shell and seeing you grow as a student has been a joy for me. You are incredibly compassionate and hard-working. Thank you for all that you do and for all that you are. I’ll never forget bonding over Three Days Grace and Anime.

Mrs. Kelley says:
There are so many words that come to mind as I try to describe Mahogany Young. She is kind and treats all individuals with respect, even when no one else does. She is a student leader who can make any class discussion gain depth and become memorable. She is brave. She says what needs to be said, not what you want to hear. Finally, Mahogany is unforgettable. She is a stand out student who will continue to be a trailblazer in her future. I could go on and on about words that describe Mahogany, but alas, I only have a small paragraph. I am confident that in the future Mahogany will prove true everything I have said, and more. Mahogany, I felt so lucky to have you as a student.

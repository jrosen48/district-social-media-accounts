Hello again! Today, I want to clarify what Governor Kelly’s “Stay-at-Home Order” that was issued earlier today means for our current operating procedure.

First of all, the governor’s executive order does not change our Continuous Learning Plan. USD 223 will continue to operate with the online classroom routine that we have in place.

However, due to the more restrictive guidelines in the “Stay-at-Home Order,” USD 223 will not serve meals Monday, March 30 or Tuesday, March 31.

""Coach Dice, do you mind if I talk to your team for a few minutes? I was driving by and noticed how hard your team is working. Your team is hungry. They are covered in dirt. Diving after balls. Hustling. I just knew I had to stop and share a story and blessing.""

Mr. Dave Hale played for the Chicago Bears from 1969-1974. He told the girls that one of his best sports memories was the summer he played softball and went undefeated and his coach bought ice cream for the entire team. The girls and I talked about the reference to ice cream as being a God wink.

Mr. Hale also talked about never giving up and how no one expected him to make it to the NFL. He wrapped up his talk and asked if he could give us an Irish blessing. He offered the blessing through tears and having to pause to collect himself. With a fist bump to the players and a kind but firm handshake to me and he was on his way.

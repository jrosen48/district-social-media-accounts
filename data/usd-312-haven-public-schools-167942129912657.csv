USD 312 Haven has received its first guidance from the Reno County Health Department related to ""Gating Criteria"". This criteria uses reno county data to help guide and direct schools related to which learning plan will be used for the following week.

The number of positive cases has actually decreased slightly for Reno County. We hope this trend continues.

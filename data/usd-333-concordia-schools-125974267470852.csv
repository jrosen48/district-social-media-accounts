We have gotten several messages about the Senior signs at the high school, mainly questions about purchasing one for the house.

When we donated these, the intention is to have them at the school for a week or two and then the seniors should grab them and take them home to display in their own yards. We do not want compensated for them directly, if you feel the need to pay for them, please donate whatever you desire to the Cloud County Resource Center or the new Caring for Cloud County program.

Kindergarten graduates: We are sure you have seen your signs also, we are still working on the rest of them, we have been a little busy and will let you all know when they are ready.

Wildside Creative is at Concordia Junior-Senior High School.
April 23 at 4:17 PM · Concordia, KS ·

We have gotten several messages about the Senior signs at the high school, mainly questions about purchasing one for the house.

When we donated these, the intention is to have them at the school for a week or two and then the seniors should grab them and take them home to display in their own yards. We do not want compensated for them directly, if you feel the need to pay for them, please donate whatever you desire to the Cloud County Resource Center or the new Caring for Cloud County program.

2020 CHS Seniors - We are Proud of You!

Kindergarten graduates: We are sure you have seen your signs also, we are still working on the rest of them, we have been a little busy and will let you all know when they are ready.

Rationale: We tried to buy some time with a late start to see if the fog would subside. The fog remains, and is continuing to freeze on the roads making the non treated blacktops and sand surfaces very slick. Although late start buys us a couple more hours, the temperature looks to stay below freezing until 11 and our buses depart 2 hours before school begins and the call needs to be made now for food service and transportation.

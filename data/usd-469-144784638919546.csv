Parents... During this crisis, please remember that school is important, but it's not all that can be taught during this time. I understand the stress you are in, but if it's not benefitting your family, stop and try something fun. Use the time to have fun family discussions or play a board game. Presence is just as important as learning. If you need anything or any advice, please don't hesitate to reach out to your teachers, principals, social workers, psychologists, and counselors.

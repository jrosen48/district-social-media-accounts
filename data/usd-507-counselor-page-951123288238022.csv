Good evening parents,

On Wednesday from 3:00 to 6:00 your student’s school materials and technology devices will be available for pick up. GS pick up will be spread out around the GS building. JH and HS pick up will be outside the concession stand doors of the HS. This will be a drive up pick up. We ask that you and your children remain in your vehicle. Teachers will come to you in your vehicle. The technology devices will require a parent/guardian signature to be released. They can not be released other than to a parent/guardian. If you know you do not want your child's school devices to go home with you, please email the principal at hstegman@usd507.org to request they be taken out of your child's bag.

We also ask that if your child has library books, school uniforms, or other school materials that you bring them. Teachers will be able to take those.

We appreciate your continued support and patience.

that everyone has the right to attend a school where they feel included, valued, and respected.

that it is my responsibility to protect the members of my school community by standing up against bullying, harassment, and exclusion.

that I must challenge and report incidents of discriminating behavior, working together to demonstrate that hate will not be tolerated here.

that my school is worth fighting for and is a place where I can find people who support me in the same way I support them. Because of this, I will do more than “just show up.” Instead, I will work continuously to improve our school, our community, and myself.

Going back to school can be expensive! This year the newly formed SPEAR Project (Students Providing Educational and Athletic Resources) hopes to move beyond the USD 507 Care Closet’s efforts to provide food and personal hygiene assistance to students in need by helping to ensure that all students have the things they need to be successful. If you’re in need of a little extra help (maybe with football cleats or volleyball kneepads or three-ring binders) simply fill out a form (https://docs.google.com/document/d/13z_mCE7Jk4aCHijbwFxi-Lp3ZzbODgTh_D5N69QVif0/edit?usp=sharing) and return it to Christy in the high school office. This service is currently focusing on students in grades 6-12.

Please note that while SPEAR is associated with the FCCLA Care Closets project, it is not meant to replace it any way. Nutritional and personal hygiene items will still be available for both high school and grade school students.

If you would like to donate toward either the SPEAR or Care Closets projects, checks can be made out to Satanta High School with FCCLA Care Closets in the memo line.",0.0,"Satanta High School

This afternoon we host a high school volleyball quad that begins at 4:30. If you plan on attending, please know that since this is an indoor event, everyone is now required to wear a mask while in the gym.
This is in response to a Covid outbreak at a neighboring district that is dealing with several severe cases. Please help us keep our school open and our activities going. If you would like to watch the matches remotely, you can log onto our school website usd220.net and scroll down to our livestream broadcast.

During this event, social distancing guidelines will be in effect, reducing our seating capacity. Therefore, each student's family will have a section reserved on the gym floor with overflow family seating on the south side . Community members and friends will have limited seating on the north side.

Additionally, we encourage everyone to wear a mask if you choose to attend, especially those who are at risk, may have been exposed to large groups or gatherings, or been to an area with a high infection rate.

This event will be live streamed for those who would rather watch the event instead of attending in person.

We appreciate your support and understanding as we must comply with specific social distancing guidelines for the safety of our students, staff, and patrons.

USD 220 will be holding our 8th grade promotion and High School commencement on Sunday, July 5th.

The promotion ceremony begins at 4:00 PM, while the Baccalaureate will begin at 5:00 PM, and Graduation at 5:30 PM.

During this event, social distancing guidelines will be in effect, reducing our seating capacity. Therefore, each student's family will have a section reserved on the gym floor with overflow family seating on the south side . Community members and friends will have limited seating on the north side.

Additionally, we encourage everyone to wear a mask if you choose to attend, especially those who are at risk, may have been exposed to large groups or gatherings, or been to an area with a high infection rate.

This event will be live streamed for those who would rather watch the event instead of attending in person.

We appreciate your support and understanding as we must comply with specific social distancing guidelines for the safety of our students, staff, and patrons.

Thank you.",2020-07-02 17:40:54,,

Mrs. Walker and her class decided that they wanted to raise some funds when the Clark County rivals got together on the court. Thanks to the generosity of patrons from both towns, a total of $661.00 dollars was raised last night. After the 50/50 raffle was paid, each family received $150.00.
Thank you to Haley Walker and her Class of 2023 for showing us what good neighbors do for each other.",2020-01-15 16:29:35,,

We can’t wait to get the children back in school.

If you are bringing your child to school, pre-K through first grade, drop off your child off at the elementary wing. The second through fourth grade students need dropped off at the main 2 story building. Please drop your child off between 7:30 and 7:40, so they will have plenty of time to eat breakfast before class starts. For the first semester, breakfast will be free to all elementary students.

We will be taking the temperature of all the students and staff as they arrive and they will also sanitize their hands. Shortly after, the students will eat breakfast in their classrooms.

Please send your child with a backpack, mask, and water bottle.

It is so important, especially this year, to keep your phone number updated, so we can contact you in an emergency.

Mrs. Hall and Staff

Unity

I dreamed I stood in a studio
And watched two sculptors there,
The clay they used was a young child’s mind,
And they fashioned it with care.

One was a teacher; the tools he used
Were books and music and art;
One a parent with a guiding hand,
And a gentle, loving heart.

Day after day the teacher toiled,
With touch that was deft and sure,
While the parent labored by his side
And polished and smoothed it o’er.

And when at last their task was done,
They were proud of what they had wrought,
For the things they had molded into the child
Could neither be sold nor bought.

And each agreed he would have failed
If he had worked alone,
For behind the parent stood the school,
And behind the teacher, the home.

Thank you for being patient, we are almost there!



We plan to have your graduation ceremony on Friday, July 10th at 8 PM outdoors on the Frank Jameson Field. If weather prevents that ceremony from occurring, we will move it to the next night (July 11th) at the same time.



We will have a graduation practice on Monday, July 6th at 8 PM. Please attend.



Many of you have asked about diplomas and reimbursement of Seniors Fees. All of those will be distributed the day of the ceremony. If you need these items before that date, please contact the GHS office and set up an appointment.



A letter will be coming in the mail soon with all of the details for the week.





Go Trojans!



Mr. Ferguson",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2811755392268649&id=254565274654353,,0.0,"Seniors,



Thank you for being patient, we are almost there!



We plan to have your graduation ceremony on Friday, July 10th at 8 PM outdoors on the Frank Jameson Field. If weather prevents that ceremony from occurring, we will move it to the next night (July 11th) at the same time.



We will have a graduation practice on Monday, July 6th at 8 PM. Please attend.



Many of you have asked about diplomas and reimbursement of Seniors Fees. All of those will be distributed the day of the ceremony. If you need these items before that date, please contact the GHS office and set up an appointment.



A letter will be coming in the mail soon with all of the details for the week.





Go Trojans!

Unfortunately, they were unable to complete their chocolate covered pretzel rod fundraiser, so they decided to take what was left and donate to local entities who have continued to work during COVID-19.

Their first group was the US Post office. Mrs. Lance delivered chocolate covered pretzels and coffee from Scooters Drive-Thru to honor them for their hard work while also supporting a local business.

K-Kids officers also joined The Post Master, Robert Vacca, on a zoom call during their visit. Way to go, Dragons!

Teachers, we are so very grateful for each and every one of you. Thank you for ALL you are doing. The unprecedented times have called for so many adjustments, but in true teacher fashion, you are getting it done 👏.
You are leading with grace, encouraging with big love, and rising to daily challenges. 🙌

Our mission is to raise money for teacher grants, student scholarships, and enhancement of school facilities. The highlight of the year is awarding scholarships to our seniors.

Last Sunday, we should have been celebrating the Pitzer Family Scholarship Banquet with 50 seniors, their families, and the donors who provide the scholarships — we awarded more than $51,000 this year! The COVID19 pandemic meant canceling that celebration.

But we're determined to recognize these students, their families, and the scholarship donors, so we're holding a Virtual Foundation Scholarship Banquet here. Over the next few weeks, we will highlight each of them!

We hope you'll follow along and get to know our seniors and the Foundation scholarships that will help them achieve their dreams.

We have had so many of you reach out asking how you can volunteer to help. We deeply appreciate your support and we are very grateful that you want to help our Dragons.

The best way you can help our Dragons right now is to practice social distancing and follow the guidelines provided by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. This means we need you to stay home and limit contact with our students, staff, and families.

If you are joining us at a food route location, please continue to practice social distancing and limit contact with others around you.

Anytime you put “1st EVER” in front of something it’s usually something special!
Well, this inaugural year of Girls Wrestling across the State of Kansas has been cool to see!
Our two ladies both made history for PHS by not only becoming the “1st EVER” to compete at SEK Girls League Tournament but to also becoming the “1st EVER” to Medal at Girls League!

170- Mercedes Angeles(Jr) goes 2-2 w/ 2 Falls.
Dropping two close battles to the Champ & Runner-Up to finish in 🥉

116- Rebeccah Jones(Jr) goes 1-1 w/ a Major in the semifinals, to finish SEK League Runner-Up 🥈

Congrats to ALL the girls that made History!
It only gets bigger with “1st EVER” KSHSAA Girls East Regional in Paola on Friday & Saturday!

Time to earn a trip to the “1st EVER” Girls State Tournament‼️

A big congratulations goes out to Dr. Amy Bartlow. She received the University of Northern Colorado's Dean's Citation Award at her doctoral graduation. This award is given to less than 3% of doctoral graduates at UNC and is based on research and feedback from the dissertation committee and faculty.

Bartlow received her BSE in Early/Late Childhood in 2007 and Master of Science in Teaching (Elementary) in 2014. Congrats, Dr. Amy Bartlow! #OAGAAG #gorillateaching",2019-12-16 12:44:01,,

Another Huge THANK YOU to all the special folks that gave to the Salvation Army through our kettle. Your donation not only benefited the Salvation Army but 3 other local organizations as well! The 3rd group we were able to give to was Club 209 A.

Club 209A is a partnership with Community in Schools & PHS Counseling Services Office.

Club 209A is a resource that serves the tangible needs of our students. Our student services team works to meet the emotional, mental health, and wellness but they saw a gap in providing tangible items for our students and their families. Items in the Club 209A vary from, clothing to non perishable food items.

If you are interested in contributing to 209A please contact the PHS Counseling office at 620-235-3200 or email Susan Russian at srussian@usd250.org.

Thanks to the support of Kansas Public Broadcasters, Kansas students will receive supplemental education content by way of a new television program produced by Kansas PBS stations and KSDE, and hosted by local teachers. The new program called Learning Across Kansas will begin airing the week of April 20.

Each 30-minute segment, individually produced for elementary, middle school and high school students, will feature grade-specific educational content delivered by our very own Kansas teachers who serve on KSDE’s Continuous Learning Task Force.

Teachers, students and parents/caregivers, tune in for short, fun and engaging lessons. Plus, you just might see one of your own teachers presenting!

The first lesson launches today, Wednesday, April 8th. The lessons will be shared on social media and on our YouTube channel. Each lesson is short, approximately 5 minutes each, and also includes an activity sheet for them to complete afterward. The lessons are created for students up to a 5th grade level.

After completing a lesson, students will earn an “SNB Buck”. They will save their bucks and bring them into the bank at the completion of the series to buy a prize.

Their hope is that kids can easily learn more about banking and finances from home. Learning about healthy money habits at a young age is becoming even more important in today’s society. Thank you for supporting our students and families!

For JH and HS girls who have been going to weights but won't quite have their ten days before volleyball camp

We will have a conditioning session during camp time that will have a volleyball focus. It will be held at the High School but not in the same gym. If you are already attending summer weights and conditioning, it still only counts as one day-but do attend both. Once you have met your ten day requirement, you are welcome to come join camp. The start times will match the volleyball camp but the conditioning session might be shorter.

The focus of conditioning will be ""on general conditioning including stretching, running, lifting, agility drills, and sport specific movements. Sport specific equipment is permitted for drill purposes. All activities are subject to social distancing and group size limits."" (KSHSAA FAQ's).

Please help spread the word to girls (especially to those who cannot see this) who intend on coming to camp but won't have their ten by Monday, June 22. This will allow them to get some volleyball specific skills in on the days they cannot attend camp.",0.0,"Tammy Mann Jirak

All Chase County Residents are encouraged to wear face masks while in public spaces.

Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when around others

You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick.

Everyone should wear a cloth face cover when they have to go out in public, for example to the grocery store or to pick up other necessities.

Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

The cloth face cover is meant to protect other people in case you are infected.

Do NOT use a face mask meant for a healthcare worker.
Continue to keep about 6 feet between yourself and others. The cloth face cover is not a substitute for social distancing.

Today, following the news of the worst COVID-19 spike in Kansas, I announced that I will issue an executive order next Monday to delay opening schools until after the Labor Day holiday. The order will also make commonsense public health tools like masks, hygiene protocols, and temperatures checks mandatory for every school when they reopen.

Every action I have taken throughout this pandemic has been in done with three things in mind: Keeping Kansans healthy, keeping our state open for business and getting our kids back to school.

Real leaders aren’t afraid to confront crises head on, they don’t sit back silently and wait for the situation to get worse. That’s what I have done and will continue to do, regardless of the political consequences.",9.0,"Governor Laura Kelly

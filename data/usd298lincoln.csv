We are excited to announce that Kansas teachers, students and parents just got a new partner in their continuous learning efforts.

Thanks to the support of Kansas Public Broadcasters, Kansas students will receive supplemental education content by way of a new television program produced by Kansas PBS stations and KSDE, and hosted by local teachers. The new program called Learning Across Kansas will begin airing the week of April 20.

Each 30-minute segment, individually produced for elementary, middle school and high school students, will feature grade-specific educational content delivered by our very own Kansas teachers who serve on KSDE’s Continuous Learning Task Force.

Teachers, students and parents/caregivers, tune in for short, fun and engaging lessons. Plus, you just might see one of your own teachers presenting!

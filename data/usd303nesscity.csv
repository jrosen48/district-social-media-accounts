Due to this information, we found it necessary to have the Ness County Sheriff’s office come and investigate. They brought the K9 units from Gove and Hodgeman County to do a search of the buildings. Due to the search of the building, NCHS was on lockdown for about 45 minutes today.

Through the investigation marijuana was found and the individual(s) is being dealt with according to district policy. We have concluded the searches and the school day has resumed, however this investigation is ongoing.

There was no danger to any of the students or staff here at the Jr/Sr High School. I ask that you please take this as an opportunity to talk with your student(s) about drug use.

Due to this being a student matter, I ask that you refrain from calling with questions.

While videos and other messages cover a lot of ground, some topics deserve a deeper dive. This is why we’re creating a new podcast titled Talk305.

For this first podcast, hear from Jacy Murphy as she discusses her virtual kindergarten classroom through Meadowlark Ridge Elementary. Jacy talks about ways she connects with her young students. She tells of a lesson about baby animals where students were asked to find examples in their own environment. In his own backyard, one student saw a family of three baby bunnies and dictated to his mother a report for Jacy. The student’s mother was able to capture the moment on her phone and sent the attached picture to Jacy.

Superintendent Linn Exline hosts the conversation with Jacy on this new podcast that explores the heart of education. You can find the podcast on the usd305.com website. If you have an idea for a podcast topic, comment on this post! #Why305

What you might not know is that your decision to participate in the upcoming census in April 2020 will have a huge impact on our community and our state for the next decade. Funding based on the census count affects education, school lunch programs, Head Start programs, nutrition programs, highway funds and more.

It is critical that everyone is counted! #Salinaks #everyonecounts",2020-02-14 17:17:12,,

Everyone wants to know: Who is Joe?

This is Joe’s Pet Project’s fifth 305 LIVE, and they are thrilled to be back. Rocking together for nearly two decades, Joe’s Pet Project (JPP) is one big happy musical experiment. Members are spread across the country and assemble several times a year to play shows and create new material in a fast-paced improvisational setting. The result is a five-piece jam band known for their euphoric live performances of diverse originals and eclectic covers. In Salina, JPP plays wherever the town will have them, be it headlining the Smoky Hill River Festival or playing on the back of a trailer bed. Together they wrote the rock theatre piece STILLWATER that premiered at Kansas City Repertory Theatre and was subsequently performed in concert at Joe’s Pub, NYC.

They are all proud products of the USD 305 school system, and no, no one’s named Joe. www.joespetproject.com

This is Joe’s Pet Project’s fifth 305 LIVE, and they are thrilled to be back. Rocking together for nearly two decades, Joe’s Pet Project (JPP) is one big happy musical experiment. Members are spread across the country and assemble several times a year to play shows and create new material in a fast-paced improvisational setting. The result is a five-piece jam band known for their euphoric live performances of diverse originals and eclectic covers. In Salina, JPP plays wherever the town will have them, be it headlining the Smoky Hill River Festival or playing on the back of a trailer bed. Together they wrote the rock theatre piece STILLWATER that premiered at Kansas City Repertory Theatre and was subsequently performed in concert at Joe’s Pub, NYC.

They are all proud products of the USD 305 school system, and no, no one’s named Joe. www.joespetproject.com

Stay tuned: tomorrow we will introduce all the members of Joe's Pet Project.",2020-01-27 16:11:36,,

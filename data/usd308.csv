0,3.0,,20.0,,4413939025342793,"Greetings 308 Families-

Each Friday the Reno County Health Department releases the 14 day PTR (positive test rate) and the 14 day new case average. This is the second week in a rolling two week average for schools.

Currently the numbers are:
14 Day PTR-9/11, 7.3%
14 Day New Case-9/11, 67

I have added a short video to this week's communication in hopes of better explaining these numbers and how we are using them.

The good news is we are showing a slight downward trend in both of these numbers from the previous week. It continues to be crucial that we all do our best to help keep our schools open by wearing masks, staying home when sick, washing hands regularly, and social distancing.

I have attached the 308 Gating Criteria in case you missed it last week.

Your students continue to do an excellent job with our safety procedures. We look forward to having a full week of school next week. Have a wonderful weekend.

Thanks again for your support of our school district!

Meals will be offered from 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Monday through Friday at the HMS-7, HMS-8, McCandless and the Library. Fairgrounds Splash Park offers meals from 11:30 to 12:15 p.m.

Meals are free for anyone 18 and younger but the student/child must be present in the vehicle, or the driver must show a Grab and Go Meal Pass. For each student/child, they will receive one lunch for that day and breakfast for the following morning with additional food for Saturday provided on Friday. We also will allow families to pick up meal passes so that children don't have to be in the car when they receive their meals in the future.

Lunch entrees for the week of June 8 include:
Monday: Soft Taco
Tuesday: BBQ Rib Sandwich
Wednesday: Ham & Cheese Sandwich
Thursday: Fiestada Pizza
Friday: PB&J
Saturday: Ham & Cheese Munchable and Goldfish Cracker

Each meal has additional items including fruit and veggies as well as milk.",2020-06-07 07:00:20,,

Norris has taught art for the district for about 2 years. On a normal day, you can find her in her HMS-8 classroom that has wonderful murals painted on the walls helping students reach their potential.

""I love watching my students get a spark of creativity,"" Norris said. ""When they get excited to create something, there’s nothing more rewarding.""

Norris is proud to be an art teacher and says the art is vital to education because it gives students and opportunity to express themselves.

""Art is so important for students,"" Norris said. ""It gives them a creative outlet and opportunities to work in a hands-on way that they don’t get throughout most of the school day.""",2020-03-10 13:00:08,,

Debra Ringler, Art Teacher, has been teaching at Hutchinson Public Schools for 22 years.

""The most rewarding part of my job is not only teaching them all I know about art, but watching them grow, change and experience success,"" Ringler said.

On a normal day, you can find Ringler in her room at Hutchinson High School adorned with paper machè masks, working with students on a throwing wheel for pottery. Some of the bowls for the annual Empty Bowls fundraiser, held at Hutch Art Center, are made in her room.

""The community can help by staying on top of what the schools are doing with the art programs,"" Ringler said. ""Another way for the community to get involved with Youth Art is to support the Empty Bowls sale that HHS students put on to help the Reno County Food Bank.""

Police in Texas have verified the Snap came from Texas. The HHS student shared that posting as well. It had nothing to do with HHS or Hutchinson.

As word spread, it became embellished with additional rumors about a video, which were investigated as well.

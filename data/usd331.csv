At approximately 11:30 a.m. this morning, a 5th grade girl left KEMS without permission. We originally thought she was hiding in the school building so a lockdown of the school was initiated to facilitate a search for the student by staff and local police. As part of the search we reviewed video surveillance and determined she left the building. The search was then expanded to the blocks surrounding the school.

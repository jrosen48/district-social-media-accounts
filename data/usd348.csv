Kansans to receive maximum benefit

Governor Laura Kelly and Department for Children and Families Secretary Laura Howard today announced the agency will begin issuing an emergency food assistance benefit to current program households. The emergency allotment increases a household’s monthly benefit to the maximum allowed for the size of the family. The maximum monthly benefit for a family of four is $646.



No application is necessary to receive the emergency funds. Families should start to see their March emergency benefit on their EBT card beginning April 15. The distribution will follow the standard alphabetical schedule. DCF will distribute April emergency benefits in mid to late May.

Households that already receive the maximum monthly allotment are not eligible for emergency assistance. The allotment is for March and April only.

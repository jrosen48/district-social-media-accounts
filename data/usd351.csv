Ken Hagen
My favorite Highschool memory is impossible to pick because there is so many. But overall being with my friends, cracking jokes and laughing will be something I'll never forget.
My advice for underclassmen: would be to just relax, enjoy the ride, but still get what needs to be done, done without stressing to much.
Future Plans:I don't have a set plan for the future, but my goal is to finalize my EMT job, and to be better off then what I am now.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2575338292754853&id=1549146145374078,,0.0,"Senior Spotlight!

Many people do not realize, but a single shoe can have as many as dozens of parts that are sewn, stitched and glued together. Some components of shoes may include rubber parts for the shoe soles. Unfortunately, when shoes end up in landfills, they cause a lot of harm to the environment and the health of people.

The decomposition process for shoes takes many, many years‚Äì‚Äìdecades. As shoes begin to decompose, they begin to release toxins into the air. These toxins are dangerous to human health, which is why people who live close to landfills may have a higher incidence of respiratory illnesses.

The decomposition process is also harmful to the environment because those toxins that go into the air and seep into the soil are poisons that affect our natural environment. What‚Äôs worse is that, depending on the components of any shoe, it can take as many as 80 to 100 years for a shoe to decompose completely.

We hosted several school districts today! Student activities for Child Nutrition and Wellness included a scavenger hunt in the morning to find clues and perform tasks related to creating a healthier school environment and modeling level policies in the Kansas School Wellness Policy Guidelines. This afternoon, they created “story walks” to share their own stories on how students can be advocates for creating a healthier school environment.

Child Nutrition & Wellness is hosting five interactive regional workshops focused on actions to implement modeling level wellness policies. Participants hear best practices, gain knowledge, and obtain resources to help their schools envision and create a healthier school environment.

Recently Karsen had his state reading assessment for the first time outside of Kansas. He scored so well I thought it appropriate to compliment USD 379 and the teachers who work so hard every single day. Sometimes when you live in an area for a long time you're blinded by privileges that you don't even realize are at your finger-tips. Keep in mind our new school district ranks among the top in the state of Florida and Karsen's school (grades 3-5) alone has a population of nearly 1,000 students. For him to stand out in this way is a testament to where he came from and the emphasis put on early literacy...thank you Lincoln teachers for what you do every single day. Just wanted to give you a glimpse of how you stand out in the nation...its HUGE!! Thank you especially Rhonda Richter, Jennifer Swihart, Kelli Hays, Andy Bent, Matt Weller, Cheryl Payne....I mean my list could go on forever. I miss you all and am so blessed to call you friends. The seeds you've sewn continue to bear fruit....thank you.",0.0,"Wendy Kiewel

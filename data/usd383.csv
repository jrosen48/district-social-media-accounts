IMPORTANT INFORMATION!!!!!

Beginning on Thursday April 2nd we will be allowing parents or guardians to pick up a meal permit for their children’s meals.

This meal permit will allow a parent to pick up the number of meals on your permit without your children needing to be in the car. Beginning April 2nd the number given on the permit will be based on the number of children in the vehicle when the permit is issued.

This means in order for all children in your household to receive a meal you must bring all of them on the day you pick up your permit. Once you receive your permit then you will just need to have the permit hanging on your rear view mirror in order to receive meals.

You are still welcome to bring your children with you as we do enjoy seeing them.

We are hoping by allowing families to pick up meals without children will help limit the risk of exposure for both families and our staff.",18.0,"Important information for meals!

Making sure you're well stocked on the essentials is smart with uncertainty about how COVID-19 social distancing recommendations could affect your daily routine and your family's needs. Regardless of how COVID-19 spreads, however, Riley County will NOT order the closure of grocery stores or pharmacies.

So, buy what you need to provide for your family for up to two weeks for general preparedness. But there's no need to stock up for any more than that. A little consideration for our neighbors is going to go a long way as we get through this together. #KansasStrong",23.0,"Riley County Health Department

Sure had fun with these future project managers from our partner classroom at USD 383: Marlatt Elementary School! They learned a little about the job of a PM then studied some plans and got a schedule written to build their own projects. Lots of hot tubs and pools in their designs, like their style!!

Being remodelers, we don’t typically build from the ground up. We made an exception though in order to help Mrs. Snyder’s 4th grade class build gingerbread houses. I think there are some future architects in this bunch!

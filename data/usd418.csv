Keeping our schools safe and healthy is one of the main goals for USD 418. We are working closely with the McPherson County Health Department and KDHE to stay informed about the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). Currently there are NO confirmed cases in Kansas.

Here are some general recommendations to help prevent the spread of any respiratory virus, including the Novel Coronavirus:
*Wash hands frequently with soap and water. Hand sanitizer is ok if soap and water is not available.
*Wipe down frequently touched surfaces (computer mouse, cell phone, door handles, etc)
*Stay home if you aren’t feeling well
*Avoid those who are sick
*Stay healthy-eat well, get plenty of sleep, & stay hydrated.

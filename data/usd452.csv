With the next re-opening phase, the summer lunch program will also move forward! We are SO excited to say hello to all our kids!

1. To receive a lunch, the child/youth must be present. Parents can not pick up a meal without the child being present.

2. Pre-packed individual meals and Family Quick Pick Up meals will end.

3. Kids will line up outside - social distancing will be encouraged.

4. A volunteer will greet the kids at The Old Store door – Five (5) kids will be allowed into the store at a time to walk through a buffet line.

5. Once the child has received their meal, they will exit the store and should return home to eat their meal.

6. A Friday meal will continue to be handed out on Thursday. The number of meals will be limited to the amount of leftovers we have available. First Come/First Serve.

Today, right now at exactly 3:00 pm, the gym should be filled with family, friends, classmates, teammates, teachers, and community members celebrating these 30 young men and women. They should be receiving their high school diploma with all of us cheering them on! However, this day will have to wait, but honoring them will not!

Come cheer them on this evening at 6:00 pm as they drive down main street!

Congratulations to the Class of 2020!",2020-05-10 16:20:08,,

Dear Parents/Guardians,

This Wednesday, March 4, our 7-12th grade students will be traveling to Lakin for a presentation. The presenter will be former NBA player, Chris Herren. Mr. Herren will be speaking about the dangers of substance abuse, and he will be sharing from his life experiences.

The students and staff will be leaving at 8:30 a.m. and will be returning to the school at around 1:00 p.m. This will be considered a normal day of school, so if they are not going to attend, they need to be excused by a parent. Sack lunches will be taken, or students have been given the option to bring their own lunch.

If you have any questions, please contact Mr. Siebert at the HS office 620-492-6284.

The banners have been hung and added to the gym wall for the 2019 Boys State Track Champs, 2019 Girls State Cross Country Champs, and 2019 Boys State Cross Country Champs! We are proud of the Trojans and their coaches! Also, Congratulations to Peyton Peterson and Yessenia Ornelas on earning the Cross Country Academic All-State Honor!

And finally, a HUGE congratulations to Coach Mike Horton on being named the 2A Cross Country Coach is the Year and the All-Class Cross Country Coach is the year!",2020-01-08 09:20:15,,

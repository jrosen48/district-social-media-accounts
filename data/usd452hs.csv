This Wednesday, March 4, our 7-12th grade students will be traveling to Lakin for a presentation. The presenter will be former NBA player, Chris Herren. Mr. Herren will be speaking about the dangers of substance abuse, and he will be sharing from his life experiences.

The students and staff will be leaving at 8:30 a.m. and will be returning to the school at around 1:00 p.m. This will be considered a normal day of school, so if they are not going to attend, they need to be excused by a parent. Sack lunches will be taken, or students have been given the option to bring their own lunch.

If you have any questions, please contact Mr. Siebert at the HS office 620-492-6284.

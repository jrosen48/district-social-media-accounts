The Marais des Cygnes Valley Board of Education believes that it is greatly important to recognize and honor outstanding teachers on an annual basis. In order to recognize those outstanding teachers, the Board established the USD 456 Teacher of the Year Award in 2018. This award is given to teachers who have demonstrated superior ability and exceptional skills, and have gained the respect and admiration of the community they serve. The award will be determined through a nomination process that will include students, staff, and community members and then selected by the board of education. Recipients of the award are then nominated by the district for the Kansas State Department of Education's Teacher of the Year program.

Please follow the link below to nominate a teacher you feel is worthy of this honor!

The current “free for all” meals will end sometime soon and we want to be prepared. Also, funding for various school related programs is linked to these applications.

The official student count day is September 21st. Additional state funding allocations are given to distribute based on the number of students who qualify for free/reduced meals and the information is based on the outcomes of submitted applications by that date.

When the funding for the free meal program runs out, students will return to full pay for meals unless we have a current approved application on file.

Eight and nine o’clock hours on Thursday and Friday mornings.

It was, as usual, tons of fun and loud as the kiddos loved cheering on the staff who flipped pancakes up and down the gym floor. Two teams, coached by a stack of pancakes and a bottle of maple syrup and an announcer decked out like a box of butter began the event. The two teams were all decked out with their ""names"", aprons and more! Mad flipping prevailed and the winners were honored with a gold plated syrup bottle and spatula while the runner up team received gold plated silverware. Lots of fun!!

Today was our Fall Leadership Assembly and what a wonderful morning we had at Whittier!! The assembly began with a terrific message from our guest speaker, City Manager Taggart Wall! We were so pleased with his speech and very proud of this USD 465 2007 WHS Graduate! He had the entire group in a pledge about how strong, how smart and how kind they are and can be! Sixteen students were honored by staff for their demonstration of character traits that help create our future leaders!! From Kindergarten through Fifth Grade, students were surprised when their names were called (it was a secret!) and their families were present beaming with pride. After the assembly, students hung their pictures on our Leadership Bulletin Board in the Leadership Hallway. Another great day at Camp Whittier and it all happened during American Education Week!!

Children learn best when they can access their executive skills in their prefrontal lobe. In times of distress, when BIG feelings get ahold of us, we can't access those skills, because we are operating from a different part of our brains.

We've been working on deep belly breathing and being a S.T.A.R. (Smile, take a deep breath, and relax) to help us move to a higher center in our brains, so we can think and solve problems! In this photo, we are watching our Feeling Buddies move up and down as we take slow, deep breaths.

Learning to manage feelings must be as intentional as learning to read.

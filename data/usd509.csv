SENIOR SPOTLIGHT

Meet Mariah Newberry. Mariah moved to South Haven five years ago. Mariah has many memories from high school, but she says her favorite memories are Coach Heater's pregame locker room pep talks.

Mariah plans to attend Cowley County Community College in the Fall. She plans to pursue her degree in Secondary Education. She would like to thank her grandparents for pushing her to be better even when she had thoughts of giving up.

Mariah, your kind and patient leadership has been a treasure to South Haven. We are so proud of you, and cannot wait to follow where life takes you. SHS is grateful you became a Cardinal!",2020-04-06 13:45:55,,

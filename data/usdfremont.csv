This week we're celebrating Classified School Employee Week, with an extra weight to our appreciation this year.

We have seen classified employees serving students, families and communities in an extra visible way through this pandemic, from food service to communications, technology distribution to kindergarten enrollment.

We've also seen how much we've always relied on classified employees, perhaps taking their service and impact for granted.

To all of you who support students through school, from the first day of kindergarten to high school graduation: THANK YOU! We see you and value your work more than words can express.",7.0,"We are happy to celebrate Classified School Employee Week in recognition of all they do, both on the front lines and behind the scenes, in support of students.

We are asking for area residents to continue reporting any suspicious activity that they may see at these schools. This includes people on campus in the middle of the night, subjects using flashlights, sounds of broken glass or forced entry, as well as any sounding alarms.

Schools may be closed, but our work is certainly not closed!
We've partnered with Fremont USD to provide $10,000, which will be used to support students needs during this school closure.

We're also helping the Tri-City Health Center secure some much needed supplies. They see many of our FUSD students for vaccines, well checks, sport health check ups and more. If you would like to join in our teamwork, please see their supply needs below!

Congratulations to USHS for bringing home High Point once again, it’s truly become a tradition😍 Even with deductions they still out scored all small high school teams💪🏼 USHS has taken home 1st in their division since 2015! What an accomplishment🥳

USMS absolutely killed their performance today!🙌🏼 They had a “Hit Zero” routine (no deductions)🥳 We as coaches have never been so proud to take home 3rd place. All of the teams in the Junior High Advanced division were incredible and they came out in the top 3!🤩

We are so very proud of these teams today and can not wait to take on the rest of our season! If you haven’t seen them compete yet.. you won’t want to miss these show-stopping performances. 🟠🐏⚫️

This is where this object is the most effective, despite some people who don‚Äôt like to improve in the off season thinking it‚Äôs best kept in a closet or under a bed. Much like it‚Äôs wild counterpart, the domestic soccer ball also likes to be taken out into the yard, even now in times of isolation as it‚Äôs been proven one person can subdue the beast. If you find yourself unable to control a soccer ball on your own, younger siblings have been shown to be effective as alternative ball retrievers. So, take your soccer ball out in fresh air and don‚Äôt leave it in a dark closet. #SoccerBallAbuseAwareness",2020-03-17 17:09:59,,

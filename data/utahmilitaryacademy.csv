One cadet's answer to the question-What has been one of your favorite UMA moments or memories this year?

"" The bus rides for basketball, the dumb interactions in the hallway. Snow-cones in the Mrs. Daniels room. A shot in the leg from a tootsie roll. So many things that are distinctly UMA and make me feel at home. I've grown a lot this year and experienced more. I fell for someone for the first time and got to feel the pain of rejection. I was pushed just a little bit this year and got to feel the reward of hard work. I got to see a community mourn and rely on each other, a beautiful thing. The days tend to slip by so fast that I forget how lucky I am to live my life and do what I do.

As many of you know, I dabble in theater. I'm currently rehearsing for a comedy called ""See How They Run"" which runs June 21-July 6. More importantly, it's at a theater in Kaysville called the ""Hopebox"" which is non-profit and donates all tickets sales, concessions, and donations to a person or family affected by cancer.

I'm pleased to announce that the recipient for my show will be UMA's Alumni (and member of our family) Riley McBride. Thus, I encourage anyone able to attend, not only to see Captain Curtis as a Priest, but to support one of our own, and his amazing family.

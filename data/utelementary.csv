If you know me, you know how much I love Keep Austin Beautiful. My family and I have been volunteers at their events like Clean Sweep and the Lake Travis Clean-up and we look forward to them every year! What fun to serve as emcee for the Beautify Bash at UMLAUF Sculpture Garden & Museum Thursday night while on my CBS Austin dinner break! I had the privilege of announcing the 2017 Annual Award Winners! The Balcones Beautification Award went to Keep Walnut Creek Wild. The Ebay Community Involvement Award went to GoodPop. The Applied Materials Education Award went to The University of Texas Elementary School, the TDS Dennis Hobbs Individual Achievement Award went to Susie Shockley. The Samsung Litter Abatement Award went to The Expedition School, and the Dell Youth Achievement Award went to Jose Garcia-Chong. Congrats to all the winners!

Our oldest grads will be seniors next year and we have scholarship opportunities for those who are accepted to UT Austin.

Problem? We don't know where all our grads are! Please help.

We've identified a few grads who will act as Class Captains to help find and inform their cohort friends about these opportunities, by inviting them to be a part of this group (and we have a Instagram approach being created as well). So if you are a grad, or a parent of a grad, who is interested in being a captain, please let us know right now!

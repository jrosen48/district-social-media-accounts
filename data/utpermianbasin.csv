“I have enjoyed collecting minerals and looking at the collection. As we get older, there comes a time when you should let others enjoy it. After putting such an effort into accumulating the collection, I didn't want it to be discarded or put somewhere it would be forgotten.”

Decker graduated from UTPB in 1983 with a Bachelor’s degree in Criminal Justice. Faculty and students studying geology and geosciences will learn from and study Decker’s collection for years to come.

“I am grateful that the collection has a home and will be used to help educate students. I hope it creates an interest in mineralogy, chemistry, math, and awareness of natural resources and their economical and industrial uses.”

The collection will be on display in the new Geosciences Building.

When he’s not overseeing game operations, supervising the sports information office, serving as the Vice Chair of Marketing for the Lone Star Conference, or gearing up as the incoming President of UTPB Staff Senate, you can catch him doing one of the other things he loves: photography.

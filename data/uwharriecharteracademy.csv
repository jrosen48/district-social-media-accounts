In case you haven't heard, the governor made an announcement yesterday that schools can reopen on Plan B. This plan states that students can return to school, but only if capacity is lowered and social distancing can be maintained at all times. He also gave schools the option to use Plan C (online instruction) if needed.

Now that we know which plan we are to use, our Board will have to approve the Plan B that our admin team has developed. We plan to email it out to all families by Friday. We will also post it on our social media outlets.

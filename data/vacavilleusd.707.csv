Please remember to keep your distance from people.

Mrs. Beeby will be present in her classroom to supervise. For some students this may be very difficult for them emotionally. Please keep that in mind as you decide to bring them with you or decide to come on your own.",3.0,"ACE Program - Vacaville

Why Should I Wear A Face Covering?

The primary role of a face covering is to reduce the release of infectious particles into the air when someone speaks, coughs, or sneezes, including someone who has COVID-19 but feels well. Cloth face coverings are not a substitute for physical distancing and washing hands and staying home when ill, but they may be helpful when combined with these primary interventions.#TogetherWeCan

CDC: STEPS YOU CAN TAKE IF A FAMILY MEMBER GETS ILL- Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces daily in household common areas (e.g. tables, hard-backed chairs, doorknobs, light switches, remotes, handles, desks, toilets, sinks)
In the bedroom/bathroom dedicated for an ill person: consider reducing cleaning frequency to as-needed (e.g., soiled items and surfaces) to avoid unnecessary contact with the ill person.
As much as possible, an ill person should stay in a specific room and away from other people in their home, following home care guidance.
The caregiver can provide personal cleaning supplies for an ill person’s room and bathroom, unless the room is occupied by child or another person for whom such supplies would not be appropriate. These supplies include tissues, paper towels, cleaners.
If a separate bathroom is not available, the bathroom should be cleaned and disinfected after each use by an ill person. If this is not possible, the caregiver should wait as long as practical after use by an ill person to clean and disinfect the high-touch surfaces.",0.0,"Solano County Office of Education

We have so many great Mini Clubs! 🤗 Garden is always a favorite and it’s really neat to see how excited the kids are to harvest and make their own food. This morning, a bunch of different greens were harvested from the garden for a salad, which was paired with a fresh raspberry vinaigrette dressing! Yum! 🥬

We also had some fun with eggs! We were gifted some fresh chicken, duck and quail eggs from three parents and the kids were able to crack them open, see the differences and then taste the differences! 🥚🐓

The meal was also served with fresh squeezed lemonade and lemon bars! 🍋

Lastly, the kids worked hard preparing the soil for planting new produce next month! 🤗🌱☀️💦

A great classroom and bedtime read-aloud, Mae Among the Stars is the perfect book for young readers who have big dreams and even bigger hearts!

When Little Mae was a child, she dreamed of dancing in space. She imagined herself surrounded by billions of stars, floating, gliding, and discovering.

She wanted to be an astronaut.

Her mom told her, ""If you believe it, and work hard for it, anything is possible.”

Little Mae’s curiosity, intelligence, and determination, matched with her parents' encouraging words, paved the way for her incredible success at NASA as the first African American woman to travel in space.

This book will inspire other young girls to reach for the stars, to aspire for the impossible, and to persist with childlike imagination.

Thank you for watching Bedtime Stories with VUSD! The next video with Mrs. Austin will premier on February 4th at 7:00 pm. What book do you want to see an educator read next?

These two situations were coincidental, although many students became worried that there were several police cars on campus at the same time as the false fire alarm.

Unfortunately, student rumors spread during lunchtime that there may have been a threat to the school, or a weapon on campus. We are writing to let our parents and guardians know that there was not a weapon on campus and that these two situations were unrelated and coincidental. All students and staff are safe and in class and we are conducting business as usual at school. If you have any questions or concerns, please call our main office.",2019-12-10 16:48:33,,

* There is so much spirit in our cheer club!

* Garden Club made delicious food (as always) and the CUTEST garden gnomes!

* Our singing and acting club is working on their production of 101 Dalmatians!

* Board games was full of smiles and strategy!

* Sweet Adventures learned about the abstract art of Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky. The kids created their own work inspired by the artist. Then enjoyed a delicious ""Chocolate Salami"" dessert.

* Our sports club was busy outside warming up, by shooting hoops!",0.0,"ACE Program - Vacaville

We are grateful beyond measure for all the blessings of yesterday! What a feast! What a community! Thank you all for dressing the part, showing up and helping prepare for this day. From naturally dying socks to making butter and embracing the experience, we think the kids will remember this day forever.

Here are just a few photos that we would like to share and we think they speak for themselves. ❤️Thank you to each and every one of you who helped make this day so incredibly special.

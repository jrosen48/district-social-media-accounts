DEED Spotlight on Hermon Hutchens Elementary School, Valdez City Schools.

The staff at Hermon Hutchens Elementary School (HHES) in Valdez wanted to find a way to stay connected with families during the COVID-19 crisis. Their team decided to host Monday Morning Assemblies for the HHES families. With a lot of creativity and teamwork, virtual Monday Morning Assemblies were launched on March 23rd.

Each week’s Morning Assembly has a theme – this week’s is COMMUNITY. HHES staff invited a few guest speakers from Valdez to discuss what community means to them.

Watch their Monday Morning Assembly: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nC63H2FDSq2s7rK7_5QAoWSOFAywaMf2/view

The meaning of community was very similar to everyone:
• Helping one another
• Trust
• Teamwork
• Togetherness
• Support
• Kindness

During these challenging times, community is more important than ever. Thank you, HHES, for supporting your school community and bringing everyone together through your virtual assemblies!

This month represents a time for us to celebrate libraries and the incredible staff who devote their days to transforming learning. Library staff does so even during times of crisis.

Though the current situation has forced libraries to close physical locations temporarily, they remain steadfast providers of continuity of learning with online resources and programming.

I have been impressed to see technology leveraged connecting library staff with students and families via virtual activities. Our school librarians, Pam Verfaillie, Michelle Petersen, and Lorraine Critchlow, have worked tirelessly to ensure educators can effectively utilize online strategies to enhance learning.

Although everyone may be unable to celebrate libraries and librarians this month in face-to-face events, we want to encourage you to take advantage of opportunities to continue education and take a moment to honor these champions.

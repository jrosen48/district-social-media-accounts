Thank you for your patience, your understanding and your grace as we have tried to make the best out of every circumstance and opportunity thrown our way during these unprecedented times.

Tonight we celebrated with you on the campus of Valdosta High School. What you do not know is that we also lit up Bazemore-Hyder and celebrated YOU as our promise to provide you with your traditional high school graduation ceremony.

CONGRATULATIONS JULIAN GONZALEZ!!!!
Tom and Heidi Gonzalez are proud to announce that their son, Julian Gonzalez, has committed to playing tennis at Belmont Abbey in Belmont, NC. The Belmont Abbey Crusaders participate in the NCAA's Division II athletics program. The Crusaders are members of Conference Carolinas. Julian’s official visit was in February and he immediately loved the campus, culture, and tennis coach, Mike Salomon. Julian is an IB student at VHS and will graduate with Honors. Julian is also the recipient of the Hintemeyer Catholic Leadership Scholarship from Belmont Abbey. Even though Julian’s senior year of playing tennis at VHS was cut short (Covid-19), he is extremely excited about his future in college tennis.

Julian wants to thank his parents, his grandparents – Jim & Mary Netherton, Keith Childree - his tennis coach for past 8 years, and his high school coach, T.J. Gay for all of their love and support.",2.0,"Congratulations to Julian! Best wishes on your collegiate career. 🎾

CONGRATULATIONS JULIAN GONZALEZ!!!!
Tom and Heidi Gonzalez are proud to announce that their son, Julian Gonzalez, has committed to playing tennis at Belmont Abbey in Belmont, NC. The Belmont Abbey Crusaders participate in the NCAA's Division II athletics program. The Crusaders are members of Conference Carolinas. Julian’s official visit was in February and he immediately loved the campus, culture, and tennis coach, Mike Salomon. Julian is an IB student at VHS and will graduate with Honors. Julian is also the recipient of the Hintemeyer Catholic Leadership Scholarship from Belmont Abbey. Even though Julian’s senior year of playing tennis at VHS was cut short (Covid-19), he is extremely excited about his future in college tennis.

Julian wants to thank his parents, his grandparents – Jim & Mary Netherton, Keith Childree - his tennis coach for past 8 years, and his high school coach, T.J. Gay for all of their love and support.",2020-04-22 00:06:34,,

STUDENT LEARNING PACKETS

While all grade level packets are online on the Valdosta City Schools website (Home Learning Resources), we realize that all students do not have internet access. We have put together these resources into a printed packet. The packets are designed to provide at-home practice for skills that have already been taught to the students. These packets are not to be returned to school when the students return.

Parents may pick up these packets from WG Nunn Elementary School on Thursday, April 2nd. We will offer two time slots in order to try to accommodate parents.

8:00 am – 10:00 am

4:00 pm – 5:00 pm

Parents are to drive in the front entrance of the school and pull under the covering in front of the office. DO NOT GET OUT OF YOUR CAR. When you pull up, tell us which grade level packet you need and we will get it for you.

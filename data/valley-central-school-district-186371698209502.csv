We would like to thank all of our volunteers, our food service workers, our custodial/maintenance staff, our School Lunch Manager, Eleanore Mills and our Director of Facilities, Ryan Schmidt for all their work to keep our students fed throughout the school year.

As in past summers, our students may go to neighboring school districts that provide summer meals: Pine Bush, Newburgh, Middletown.

Also, Neighborhood Communities provide meals for the summer as well.

Call 1-866-3-HUNGRY or text: “food” or “comida” to 877-877 to find the nearest program.

This is the first of several Drama 3 solo film projects that I will share over the next few days. We just completed our last class with a film viewing MeetUp. I cannot express enough how much we all needed to spend this time together...we chatted and laughed and oohed and ahhed over each film.

The Drama 3 Class introduces our students to acting for film and learning about all the various film angles that help achieve the emotional responses that a director hopes to get from their audience.

I told them all tonight that I am so proud of each of them because their films represent their individual creativity and determination to bring their thoughts to life in a short film.

I hope that you will be on the lookout for a new film or two every day until the school year officially ends. I have no doubt that you will be impressed by the artistic minds of these young filmographers.

The first film was actually the first one completed and turned in to me...please enjoy R.P. by Jaden Penney",0.0,"Valley Central High School Performing Arts Department

The VCHS Revelation staff, advised by Melissa Bonacic and Karen Morris, is very excited for the release of the 2020 edition of our Revelation magazine! What you may not know is that VC doesn’t just stand for Valley Central; it also stands for “very creative,” which we certainly had to be during these unprecedented times. Because we were unable to produce printed copies of the magazine this year due to our school closing during this pandemic, we worked hard to produce this online edition of the magazine, the first one (and hopefully the last one) ever. We did not want the work of many of our talented students to go unseen, especially those pieces created by our graduating seniors.

We would like to thank Superintendent John Xanthis and Principal Jayme Ginda-Baxter for their continued support, and for allowing us the opportunity to share and highlight the many artistic and literary talents of our students. #VCProud

We will be back from Noon to 4:00pm tomorrow, as well as afternoons/evenings on Monday and Tuesday for those who signed up. Remember: VPSD is going full 1:1 initiative for student laptops. These laptops are personalized for the induvidual student. If you have not signed up for a laptop, you can still sign up for Monday and Tuesday pickup times, using the link on the Infinite Campus Parent Portal!",2020-08-15 19:08:21,,

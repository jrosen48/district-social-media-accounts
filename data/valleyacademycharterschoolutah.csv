Due to popular demand, Valley Academy is opening a 4th all day kindergarten class!!
We currently have 8 spots available! Valley Academy has a student cap in each class and a cap in the entire school so overcrowding does not impede learning. Kindergarten classes start Monday August 24th.
Please share and tell your friends!

Valley Academy is the only ALL day public Kindergarten school in the area. We feel this extra half day is critical to our children's foundational knowledge so they can succeed that much more as they travel upward through other grade levels.

Valley Academy is a free public school separate from the Washington County School District. Valley is its own district.

Valley Academy has bus 5 routes that include all of Hurricane, LaVerkin, Toquerville, Anderson Junction, Leeds, Virgin, Rockville, Springdale, and Coral Canyon area.

By means of keeping you informed we had a fire alarm go off today at the school at about 8:45 AM that was the result of dust being blown into a sensor and setting off the alarm. This was not the planned fire drill we had planned for 10 AM, but it gave us great experience to practice what we have learned. The Hurricane Fire Department arrived and cleared us to go back to class after they gave high fives and talked to the students. If you have any questions you are always welcome to call me. Thanks, Mr. Stevens 435-635-7815",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2738012372883443&id=239250879426284,,0.0,"Hello parents.

We are looking for sponsors to support each cohort coming up. The cost for each cohort (maximum of 8 students) is $400. If you would like to sponsor a group please let the school know asap.

My 40th birthday is upon us. This year I don't want gifts, treats, or a fancy dinner. I want to donate to the American Red Cross, the VFW, and my school. Below are the links to my gofundme account and a Donors choose for education. If you can give anything it will go to help those in Vegas, Houston, and other areas where recent hurricanes have hit. I hope to exceed the amount on my GoFundMe page if possible. Please share if you can't give. #LoveforVegas #redcross #giveforyourbirthday

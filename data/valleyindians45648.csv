On Friday, December 13, the students traveled to Portsmouth for a field trip where they visited the Second Presbyterian Church (to learn about the history and architecture of the church), the Human Rights Garden (to learn about another student-driven community art project), and the floodwall murals (to learn about the artistic processes that were used to create the murals).

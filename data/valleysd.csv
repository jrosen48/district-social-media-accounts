The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the forefront the issue of rural broadand. Help us get accurate data so we can find solutions.

The Stevens County / Spokane Tribe Broadband Action Team has been chosen by the Washington State Broadband Office to launch a new, and better mapping tool. The map it creates will help us plan and apply for grants to get increased broadband to our area.

Please take this speed test from your home internet.Don’t have internet? Message us!

This data allows us to challenge the FCC records that show Stevens County as 100% served with high speed internet, and we know that’s not true.

You have the option to fill in your real address or keep it private, but the more accurate the data is the more likely we can get something done for everyone. They discard the addressing data as soon as it hits the map and don’t collect any personal information.

Please share this with your friends, family, and acquaintances in Stevens County.",0.0,"Please read this post from WSU Stevens County Extension office and consider taking the speed test to help them bring better internet service to our area.

This data allows us to challenge the FCC records that show Stevens County as 100% served with high speed internet, and we know that’s not true.

You have the option to fill in your real address or keep it private, but the more accurate the data is the more likely we can get something done for everyone. They discard the addressing data as soon as it hits the map and don’t collect any personal information.

As you have likely heard, Governor Inslee has extended the closure of schools for the rest of this school year. It is a good reminder that we are in the middle of a health crisis and will do everything we can to stop the spread of COVID-19. With that said, our plan is to continue running the meal service, childcare for first responders and medical professionals, and provide continuous learning. The district will receive additional information and direction from the Office of the Superintendent of Instruction (OSPI) on continuous learning. Please know, we will continue to work hard and provide the best education possible for our students.

We wanted to let you know about an important resource to help families who are struggling because of the
pandemic. If your child was eating free or reduced-price lunch school lunch in March 2020, you are eligible for
food purchasing assistance of $250 per eligible child!
The Oklahoma Department of Human Services will be sending Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer benefits, or
P-EBT, to eligible families – you do not need to apply. If you already have an EBT card the benefits will be loaded
on your existing card. If you do not currently have an EBT card, please look out for a P-EBT card in the mail.
Watch closely as the outside envelope may not clearly say P-EBT.
P-EBT is provided to any child who was receiving free or reduced-price school lunch in March 2020. It will not
impact your citizenship or immigration status.

It's a Great Day to be a Bulldog! It was great seeing all the kids getting back to school tomorrow. While our soft opening last week went well, we discovered a few areas we need to work on this morning. Please make sure you are screening your children before you send them to school and be patient while we work through our morning screening procedures. We will get faster and make it as seamless as possible.

I wanted to remind everyone that this week we have a VIRTUAL FRIDAY! Students will not have to attend school, but will have class assignments to complete. Teachers will be taking attendance based on completion of the assignments. I am attaching a 2020-2021 School Calendar to this message. Days in Green are attendance days and days in Blue are Virtual days.

We are glad to be back. Help us be back and stay back. Wear your mask. Watch your distance. Wash your hands.

Earlier today, the Oklahoma State School Board voted to accept some strongly worded recommendations for schools in Oklahoma in response to the Covid-19 Pandemic. These recommendations vary based upon the level of community spread in each county based upon the OSDH Covid-19 Status Map. McCurtain County is currently in the most severely affected status.

At Valliant Schools, we are continuing to work on the plan we have previously released. The administration will meet together on Monday and reassess how the recommendations approved today will affect that plan. We will notify you if and when our plan should change.

We want to be in school face to face with our students. We need your help to make that happen. Please follow social distancing guidelines, wear masks when required, and do whatever you can to allow us to get back to normal. This is not about politics or conspiracies. It is about the health and safety of our kids.

Valliant Patrons and Friends,
We have been and will continue to monitor the weather this evening. I wanted to make sure that everyone knows our position on Storm Shelters and the restrictions during the Covid-19 outbreak.
Given the potential severity of a tornado, we have deemed that to be an imminent risk which supersedes the group number restrictions of the CDC. Our shelters will be opened and available for you to use should they be needed. While they will be open, we encourage anyone that might seek shelter to practice safe social distancing in the shelter and good hygiene practices.
Stay weather aware this evening and be safe. I have been in contact with Valliant Emergency Management and Valliant PD already and we are all prepared to open the shelter if we are placed under a watch or warning.

Dustin Hames is a senior at Valliant High School and in the Criminal Justice program at Kiamichi Tech - Hugo. Dustin has completed the Microburst EmployABILITY skills program through our Career Connections Center and credits those skills to his success in the workplace.

When applying at Pruett's Food, Dustin shared what it means to be an ""involver"" - a term our students learn that means showing up on time, doing the work and helping others. He was offered the job within a couple hours.

During his first week, Dustin showed enough responsibility to be promoted to the deli department, which came with a $1/hour raise, and is not often given to high school students.

Congratulations Dustin!",4.0,"Congratulations Dustin!

We increased our scores from last year by 45 points and ironically we were 45 points away from making the top 6! Our goal was to improve and we did that! We are creeping our way up after just 2 years of competing. We are learning and that’s what it’s all about. I love this job! Thank you to everyone of our parents who came to support us today and to 3 outstanding young men (Lawson, Cody and Braylon) who gave up a Saturday to compete with us! We would like to give a huge shout out to our school district patrons who voted for the bond issue that provided us with safe transportation traveling late at night and early into the morning!

At 8:00 a.m., FFA will be hosting its annual Veterans Day breakfast in the Scroggins Room. We would love to have the honor of hosting as many veterans as possible. Please come and celebrate our veterans of past and present with us at Valliant Public Schools.

If you have a student enrolled in our school district and they have family members who are Veterans we would love to honor them by adding them to our Veterans slideshow. Please email the Veteran’s picture, name, name of student or students they’re related to, and relation to student(s). Please e-mail these things to Mr. Pannell at cpannell@vpsd.org. Please note that if you have sent photos of your Veteran in the past that they remain on the slideshow every year so that you don’t have to resend photos on a yearly basis.",2019-10-30 13:06:07,,

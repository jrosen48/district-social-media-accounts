Lots of fun today promoting seat belts at Ridgevue. Thanks to Sherry and Bill from the Idaho Transportation Department for coming out and running the Barbie egg car demo’s. We also had Nampa Fire Fighters, Canyon County Paramedics, Caldwell Police , and Nampa Police Officers Watt and Friedli. The stars of the show were Buckle Bear and Officer Friedli’s K9 partner Yager.

Of course the RHS Buckle Up team of Maddie, Kami, Paige, And Brady we’re busy. We tied somewhere in the neighborhood of 400 orange buckle up ribbons on student backpacks reminding them to buckle up.

As one photo shows you can see hundreds of students signed our buckle up pledge poster (made by students).

Great job today

Even as spring turns to summer, we continue to recognize the outstanding educators honored at the Celebrating Educators event in May. Meet Dawnyelle DeLongchamp, District Psychologist, El Potrero Preschool, in the Val Verde Unified School District, and the Riverside County Site Support Employee of the Year. As the first contact with students’ families when they enter the district, Dawnyelle works to build trust with parents and ensure they are invested early in their child’s education. She provides psychological services to students onsite and believes it is important to reduce stigma around mental health issues. Dawnyelle is described by a peer as a “leader that is fair, a teacher that is generous, and a psychologist that is dedicated.” Congratulations, Dawnyelle!

Meet Vista Verde Middle School Attendance Technician and Riverside County Classified Employee of the Year, Lindsay Brancato. Lindsay always wanted to serve and help people, and found her calling working with students, parents, and educators at the Val Verde Unified School District.

Ms. Brancato’s efforts to launch a STEAM-focused attendance recovery program on Saturdays has garnered countywide attention and helped recover more than $5 million dollars in attendance funds in 2016-2017. As a result, Val Verde USD posted one of the highest attendance rates among all school districts in Riverside County.

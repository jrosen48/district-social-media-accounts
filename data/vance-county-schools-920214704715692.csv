Vance County Schools recently added our sixteenth school to the district - Vance Virtual Village Academy, also known as V3. V3 is an entirely virtual school for students in grades K-12. As the school year kicked off, the students of V3 worked to establish their identity relative to school colors and mascot. The students voted on their school colors and official mascot, then participated in a school logo design contest. Devin Crump, a sixth grader at V3, designed the official logo for the school. The new mascot and colors were unveiled on September 1. We are excited to reveal the Vance Virtual Village Academy Huskies. Their school colors are crimson and gray.

NC Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) is launching new initiatives to expand COVID-19 testing and contact tracing. Testing and tracing are key components of our state's strategy to responsibly ease restrictions, while continuing to slow the spread of the virus.

New online tools include:
🌡️ Check My Symptoms (www.ncdhhs.gov/symptoms) allows people to enter their symptoms to determine if they should consider getting tested.
🔎 Find My Testing Place (www.ncdhhs.gov/TestingPlace) allows people to enter their county or ZIP code and access a list of nearby testing site locations online.

NCDHHS also launched the COVID-19 Community Team Outreach (CCTO) Tool, a password-protected online software that helps people track their symptoms if they have been advised to do so by the COVID-19 Community Team. The tool also helps streamline and integrate contact tracing work across the state.

Vance County Schools faces many of the same issues as other rural areas, especially a lack of district-wide internet connectivity.

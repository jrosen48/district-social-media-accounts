It’s great to see kids supporting kids at Helen DeVos Children's Hospital! Ellie, pictured here with Dr. Jim Fahner, was picked to be “Principal for the Day” at Vanguard Charter Academy. As principal, she made September 30 “Crazy Hair and Crazy Hat Day.” To participate, students and teachers were asked to make a donation and they raised $514.06! Ellie chose to give the money to pediatric cancer research, in honor of her cousin Hayley, who is battling cancer. Ellie, thank you for being so kind and thoughtful, and a great example for all of us!",2.0,"Spectrum Health Foundations

Good morning Van Meter,

I just wanted to let you know that all of our students now have Van Meter Public Library cards for the digital materials in the public library, which includes eBooks, newspapers and audio books.

The students library card number and password is their school lunch number.

If your child needs help, please email me at shannon.miller@vmbulldogs.com and I can send the number.

With the public library access, we also have access to all TumbleBook products with this....TumbleBooks, TumbleMath, and TumbleTeen Book Cloud. And a few other databases such as Gale and LibriVox.

You will find the directions at the link below and attached in the image.

Students can use this anywhere, anytime.

It will be awesome for all of them to have this access as it opens up lots of additional resources for our kids and teachers.

Let me know if you have any questions, Mrs. Miller

Hope everyone is safe and well in these difficult times.

Just wanted to remind everyone that we will be turning on the stadium lights tonight at 8:00 to show support for each other. Just a reminder that we are not wanting anyone to congregate at the school, but it is more than OK to drive through and show your support to your friend and neighbors.

Please continue to be safe and take care of yourselves.

Hope everyone is safe and well in these difficult times.

Just wanted to remind everyone that we will be turning on the stadium lights tonight at 8:00 to show support for each other. Just a reminder that we are not wanting anyone to congregate at the school, but it is more than OK to drive through and show your support to your friend and neighbors.

Please continue to be safe and take care of yourselves.

While students and staff stay safe at home, Green Iowa AmeriCorps - Sustainable Schools members at @Van Meter Schools are assuring that outdoor sustainability projects keep moving forward. This week the City of Van Meter's Fire Department led a controlled burn around the school, burning off dried canary grass and prairie in order to encourage spring growth of native plant species.

Burns around the school pond, Bulldog Basin, will assure that the herd of goats who will be spending their summer there will have lots of fresh shoots to eat! Thanks to the VM Fire and Police Departments, the City of Van Meter, and Van Meter Schools for colloborating to keep our outdoor grounds healthy for local wildlife and fauna, even during trying times.",2020-04-02 09:49:44,https://video-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/92263936_146982456714946_237085364425064448_n.mp4?_nc_cat=108&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=C08eA_61yfcAX8vA7xw&_nc_ht=video-atl3-1.xx&oh=a980579c4179f39764f9f15b9b933cb0&oe=5F5CF40C,

Due to the updated guidance from the IDPH, IDOE and the Governor‚Äôs Office, Van Meter CSD will be closed through Sunday, April 12. All activities are postponed until further notice. There will be no practices, games, or events while we are closed.

More details will be provided at a later date, but the buildings will be not be accessible at this time by anyone other than necessary custodial staff. We will provide opportunities next week for students and staff to get needed supplies from the school.

As you know, this is a very fluid situation and many details still need to be addressed. We are aware that this information does not answer all of your questions, but we want to gather as much information as possible before communicating our plans. Our team will meet this weekend and we will provide further information for staff, family, and students.

We are excited to announce a very special author visit to Van Meter Schools!

On March 3, author and illustrator, Tom Watson, will be joining our elementary students and teachers in the morning. He will be talking about writing, illustrating and of course his series Stick Dog, Stick Cat and the newest, Trouble at Table 5.

We will be sending home a form tomorrow if families are interested in purchasing a book and having Tom sign it on that day.

It is going to be a fun day! :)

And make sure you check out Tom's site with your kids at home too...It's awesome!

The art department is looking to make some hula hoop weavings as a project this next semester and could use some clean colorful t-shirts you no longer need. In addition if we get some extra shirts we were thinking it would also be very cool to make some t-shirt -rugs to donate to local animal shelters for dogs and cats. If you are cleaning out closets over break and want to send t-shirts with your student to school.. that would be awesome! Also please comment with any connections that would like animals rugs. Here is a video link of the process.. in case anyone also wants to do a short project at home! Thanks!! https://youtu.be/lAqxa6RH2SM",2.0,"YOUTUBE.COM

Attention all Oklahoma high school seniors and their parents, teachers and administrators — the Oklahoma Hall of Fame Scholarship application process officially closes in less than one month! Every year, we award one Oklahoma high school senior a $6,000 scholarship, which is based on the student's leadership roles, civic/community involvement, academic achievement and knowledge of our great state.

Students MUST commit to attending an Oklahoma college or university to be considered. Last year's recipient, Madison Stephens from Weatherford High School, was selected out of 95 applicants from 69 high schools in 40 counties across the state! 😲

Hi guys, we're officially rolling out our After School and School Day Camp programs for those that need it.

Right now we are only picking up kids in Ada and Latta, but might extend our range back to homer/francis/byng again if there is enough demand.

In addition to after school and holiday (as well as friday) day camps, we are also offering an every day day camp option for those that want a place for their kids to do their distance learning in an environment other than home or school.

You can find the details on our website here:

The Chickasaw Nation is accepting applications for the Summer EBT for Children program. This federally funded program is available to both Native and non-Native students in more than 170 participating school districts.

Qualifying families receive approximately $30 of free food per child during summer months. Benefits are accessed through an EBT card, which works like a debit card that allows for the purchase of healthy food for the summer.

To qualify for this program, students must be enrolled in a participating school district in grades pre-K through grade 12 and receive free or reduced meals at school. Once approved, summer EBT cards are mailed to the address provided, along with a list of participating stores and a food card shopping list that helps identify approved items.

For more information, or to apply by phone, call Chickasaw Nation Summer EBT at (844) 256-3467.

FFA ALUMNI CAMP HAS BEEN CANCELLED.....🙁

Official email below.

Since 1973, FFA members have been provided an opportunity to grow as individuals, develop leadership skills, and fellowship with FFA members from across the state at the one and only Oklahoma FFA Alumni Leadership Camp. That’s why we have been hesitant to make the decision to cancel camp. Unfortunately, like many other things this summer, there will be no on-site Oklahoma FFA Alumni Leadership Camp in 2020.



The good news is that we are planning a virtual camp, July 27-29. It will feature our regulars, Bill Cordes, Kelly Barnes, and the newly elected State FFA Officer team. It will be free to FFA members and there is no limit on participation. We know that there is no way to 100% emulate what camp does in a virtual setting, but we are committed to providing top-notch leadership training for the agricultural youth of Oklahoma in these uncertain times, even if it is from a distance.

How to Talk to Children About COVID-19

Why it’s important to discuss COVID-19 with children
Collectively, we are all involved in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Students, educators, families and communities must be aware of the facts involved in the coronavirus pandemic.

What should be included in the discussion?
Families and educators should remember to keep the conversation appropriate to the child’s developmental age. Share facts using age-appropriate terminology, actively listen to students’ concerns and answer their questions as best as you can. It’s okay to let them know if you are unsure of the answer.

How to communicate information about COVID-19 to children:
Stay calm and reassuring
Ask what they know or what they’ve heard
Keep children updated with facts
Be honest and available for discussions
Allow children to express their feelings
Validate their feelings
Limit media exposure",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3007419842682810&id=539785626112923,,0.0,"From the SDE:

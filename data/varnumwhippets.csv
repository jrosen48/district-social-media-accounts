We plan to continue using the App and are working on getting all the class titles moved up to the 20-21 classes (last year 7th will now say 20-21 8th, etc).

That being said we have found one small glitch. If a parent or teacher chooses or accidentally takes themself out of the group we can no longer add that person back to the group under that number. We know there will be a few groups we might have to redo because of this issue, but we will wait until after enrollment and see where we are with our GroupMe lists before we do that.

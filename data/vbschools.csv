Parent Connection Tip of the Day: Motivate your child with a puzzle! - If your child likes puzzles, use them to motivate them! When they’re not around, make a puzzle by pasting a picture from a magazine onto cardboard and cutting it into pieces. Then, every time your child reads a book, or does their schoolwork or a chore without being nagged, give them a puzzle piece. Each day will bring them closer to solving the puzzle and seeing the picture. https://bit.ly/3k9mIDn",0.0,"VBSchools added a new photo.

To encourage them to give assignments their best effort, give them this checklist. Before they turn anything in, have them ask themselves: Did I follow the directions? Is my work neat so the teacher can read it? Have I checked my spelling? Did I complete every step of each math problem? Have I double-checked my work? https://bit.ly/2Z8P3S7",2020-09-08 11:00:39,,

Parent Connection Tip of the Day: Make it easy for your child to be honest - You want your child to avoid stretching the truth and cheating in school.

Parent Connection Tip of the Day: Ask your teen to think and imagine - Almost all teens like to answer hypothetical questions. It gives them a chance to plan, dream and imagine. These questions are also great for building thinking skills. Try asking your teen something like, ""If you were famous, what would be the downside?"" or ""If you could start your own charity, what would it do and how?"" Encourage your teen to really think through their response. https://bit.ly/3gDiOBj",0.0,"VBSchools added a new photo.

But when some teens want to stop disrespectful behavior, they become disrespectful themselves. Teach your teen that it doesn't help to retaliate in kind. Instead, they should take a deep breath or count to 10. Then they can say something like, ""I feel uncomfortable when you use that language.""

Parent Connection Tip of the Day: Record an audiobook with your child - Listening to audiobooks and reading along can help develop your child's reading fluency. And it's more fun if you make your own audiobooks. Simply record yourself as you read a story to your child. Slow down and pronounce words carefully. Act out the character's voices. At the end of each page, have your child ring a bell. When she listens and reads along on her own, the bell will cue her to turn the page. https://bit.ly/2P9kG8L",0.0,"VBSchools added a new photo.

Parent Connection Tip of the Day: Don't let worry turn into stress - The pandemic has brought on many changes, including changes to the college admissions process. But one thing is still certain: Students don't need to get into the ""best"" college to be a success. They need to get into the college that brings out the best in them. What really matters to your teen's college success are the habits they bring with them, such as hard work, commitment and persistence. https://bit.ly/3fLMvQ3",0.0,"VBSchools added a new photo.

Parent Connection Tip of the Day: Ask questions to help your teen think things through - There comes a time in nearly every teen's life when parents don't seem to know anything.

Start by asking, ""Can you list the reasons why that might be a good idea and other reasons why it might not?"" Talking it through may be just what your teen needs to make the right choice. https://bit.ly/2UELQHQ",0.0,"VBSchools added a new photo.

Parent Connection Tip of the Day: Point out the positive side of mistakes and failures - Children need to learn how to handle failure if they are to succeed. If your child is facing up to a failure, don't minimize their feelings. Instead, help them see the situation more clearly. Tell them that mistakes give us information that allows us to make necessary changes and get smarter. You can also talk about what you've learned from failures. Above all, don't allow your child to lower their expectations for themselves. https://bit.ly/3gTXU1k",0.0,"VBSchools added a new photo.

Parent Connection Tip of the Day: A simple process encourages cooperation - Experts suggest these steps for motivating children to do what they're asked. First, tell your child exactly what you want them to do. Next, link the behavior you want with something your child wants (that you're willing to deliver). ""When your math is done, we can play a game."" Then keep your promise when your child does what you've asked (and not before!). Finally, comment positively when your child cooperates. https://bit.ly/2TKMnaQ",0.0,"VBSchools added a new photo.

Parent Connection Tip of the Day: Small changes improve reading concentration - Does your teen's mind wander when they read? They can improve their concentration if they avoid lying down to read. Help your teen schedule a time to read when they’re most alert. If they usually fall asleep at 10 p.m., they shouldn't wait until 9:30 to start reading. Also encourage them to read for several short periods, rather than one long stretch. Reading aloud and taking notes can also help them stay engaged. https://bit.ly/2B8OYol",0.0,"VBSchools added a new photo.

Parent Connection Tip of the Day: Encourage a hobby of critical thinking - Thinking critically involves weighing information. Your teen must not only take the information in, they must decide if it is reasonable and how they can use it. Many hobbies offer teens fun ways to practice critical thinking, including: debating (most teens love to argue), playing board games like chess or backgammon, reading for pleasure, doing puzzles (crossword and jigsaw) and playing an instrument. https://bit.ly/2z0KOhT",0.0,"VBSchools added a new photo.

Parent Connection Tip of the Day: Guide your teen toward responsible learning - Some students have more success than others because they have a strong sense of responsibility. To develop this trait in your teen, teach them to weigh the pros and cons of their options when they make decisions.

And have them prepare for their future by setting goals and keeping track of their progress toward meeting them. https://bit.ly/2LCQvF4",0.0,"VBSchools added a new photo.

Parent Connection Tip of the Day: Use expectations to emphasize two key lessons - ""Two of the most important lessons children can learn,"" wrote columnist William Raspberry, ""are that they matter and that they are counted on."" A great way to show your child she matters is to set expectations. When you maintain a regular study time, for example, she learns that her education matters to you. When you expect her to act responsibly, she knows you count on her and think she's capable. https://bit.ly/35Ve0CU",0.0,"VBSchools added a new photo.

Help your child practice by drawing a clock face on a paper plate and using two strips of paper for hands. Ask questions such as, ""When you feed the dog at 8:00, where are the hands on the clock?"" or ""Where are the hands when your favorite TV show comes on at 7:30?"" Let your child take control and move the hands to the correct time. https://bit.ly/2W0yjeJ",0.0,"VBSchools added a new photo.

Parent Connection Tip of the Day: To support learning, support your teen -Do you know what your teen needs to succeed in school and life? One expert suggests that it comes down to self-respect, goals, communication skills, social skills, stress management, exercise and family support. Family support may be the most important. Your love and acceptance gives your teen a foundation for developing all the other elements of success. https://bit.ly/2SvN5Ie",0.0,"VBSchools added a new photo.

Parent Connection Tip of the Day: For better recall, share long-term learning strategies - When your teen has really learned something, she can recall it on demand. The key to good recall is to move a piece of information from short-term memory to long-term memory. Several strategies can help. Encourage your teen to draw diagrams of the information she wants to remember. She can also write a song about it or create a digital file of key facts. Whenever possible, help her apply the material to real life. https://bit.ly/35tS15u",0.0,"VBSchools added a new photo.

Don't ignore behavior that creates a problem for another person or breaks an established rule, however.

Parent Connection Tip of the Day: A bedtime review can boost morning recall - When your child is studying for a test, have her finish her preparations by reviewing the most important information one more time right before going to bed. She shouldn't spend long; 10 or 12 minutes should be enough. While she sleeps, her brain will keep thinking about what she's just reviewed. The next day, she'll find the material easier to remember. https://bit.ly/3d6Vjyz",0.0,"VBSchools added a new photo.

Parent Connection Tip of the Day: Short chats add up to meaningful conversation - A teen who longs for independence may not have any interest in a long talk with you. But you can still talk with her about the issues that matter. Just figure on five or six short talks instead of one long one. Talk about something for five minutes, then, as she disappears into her room, press the ""pause"" button. After dinner, pick up where you left off. Over time, you'll cover the issue, just in short bursts. https://bit.ly/39Yb6NZ",0.0,"VBSchools added a new photo.

Challenge her to copy the problem on a clean sheet of paper, put away her notes and try to solve it herself. If she can't, that's OK. She should just work through the problem again, using her notes and the book to remind her what steps to follow and why.

Parent Connection Tip of the Day: Can your teen solve a sample science problem? - Before your teen begins to solve new science problems, have her review a similar problem the teacher solved in class. Challenge her to copy the problem on a clean sheet of paper, put away her notes and try to solve it herself. If she can't, that's OK. She should just work through the problem again, using her notes and the book to remind her what steps to follow and why. Then she can tackle the new problems. https://bit.ly/2UEf4qC",2020-04-11 11:00:09,,

Parent Connection Tip of the Day: Use your eyes when correcting behavior - Your child is more likely to do as you ask if she is actually listening to you in the first place. To get her attention when you correct her behavior, move close to her. Raise your voice only enough to make her look at you. Look your child in the eye, and with a neutral expression, ask for the behavior you want. Hold eye contact for a moment after speaking. Your point will have been both made and heard. https://bit.ly/343mQgW",0.0,"VBSchools added a new photo.

Parent Connection Tip of the Day: Plan screen-free ways to buy yourself some time -
Experts agree that it's important to monitor and limit your child's recreational screen time. One way is to think about the times you rely on TV or screen devices as babysitters for your child, and to come up with alternatives. For example, if you turn on a screen to occupy your child while you make dinner, try doing some advance meal preparation. Or invite her into the kitchen to help you cook instead. https://bit.ly/2R6kk4c",0.0,"VBSchools added a new photo.

Parent Connection Tip of the Day: Avoid using labels that limit your teen - Your daughter is the family athlete, your son is the musician. It's great to celebrate talents, but referring to teens by such labels can actually hold them back. The ""athlete"" may not try hard in math. The ""musician"" may avoid sports. Instead, encourage your teens to try on new roles and praise them for trying unfamiliar activities. https://bit.ly/2xor5rd",0.0,"VBSchools added a new photo.

Parent Connection Tip of the Day: A note-taking system helps teens get more from reading - If your teen's mind wanders when she reads, try this: Divide a sheet of paper into four quarters. In the first, put an exclamation point. This stands for ""I didn't know that!"" The second gets a question mark for questions your teen has while reading. The third gets a plus and a minus sign, for ""I agree/don't agree."" The fourth gets a cloud, for ""I wonder."" As she reads, your teen should make notes in the boxes. https://bit.ly/2UlvLHj",0.0,"VBSchools added a new photo.

Parent Connection Tip of the Day: Eliminate supply hunts at homework time -
If statements like ""I can't find a ruler"" and ""I can't do my social studies until I find my colored pencils"" are common delay tactics at homework time, help your child create a homework tray. Collect tape, glue, rulers, pencils and other supplies and put them in a tray tote or a basket. The container is off limits unless your child is doing homework. With everything in one place, your child can't waste time hunting. https://bit.ly/3bqWUy2",0.0,"VBSchools added a new photo.

City officials are urging caution and compliance as they respond to the rapidly evolving novel coronavirus COVID-19 State of Emergency. All citizens should practice social distancing and self-quarantine when sick or exposed to someone who has the virus. While we have kept City parks open amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we are urging residents to take the practices of self-quarantining and social distancing extremely seriously. There have been reports of crowds gathering at public parks, and City officials are imploring people to keep their distance from others and engage in more individual activities such as walking their dogs, biking or jogging.

City officials are urging caution and compliance as they respond to the rapidly evolving novel coronavirus COVID-19 State of Emergency. All citizens should practice social distancing and self-quarantine when sick or exposed to someone who has the virus. While we have kept City parks open amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we are urging residents to take the practices of self-quarantining and social distancing extremely seriously. There have been reports of crowds gathering at public parks, and City officials are imploring people to keep their distance from others and engage in more individual activities such as walking their dogs, biking or jogging.

Parent Connection Tip of the Day: Participate in things that matter to your child - It's not always possible for parents to attend every one of their children's events at school. So what's most important? It's simple, really. Ask your child which events mean the most to them. They may not care if you miss seeing them get a perfect attendance award. But they may really want you to hear their 30-second solo in the spring concert. When you can't be there for everything, be there when it matters to your child. http://bit.ly/2OoUffe",0.0,"VBSchools added a new photo.

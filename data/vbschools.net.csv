Governor Mike DeWine has reopened contact practice for all sports starting 6/22. The OHSAA will provide specific guidance soon. We will then evaluate our current outdoor/indoor protocol and coaches will be notified regarding any changes.

This is obviously exciting news as we are getting closer to being back to ""normal"" in athletics. We still need to be on the same page and follow safety protocols to ensure our kids are afforded these opportunities in the 2020-21 school year.

The family will be assisting with signage and memorial. Some from the soccer family have expressed interest in honoring Tom.

While a budget cut of 2.11% may appear small, the State of Ohio actually calculated the reduction based on our per pupil spending from last year which was $12,229.74. This equates to a reduction of our state foundation revenue by $273,690.00 (25.67% of our annual gross revenue) for the 2019-2020 school year.

💚🎓🐶🎉
The Education Foundation was excited to still be able to recognize our annual •Top 40• graduating Seniors. While maintaining under 10 people and keeping our social distancing of 6ft, we recognized the students 1 by 1. Each Senior received a goodie bag with their traditional Star keepsake, candy, T-shirt and some other goodies. Usually each student also selects a teacher to recognize but with our group limitations and other factors we were not able to have that aspect this year. We hope you can still take the time to reach out to the VBSD staff that made a difference in your school careers and thank them.

Congratulations to the Class of 2020 •TOP 40• graduating Seniors! 👏🏻

Hello City Heights Students! We already miss you guys being at school with us! So let’s play a game for the next 12 days! Grab a piece of paper and number to ten. Each day I will send you a picture from somewhere at our school. Each day you will write down the location. Then when we return to school, bring the paper and we will see how many of you really know our school. Special surprise for the class returning the most papers! Ready?
Day1- Where is Mrs McCutchen today?

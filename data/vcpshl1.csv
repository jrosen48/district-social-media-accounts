This team continues to amaze me at every turn. Saturdays EDC battle for the championship was like a heavyweight fight back and forth all day long. Just when it looked like Devils Lake may win. Our team said not so fast. Every time all season long in big dual after big dual our team rises to the occasion and someone gets it done. Saturday's EDC championship was no different...

Due to the Blizzard Warning and No Travel Advisory we are cancelling school today at Valley City Public Schools. We expect by this afternoon that conditions in the rural areas will be much improved, however, the wind chill is still forecast to reach 40 degrees below zero. Please know that much thought has gone into this decision, and while it may appear that conditions in town are fine, the rural areas continue to have zero visibility driving conditions.

All after school activities scheduled for today have been cancelled. The post graduation party meeting for senior parents has been rescheduled for 6:00pm on Wednesday, February 19th at the Eagles Club.

Valley City Public Schools will make up this cancelled day of school on Friday, May 22nd. Please stay safe and follow the warnings and advisories that have been issued.

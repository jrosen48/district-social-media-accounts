This is Superintendent Mary Gorsuch with a message regarding your student’s school records and information. A letter will be sent home with detailed information about a recent California District Court ruling that requires the California Department of Education to release student information to the Morgan Hill Concerned Parents Association. The Valley Center Pauma Unified School District is not named in the lawsuit, and is not releasing any student information to outside parties, but the California Department of Education will be required to do so. Parents have the right to object by sending in a form that will be provided to you as part of the letter we are sending this week. All parents need to do is to complete and return the form to their child’s teacher or school office by March 18th.

Valley Center Pauma goes to great lengths to protect your family’s personal information, and we want to do all we can to help you to keep it protected. If you have any questions, please contact your child’s school principal.

Thank you.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=948014878587203&id=280420295346668,,0.0,"Greetings,

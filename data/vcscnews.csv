LHS Tennis Parents and fans,

I would like to thank those of you who wore masks and socially distanced while attending our match on Monday. Please know that even though we play outside face coverings and social distancing are still requirements per IHSAA and VCSC policy. Our team wears them anytime we’re not on the court, and we should have the same expectations for those attending our events. The more we adhere to this policy, the greater our chances of your child having a full tennis season. Thank you for your continued support of LHS tennis!

As you know, all plans are subject to change but we have a strong foundation with our VCSC Reentry Plan that will allow us to overcome anything and everything. Next week, we will be sending out a survey of interest in virtual at-home learning. This is different than our eLearning and will be a program, self paced that will be done at home by the student. While we believe in person learning is best for our students and community, our goal is to provide platforms for our students if in person instruction isn’t an option.

Class of 2024 -

LHS summer school has been canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If your student plans to take PE their Freshman year at LHS, during the regular school year, there is nothing you need to do.

If your student wants to earn one or both of their PE credits using Summer PE or a PE waiver, I’ve attached the policy for the class of 2024, only. This will need to be returned to Mrs. Tolliver by July 27, 2020. Please read carefully, and give me a call at 812-882-6168 if you have questions.

I hope all of you are well and we look forward to seeing you at Lincoln in August.

I certainly know that many of you are dealing with larger issues this morning from the storm. It is an E-Learning or counted day for education in the VCSC but this is secondary and quite frankly if it does not occur today, it does not occur.

Many of you are without power and this includes many of our staff members as well and they simply may not be available during the hours of 9AM to 2PM.

As we have learned with Covid-19, we have to be flexible. We just did not know that today that Covid-19 would become secondary for many of us and our attention would turn elsewhere and with this we must be flexible today and patient as we have too many people dealing with much larger issues than that of education and this is primarily related to the storm from last night.

Hopefully we will slowly start to return to what is the new normal for the time being, but today, education is far more secondary.

Hope you all are safe and with this, please stay safe!

Want to know why Lillian was embarrassed for me? Watch The Best Me with Mrs. V posted below to find out. It might have something to do with a silly joke I told. 😄

Students had the opportunity to start the new year out right by making the day of a classmate. They were inspired by the New Year Party Cracker and the fun contents inside. They wrote a compliment to a classmate in their homeroom on a party cracker cutout, included a joke and treat, and then presented them with it!

When Officer Helderman came to Mr. Lang looking for some help on spreading the word about this competition for a great cause, he could not wait to get started.

4 years ago the Vincennes Police Dept and Vincennes Fire Dept started a friendly competition of ringing bells to raise money for the Salvation Army. It is called the Battle of the Badges! We ring bells at Wal-Mart from 10-8. This year it is on Dec. 20th.

Thank you to the Big Green Media students who helped with this project!

Mrs. O'Dell is looking for replacements to help with sensory issues. A cover for a 15lb weighted blanket (41X60) adds longevity to this item, not to mention it can be easily cleaned. Also, she is looking for a light-up bubble tube with a fake fish inside.

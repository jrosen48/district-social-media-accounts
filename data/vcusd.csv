The North Bay fires are a tragedy impacting several VCUSD teachers and staff. We are staying in close contact with those being directly affected and are providing supports as needed.

At this time VCUSD remains open and Distance Learning will continue, but there may be an impact to our classes throughout the district, and if that is the case our families will be notified by site principals.

We keep our teachers, staff, and families, as well as those in our neighboring cities and districts in our thoughts and prayers in their time of crisis.

Dear VCUSD Stakeholders,

On Thursday, February 27, the Vallejo Police Department and Hogan Middle School administration were alerted about a post on social media threatening violence at Hogan Middle School. As a result of a thorough and swift investigation, VPD quickly identified the location the post was made. They authored a warrant and arrested the responsible who stated it was done as a joke. The responsible was a 13 year old child who will be booked into Juvenile hall. No weapons were located.

We are thankful for the strong relationship we have with the Vallejo Police Department and our many stakeholders. See Something Say Something!

Sincerely,

As if that were not enough, they cleaned the bleachers in the gymnasium as well as the outdoor tennis and basketball courts.

Jaelynn collaborated with classmates, other clubs and staff to ensure a successful event. The new Jesse Bethel High School radio club, KJBJ, provided music and created a digital poster to share news about the event.
We could not be more proud about student spirit in Vallejo! There are so many organizations and individuals who made this event happen. Our sincere appreciation goes out to all who sponsored or who volunteered. Thank you!!

We are aware of the potential PG&E Public Safety Power Shutoff, which may occur starting early Wednesday, October 9th due to weather conditions.

Due to the fact that Vallejo is not on the map of targeted areas, we are planning to keep all schools open on Wednesday, October 9th. Classroom instruction will continue. We have made appropriate plans for communication systems and safe conditions at school. Should circumstances change necessitating a school closure, we will communicate directly to parents.

Students are encouraged to bring lunches from home. Food services will be operational, but options might be limited.

Today, October 8th, VCUSD received a Public Safety Power Shutoff advisory due to expected gusty winds and dry conditions, combined with a heightened fire risk. We were notified that PG&E may need to turn off the power for public safety. The potential shutdown may take place Wednesday, October 9th and Thursday, October 10th.

As we continue to monitor conditions, please prepare for outages that could last longer than 48 hours. The district has no control over when and where these shutoffs may occur and may not receive any other advance notices.

Currently, we are continuing with business as usual and school will remain in session. If the power shuts down, we will collaborate with the Vallejo Fire Department, Police Department and Solano County Office of Education to access whether schools should remain open or close.

As always, the safety of our students, staff and our school community is our top priority. We will keep you updated of additional information as it becomes available.

Many of us are concerned about the air quality and wondering if we are having school tomorrow. Unfortunately, the smoky air is becoming increasingly common in California. All of our schools will be open tomorrow unless things change significantly. We have consulted with neighboring school districts in Solano and Contra Costa County.

The Vallejo City Unified School District will use the “Air Quality and Outdoor Activity Guidance for Schools” document co-authored by EPA, CDC and Department of Health and Human Services to monitor air quality. Please visit the website:
https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=744531

We will also use:
http://www.baaqmd.gov/sitecore/content/sparetheair/home/stay-informed/todays-air-quality

The Vallejo City Unified School District administration and personnel will continue to monitor the air quality throughout the day. We will consult with the Vallejo police and fire departments to ensure that our students and staff are safe.

Thank you,

Dr. Adam Clark

Many of us are concerned about the air quality and wondering if we are having school tomorrow. Unfortunately, the smoky air is becoming increasingly common in California. All of our schools will be open tomorrow unless things change significantly. We have consulted with neighboring school districts in Solano and Contra Costa County.

The Vallejo City Unified School District will use the “Air Quality and Outdoor Activity Guidance for Schools” document co-authored by EPA, CDC and Department of Health and Human Services to monitor air quality. Please visit the website:
https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=744531

We will also use:

The Vallejo City Unified School District administration and personnel will continue to monitor the air quality throughout the day. We will consult with the Vallejo police and fire departments to ensure that our students and staff are safe.

Thank you,

We are excited to share news that Veazie Community School has been accepted to participate in the USDA school breakfast/lunch meal program under current COVID-19 guidelines. Our participation means that all VCS students qualify to receive a free breakfast and lunch—remote learners too! We are not able to deliver meals as we did last spring and are presently organizing a meal pickup procedure for our remote learners. We are requesting that interested families contact Betsy Brooks, VCS Food Service Director by phone or email to be added to our list. Once we know how many people are requesting meals, we will communicate scheduled pickup times and starting date for this wonderful opportunity. Please reach contact Betsy Brooks asap to be added to this list: bbrooks@veaziecs.org 947-6573 ext. 209

Please note that we still need 100% of our families to complete the Free/Reduced Lunch application as this important document directly impacts State and Federal school funding levels.--Thank you!

Have a good afternoon!

With this school year ending differently than expected, we had to think outside of the box to show our appreciation to the staff at VCS.

This year, we will be providing ALL the staff at VCS with 9 - 40 minute, private/live workouts from Wilcox Wellness & Fitness. 👟🏋️‍♀️🤸‍♂️

We hope that they will all join in and enjoy this opportunity to be active while being at home.

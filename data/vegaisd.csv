Dakota Walker working her magic tonight. Getting the rough outline of what the ‚ÄúBilly the Kid‚Äùmural is going to look like. We are so excited to have Dakota do this mural. She is a Junior at Vega High School and a very talented artist. We had a creepy crawling tarantula climb down from the top of the granite while Dakota was working so now it will be drawn in as part of the mural and become part of the story. Billy the Kid visited Oldham County back in 1878, now 142 years later he will be back for Route 66 tourists to take a selfie with. Stay tuned for further updates on Dakota‚Äôs artwork.",0.0,"Milburn - Price Culture Museum

On Friday, March 13, 2020 the Texas FCCLA Board of Directors made the decision to cancel the 2020 State Leadership Conference that was scheduled to take place in Dallas April 2-4, 2020.

It was not an easy decision but one that was made in the interest of the health and safety of our members, advisors, volunteers, staff, and the communities in which we reside.

We know that members and advisors across our great state have been working hard to prepare for the State Leadership Conference and we (the Texas FCCLA State Staff, the Board of Directors, and the State Executive Council) are both so very proud of what each member and chapter has accomplished this school year and upset that you will not be able to fully showcase these efforts at the State Leadership Conference.

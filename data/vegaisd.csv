Dakota Walker working her magic tonight. Getting the rough outline of what the “Billy the Kid”mural is going to look like. We are so excited to have Dakota do this mural. She is a Junior at Vega High School and a very talented artist. We had a creepy crawling tarantula climb down from the top of the granite while Dakota was working so now it will be drawn in as part of the mural and become part of the story. Billy the Kid visited Oldham County back in 1878, now 142 years later he will be back for Route 66 tourists to take a selfie with. Stay tuned for further updates on Dakota’s artwork.",0.0,"Milburn - Price Culture Museum

Due to the school being closed, Vega Elementary will not have a summer reading program this year. But we want to encourage you to take some time to read your favorite books.

Students that don’t read during summer vacation can lose 2 months of reading proficiency. You all have worked so hard during the school to become great readers, don’t let that happen!!",2020-05-25 09:31:49,,

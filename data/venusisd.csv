Si continuamos siguiendo la guía de salud pública, menos de nuestros amigos y familiares se verán afectados por COVID-19. #StayHomeTexas",2020-04-08 11:58:06,https://video-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/92166857_2999469203445149_4756527721696198656_n.mp4?_nc_cat=105&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=kxNO63NFSacAX8bQRbn&_nc_ht=video-atl3-1.xx&oh=7cf7765f4b3c9d94bd6692f318cc0a0e&oe=5F64BE0F,

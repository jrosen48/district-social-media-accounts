Ms. Andaloro joins us today in Falcons Morning Announcements to recite a poem from Oliver Wendell Holmes. With its rich imagery and ringing verse, ""The Chambered Nautilus,"" by Oliver Wendell Holmes, is one of the most enduring nature poems of the mid-nineteenth century. Its subject is the nautilus, a sea creature that lives inside a spiral shell. As it grows, the nautilus makes new, larger chambers of its shell in which to live, closing off the old chambers and gradually forming a spiral. Holmes compares the nautilus to a ""ship of pearl"" sailing through enchanted but dangerous waters until it is wrecked.

Ms. Andaloro encourage us that in these times that we find ourselves in, we can surely see the opportunity for growth in our own souls.

Yesterday, August 4, the MSHSL Board of Directors met and made some decisions regarding fall sports for this school year. Listed below are some of the decisions that were made at this meeting.
Soccer, girls tennis, girls swimming and cross country will all begin on August 17 with modifications to the length of season and the total number of contests.
Volleyball and football have been moved to the spring (Mid-March through Mid-May).
The spring seasons will be pushed back to a “summer season” that will run from Mid-May through July.
Spring sports as well as volleyball and football will be allowed to practice during the fall.
The above decisions will also affect cheerleading and pep-band this fall.
These are the details that we currently have. We will be learning more in the coming days and weeks about what we will be able to do concerning practices this fall.
We promise to do our best to keep you updated as the situation evolves.

The Verndale staff would like to invite you to an End of Year Drive- BYE Parade!!! Your child will get to wave, air hug & show a big smile to say goodbye to their teacher! High School teachers will be situated in the school parking lot. Elementary teachers will be on 4th Street and Brown Street. Families will need to stay inside their vehicles, but may pull over (waves, air hugs, & car decorations encouraged!)

Part of the parade route will include drop off points for chromebooks, chargers and other materials.

Verndale staff sends wishes for a fun-filled safe summer.

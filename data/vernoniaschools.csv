Welcome Back!

We are very excited about the upcoming school year and partnering with you!

I wanted to let you know that classroom teachers will be contacting you some time this week to set up parent/ teacher conferences for next week.

The Chromebooks have arrived and our tech team is busy getting them prepared and ready to distribute. As soon as I have the details for pick up, I will let you know.

Teachers are busy finalizing their schedules for synchronous (live) and asynchronous (recorded lessons or assignments) learning to be shared during conferences.

Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns.

Due to some potentially severe budget cuts for the next school year, and an attempt to save money ahead of time, all Vernonia Schools and activities will be closed and cancelled this Friday, May 15, and likely all remaining Fridays in May and June.

Attention that this will impact all families receiving free breakfast and lunches for their children from the school.
Because we will be closed on Fridays we will begin sending home two days worth of meals on Thursdays. These meals can still be picked up at school between 11am-Noon on Thursdays, or they will still be delivered by bus on Thursdays if that is how you normally receive them.

Again, the VSD will no longer have meal pickup and delivery on Fridays. Double meals will be provided on Thursdays to make up for this inconvenience.

Happy Teacher Appreciation Week!!!

We can't thank you, our teachers, enough for all you do to take care of the children in our community!

You are there for them when they are hurt, happy, hungry, excited, upset, in need of someone to listen, in need of someone to be proud of them, and none of that has anything to do with the day job of teaching academics.

You are amazing people and we thank you for all you do for our kids! Even though we don't get to see you this week, know we are thinking about you!

Now, more than ever, the rest of the world is appreciating you, too!

Please complete the following survey to help the Vernonia School District determine how to positively impact our academic programs with extra money coming from the State. The recently passed Student Success Act (SSA) will provide the VSD with approximately $500,000 in extra funding earmarked to address four key areas of impact: Reducing Class Size, Increasing Instructional Time, Improving School Health and Safety, and adding resources to enhance a student’s Well-Rounded Education. These funds are separate from the general fund and Bond funding. SSA funding can’t be used to pay for current Bond projects, or increasing staff salaries.

The VHS Lady Loggers made short work of Santiam in the state softball playoffs on Wednesday, May 22, defeating the Wildcats 11-0 in 5 innings to reach the final 8. Senior pitcher Joyce Everett was dominant in recording the shutout and also chipped in a home run for the Lady Logger offense, which was aggressive at the plate - freshmen Brooklynn Walters also hit a home run and Nita Cook added 2 triples. Vernonia's defense was also sharp, led by shortstop Cook, second baseman Tomi Oata, first baseman Jordan Walters, and right fielder Jessica Butcher, who made several key plays.

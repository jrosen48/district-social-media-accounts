Instead, I want to promote the radio event that begins at noon today. Our school is included in this event. The event has been posted on this page, earlier this week. However, here is the link again (https://www.facebook.com/events/2253965431578125/). It also provides information on how to listen online.

There has been a lot of work being done on a constant basis and some of it ""behind the scenes"" to honor these seniors, and this is one of the ways.

Our Valedictorian(s) and Salutatorian collaborated together to create a speech to submit to the radio and put it into a video format for us to post online for all to see (the video has been posted to this Facebook page).

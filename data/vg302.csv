Voting starts on September 14th!

There won't be cheering fans on the sidelines, in the stands, or on the course this Fall. So, instead of Football games on Fridays this year, we're going to turn the competitions over to the FANS.

It's the School Spirit Showdown, where the most passionate fan base wins! If your school turns out big for volleyball, football, tennis, band, cheer, or ANYTHING We want to know. We're looking for the most passionate boosters of their school in Central Illinois.

Every week for six weeks, we'll have match-ups between two local schools. Voting will be open from Monday through Thursday at 11:59
pm. The school that gets the most votes moves on to the next round. The school that beats them all, and is crowned champion will win

The School Spirit Showdown Travelling Trophy, and gets $1000 donated to their school!

Ierik Sorenson

Birthday: 11/23

Who are some of your favorite musicians/bands?
Luke Bryan and Jon Pardi

What are your extra curricular activities?
Work at McDonald's and I used to run Track and Field. I have also played football and basketball.

What are your hobbies and interests?
My interests outside of school and sports consist of hunting, fishing, and playing video games, which is a weird mix.

What do you and your friends do for fun- before the Corona 19?
Most of the time we would be outside playing some sport, but when we were inside we would play Xbox.

What are your post high school plans?
I plan to go to Parkland College to give myself more time to figure out what I want to do for the rest of my life. This is the cheapest route that I can take, and I will transfer from there to a University.

Mrs. Osborne has provided some good resources that guide how to spend quality time together and collectively improve family resilience during this time.

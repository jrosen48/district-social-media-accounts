Of course the best part was getting to take flight in the wind tunnel while learning about basic concepts like terminal velocity, drag, air resistance, & the laws of motion.

As you may know, Victoria is from Eufaula and her father is the Vian school superintendent. Victoria has been battling brain tumors for most of her life. She has recently suffered a brain bleed and is currently in the hospital. The Vian and Eufaula communities love and support the Salcedo Family. Let‚Äôs continue to show our support this Friday! There will be a limited supply during the game, however, order forms are available for additional shirts. All orders must be prepaid at the booth. The Pink Bunny Co., located at 110 S. Thornton in Vian, will contact you for pickup availability. Thank you Vian, Eufaula, and surrounding communities!",2017-08-30 18:20:52,,

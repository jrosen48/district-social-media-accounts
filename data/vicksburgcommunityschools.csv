Roy said they would perform a screening and temperature check on each of the students that participate in each practice. Coaches would have to get creative with their workouts to get athletes back in-shape due to indoor facilities remaining closed.

""It's time to get creative let's think of ways that we can get these kids back in shape. It may not be the traditional working out in the gym or working out in the weight room, but can we do some stuff, outside that we can gather with 100 people.

Michigan high schools make plans for teams to begin summer workouts",7.0,"Vicksburg High School announced the end of their school year will be June 12, 2020, giving Vicksburg Schools Athletic Director Mike Roy time to formulate a plan for athletes to begin workouts on June 15.

Roy said they would perform a screening and temperature check on each of the students that participate in each practice. Coaches would have to get creative with their workouts to get athletes back in-shape due to indoor facilities remaining closed.

This order was expected, and I want all of you to know we have been working diligently on plans to continue learning during this unprecedented time.

With that being said, we have many details that still need to be worked out. I will communicate our plans for our students very soon. We cannot thank all of you enough for your patience, your calmness, and your support during this difficult time. We are in this together and rest assured, the well-being of our entire school community is our top priority.

I hope you can take some time to enjoy spring break. You have my promise that I will continue to communicate regularly regarding VCS operations.

First and foremost, we hope you are safe and healthy. Today, Governor Whitmer issued EXECUTIVE ORDER 2020-35, closing all schools for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year. This order was expected, and I want all of you to know we have been working diligently on plans to continue learning during this unprecedented time.

With that being said, we have many details that still need to be worked out. I will communicate our plans for our students very soon. We cannot thank all of you enough for your patience, your calmness, and your support during this difficult time. We are in this together and rest assured, the well-being of our entire school community is our top priority.

I hope you can take some time to enjoy spring break. You have my promise that I will continue to communicate regularly regarding VCS operations.

Please take care and know you are all in my thoughts.

Keevin O'Neill, Superintendent

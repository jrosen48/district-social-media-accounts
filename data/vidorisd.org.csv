First we made origami hearts and they each wrote a positive message on it. Then we hung them up in the high school inviting students to take a positive heart. All the hearts were gone in a day’s time. The students were so thrilled!
Then they designed creative valentine cards for the nursing home residents. They wrote positive and sweet messages inside with creativity in pop outs and cut outs. I dropped them off Thursday and they were handed out to the residents.

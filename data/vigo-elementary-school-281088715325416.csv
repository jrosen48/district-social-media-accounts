Good morning all,

I certainly know that many of you are dealing with larger issues this morning from the storm. It is an E-Learning or counted day for education in the VCSC but this is secondary and quite frankly if it does not occur today, it does not occur.

Many of you are without power and this includes many of our staff members as well and they simply may not be available during the hours of 9AM to 2PM.

As we have learned with Covid-19, we have to be flexible. We just did not know that today that Covid-19 would become secondary for many of us and our attention would turn elsewhere and with this we must be flexible today and patient as we have too many people dealing with much larger issues than that of education and this is primarily related to the storm from last night.

Hopefully we will slowly start to return to what is the new normal for the time being, but today, education is far more secondary.

Hope you all are safe and with this, please stay safe!

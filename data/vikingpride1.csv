IMPORTANT!!!!

Do you have a student starting kindergarten this fall? We need to hear from you! Packets were mailed out with a self-addressed, stamped envelope to return registration papers by 5/8. So far only a fraction of those have been returned. We MUST get these back in order to register your child.

Packets can be returned:
* by mail ASAP using the self addressed stamped envelope
* by drop off on Tuesday or Friday morning
* by emailing scanned documents to lmiles@gsd1.org

DEADLINE is May 29. At that point class lists will be made with the students whose parent(s) have completed the registration process. Both the original registration packet AND the supplemental packet mailed out recently are needed.

If you can help share this with those you know with a prekindergarten student, please share or tag.

Please call the elementary office if you have any questions 814-687-4263 and leave a message. You can also private message our FB page. Thank you! We can’t wait to meet the members of the Viking Class of 2033!",0.0,"Glendale Elementary PTO

Dear Elementary Choir Parents (Grades 3-6): The Elementary Choir and Band concerts are Monday, Dec. 16th at 1:30 PM, and Tuesday, Dec. 17th at 9:30 AM. Both concerts are FREE and are in the HS Auditorium.

To help your students have a more enjoyable experience under the hot stage lights, please see the following recommendations:

-Please dress your student in cool clothing. No hoodies or jackets on stage. Lite t-shirts are recommended to prevent overheating.

- Please make sure your student eats breakfast, even if it's small, to help stabilize blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of passing out.

- Please make sure your student has plenty to drink. I am ok with small water bottles on stage to drink between songs.

- If your student is not feeling well, please let me know so we can have a backup plan so your student doesn't become sick on stage.

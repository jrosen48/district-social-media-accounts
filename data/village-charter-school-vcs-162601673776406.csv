Wiley paints large, beautiful photorealistic portraits of African Americans using styles and symbols that rewrite history, and call into question the ways that black people are represented throughout history and in contemporary culture. Today in art class, we learned to draw a simple portrait, and create a patterned background that is a signature of Wiley’s paintings.

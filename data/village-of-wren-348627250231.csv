Ivan Voltz

WREN — As part of opening ceremonies for the Wiffleball Warehouse Tournament in Wren, local resident Ivan Voltz will be singing The National Anthem during opening ceremonies, starting at 5:50 p.m. Friday, August 17, at Wrenway Park.

Voltz was a Crestview bus driver for 30 years and also served in the United States Army in the Pacific as part of the occupation force in Japan just after World War II.

Other than his time in the military, Voltz has lived in the Wren area and is “proud to have laid his head on his own pillow every night”.

Thank you for being good neighbors and looking out for one another.
Thank you for keeping your properties looking beautiful. We see you cleaning the street in front of your home. Thank you for that and, thank you for not blowing grass into the street when you mow.
Wren will have lots of company this weekend and thanks for helping us get the Village ready.

PS - If you have a vehicle that doesn’t run and/or is not currently plated it needs to be removed. Let us know how we can help.

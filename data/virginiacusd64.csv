The Virginia CUSD #64 4th grade class went above and beyond this year breaking the record for their largest donation to date with $4032.71.
Since the 4th grade class stated this fundraiser in 1994, they have raised $55,000 for our amazing Shriners Hospitals for Children - St. Louis.

This year was especially special for us because Preston, a patient at our Shriners Hospitals for Children- St. Louis and our incredible patient ambassador was part of this years class and gave a challenge to his class - the student who raised the most money gets to design his new prosthetic. We can’t wait to see what they come up with!

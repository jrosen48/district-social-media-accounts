We are so excited to announce the official kick off of our United Schools of Indianapolis Chromebooks Campaign!

When we found that 30% of our students don't have access to the technology needed to participate in our home learning program, we decided to raise the funds to purchase 150 chromebooks for our students. Without access to technology our kids will fall behind in their education and we want to see our students thrive in their academics.

We are a supportive community of teachers, families, and administrators who do our very best to install a love of learning in our scholars that will lead to lifelong success.

Help us reach our goal by donating at https://charity.gofundme.com/chromebook-campaign

Every bit helps us get closer to our goal. No donation is too small or too large. If you cannot donate you can still support us by sharing this post with your followers. Let‚Äôs work together to support the next generation of leaders!",2.0,"Vision Academy at Riverside

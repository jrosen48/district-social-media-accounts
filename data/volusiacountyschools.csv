Now more than ever, we want to make sure we provide every opportunity for students to have every minute possible to make up for lost learning from COVID-19.

In the Fall of 2020-2021, Volusia County Schools is planning to have all students start on the first day of school. This will ensure that all students are afforded the opportunity to participate in 180 days of school, in alignment with Florida Statutes.

If a staggered schedule is requested, we will work with each school on a case by case basis to ensure the needs of our kindergarten parents, students, and staff are being met.

We will work with individual school's needs to ensure a smooth transition.

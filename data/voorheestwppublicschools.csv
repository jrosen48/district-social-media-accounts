The students were then able to put their own ideas about architecture into practice by being asked to find materials to build with including Legos, blocks, cups, boxes, and other architectural items. The results of this assignment were magnificent and the students did a fantastic job in creating their own masterpieces. I was beyond impressed to see how creative all of the projects were.

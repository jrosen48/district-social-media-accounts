Kristin Marietti, Second Grade

I absolutely love being a teacher. It was my dream as a little girl and my dream came true. The best thing about being a teacher is watching others improve themselves little by little, one day at a time. It's such a beautiful thing to be a part of.

I have an amazing class this year. They are full of love and dedication. I have watched this year as my class has overcome many obstacles.They are such an amazing group of 2nd graders. They also give the best hugs. I miss their hugs.

While I've been in quarantine I have enjoyed reading more books, playing board games and being with my dogs. One thing I have appreciated more while being in quarantine is the peace that I feel in the many quiet moments I experience. I am more aware of my childrens laughter, the bird singing, and the breeze blowing through an open window. These moments remind me that it's okay. Things will be okay.

Some fun facts about me are I LOVE dogs, I enjoy playing the piano, and I really like to bake. But I LOVE my family and my students most of all!!!",,,0.0,"Teacher Spotlight of the Day!

Something she has learned or enjoyed doing while in quarantine?

I have loved being able to garden and take Jo on more walks. I also bought a bike after almost 20 years without one!

Voyage Academy was recently able to celebrate our 5-year anniversary. Many fantastic individuals helped prepare and put on a celebration of success for the school. We would like to give a round of applause to our student council and choir members who put on a stellar program. Becky Mortensen and Amy Mills that helped plan and organize the event with detailed consideration. Many local and state officials took time out of their day to attend and offer their ongoing support to Voyage. Thank you to our school board, administration, teachers, staff, students and parents for five wonderful years. We look forward to the continued success of the school thanks to the dedication of our Voyage family.",0.0,"Voyage Academy added 44 new photos.

Voyage Academy was recently able to celebrate our 5-year anniversary. Many fantastic individuals helped prepare and put on a celebration of success for the school. We would like to give a round of applause to our student council and choir members who put on a stellar program. Becky Mortensen and Amy Mills that helped plan and organize the event with detailed consideration. Many local and state officials took time out of their day to attend and offer their ongoing support to Voyage. Thank you to our school board, administration, teachers, staff, students and parents for five wonderful years. We look forward to the continued success of the school thanks to the dedication of our Voyage family.",2018-05-21 00:01:35,,

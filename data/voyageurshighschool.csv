I just wanted to provide you with an update as to how things are going in the preparation of what ways we might be having school this fall. Our deepest hope is that we all can be back together again at one time but we also need to prepare for combinations of that as well as distance learning.
As far we know there will be an announcement next week that will identify how the school year will start this fall. We’ve had many meetings this summer as we make plans for ways to deliver education and keep all as safe as possible.
We will also be reaching out to each family in the next few weeks to check on your status this fall and answer any questions that you might have. The office is staffed Mon-Thurs from 9am-3pm and we’ll be back to a regular schedule starting August 3rd.
We have added to our website some guidelines from the Minnesota Department of Health that asks all families to prepare for different scenarios should the COVID-19 issue affect you.

Stay safe!

I recognize that this news might be difficult to hear for our school community and many of us were still hoping to return to our typical Spring time activities.
We will use both May 1 and May 4 as staff training days to fine tune our current Distance Learning Plan. Those days will be non-instructional days for students. Classes will resume on May 5th. We will also keep you updated on any new changes that take place with our plan.

Dear Voyageurs Expeditionary School Families,

Governor Walz has announced the closure of all schools to students in Minnesota beginning Wednesday, March 18 through Friday, March 27. Voyageurs Expeditionary School WILL BE in session Monday, March 16 and Tuesday, March 17.

This time will be used by our staff to plan educational services in the event of a longer school closure. We will also be deep cleaning the school.

Bag lunches will be provided for students on a “grab and go” basis.

A parent survey has been posted on the Voyageurs Expeditionary School website to help us prepare for distance learning and know how many daily lunches to prepare. Your participation in the survey is CRITICAL in helping us formulate our plan of action.

As always, our first priority is the safety and well-being of our students. We also want to ensure every child has access to the education they need and deserve.

As more information is made available, we will post on our website, our Facebook page and utilize JMC for messages.

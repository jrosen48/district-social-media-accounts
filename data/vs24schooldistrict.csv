Will you help them support St. Jude by donating today?

How your support helps:

Families never receive a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel, housing or food — because all a family should worry about is helping their child live.

St. Jude is working to drive the overall survival rate for childhood cancer to 90%, and we won't stop until no child dies from cancer.

St. Jude freely shares the discoveries it makes, and every child saved at St. Jude means doctors and scientists worldwide can use that knowledge to save thousands of more children.

Please visit their St. Jude page to make a donation. Once you donate, please share it on Facebook and Twitter with a challenge to support the kids of St. Jude. You'll help families and patients around the world.

Our upper elementary students continued working on their comic book projects. This week the students have learned about character development and are thinking deeply about the characters for their own comic strips.

Our fifth-grade students expanded and connected their comic character knowledge to doodle art and mindfulness. The students learned about the relaxing qualities doodling has on our minds and bodies.

Due to the COVID 19 pandemic, many people have lost their jobs and are in need of some help. The Wright Center for Community Medicine is holding a food drive in May and is looking for donations.

The Valley View Soccer Teams are looking to help. Since it’s hard to find cases of canned goods in stores today to donate, there was a reach out to the players yesterday to see if anyone was interested in donating a can or two per each soccer family to help make a big difference in the lives of someone who needs it.

On Wednesday May 6th after 5 pm some of the kids will be driving around to pick up cans to donate.

This is just an FYI and if you want to help out as well just leave them on your porch or by your mailbox and someone will pick them up.

Either reach out to one of the girls or boys varsity soccer players with your address to forward on to us or you can PM me your address and we will send someone over to pick it up.

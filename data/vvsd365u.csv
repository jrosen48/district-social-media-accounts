This fall, we‚Äôll be taking you on visits to a variety of classrooms throughout the District to show you how teachers are adapting their methods of instruction to meet the needs of their students who are learning from home.

Watch the video to visit the Advanced Placement Economics class of Bolingbrook HS Social Studies Teacher Mr. Michael Rende. Proving he‚Äôs a lifelong learner, Mr. Rende has developed a classroom setup with three monitor screens. The largest contains the Zoom window of his students, a second screen is where he manages the curriculum materials, and the third is where he can see the chat window so that he can always see current questions and feedback from students.

Teachers throughout VVSD are learning, evaluating, adapting, and yes, sometimes even rejecting, systems and methods as they refine remote learning to best meet the needs of students.

Among the concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic is shortages of cleaning supplies for public buildings. VVSD is being proactive in preventing such shortages with the help of cleaning services contractor GSF-USA.

Throughout all VVSD school buildings, GSF-USA is using the PathoSans System which generates cleaning products on-site thereby eliminating concerns about shortages. In addition, PathoSans cleaning products reliably kill 99.999% of bacteria without exposing workers to harsh chemicals and also eliminates the need for multiple cleaning solutions for various surfaces.

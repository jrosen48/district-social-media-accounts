📝 Dear Innovation Families,

We are so excited to launch the 2020-21 school year! Our staff has been working hard to create an engaging, meaningful learning experience for students in the safest setting.

Distance learning to launch the year: After stakeholder input and county and state health guidance, ICS will begin the year with a distance-learning model, with opportunities for teachers to plan in-person activities for 5 students or less. As soon as it is deemed safe, we will transition to a hybrid model. We will monitor the latest recommendations and communicate with families regularly.

We miss our students and can’t wait to connect with you all soon!

Spread the word! WA-BLOC providing free hot lunch for students in the Rainier Beach Community tomorrow and every Tuesday/Thursday while schools remain closed!

*UPDATE!!! We have updated serving time to 1-3pm at the Rainier Beach Community Center Plaza so we do not directly overlap with SPS lunch distribution time!

Please do not come if you are over 60 or have underlying health conditions.

Please do not come if you or anyone in your household has any sick symptoms.

We will have several sanitation stations. You must sanitize before receiving your food box.

We will be marking recommended 6 feet of social distance with chalk to ensure any line that forms will meet social distance requirements.

Students/families must 'grab' food boxes and 'go' and will not be allowed to stay and eat to ensure we stay under 50 people at all times.

Thank you for understanding and helping keep us all safe!",3.0,"SHARING -

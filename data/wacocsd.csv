I have been in communication with the other area league commissioners. We are attempting to put together a schedule and will relay that info as soon as I can. Once I have all the registration forms, I can let them know how many teams we have and get us divided (if more than 1 team). I have had a few forms come to my home, thus far no coaches, so parents please be thinking if you're willing to help coach. I will get with the coaches soon to discuss practices and the season.

WYAA is looking for new volunteers to join our team. If you're interested please do not hesitate to reach out. WYAA meets the second Wednesday of each month @ 6pm, either at the HS lunch room or recently via Zoom.

After a lot of thought, conversations, and planning we have decided to cancel Prom and all events associated.

We put students in front of all of our decisions so please know that this wasn't an easy decision to make. We worked very hard to pull it off but we are not in an environment where it would still be meaningful and memorable for students.

I appreciate your flexibility in dealing with information releases about Prom and for everyone who worked hard throughout the year to offer kids the best.

As we move forward we will work to offer seniors a memorable send-off, and we will continue to put what's best for students first in our decisions.

Mrs. Settles' singing voice is a bit rusty. However she would like to share her snow day announcement lyrics with you... maybe we will have to record Mrs. Langr or Mrs. Barnhart next time!

Hello? It's me.
I'm standing here, out in this complete mysery
because. you need. to know it's another day at home.

Hello? Can ya hear me?
I'm in southeast Iowa dreaming about what Spring used to be...
We were warmer, and free,
I've forgotten how it felt before our toes began to freeze...

Theres such a difference, between us, and a million. Degrees....

Hello from the WACO siiiide
It feels like a slip and sliddddeee
But I know you'll stay warm wherever you are...
Please dont, leave the house, or drive very farrr

Here are a few tips from the Iowa State Patrol.

Bus Stop Rules For the Kids
• Stop and look both ways before crossing any street.
• Getting on or off the bus, do not cross the street until the bus driver signals it’s ok to cross.
• Always cross in front of the bus far enough ahead to be seen by the driver (5 giant steps ahead).
• Never cross behind the bus or run behind the bus.
• Do not run, push or shove when waiting at the bus
stop, and always arrive a few minutes early.
• Wait until the bus driver brings the bus to a complete
stop before attempting to get on the bus.
• Never pick up anything dropped near the bus; tell the
bus driver and follow his or her directions.
• Never crawl under a bus.

Washing your hands is easy, and it’s one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of germs. Clean hands can stop germs from spreading from one person to another and throughout an entire community—from your home and workplace to childcare facilities and hospitals.

Follow these five steps every time.

Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap.
Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the “Happy Birthday” song from beginning to end twice.
Rinse your hands well under clean, running water.
Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry them.
Why? Read the science behind the recommendations.

6A 2019-11-11. Here is a Public Service Announcement from the Iowa Department of Transportation: Please give us room to work. Snowplows don't operate like any other vehicle on the road. If you see a plow, don't tailgate it or drive along side it for any distance. Blowing snow makes it very hard for the driver to see you. If you are driving this morning, put your phone away.

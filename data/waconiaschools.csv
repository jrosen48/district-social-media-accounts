A heartfelt CONGRATULATIONS to Michael Jensen for being awarded the Accomplished Waconia Educator Award for 2020! One of his nominators had this to say: ""Mr. Jensen is one of the most incredible teachers I have ever met. His passion for what he does shows through his teaching style, attitude, and personality every single day. Not only does he do a fabulous job teaching the curriculum, but he ensures that every single student he encounters is taught the life lessons that are needed to be successful. Mr. Jensen has become more than just a teacher for students at Waconia High School, he has become a mentor as well. ""

When asked why he became a teacher, Mike said: Having the chance to share life lessons and connect our content to a student's life brings purpose to your life. Having the chance to do this surrounded by a supportive community of educators and families bring joy to your life.

The lights at the WHS stadium, the Bayview field, and the tennis courts will be turned on from 8:30 pm to 10:20 pm (110 minutes). In addition to providing a message of hope and encouragement, we want to celebrate the tremendous support all of our students enjoy from the entire ONE10 community, especially the Class of 2020.

If you'd like to join in, plan to turn on your porch light, yard lights, or any other outdoor lights you may have on Monday night. Here's a chance for all of us to throw a little extra light and love on the Class of 2020! #BeTheLightMN #allinthistogether #WEareONE10",2020-04-19 21:34:46,,

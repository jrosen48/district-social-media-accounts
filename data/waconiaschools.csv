A heartfelt CONGRATULATIONS to Michael Jensen for being awarded the Accomplished Waconia Educator Award for 2020! One of his nominators had this to say: ""Mr. Jensen is one of the most incredible teachers I have ever met. His passion for what he does shows through his teaching style, attitude, and personality every single day. Not only does he do a fabulous job teaching the curriculum, but he ensures that every single student he encounters is taught the life lessons that are needed to be successful. Mr. Jensen has become more than just a teacher for students at Waconia High School, he has become a mentor as well. ""

When asked why he became a teacher, Mike said: Having the chance to share life lessons and connect our content to a student's life brings purpose to your life. Having the chance to do this surrounded by a supportive community of educators and families bring joy to your life.

Out of 857 outstanding student musicians across the state of Minnesota, 248 students were selected to participate in the 2020-2021 All State Choir. Waconia High School Choirs had 12 incredibly talented students audition this year, and 6 students were selected! This is only the second time in school history that we've reached the maximum number of students allowed per school! 🙌🏻

Each school does something unique to express words of thanks and display messages of gratitude in honor of veteran friends and family members. Students are asked, “What can you do to thank a veteran on Veterans Day?” 🙏

Today, various program activities included: students reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, a 4th grade class signing the Pledge, members of the WHS band playing the Star Spangled Banner, and veteran friends and relatives joining students for a recognition breakfast.

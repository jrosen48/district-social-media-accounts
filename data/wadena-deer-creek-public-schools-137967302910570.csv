Grade You Will Teach: 1st grade

Hometown and High School: Wadena-Deer Creek Class of 2014 -- once a Wolverine, always a Wolverine! 💙💛

College/Years Teaching: Minnesota State University-Moorhead. This is my first year teaching!

Pastimes: playing sports, being outdoors, enjoying the lake, cooking and baking.

Family: My amazing son Jax, who is 2 years old.

Best advice you’ve ever received: “You can’t go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending.”

What do you love about teaching: I love each unique personality in the classroom and being able to be my students’ biggest cheerleader in all they do.

Something unique about yourself: I love to wake surf!

What is your dream superpower: To be invisible!

WDC senior Paige Kilbury is back in the hospital fighting an infection, according to her dad, Chad.

In a message this morning, 7/10, he writes:

“She’s doing as good as she can, she is in a lot of pain still as it is to be expected. But she’s a fighter, that’s for sure!”

Paige received her liver transplant on June 20, 2020. She had been on life support for eight days prior to the transplant.

When Paige does get released from the hospital, hopefully today, she will go to back to the Ronald McDonald House. Paige and her mom will be there for a month “to make sure Paige’s meds are tweeked just right and to see if her new liver has any rejection issues,” he said.

Please continue to keep Paige and her family in your thoughts and prayers. She has a long road ahead of her.

A fundraiser has been set up by Amy Kine to help with medical expenses.

""Our coaches may not work with our student-athletes until that time. We will continue to offer information for the kids and reach out to maintain positive relationships and support.

Starting June 2, grab-and-go/heat-at-home student meals will be offered. Pick up will be from 11am-12:30pm at the WDC Elementary south entrance (cafeteria doors), M-F, through Aug. 13.

At this time, due to social distancing, we cannot allow students/families to eat meals in the cafeteria. This program is for youth 18 years and younger.

As part of a small group of Career Tech Administrators from across the state representing Compacts, Comprehensive High Schools, Career Centers and Joint Vocational School Districts I had a wonderful opportunity to talk yesterday with Ohio's leadership team of Governor DeWine, Lt. Gov. Husted, State Superintendent DeMaria, and State Health Director Dr. Amy Acton. The state leaders understand that Career Tech Education has special needs and concerns regarding the reopening of school this fall. They wanted to gather input from the field to help form plans that will keep people safe and allow hands on learning to continue. We certainly appreciate the state's leadership teams efforts to gather accurrate information to guide them in the important decisions to come!",3.0,"From the Four Cities Compact.

Happy Friday Everyone! More great news from the Compact’s Business Management Program! We were awaiting results for our students who recently competed virtually in the Business Professionals of America State Conference.

And .....The results are IN!!!!

Senior Ethan Wise (WHS) placed FIRST in Payroll Accounting;
Senior Elizabeth Stedman (WHS) placed FIRST in Fundamental Word Processing;
Senior Alex Klein (BHS) placed FOURTH in Intermediate Word Processing;
Junior Jayanah Sutton (NHS) placed FIFTH in Legal Office Procedures;
Junior Jakob Denee (WHS) placed SEVENTH in Fundamental Accounting.

Students placing in the top five would normally advance to the National Conference which unfortunately has been cancelled.

So proud of our students who rise up and accept challenges regardless of the obstacles they face",2.0,"Good news from the Four Cities Compact! Way to go Grizzlies!

Happy Friday Everyone. If anyone wonders how our animal friends from the Animal Care and Science Program (@ Copley HS) are doing -by the looks of these photos -they are doing just fine! Poof the Chinchilla is under the care of Madison Miller. Bean and Oliver (Kitties) are with Ashley Payton, and Poppy the Hedgehog is with Rachel Roberts. As well as being cared for (and maybe pampered a bit) the animals help the students by providing an opportunity for continued hands on learning. Program teacher Rachel McClenaghan still oversees the general care for the animals and is providing lessons to the students that allows them to continue their studies in the field. Thanks for all the good work students!!",0.0,"Happy Friday from the Four Cities Compact!

Although our school buildings may be closed for now, work is continuing on the Compact’s Senior Carpentry house project in Wadsworth. Teacher Chris Kallai and various contractors are keeping the project moving. Mr. Kallai has been sharing video clips with his students as he works on different parts of the job. He also gives class assignments to them based on the work he is demonstrating. It’s not ideal but it’s a way to keep the learning happening.

Also, many thanks to Davis Door for their donation of the nice garage door! Also to Bill Alexander and the good crew of AK Construction that laid the concrete for the driveway, sidewalks, and beautiful patio!

Compact Carpentry students have been hard at work the last few days helping with a home addition for fellow Compact student Emma Pfouts who has been hospitalized since Oct. after experiencing a severe health crisis. A new addition that will be more conducive to the care Emma will need when she returns home is being built with donated materials and labor. Students and teacher Chris Kallai were even over volunteering on the project last weekend before braving the weather this week to keep the project moving. Awesome to watch these exceptional students at work and see them using their gifts talents and abilities to help others in need.

""Career Tech Thursday"" visits have been taking place throughout the month of January here at the Four Cities Compact. Mostly Sophomore students from our 4 districts visited the Compact programs at Barberton HS last week. Students first attend the Compact Showcase in November then have an opportunity to actually visit the program and speak again with the teacher and current students to make sure it is a good fit for them in January. There are already nearly 350 students who have applied to Compact programs and numbers typically rise higher right after each one of the visits. Tomorrow it will be a visit to Wadsworth HS- where prospective students will see-Automotive Technologies, Engineering, Programming/Robotics, Media, Marketing, and Carpentry.

As an additional component to the unit, students were part of the Postcrossings movement and sent and received postcards from all over the world. They were comparing languages, customs, traditional cultures, postage, currency, and even landmarks. The class kept track on our map of all the different locations they received cards from. The site also gave data on: how long it took for the cards to be delivered, the amount of miles the cards traveled, and current events and happenings from across the globe!

In November the teachers travelled to Danville Community College in Virginia for an intense training that will help them successfully operate the lab's new CNC Milling Machine and teach their students how to use it as well. The level of learning for young Engineers in training goes much deeper when they can design a part and then actually manufacture it as would be done in typical production. Many thanks to both Mr Shipley and Mr Van Kirk for their efforts- great role models of being lifelong learners!",2019-12-31 10:53:49,,

Although all of our students enjoy breaks from school our Compact Automotive Program (@Wadsworth HS) students also enjoy brakes of another kind. Junior Auto students were working on brake repair before the holidays while the seniors continue work on their special class project. Their goal is to have this 1957 Ford Ranchero on the road in June. The class is working to completely rebuild the brake, steering, and suspension of the car. They will also recondition the transmission, rear end and install a big block 460 Ford engine. Enjoy your well deserved time off Auto students -when classes resume next week it will be back to brakes!",0.0,"From the Four Cities Compact

Happy Friday from the Four Cities Compact. I wanted to make you all aware of a special Compact shirt that is being sold as a fundraiser to help with Compact Athletic Health Science Program and Norton High School Student Emma Pfouts. As many in the four communities are aware Emma has been in need of extensive medical care since experiencing an extreme health emergency several months ago. Her classmates and teacher in Athletic Health Program (@Norton HS) wanted to do something special to help show support both moral and financial to Emma and her family as they face these extreme hardships. The shirts being sold are black long sleeve drifit shirts featuring the Compact logo and Emma Strong logo together. If you are interested in purchasing one they are being sold from now until Jan. 17th with delivery to the high school offices on Jan. 31st. Five dollars from each shirt will be donated to the family.

The Compact's Automotive Technologies Seniors (program housed at Wadsworth HS) in the class of 2019 finished the 1972 Chevy C10 Truck restoration project they did as a class project last year. Almost every bolt was turned on this truck and all the work was performed by students. All suspension and steering components were replaced. The motor was completely overhauled with new high performance upgrades. The body of the truck was removed and the frame cleaned and painted. All the truck needs now is a good paint job and it will be complete.

These class projects really help provide the students with some outstanding and unique learning opportunities and they take great pride in them.

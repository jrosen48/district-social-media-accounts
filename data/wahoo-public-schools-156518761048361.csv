There is one staff member at the elementary and one student at the high school that have received positive tests; however, because of procedures and protocols we have in place, and in coordination with Three Rivers Health Department, we have significantly minimized any potential exposure to others in our buildings. Unless you have been contacted directly, your student or staff member is not considered to be at high-risk for exposure. We will continue operating as we have for the first 2.5 weeks of school.

I would implore everyone to encourage your students to continue abiding by the practices in place at school. They are working. Further, by practicing social distancing and masks outside of school, we increase our opportunities to keep the doors open for students throughout the year. The school year is off to a great start and we love seeing the students in our buildings. Stay safe, stay healthy, and have a great weekend!

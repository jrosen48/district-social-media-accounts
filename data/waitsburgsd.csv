“Future Occupation and Schooling: Lawyer in the army.

-Greatest Accomplishment: Sporting events, my leadership I’ve held in clubs, the passion and excitement for everything we the senior class did.

-Favorite Teacher: Mr. Kiefel! He has always seen my strengths before I ever did, when I thought I had a weakness he would turn it around and show me the strength I had in it! I still have a note he wrote on one of my tests from sophomore year😁

-Favorite Memory: Every sports event! Our students, whether they played or not cheered hard, they gave our athletes drive and made the games more exciting!”

With the recent pandemic outbreak forcing school closures throughout Washington, Idaho, and Oregon, many students are missing out on important memories of their school year. A big part of Spring Picture Day for students is having their class group photo taken alongside their friends, teachers, and mentors. We want to help students preserve the memories of their time spent at school with their classmates in 2019-2020.

It is with a very heavy heart I am writing to let you know (as I’m sure many have suspected) that we will not be having our annual 6th Grade Camp this year. As many of you know, the camp and surrounding roadways were affected by the recent flooding in the area that occurred around the first part of February. We were unsure of how quickly the camp and roads would be back up and operational and had been waiting to hear about their progress…but now with our school closures and “Social Distancing” needs, Wooten has officially cancelled camp for this year.

So, I am looking forward to next year…anticipating that we will be able to once again enjoy all that Camp Wooten has to offer. Until then, stay safe and healthy.

At 2:20 today there was a report of a safety issue on Main Street. A staff member consulted with the police and the police indicated a desire that we reroute students away from Main Street when school was dismissed.

Elementary students are dismissed at 2:40 – A decision was made to have all elementary students be dismissed to the multi-purpose room. Staff then worked together to separate bus students, Cardinal Nest students, students picked up by parents, and walking students. Students were released in small groups when it was determined that they could safely go home. Students that would normally cross Main Street were led away from Main Street by staff and rerouted away from the area of concern.

The entire process was completed by 2:52 –

JH and WHS students were told that Main Street was closed and to walk/drive home using alternative routes to Main Street.

We would love to have as many volunteers as possible to help run the meet so that coaches can focus more on their athletes. We'd like helpers at each field event (long jump, triple jump, shot put, discus, javelin and high jump), as well as assisting with timing.

It's a great way to support the kids, and get a front-row seat at a great event.

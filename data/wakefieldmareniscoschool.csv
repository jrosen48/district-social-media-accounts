The WM Staff has had a lot of fun over the years planning surprising send-offs for our students on the last day of school. Even though this has not been a normal school year, we would still like to wish everyone farewell for the summer.
Buses carrying the staff will be traveling past students' houses (GSRP-Grade 11) on Thursday, June 4, which would have been our last day of school. The route will start at approximately 10:00 in Ironwood, making our way to Bessemer, Wakefield, Marenisco, and Bruces Crossing. The buses will not be stopping, but will slow near houses to give us time to say goodbye and wish everyone a good summer.

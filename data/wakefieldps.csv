Based on the updated State guidance for phase 3, Danversport has confirmed that they will only be able to offer a meal to 100 guests maximum with no dancing. These are not the conditions that will allow for a celebratory and fun senior prom.

However, the Senior Committee is currently working with the Class Advisors, the Class Officers, and administration to put together an alternative celebration for early August which will include viewing footage from graduation and the senior show combined with food and some activities that can be done with appropriate social-distancing and masks. We are still looking into possibilities for this event and more information will be out as soon as possible.

Many of our volunteers “hit the pavement” to give out Certificate of Excellent awards for the 2020 Celebration of Learning along with a lawn sign to celebrate the recipients.
The awards are given to “students who best exemplify to their peers and teachers a living example of their school’s CORE VALUES (Pillars of Character), day in and day out throughout their academic career”. Congratulations to all of this year’s recipients! They should be very proud!

From Elizabeth:
“To celebrate teacher appreciation week, I interviewed college seniors graduating this spring and edited it into a one minute video. Most of the kids are Wakefield High graduates and there are a couple of Wakefield High shoutouts. I just wanted to share!! We really loved our Wakefield High teachers!”

Dear Class of 2020,
It is hard to find the words that will make any sense of this whole situation. There is nothing that can be said that will fix what we are dealing with right now. It is hard to think that we will never be able to have our last’s. Our final sports game, our final class, goodbyes to our teachers, and especially the final morning greeting from Mr. Mullaney walking into school. But, it is important that we focus on the great memories that we were able to make together over our past four years at WMHS.

In early March, Neal Nichols hosted his Geography Gameshow for 6th grade students at the Galvin Middle School. The program provided some friendly competition among classmates as a way to reinforce their social studies curriculum. Nichols, an artist and seasoned international traveler, rendered a large map from memory, as he engaged students in a series of discussions and trivia contests about Ancient Civilizations.

The Geography Gameshow was sponsored by The Galvin School PTO and a grant from the Wakefield Educational Foundation (WEF).

For the 8th time in 9 years, the NAMM Foundation has named the Wakefield Public School District one of the ""Best Communities for Music Education."" in the country.
Districts were chosen for this honor because they demonstrate outstanding achievement in their efforts to provide music access and education to all students. This year, 754 school districts from across the country and 15 school districts in Massachusetts received this honor.
The “Best Communities” designation recognizes collaborative, from-the-ground-up efforts for teachers, administrators, students and parents who continually work to keep comprehensive music education as an integral part of the core curriculum. These districts also lead the way with learning opportunities as outlined in the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), which recommends music and the arts as important elements of a well-rounded education for all children.",2.0,"Wakefield High School Bands

Whale Day at the Walton!!

Walton students enjoyed “Whale Day” with a visit from the New England Aquarium thanks to a grant from Wakefield Educational Foundation (WEF). The grant allowed students in grades 1-4 to learn about whales through a series of interactive exhibits alongside a giant inflatable right whale named “Calvin”. Kindergarten students also benefited from the grant with the Aquarium’s Tidepools Alive hands-on program.

WEF has awarded over $380,000 to schools across the Wakefield Public Schools district since 1989. Learn more by following WEF on Twitter or Facebook, or go to www.WEF01880.org.

We hope your summer is going well! With guidance from the state, we are preparing for the reopening of school this fall. Plans and options will be available to you before the end of this month.

We realize that wearing masks may be part of the new reality. If so, what could be better than wearing a mask designed by one of our own students? We invite students to tap into their creative genius and design a mask for Walden. Please send ideas to Hannah, Sharon or Lois by Friday, July 10th. A panel of teachers will be the judges and a local company will print the winning designs on masks to be ready for the first day of school.

There is a template you can use attached. We can't wait to see what you come up with!

Stay safe!

Dear Walden Community,

On March 13th, our governor issued a soft closure (dismissal) of schools for two weeks. This afternoon, we received an update letting us know that schools in Utah will remain in this state of soft closure through May 1, 2020. State officials will continue to monitor the current health crisis and make adjustments to the timeline for reopening schools as needed.

We have been amazed at the outpouring of care and support from our Walden families as we figure out how to best educate our students from a distance. There have certainly been plenty of technological glitches and communication hurdles and we realize the great challenge a continued dismissal creates for many of our Walden families. Please know that your physical and mental wellbeing is our primary concern.

Thank you for your continued effort in keeping Walden a safe, patient and strong community. Please stay safe, and healthy.

For clarification we wanted to send a couple of reminders about the dance tonight, especially if your student is planning on bringing a guest.

-This is a high school dance intended for high school students ages 14-18.
-If you are bringing a guest, you MUST have the signed dance permission form to get in (must have parent signatures).
-Your guest will not be permitted without a filled out and signed form.
-If you are bringing a guest from another school, they should bring a photo ID (school ID is fine).
-If your guest is 18, I need their name right away. We are required to run background checks on all visitors who are 18.

Please let me know if you have questions :) See you tonight!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1523334797820768&id=859847827502805,,0.0,"Hi Students & Parents!

If your child is not on Walkabout please disregard the following.

Due to storm clouds we decided not to take any students up Timpanogos mountain today. All of our students who attended walkabout went on the Rock Canyon hike and are staying on camp grounds between the Rock Canyon trailhead and Squaw Peak. We are keeping an eye on the weather as there is still a slight risk of showers in that area and we know that soggy students are sad students. Please keep an eye on your email or our Facebook page for updates in case we need to bring the students home quickly.

We recognize the disruption to education caused by the weather over the past few weeks. Tomorrow's forecast once again includes a threat of ice, further complicated by a planned staff professional development day. Obviously, there is little educational value to a potential late start and early dismissal combined in one day, and we don't want to risk unnecessary cancellation.

In light of the potential weather tomorrow, all CCSU schools will plan to have a full day of school on Friday, February 8th, and will cancel our plans for an early dismissal. We understand families may have already made other afternoon plans, and will certainly excuse your child if that is the case.

While we hope we won't have to delay tomorrow, we will make that call tomorrow morning following our usual procedures.

The game has several forms, the one that has surfaced locally is the most dangerous form. In short, one person chokes another person until the individual passes out. The game is popular because bystanders enjoy watching the victim fall and victims volunteer because the experience produces a temporary high.

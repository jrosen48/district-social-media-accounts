With the first day on the books I would like to express my appreciation to the community in helping us work through the start of school. I am very proud of the students in how they conducted themselves with social distancing, and wearing their masks. Thank you to parents for your patience! We dealt with two power outages in the community today which affected our high school electricity, and we had a very large car rider pickup line which caused delays. We will reflect on the day, and work to make any adjustments needed to help our traffic flow. If you’re an off-site learner and experienced any issues logging on or using the learning management system, please call the school and we will do everything we can to assist. We are currently waiting on delivery from the state for the internet hotspots, but will notify everyone set to receive one as soon as they arrive. Thank you again for your support, as we work to make this new process better and better.

There have been several questions regarding the hotspots that are going to be provided for off-site students.

Unfortunately most if not all schools across the state have not received the allotment yet. As soon as our school receives the hot spots we will contact families that are signed up to receive one and arrange for pickup. Until that time rest assured that students using this option will not be penalized for any missing assignment, and will be provided ample time to complete the work.

This is Daniel Fielding, Superintendent of Waldron Schools. I’m sure word is spreading fast regarding the mandatory school closure on Tuesday March 17th. Our administration, teachers and staff had already made preparations for a possible closure. Schools have the option to close on Monday March 16th as well. We are choosing to go ahead and close school tomorrow March 16th with a current date of March 30th to resume classes. Resume date will be re-evaluated by the Arkansas Department of Education as that date approaches.

Day 1 is in the books! All students started the day out at high school and was able to eat breakfast. Huge thanks to high school cafeteria staff for taking care of us. We were able to explain our situation to the students and fill them in on the schedule this week. Once lunch was provided we bussed 3/4 of our students to their “school house” for the rest of the week. Each off campus site will have a police stationed full time during the duration we are there. The electric company is making progress on our situation and we will update as we learn more. Great day at WMS and looking forward to the days ahead!

Congratulations to Kendall Watkins (Cordova), Josh Smith (Dora), and Chris Stillwell (Dora) for passing your state boards and becoming Certified IBEW Electrical Journeymen, and thanks to Instructor Mark Palmer for getting them there! They will be making around $30 an hour with full benefits. This required 8000 hours under a master electrician or an electrical engineer, 1000 hours of post-secondary training at the IBEW Apprenticeship School, and 54 credit hours recognized by UA and AL community colleges (ALL AT NO COST!!) One of his students made 69,500 last year as only an apprentice. Mark Palmer has placed 15-20 students there in the last 6 years (including Hispanic, Black, and female students). One of the the IBEW instructors told me that if Mark recommended someone, he didn’t have to ask questions. The electrical technology program at the WCCT is the reigning Construction Wiring Champion in the state of AL. We are so proud of you all and thank you for paving the way for our other students to have this amazing opportunity. IBEW L.U 103 WCCT Mark Palmer",5.0,"Shawna McCullar

This brings our total FIRST CLASS PRE-K classrooms in the Walker County School System to 14. The following schools received the additional sites: Cordova, Curry, Oakman, and Valley.

This is a competitive process with only 55 units awarded statewide, and 4 of those were awarded to our system. Thank you to Senator Greg Reed and Representatives Connie Rowe and Tim Wadsworth for your efforts and support. We will be pursuing additional units this summer.",2020-05-19 23:23:41,,

Please note given the Governor’s recent “Stay at Home” order it is now necessary for us to adjust our original plan for packet pickups at our respective schools for those lacking Online access and/or appropriate devices.

Packets will now include assignments for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year instead of week-to-week assignments. Principals will provide more specific information concerning his/her respective school soon. Packets will be available for pick-up at your school on Thursday, April 9th. Nurses will also be present at your respective schools on this day from 8 a.m. until 12 noon for medication pick-up for those who have medication still at school as a result of our required closure.

I understand concerns, probably more than anyone when it comes to student safety, considering I am responsible for more than 7,000 students in the Walker County School System. This number includes my own two children. Today’s event was a generic threat, and NOT specific to any one location. Based on the information we had we took the necessary measures outlined in our safety plan. This event called for SECURE PERIMETER and HEIGHTENED AWARENESS.

It is not our practice to do a “callout” to parents, or post on social media, during these type of events. This creates chaos and confusion and most often will interfere with our most important task, which is protecting our children. Please know we always communicate with you at the appropriate time when these events occur. Each school has a safety plan that is well thought out, communicated among staff, and practiced. We work directly with law enforcement and community agencies when these events arise.

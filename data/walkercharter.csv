The Rubber Egg
1. Place an egg into a tall drinking glass.
2. Pour vinegar into the glass until it is completely covered.
3. Put the glass to the side so nobody drinks it or spills it.
4. Let the egg soak overnight. Make some observations! You should notice a lot of foam and bubbles. When it seems to have slowed, move on to the next step.
5. Rinse the vinegar and foam out with water and then cover the egg again with vinegar.
6. Wait for 6 days. At the end of this time, rinse off the egg and pick it up.

You should notice it feels slightly different than when you started… most noticeably it is missing the shell and has a weird rubbery feel to it. Shake it. Gently squeeze it.

Test out your new creation in the sink by dropping it from a few inches and then some more.

As we soon expect winter snow, we wanted to remind you of a few rules that will help keep our students safe during arrival and dismissal.

• Parents should stay in their cars at dismissal. When all cars stop, students will be excused to enter cars.
• Green window cards (5th-8th students plus siblings) can enter the lot at 3:15 pm. Early cars may be asked to park and wait for students to be dismissed after 3:15 pm.
• Avoid using your cell phone when driving through parking lot so that you can stay very aware of moving children.
• Walker is a smoke free campus so please refrain from smoking in the parking lot.
• Be aware and in your own lane. Snow piles may close in on the lanes and make it a little tighter.

Thanks for helping us keep our parking lot safe for everyone.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1760178827452282&id=231673066969540,,0.0,"Parking Lot Reminders:

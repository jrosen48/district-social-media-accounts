Check out some of her cartoon characters (and Dwight) that she has drawn on the sidewalk outside Nether Providence Elementary School for local families to enjoy. The rain may have washed them away, but she will be back to draw some more. She was very happy to see that some children were also drawing their own designs there after she started!

Alicia is currently studying organizational development and leadership at Widener University and works full-time in the human resources department at PNC Bank. She loves art and enjoyed her art classes at WSSD, particularly one at Strath Haven HS with Mrs. Rodgers.

Thanks, Alicia! Beautiful work!",2020-07-23 12:08:47,,

It is really a treat to see so many excellent shows at SHHS and SHMS and watch our talented students perform. The set design, costumes, makeup, lights, ushers, music, and more is always first class. The students, directors, choreographers, and all of the staff work so hard to bring us these amazing shows. I am in awe of the students' talent.

I am glad we were able to see Chicago this year too, before everything changed. I saw my first performance of Les Mis at SHHS and it was truly life-changing. I am always hounding Mr. Shankweiler for the cast list as I am excited to see who got which parts - and I also go check the posted list at SHMS too.

As many of us stay at home and turn our attention to our yards, we are smart to consider that mulch can (if conditions right with heat and depth) self ignite. The most common cause of a mulch fire is a carelessly discarded cigarette. Don't smoke? Mulch clearly doesn't care, as it can set itself on fire anyway ;)

While we don't know the cause of the mulch fire at Strath Haven MS this morning, we do know that it took a Strath Haven High School graduate and a current Haven student, with shovels and pressurized water and before upgrading to a handline, to fully extinguish this fire at the Copples Lane entrance to the Middle School.

Before you dump that mulch, google a 'How To'.

Day 1, Monday, 3/23 - Superhero Day!

Our teachers and staff are missing their students A LOT. They are a pretty extraordinary and dedicated group, and we all can't wait to get back into school and our classrooms. During Halloween, and throughout the school year, they really show their spirit and sense of fun.

Dress as your favorite superhero today. It could be Wonder Woman or Batman. It could be your favorite teacher. It could be your parent who is a doctor or nurse who is at work today and who may be quarantined from your family during this time. It could be a figure from history or a character from a book or a sports icon. Whoever you want.

With the closure of all WSSD schools and the closure of the Community Art Center through March 30, we are sad to report that our biennial K-12 art exhibition The Art of WSSD is closed until further notice. The reception scheduled for March 22 is canceled.

The Art of WSSD was installed over the course of two days earlier this week by students in AP Art & Design. We typically have four days to install this show but only had two days to complete this daunting task due to circumstances beyond our control. Seniors in AP Art & Design worked incredibly hard to prepare, organize, and hang over 100 works of art created by students from every grade in the school district. Many thanks to the AP Art & Design class for making this exhibition possible. Their efforts make the art from our K-12 students shine brightly on the walls of the Duke Gallery at CAC.

In the 200 yard freestyle preliminaries on Wednesday, Sydney Bergstrom placed 13th with a time of 1:52.93 and Mia Yancey was 26th in 1:55.92.

Sydney advanced to the B finals that evening where she placed second in a time of 1:50.95 - which would have placed her 4th in the A final. Despite her fast time, she finished 10th overall.

On Thursday, Sydney finished third in the 500 yard freestyle preliminaries in a time of 4:56.75. She did not get a chance to swim the finals that evening as the competition was canceled before then - so her third place finish stood.

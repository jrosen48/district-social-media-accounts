It is sad to say it is over but it is also a great relief. It is our way of growing up and starting a life of our own, to become responsible adults. Life with my class of 2020 has been one to remember. Most of us have been together since the day we walked into Pre-School. My class is another family that I will not forget. We have so many memories together that will never be replaced. We’ve always stuck together. Always had each other’s backs even though school got hard sometimes. Drama, violence, and bullying, it’s all part of high school but this is the time that we leave all that behind. The time to move forward with our lives and focus on the future of being an adult. After high school I plan to attend Eastern Oregon University and major in Chemistry. I hope to see the rest of my class be successful and responsible adults. It’s time to move forward and let go of the past. Peace out 2020!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2914364888790586&id=1990252624535155,,0.0,"Senior Quinten Tillery

In honor of our senior students, all Wallowa County High Schools will be turning on their football lights as a symbol of hope and support for all Wallowa County students beginning on Monday 4/13/2020.

We want all of our students and especially our seniors to know how important they are to us and we care for each and every one of them.

The lights will come on every Monday through the end of the school year at 20:20 military time in honor of our seniors (8:20 pm) and will light up the stadium for one minute of each school day lost during this pandemic.",2020-04-09 14:43:57,,

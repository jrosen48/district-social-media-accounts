As an abundance of caution and based on Governor Baker’s press conference, we have decided to postpone the Middle School Basketball Showdown scheduled for this Thursday, March 12, 2020.

The information is fluid and ongoing. We are learning more by the day. Since this is an event that can easily be rescheduled to a time when more definitive information is available, we believe this is the best decision to make.

Prairie Fox Books is excited to announce our first kids’ writing and art contest!

From June 1st to August 1st, kids can send in stories, artwork, or comics, and we will choose 10 to comprise our first kids’ zine. Plus, one art piece will be chosen to be the cover!

This is open to kids in 1st through 8th grades. If you’re not chosen to be in this zine, don’t give up—we’ll do this again!

For our first zine, feel free to use anything for inspiration. We can’t wait to see what you create!",3.0,"Prairie Fox Books

To celebrate we have a virtually field day(s) and invite everyone to participate. The field day(s) will be held today (Tuesday) and tomorrow (Wednesday).

Students- make sure to keep track and email your score to Mrs. Culjan (bculjan@wesd185.org) by midnight on Wednesday. By doing so, you can be recognized on the school Facebook page for earning a virtual gold, silver, or bronze metal! Also, we would love to see pictures of you and your family completing the activities! You can email those to Mrs. Culjan as well.

The virtual field day is attached and you will find that each activity has an explanation and possible modifications. If you need to further modify the activity so that it will work in your environment that is completely fine.

Have Fun! You have earned it!

Favorite memory from my time at Waltham-
One of my favorite memories from Waltham are the ones made at games and practices. I enjoyed basketball practices with Lexa and Lia, and I enjoyed jamming out to music at the volleyball practices. The parent nights were also an amazing event to experience with our coaches, Bruce, Shannon, Amy, and Reece. But, I have made many other memories with the teachers and staff at Waltham, that I will hold on to for a lifetime.

What I will miss the most-
I will miss the teachers willingness to help us achieve our goals by teaching us, but also their ability to make things fun and interesting at the same time. I will also miss the inside jokes we have with the teachers and how everyone knows each other by name.

What I am looking forward to in highschool-

My favorite memory from Waltham was my overall 7th grade experience. Our field trip was a crazy but wonderful experience, it was a great year for sports, and class was always so much fun.
I'm going to miss the close bonds I have with all the teachers. Because we come from a smaller school, I've grown to become very close with everyone.
I'm looking forward to starting a new journey in high school and seeing where it leads me.

With many students and families at home and many of our elderly residents experiencing complete isolation we have created a questionnaire to learn more about our county’s rich history from those who have lived it. Please consider taking the time to reach out to an elderly family member or friend. This is a wonderful way to teach our youth about our local history as well as bring back nostalgic memories to those whom may be experiencing loneliness during this difficult time.

as most of you know I love having ( and going to) garage sales! While most of you dread or hate it - it's fun for me and I love meeting and talking to people. I will be having my annual sale again but this year all proceeds will be donated to my great niece
Ava Lukacsy. She has spent over 100 days of her 7 month life at Luries Children's Hospital with 2 heart surgeries already under her belt! Her 2nd one was Feb 27th and she has been seriously fighting everyday . IF YOU ARE SPRING CLEANING AND LOOKING TO GET RID OF STUFF LET ME KNOW AND I'LL GET IT PICKED UP FROM YOU .
Stay tuned for date and time of the biggest and best sale yet! In the meantime say a few prayers for our little Heart ❤️ WArrior - Baby Ava !

No school, no sports, no restaurants! Like many of you, our lives have changed in the blink of an eye. Not only are we out of toilet paper, practically all of our 170 shows in March and April have come off the books. If there's a silver lining it's that we have more time to work on our YouTube Channel. We will be highlighting many of our show animals and releasing new content starting tomorrow morning and several times each week. If your kids get bored, round them up in groups no larger than 10 and infect their minds with a little Nature In Your Face! Like, share, subscribe.

Thank you to a handful of volunteers who helped make our Scholastic Book Fair a HUGE success last week!

Also a BIG thank you goes out to our Waltham Families for all their purchases to help us not only reach, but to blow our $2,500 goal out of the water!! Our total fair sales were $4,297!! That’s amazing!! That’s almost double the fall fair!

With the goal met, and surpassed we decided to purchase a book for every student! So each and every student will be coming home with a new book!

With our library & birthday books stocked pretty well, we will also be giving teachers a budget to spend at Scholastic for their classrooms!

Thank for your support!!

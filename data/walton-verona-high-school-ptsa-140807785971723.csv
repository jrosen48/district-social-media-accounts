I am excited and proud to share this new Strategic Plan for the Walton-Verona Independent School District. This plan is the culmination of significant work and input from district employees, parents, and community members. This plan will help shape our decisions in direction and resource allocation. More importantly, this plan outlines the steps we will take over the next 5 years to continue our well-documented Tradition of Excellence. The overarching themes of this plan are to continue our Tradition of Excellence by increasing efficiency, improving communication and transparency, and to remain a ""district of choice"" in Northern Kentucky by continuing to be a great place to work and an even better place to educate children! I will be working diligently over the next 5 years with our Board of Education and district employees to implement the goals and objectives outlined in this plan in a manner that remains consistent and responsible to our students, employees, parents, and community.

It's a great time to be a Bearcat!

Dart Wars has become a popular game throughout the community. We have received a lot of complaints from frustrated citizens and we'd like to remind those who are playing of a few things:

- Have respect for other's property.

- Don't walk on or into someone's private property that you
do not have permission to be on or in.

- Don't use a stranger's vehicle as a part of the game.

- Don't be a disturbance, especially late at night.

- Lastly, don't climb on or conceal yourself in a building,
house or other structure.

There are laws on the books that can be enforced if need be. We want everyone to have fun, but it seems that some are taking it too far.

Please call us if there's a problem in your area. Remind anyone you know playing, to play responsibly.",0.0,"It‚Äôs that time of year. Have fun, but please be considerate of those in our community. Enjoy and Be Safe!üíô

Happy Friday families✨☀️

For the last challenge of the week, I challenge you to make some homemade ice-cream! I included a video of myself making it as well as the step by step directions🍨

Some helpful tips:
🍶You DO NOT need to use half and half. Milk works just fine.

🥶You can use ANY TYPE of salt. It's used to simply make the ice get colder.

🧊You can use a towel if you'd like to shake. I use it in the beginning to help ""warm the ice"" so it melts faster and then ultimately resort to shaking it without. Kinders may prefer the towel the entire time since the bag can get pretty cold!

👍🏽You can tell when the ice-cream is done by feeling the smaller bag. It should feel pretty solid.

🥣Prior to removing the ice-cream from the bag, wipe the ziploc part of your smaller bag to get any salt off (I forgot this step and some of the ice-cream was a little salty).

I hope you all enjoy this fun Friday treat!",0.0,"This is a fun project from Miss Vetter’s Classroom. I scream, you scream, we all scream for ICE CREAM!!! Enjoy the fun!!🍦🍨

So here is our extra challenge to you for today...if we can get more than 75 students to do the math challenge today, then Mr. and Mrs. Holtzclaw will let their kids pie them at home and share the event with all of you on Friday (if you meet the goal). To meet this goal, you will need to encourage your friends to participate in today’s challenges.

We have now completed four weeks of school! This week has been the smoothest yet - with very few COVID-19 cases and/or exposure. Most of the cases that we have experienced during the first month have been community acquired, or occurred in non-school settings. For example, a parent testing positive may cause his or her child to miss school due to exposure, or a teacher’s spouse testing positive may cause a teacher to miss work due to exposure.

Congratulations to our very own Superintendent A. Russell Hughes on being recognized by the National School Public Relations Association as a 2020 “Superintendents to Watch” Honoree!

Earlier today, 24 superintendents from across the nation were recognized for this honor. Joining superintendents from California to New Jersey, Mr. Hughes represents Florida.

To be selected for this honor, superintendents must “demonstrate dynamic, fast-paced leadership with strong communication at its core.”

Mr. Hughes is grateful for another opportunity to represent the greatest school district, not just in the state, but in the nation.

Choosing a college and career path is not to be taken lightly. In the efforts to have our students begin thinking about college and careers, each 5th grade class was assigned a college to represent. Students conducted research on the universities to determine location, majors offered, requirements to attend, yearly cost, mascot, history of the college, and any major awards the school has received. Each student was also to consider a major offered at the assigned school that may interest him or her. Many of our students already have career goals in mind, and informing themselves of college requirements is allowing them to begin planning their individual paths of education.

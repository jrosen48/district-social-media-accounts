County closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic; remaining snow/emergency days, state aid requirements, and each school district’s individual calendar helped determine “last day of school” dates for each district.

Because of these factors, there are slight differences from one district to another, and are subject to change pending further guidance from the Governor and/or the New York State Education Department.

The last day of school for the Walton Central School District for 2019-20 is June 17.

This is a student-led initiative that started last year.

The program is a possible through a grant received from New York State FFA. Walton was one of 91 schools that received this grant, which is about $2,500. The money is used for this program, as well as Ag Day later this spring.

Students write, plan, and teach a different lesson to each grade level. Each has an agricultural theme. Townsend students look forward to these multi-generational and interactive lessons. This program will continue through May and will lead up to Ag Day, where all elementary school students will get the chance to interact with animals, machinery, and other aspects of agriculture.

This is a student-led initiative that started last year.

The program is a possible through a grant received from New York State FFA. Walton was one of 91 schools that received this grant, which is about $2,500. The money is used for this program, as well as Ag Day later this spring.

Students write, plan, and teach a different lesson to each grade level. Each has an agricultural theme. Townsend students look forward to these multi-generational and interactive lessons. This program will continue through May and will lead up to Ag Day, where all elementary school students will get the chance to interact with animals, machinery, and other aspects of agriculture.

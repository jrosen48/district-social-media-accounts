On March 17, 2020, schools across Kansas closed for the safety of their students and communities because of the COVID-19 pandemic. School districts were given approximately one week to formulate plans to remote teach for the remainder of the school year. This is the story of how one rural school district in Kansas met those needs.

At Kansas State University, we were inspired by Wamego USD 320's service, adaptability and commitment. While they would be the first to admit it was not all perfect, we found their courage, strength and compassion remarkable, and we know there are many more stories like it throughout the state.

We'd also like to acknowledge the phenomenal leadership at the Kansas State Department of Education and several of the Kansas Teachers of the Year whose work created a model for remote teaching used by Wamego schools.

Please share this with anyone -- in education or not -- who'd appreciate this story.",10.0,"K-State College of Education

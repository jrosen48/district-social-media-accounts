A big thanks to Nappanee Noon Kiwanis. The NWHS Yearbook Staff had originally scheduled our annual Nelson's Fundraiser to raise money to send students to a summer workshop. With the Covid-19 situation, I am unable to gather students for any purpose. Last week Donna J Persing contacted me to let me know that the Nappanee Noon Kiwanis would be sponsoring this event and running it as a fundraiser for the yearbook staff.

""I had a chance to witness sportsmanship at the NW vs. WHS volleyball match on 10-10-2019.

It was Senior night at Wawasee and after the 6 Sr. Athletes were honored and announced, for several more minutes the celebration was extended as the Sr players were greeted by teammates and parents. on the Wawasee sideline.

The Northwood players waited until the Sr Celebration was complete before starting any warm-up and by so doing showed respect. I noticed this was initiated by NW players and the team waited until the celebration was complete.

Probably un-noticed to many in attendance, but a little thing displayed by a group of NW student athletes to wait until the Sr. festivities were complete.

Nicely Done Northwood Volleyball players, program and students.""

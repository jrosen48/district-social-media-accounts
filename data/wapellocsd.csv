This decision has been incredibly difficult for the committee, but we know it is the right one. The health and safety of our fans, volunteers, contestants, first responders, healthcare workers, and everyone in our community is the only thing that matters right now. The only responsible decision was to put their safety first.

Congratulations and best wishes to Max on his graduation from WHS with the class of 2020 #WeAreWapello #WapelloTribePride #classof2020",,,0.0,"Our second Senior Shoutout for today goes out to Max Hardin. Max is the son of Josh and Beth Hardin. For two years, Max played on the Indian football team. After graduation, Max plans to attend a trade school for electrical engineering. When we asked Max which staff member has had the greatest impact on him during his high shool tenure he said Mr. Bohlen (the boss man himself). This is because ""He was always there for me and was always there to tell me when I was being stupid."" Max's advice to underclassmen is ""Don’t get on top of the school, it’s not worth it."" (Seems like good advice!). Congratulations and best wishes to Max on his graduation from WHS with the class of 2020 #WeAreWapello #WapelloTribePride #classof2020",2020-05-15 19:00:07,,

Happy Friday, everyone! Remember to pick up your missing clothes, notebooks, clothes, pencils, clothes, etc...from the school buildings. It's a shame your closets are sitting half empty when your clothes are on a lost and found table.

There have been many rumors floating around about summer activities. Some say baseball and softball will start up. Some say the seasons are a lost cause. Governor Reynolds has said that she will issue guidance on summer activities by June 1. I'm confident we'll hear something before June 1. But, until the governor makes an announcement, everything is just a rumor.

With certain parts of Iowa's economy opening up, the guidance from public health remains largely the same.

Wash your hands.
Cover your cough.
Wash your hands.
If you are in a high risk group, stay home.
Wash your hands.
If you are out and about, practice social distancing of at least 6 feet.
Wash your hands.

Enjoy the weekend, everyone. I think it's going to get chilly.

I will be sending out the secondary building's plan for students picking up their belongings. It will be in a separate message due to length.

And now, today's health guidelines shall be presented to you in the form of poetry. Specifically, that very popular poetic form...the limerick. Feel free to read out loud to get the full effect.

When you're washing your hands on this day
Please remember at home you should stay.
Because when the sun glows
And the cool breezes blow,
It's so hard to keep COVID at bay.

*****Governor Reynolds surprised us all today when she did not make any announcements regarding school closings. She has assured everyone that schools would have at least two weeks notice before any new announcements take effect. That means tomorrow is the deadline. Stay tuned...

*****To add just a little bit of humor to life, I've included one of my favorite ""Dad jokes."" My children love it when I share these, so here you go.

Here are the 3 unwritten rules of life...

3.

Okay, at least I found it funny...

*****Students, remember to attend the various Zoom sessions your teachers have set up for you. Yes, they are optional, but it's important to maintain contact with your school life, even if you can't do it in person.

*****We won't even talk about the snow coming into the area tonight.

*****And lest you forget:

Wash your hands.
Cover your cough.
Wash your hands.
Stay at home. Yes, this means you. Even if you aren't sick. Stay at home.

****At her press conference today, Governor Reynolds announced that schools will remain closed until April 30th. This news should come as no surprise to anyone. She also made reference to schools not needing to make up the additional missed time, provided they participate in either the ""voluntary"" or ""required"" plan for continued distance learning. Wapello is participating in the ""voluntary"" plan, which means we will not need to make up additional missed days.

Governor Reynolds put some more restrictions in place for businesses today, but no change in the guidance given to schools. There are all sorts of rumors floating around right now. Currently, we are all planning on coming back to school on April 13.

As always, we will follow the guidance given to us by Governor Reynolds and the Iowa Department of Public Health. And the best way to keep us coming back to school on the 13th is to follow the guidance we have all been given:

Wash your hands.
Cover your cough.

Stay home if you are sick.

Practice social distancing.

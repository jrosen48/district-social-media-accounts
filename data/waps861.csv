There are going to be challenges. There is going to be uncertainty. Schoology is going to crash. The bus is going to be late. Your student will forget their mask.

But there are also going to be successes. There are going to be triumphs. There is going to be joy.

Here is what we are asking of our families this year: Share it all with us. Share your struggles. Share your joys. Share your worry. Share your happy.

We are also asking our families to help us by filling out several forms or surveys to complete our planning for the school year. The forms in the link below include:

*How to opt-in for distance learning
*How to opt-out of transportation
*A needs assessment survey (child care, technology, nutrition)
*How to request a particular group

We realize this is a lot to ask you to do, but we want to make sure our plans and protocols meed the needs of all learners in our district.

There are four groups, each taking a section of the guidance provided by the Minnesota Department of Education: Academics, Operations, Student and Family Support, and Educator Support.

We are adhering to MDH and CDC guidelines. Each group consists of less than 25 people. We have assigned entrances and exits, as well as assigned bathrooms.

We are asking lots of questions. And while we don’t have many answers, we are working toward them, and we are working toward them together.

We are not just educators. We are also parents. We are children. We are sisters and brothers. We are aunts and uncles. We are grandparents. We are grandchildren. We are your neighbors.

We want what is best for all of our students, all of our staff, and all of our community members.

We don’t know what that is just yet. But we are working on it.

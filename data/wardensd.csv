We appreciate our staff who accepted a number of different assignments and tasks as we transitioned to extended and then remote learning. We are planning for the beginning of the next school year in the fall and realize there are a number areas we will be working to improve.

We have prepared a survey we are asking parents, students, staff and community to respond to. For staff and community we have six questions to answer to help us plan for the fall. For parents and students we have an additional 11 questions concerning your experience with remote learning this spring.

The survey will be open until June 30. Please click this link to access the survey. https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=PlZWoY3-tEiySowT1jWwQ3euqc-Nig5Ipa_b2aGsHEFURVdJSjEwUks5WDgzMUVDR1BEWE85OUFNRC4u

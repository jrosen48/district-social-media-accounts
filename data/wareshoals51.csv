If you wish to purchase flowers, balloons, etc. for your child, the local florist can send a gift card to the school, notifying him or her to stop by the shop to pick up a special surprise. Gift cards can be distributed at school without disruption to the learning process and in a discreet way so as not to embarrass children who do not receive them.
Occasional deliveries to the school during the year are allowed, but we do not allow balloons or flowers in glass vases on the buses at any time. If you choose to send your child something of this type for his/her birthday, please provide a ride home that day if your child usually rides a bus.

It is with deep sadness that we learn of the passing of a true Anderson legend, Mr. James Robert ""Radio"" Kennedy.

Our thoughts and prayers with Radio's family and friends, current and former faculty, staff + students of T.L. Hanna, and dear caretaker and friend of many, many years - Coach Harold Jones. Radio's life and story has blessed and inspired communities across the nation. While the heart and soul of the T.L.

We are definitely a StL Cardinals house, but we joke he is the “Curse Breaker” for the Cubs; hence the name on his shield.

He has been a core teacher, was involved in Project Lead the Way, and has a proven record in motivating people.” Mr. Perogy´s advocacy for Project Lead the Way, a national effort that encourages student interest in studying engineering and science-related fields, is conducive to the school district's vision to advance its STEM program. Dr. Gibbs feels that Peregoy´s background in PLTW could be instrumental in finding the right person for that position. Mr. Peregoy is proactively setting goals and taking action, meeting with the administration team and the high school staff, when possible. Mr. Peregoy will officially begin serving as the Bourbon High School principal on July 1, 2020.",2020-04-20 06:22:59,,

Here is another option for us all for eBooks: https://www.myon.com/school/readathome
This is the Myon website by Renaissance, and it has lots of great testing books. The username for this site is readnow and the password is myon no matter what grade or classroom you are in. Please note that the A.R. level is not easy to find. Once you have chosen a book and clicked on it, you have to click on the blue rectangle with the lowercase ""i"" in it. Then, look in the right hand column. The first thing in that column is ""ATOS"" which means the same as A.R. level. So...the book I am showing you in the pictures is a level 3.0. Just remember, you have to look for ""ATOS"". That is a little different than we are used to, but we can do it! I know we can!

Good morning,

I had hoped to send this activity home with your student today, unfortunately that did not happen. I have created a band bingo practice activity for students to complete. This is meant to be a fun yet educational activity to complete while we are out of school. Your student was asked to bring their instrument home yesterday. If they did not bring it home, please call the school and see when you come pick the instrument up. Should you have any questions please email me at rutledges@warhawks.k12.mo.us.

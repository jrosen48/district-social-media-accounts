Dear WCS Community,

In a radio interview earlier today, Governor Gretchen Whitmer said that it is unlikely Michigan schools will reopen during the current school year due to the coronavirus pandemic.

In the coming days, it is likely this issue will be formalized by the state through an Executive Order from her, which most certainly will generate new questions about our future.

For the time being, we continue to stay the course and support our students and families with food and online enrichment activities for students. Information continues to be updated at WCSKIDS.NET, including next week's food distribution schedule.

Most important, it has become very clear to me and the WCS Crisis Response Team that we ALL need to follow the Governor's order to stay in place as this is the only way to slow down the spread of the coronavirus.

I will keep you posted next week as things develop and please stay in place and be healthy.

Sincerely,
Robert D. Livernois, Ph.D.

Dear WCS Community,

Today at 11:00am, Governor Gretchen Whitmer issued Executive Order No. 2020-21, which is a temporary requirement to suspend activities that are not necessary to sustain or protect life.

This new “stay-at-home"" order will NOT have a significant effect on our district because we have already closed our schools and programs. However, we will keep our food distribution sites OPEN for our families because they are considered an essential service.

As we move forward, WCSKIDS.NET remains the best place for information related to this situation, including food distribution, instructional resources, frequently asked questions, and other community services. Also, as I have mentioned previously, there are many questions that we simply cannot answer at this time because we are under strict, state control.

As always, I will keep you posted as things develop, and we will get through this together.

As June 19, 1865, marks the end of enslavement, September 29, 1865, marks the beginning of North Carolina freedmen collectively asserting their rights. The 1865 North Carolina Freedmen’s Convention is one of the first such conventions in the South. Held over the course of several days, the courage of these freedmen is remarkable in assembling just blocks from the state capitol and then presenting their resolution to the 1865 Constitutional Convention. A journalist who covered the Freedmen’s Convention, Sidney Andrews, describes this resolution as “one of the most remarkable documents that the time has brought forth.” Andrew further states: “This was their first political act; and I do not see how they could have presented their claims with more dignity, with a more just appreciation of the state of affairs, or in a manner which should appeal more forcibly either to the reason or the sentiment of those whom they address.”",,,0.0,"History Information:

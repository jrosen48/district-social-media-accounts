With the governor ordering all public schools to close for the remainder of the school year (which for our district is May 21st), and UCM cancelling all activities on campus through the end of May, this also means that we will not be holding our graduation ceremony on May 16th as scheduled.

It is our hope and intent to still have our traditional graduation ceremony. While many things are still uncertain, we have secured two dates, June 13 and July 25 as possible dates for us to celebrate graduation at UCM.

It is EXTREMELY important for everyone to realize that these dates are tentative and are for planning purposes only. The ability to gather in large groups such as graduation may be out of our control.

We are also contingency planning for other end of the year activities, such as prom, Project Graduation, etc. We will share information about these events as soon as possible.

Students and staff at both Ridge View Elementary and Sterling Elementary are proud to show their enthusiasm about the Green Dot program. Also pictured are Sterling students and staff around the newly installed Lending Library in front of the school. Finally, our Board of Education recognized some of our outstanding athletes last night. Pictured are our state qualifiers in swimming and the Cross Country team that placed 2nd in State.

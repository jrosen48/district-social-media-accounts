Washington HS FCA is hosting a water drive for the elementary. If you would like to donate cases of water, that would be awesome! Our FCA students will be giving water to kids at school in the mornings who are not able to bring a water bottle to school, or forgot to bring water to school during the day. Due to COVID-19, our school is discouraging using the water fountains. Students have PE, recess, and just need to be hydrated throughout the day. So, if you’d like to donate, we would much appreciate it! You can drop it off at the HS office if you would like to help!

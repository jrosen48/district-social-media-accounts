Individuals with autism may have difficulty generalizing skills from one setting to another. An individual who has learned turn-taking in the classroom setting with peers, may not be able to take turns in the home setting with siblings.

Today, our THURSDAY THANK YOU belongs to all Emergency Workers
Shelby Beam, Lincoln Elementary School, offers a tribute to a few of our hometown heroes: Joel Beam, Mike Wilson, Carl Wireman, Layne Sumner, and K-9 Buddy.

‚ÄúMy husband, Police Captain Joel Beam, Warsaw Fire Department Chief Mike Wilson, Flight Medic Carl Wireman and Police Chaplain Layne Sumner make up a unique team called CISM, Critical Incident Stress Management.

This group has received training in trauma so that they can help and counsel all of our first responders as they respond to repeated trauma and deal with their feelings and emotions after tragic events. These men sit in on the hardest incidents with those who have experienced them and help them process and recover from what they have seen. It is long and hard work, but they run toward it in order to help those who help us on a daily basis. This is in addition to the hard frontline jobs these men maintain on their own.‚Äù

Today is the first eLearning day! Teachers are working from home and that sometimes means that there is nobody around to take a photo of you...but if at first, you don‚Äôt succeed (with the selfie stick) try, try, and try again. Yep, we‚Äôre learning too:-)

Over the coming days, we‚Äôll share a glimpse into what life is like for our amazing teachers as they plan, create, assign, check for understanding, re-teach, assess, and grade. They are here for you!

Meet Kaylynn Lampen, Department Leader for English Learners at WCHS. She has a great sense of humor, is incredibly kind, and spent Christmas in Bolivia. She recently got engaged - congrats Kaylynn and Brad! Ms. Lampen is here to help, to guide, to encourage, and to support! Here we go Tigers!

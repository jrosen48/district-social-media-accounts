Please consider joining WCS 2020-2021. We need you! Here are three great reasons you should apply to be a sub through EDUStaff.org:

1) It is a way for you to still play an active role in the school setting since we cannot allow volunteers or visitors.

2) You can sub exclusively at WCHS; WACC; Gateway; Lakeview; Edgewood; Claypool; Eisenhower; Harrison; Jefferson; Leesburg; Lincoln; Madison; or Washington.

You might choose one day a week. You might choose a couple of days a month.

3) You can make a little money while supporting YOUR child’s school.

With appreciation,

WCS

Jean Beeson- Making Masks, Saving Lives

“I want the community to know I enjoy helping others in any way I can - from tech issues to medical needs,” Jean Beeson said. “I love this community. I’m so grateful to see everyone come together for the greater good.”

Jean has called Kosciusko County home for 48 years. She works for Warsaw Community Schools as Technology Specialist at Lakeview Middle School, as well as the Assistant Director for Warsaw High School Theater.

When United Way put out the call for volunteers to make masks, Jean was the first to volunteer. Now, Jean has a team of volunteer seamstresses she leads each week.

“With the onset of Covid-19, I saw an opportunity to do something,” Jean said. “This is a huge endeavor. United Way is counting on us to get the job done! I jumped at the chance to use my sewing skills and serve others. My hope is that each mask will protect a medical worker and their patients.”

Faith Doyle, Lakeview Middle School paraprofessional, writes of WCHS graduate, “My daughter, Sarah Doyle, works part time at Kosciusko Community Hospital as a nurse intern. She helps care for patients who come into the ER. She is also a nursing student at Ancilla College and can take her RN boards after May. She has accepted a nursing position at KCH in the ER. Her calm personality is a blessing to our community for the patients she continues to help care for. I am very proud of her work on the front lines.”

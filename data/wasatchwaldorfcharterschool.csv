Wasatch Waldorf Charter School
October 9, 2017 at 9:02 PM ·

As most of our community already knows, Wasatch Waldorf Charter School does not receive enough funding from the state to provide the full Waldorf experience that we are providing for our children. The Fundraising Committee of our Governing Board has put together a very brief survey to try and identify those in our community that may have connections to people and/or organizations that can contribute. This survey is NOT just about parents who can donate money; please click through to take the survey as there may be ways that you can help our school, that you haven't even thought of, and this survey will help identify that. Deadline for survey is Sunday, October 15.

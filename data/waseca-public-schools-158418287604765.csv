Good morning everyone on this crazy weather day!
The JH/SH PTO is hoping for your help.
At every trimester parent/teacher conference time, the PTO organizes an after school meal for all of the staff.
We are in need of a few things for tomorrow’s conference, so that we have enough food for everyone. (We are serving pulled pork sandwiches on a bun)
We are asking for 4 salads and 3 more desserts.
So if we can get 7 people to volunteer to each bring 1 of these things we will be set.
They will eat right after school so if you can deliver by 2:30 tomorrow that would be awesome.
We appreciate everyone’s help, and if you have any questions please feel free to contact me.
If you can help out please let us know so we have an idea of what is being provided.
Thank you very much!

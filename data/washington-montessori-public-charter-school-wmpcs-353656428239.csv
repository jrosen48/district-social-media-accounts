Welcome to the Washington Montessori Public Charter School page.

Here are just a few guidelines for using the page.

We are not attempting to duplicate the full FYI that is sent out by the school's office, nor are we going to include all activity information on this page. Please visit the school's website at http://www.wmpcs.org for all official information and full schedules.

We will be trying to send out reminders of important events and any last-minute changes to the school's activity schedule via this page. We are also hoping that parents can use this page to coordinate carpooling details or any other helpful topics they would like to discuss amongst themselves.

This is not a page to use to bring questions or concerns to the school's attention. If you have a question about the school, or have concerns about something, please contact the school directly. The teachers and the Head of School are more than happy to speak with you.

Also - please note - we currently have photo-posting capabilities turned off. This is to protect our children, as we do not want photos of our kids to be posted without parents' permission. If you have photos of the school or any events that you would like to share, send them to the main office.

This page is a work in progress,so please feel free to leave us some feedback on how you like it!",0.0,"Welcome to the WMPCS Facebook Page! Please read...

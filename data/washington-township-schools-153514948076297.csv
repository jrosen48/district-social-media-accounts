As we close this school year we are very thankful for the many community partnerships that support our mission. The Washington Township Lions Club is a PROUD partner of the Metropolitan School District of Washington Township. Committed to the development of the whole child, this spring marks the second consecutive year in which they have provided each of the 8 Elementary School Media Centers with Hoosier Book Award Winner Book Sets. These collections are made up of books for both primary and intermediate students and are comprised of books that have been selected as Hoosier Book Award Winners. Developing readers and the enthusiastic responses from the students and staff are what the Lions Club cite as the reasons they looks forward to continuing this project in the future.

It is National Teacher Appreciation week and we are appreciating our teachers more now than ever! This time of year, we help families acknowledge their admiration for MSDWT teachers and staff through our Thank-a-Teacher program. For every Thank-A-Teacher gift (minimum of $10) received, we send a note and customized notepad to the teacher(s) classroom.

HOWEVER, this year the classroom looks different, and we decided our notepads should too!

For Teacher Appreciation 2020 we will be offering this limited edition, Quarantine Thank-a-Teacher note pad. For every Thank-A-Teacher gift (minimum of $10) we receive during the week of teacher appreciation, May 4-10, we will send an email to the nominated teacher or staff member notifying them of your gift. We will also let them know that as soon as they return to their school building, there will be a limited edition notepad waiting for them!

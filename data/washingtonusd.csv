ü§© Proud Moment: This month's feature story in the Bulletin spotlights one of our very own art teachers from River City High School, Brendan Liston. Mr. Liston teaches beginning and advanced ceramics classes. When our district moved to distance learning in mid-March, he needed to be creative and flexible with his teaching to continue to deliver a hands-on arts curriculum that frequently requires specific tools and materials. Click on the link below to learn more about how he adapted his tiki project to suit his and his students' new circumstances. üëèüëèüëè

Congratulations, Brendan, and keep up the amazing work! We are very proud and grateful for all that you do! #RaiderRISE #Great2bWUSD Raider Parent Network West Sacramento Teachers Association

With shelter in place extended until the end of May you may be wondering, how will that work with an internship? In the case that some internships are no longer available because of social distancing protocol we are prepared to offer a virtual program. This interactive online program will give students the opportunity to engage with leaders in their field, explore different career options, and engage with their peers on a community based civic engagement project.

Students who complete the virtual internship will be paid a $1500 stipend. To qualify students must be 16 years old by the start of the internship and completed two CTE classes in the same pathway.

Did you know that internship experience increases the number of job offers you receive after graduation? 63% of students who had a paid internship were offered at least one job after graduation, versus only 35% of students without internship experience.

Over the summer, Home Run students have the opportunity to be mentored in a field of their choice, learn more about their career interests, learn financial literacy skills and get paid!

Please keep in mind that due to the impacts of COVID-19, the internship program may look different than in years past. Even with unexpected changes, we hope to provide meaningful opportunities to students in West Sacramento.

Looking for the light at the end of the tunnel? INTERN APPLICATION ARE OPEN! Though the impact of COVID-19 may alter this year‚Äôs programming- opportunities will still be available whether they are in person or virtual.

89% of our 2019 interns said that the Home Run internship made them feel more hopeful about their future. During programming interns earn digital badges, go through a professional development bootcamp, network with professionals, and learn important financial literacy skills. The valuable skills go beyond the classroom and help strengthen a student's self-esteem, confidence and relationship skills.

The Home Run wants to continue to provide these types of positive and meaningful opportunities for students- all while keeping the health and wellness of the community in the forefront of our minds.

Those interested in applying for the Home Run internships are encouraged to apply. Spots are limited!

We are NOW officially done with our fall semester of activities. Our annual District Tour serves as an opportunity to wrap up the semester by performing for all K-8s in the district. We entertained thousands of students over two mornings and we have all our principals and administrators to thank. This task takes a village! Thank you to all the high school teachers that allowed their students to participate as well as the K-8 teachers for taking a few minutes out of their lessons to let their students enjoy our music. Thank you to all the bus drivers that have safely transported us to each competition and school this semester. Lastly, thank you to all parents and supporters for helping make this work! If you are looking to help our cause, look no further than here. Look out for The River City Regiment.

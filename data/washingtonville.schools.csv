As luck would have it, the weather has not been cooperating with us this weekend. Tomorrow is the rescheduled date for the graduation parade. The forecast is calling for good weather early in the day with the threat of rain in the afternoon. We will be moving forward with Sunday’s event, but please keep in mind we may need to make adjustments during the graduation if bad weather moves in earlier than predicted.

The car parade will begin on Sunday at 10:00 am sharp, students should arrive along Ahern Blvd no later than 9:30 am.

Also, the stage will now also be set up on Monday from 8:00 am until 2:00 pm for those seniors interested in taking additional pictures.

We are very much looking forward to celebrating the class of 2020 and know that tomorrow is going to be a special day.

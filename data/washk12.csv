He works to have a personal relationship with them so they can succeed. Along with teaching fifth grade, Zalenski is a partner teacher in the Spanish Dual Immersion Program. A parent wrote, “my daughter used to hate math and considered it her worst subject…It was too hard. After Mr. Zaleski taught her and convinced her that ‘math always makes sense and has patterns’ she learned to understand how math works…Now she loves math and it is her favorite subject.”

With more than 33 years in the classroom, Mr Zalenski has impacted multiple generations of students. A colleague writes, “Not only has he taught the children of former students, he is now teaching the next generation of grandchildren of his former students. Over twenty of his former students have become teachers themselves, and two are now college professors due in part to Dan's influence.”

Fossil Ridge Intermediate has two students who placed in the top 20 of the state’s ""Do the Write Thing"" essay challenge:

Elissa Petrell and Henry Heaton!

This challenge is a national and state focus on ending youth violence. The students wrote essays describing how violence impacts lives and how it can be stopped, focusing on a strong, personal voice and empowering youth. Both students were recognized in a statewide recognition ceremony and will receive a certificate with Governor Herbert’s signature.

Congratulations, Henry and Elissa!

Two Fossil Ridge students placed 2nd and 3rd in the local ""Elks Lodge patriotic essay"" contest this year:

The topic was What does freedom of speech mean to me? and was judged on how well the students expressed feelings and ideas about the First Amendment.

Whoever did this, thank you!! There has been quite a few tears this morning coming in seeing this, mine included. This school closure is hard on everyone. It’s hard on families and it’s hard on the teachers and their families. We care about our students. We worry about them not getting their reading instruction. We worry about them not getting to build relationships with their friends. We miss them so much already. The school is so quiet and that is not ok. With that being said we understand and will do our part to help this situation. We will continue to make the best online situation we can.

DHHS way to go! With so much bad publicity in the news about DHHS I thought I would show you the good. Last Tuesday while most students were finding dates or trying on dresses for Homecoming, one special group entered the Severe Special Ed class room and asked the entire class to go to Homecoming with them.

As nice as that gesture is, these students didn’t have a clue just how profound their kindness was. As a mom with a daughter of special needs, long ago I was taught to mourn the dreams I had for my daughter, but also to create new ones that were achievable for her. There would be no homecoming, there would be no dresses, no close friends, no college, no first kisses.

Last night one of those moments I thought she would never experience became a reality. My daughter was so excited to dress up, have her nails and hair done and to be apart of something fun with other students. This happened because of some great students at DHHS.

Thank you to those who thought outside the box, put others who aren’t exactly like them first, and showed them real love.",12.0,"We are always impressed with the great kids we have here in WCSD. “A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees.” - Amelia Earhart

Amy will replace Kathy Peterson who will retire at the end of this contract year.

This is Amy's 24th year serving in the Washington County School District. She has worked in numerous schools as a teacher, Learning Coach, and Reading Recovery Teacher Leader. For the past five years, she has been the Principal of Red Mountain Elementary School. Amy treasures the many friendships she has around the district, and will deeply miss her Red Mountain family.

Amy attended university at BYU, SUU, and SDSU, completing her Master of Education degree, reading endorsements, and Elementary, Early Childhood, and Administrative Licenses. While she cherishes her many educational experiences, one of the highlights of her career was lobbying on Capitol Hill to promote early reading interventions. Just as her predecessor, Kathy Petersen has done, she will dedicate her time as Title I Director to helping at-risk students learn at high levels.

Here’s a great tool to help your child find success in education! When your child takes the SAGE test their scores can be entered into our new ACT Estimator. This can help predict how they will do later when they take the ACT test.

By taking the SAGE test, and continuing to take it each year, students can know what skills and concepts they need to focus on to be successful later on the ACT. In addition, because we do not use the SAGE test as part of a student’s grade, it allows the child to practice taking a high-stakes test, in a low-pressure environment. This is teaching your student important test-taking skills, ensuring knowledge of key standards and preparing them for the actual ACT test in the 11th grade.

Crimson View Elementary Learning Coach Tiffany Porter was recognized over the summer with the “Excellence in Teaching Agriculture” award. Not only was she recognized as the top Ag teacher in the State, she was also recognized at the National Agriculture in the Classroom conference in Kansas as one of the eight best Ag teachers in the Nation.
Tiffany was instrumental in implementing Crimson View’s greenhouse program, which includes an aquaponics system (including live fish) and a weather station. She has helped students design irrigation systems and determine the best plants to grow in the aquaponics system based upon the nutrients created by the fish. She received her award from Presidential appointee, Dr. Sonny Ramaswamy, Director of the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture. Congratulations Tiffany! Today is also National Teach Ag Day, so very fitting to celebrate her accomplishments today.
Here is a brief video about Tiffany’s achievements for this award.

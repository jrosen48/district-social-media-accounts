Check out our very talented WHS actors!!

""The Advanced Acting/Panther Player group is doing a show called 10 Ways to Survive Quarantine - a funny look at our current reality. This is available for a short time only, so please check it out before June 19.

""My Acting group did not get to visit the elementary schools this year with our original spring show, but that is there as well - it's called The Truth About the Truth or Get a Job, Bob. I do have this available on Google Drive as well if anyone from the elementary wants to share this with students - like the school assembly it might have been. This was our first attempt to film a Zoom play, so apologies for the technical difficulty moments!

""Both shows are available at the following link:

On Tuesday their next step to kindergarten was celebrated with a small drive through parade. Teachers cheered for them, handed out student portfolios of their work and gave them books donated by the General Federation of Women’s Club - Camas-Washougal.

Registration for kindergarten and any new student to Washougal is open online now!

Favorite WSD memory: “It is hard to pick one. Every day there is always a good memory to put in the bank. Getting a good morning from a person that has never talked to me before, a smile when you know someone doesn’t really want to smile, air hugs, being a ‘safe’ person in the eyes of the students and the big ‘NO's!’ when I told everybody that I had put in my papers for retirement.”

Retirement plans: “Taking one day at a time and enjoying what I have been given. Clean my house. Who wants to clean when you spend all day cleaning? It is well lived in.”",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10158604985214548&id=126535519547,,0.0,"Congratulations to our WSD Retirees!

Here is a tip from ESD112. Follow the link for more helpful advice.
LET OFF SOME STEAM AND BE CREATIVE
If the kids are having a hard time focusing, getting frustrated easily, or acting out, it may be time for a short break. Spend 15 minutes playing a game, pulling a few weeds in the garden or taking a quick walk around the block. When it’s time for lunch, get the kids involved in making their own simple meals and participating in cleanup afterward. It’s a great way for them to learn basic cooking skills and will keep them busy for up to an hour.

Here is a tip from ESD112. Follow the link for more helpful advice.
SET A SCHEDULE FOR WORK AND PLAY
Don’t expect to be able to replicate a traditional school day at home. Take some pressure off of the situation by remembering that a typical school day is comprised of more than just learning periods; it also includes things like recess and lunch time. Aim for a more realistic schedule that includes one to three solid hours of learning per day, and structure in playtime, rest and meal breaks.
ESD 112 Parent Tip: “I wrote and posted a schedule for the kids to follow every day, and it really helped reduce frustrations by setting up expectations for them. My second grader needs routine to function, so this was critical for him. He was also reassured seeing the planned breaks for video games or outside time that broke up his day.” —Melissa

Tips for making distance learning work for your family",0.0,"Every family is doing their best with figuring out distance learning. Here is a tip from ESD112. Follow the link for more helpful advice.
SET A SCHEDULE FOR WORK AND PLAY
Don’t expect to be able to replicate a traditional school day at home. Take some pressure off of the situation by remembering that a typical school day is comprised of more than just learning periods; it also includes things like recess and lunch time. Aim for a more realistic schedule that includes one to three solid hours of learning per day, and structure in playtime, rest and meal breaks.
ESD 112 Parent Tip: “I wrote and posted a schedule for the kids to follow every day, and it really helped reduce frustrations by setting up expectations for them. My second grader needs routine to function, so this was critical for him. He was also reassured seeing the planned breaks for video games or outside time that broke up his day.” —Melissa

Washingtonians: thank you for staying home. I’m proud of our efforts as a state.

But we have an obligation to ourselves and our loved ones to recognize the hard road ahead

We know this: We will not sacrifice the lives of Washingtonians by ending these measures too soon. #WeGotThisWA

The 8th grade students are in their final semester at Jemtegaard so now begins the transition to high school. One of the most important factors in determining graduation success is the strength and unity of the class.
On Thursday our work began with our Challenge Day. It was called 'I Am, We Are.' as we worked with students to learn more about each other. Students did a great job getting out of their comfort zone and meeting people outside of their regular friendship groups.

The day focused not only on team building but focusing on issues that impact teenagers. As we saw throughout the day our students share many of the same hopes, dreams and concerns. A great day for our future high school students. Thank you to James Layman from the Association of Washington Student Leaders for his work that day. A great day to be a Husky.

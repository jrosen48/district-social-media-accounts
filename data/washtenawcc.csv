Our friends at the United Association raised funds for the project during their annual Instructor Training Week on the WCC campus and worked with the Union Sportsmen's Alliance to pull together materials and labor from skilled labor unions in the area. We're very grateful for all of their support!

The ponds on campus aren't natural — they were created as retention ponds when parking lots were built — but have been strategically surrounded by native species of plants over the years to create a wetlands ecosystem. In 2016, the college opened the 1.3-mile WCC Nature Trail that encircles them.

2. TAKE CONTROL WHERE YOU CAN. In what feels like an out-of-control situation, it is important to take control over even the small things. This means setting a daily routine and sticking to it. Get up, get dressed, take a walk, breathe outside air, clean out a closet ... any constructive activity where you have control over the beginning, middle and end.

3. GO ON A MEDIA DIET. Limit your news and social media intake to a few minutes twice a day. Listening over and over to the same scary stories just makes us more anxious.

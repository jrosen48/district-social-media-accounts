We haven't forgotten you! In fact, we think about you each and every day! Continue to work hard to become LAKER GRADUATES! We will work hard to reschedule events you are losing your senior year.

We will have a graduation ceremony! That's a promise, it might not be on the exact date and it may look slightly different; but you will be recognized as a graduate of Minnewaska Area Schools!

In closing, I've ordered 100 of these signs for you to display in the month of May in preparation for your big day! Everyone here at MAS will continue to work hard to create opportunities for memories just as soon as possible!

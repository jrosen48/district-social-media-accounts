Water Valley School District Superintendent Jerry Williams has released a detailed plan for the 2020-21 school year that includes learning options, use of face masks, extensive daily sanitation measures, protocol for monitoring students and faculty members as they arrive at school each day and steps that will be taken if there is an outbreak at the school. Williams also reported that the district is developing an alternative plan in case students can’t return as planned.

“Please understand that during these uncertain times things can change daily,” Williams stressed. The plan is to follow the current school calendar posted on the district website. If the district has to adjust the calendar to meet certain regulations, the revised calendar will be published when approved by the school board.

You will be asked to answer one open-ended question with as many responses as you like and then move on to the next step which is 'Star.' In 'Star,' you will see your thoughts and the thoughts of others and assign stars to each thought (from 1-5) depending on how strongly you agree or disagree with the idea.

Thoughtexchange is completely confidential. You can rate as many thoughts as you would like before moving on to 'Discover,' where you can see all the thoughts sorted by the average star rating. Please come back often to rate new ideas through Tuesday, July 14. We will share the data in a timely manner. We appreciate your involvement and continued support.

In this second video, Music Director & Conductor, Leif Bjaland, and Principal Flutist, Kim DeLuccio Collins, take us on a visit to an aviary featuring Saint-Saëns’ “Volière (Aviary)” movement.

I reached out to Ken and this was his response:

The Pre-Order information is updated on the June menu.

It states that if the survey was completed, there is no need to pre-order. The household is set for the summer. Pre-order information includes my contact to reserve meals prior to June 20. Then to contact the central kitchens beginning June 22. It also states that ""One call does it all! No need to reorder.""

I hope this brings some clarity to meals and menus. You will find the June and July menus in the body of this email. Waterford meal pick up is from 11-12 on the days that meals can be picked up.

If you have any other questions, continue to reach out!

I wanted to let you know that we now have WIFI that can be accessed in our driveway at Waterford School. There was an issue in Walden and Waterford about the access and our IT Department worked hard to facilitate the upgrade so that we now have this much needed access.

I had a couple of reports last week that milk that was delivered or picked up contained some milk that was sour. The expiration date wasn't until tomorrow, if you had soured milk, please let me know so that we can notify our provider.

There is a CCSD Board meeting this Thursday. There is a link to the agenda with the information about how to access the meeting on Zoom included in this message. The meeting notice is also posted on the front entrance doors as well as the gym door.

The CCSU Calendar has also been published.

Have a great day and don't forget that tomorrow, Monday May 11th, meals will be delivered and can be picked up.

I wanted to let you know that we now have WIFI that can be accessed in our driveway at Waterford School. There was an issue in Walden and Waterford about the access and our IT Department worked hard to facilitate the upgrade so that we now have this much needed access.

I had a couple of reports last week that milk that was delivered or picked up contained some milk that was sour. The expiration date wasn't until tomorrow, if you had soured milk, please let me know so that we can notify our provider.

There is a CCSD Board meeting this Thursday. There is a link to the agenda with the information about how to access the meeting on Zoom included in this message. The meeting notice is also posted on the front entrance doors as well as the gym door.

The CCSU Calendar has also been published.

There are homework packets still at the school as they have not been picked up. If you are having trouble picking up the work for your child/ren, please contact Danielle Limoges (danielle.limoges@ccsuvt.net) to place your stop on the delivery route. Work is delivered every Thursday between 10-12 and you can pick up work on Thursday and Friday from 8 am-noon. The teachers need the work returned so that they can monitor progress or adjust what is being sent for work.

Please make sure that you have a container out each week for work, even if you have been told the classroom teacher will not send work that week. Our specials teachers, interventionists, and special educators are sending work as well and it may not be on the same day as the classroom teacher.

You can still sign up to have meals delivered or for pick up on Mondays. If you would like meals, please contact Danielle Limoges. Meals are delivered on Mondays between 10-12 (though we have pushed to around 12:30 with the additional families that have signed up).

If you are interested in buying a yearbook, this is the week to order it. You can send your order form and payment directly to the school, with the lunch crew Monday or the homework crew Thursday. An order form is in with the meals that will be delivered today Monday, April 20th.

The yearbook is not a fundraiser so there is no pressure to purchase one. We just want to make sure everyone who likes this form of a memento gets a chance to order. It's a little harder this year because we aren't at school. Students of every grade are in the yearbook a few different times.

You can write your order on any piece of paper. Just make sure it's clear you are purchasing a yearbook, how many and your child's name. Yearbooks are $22.

Thank you

I wanted to clarify our delivery days. On Mondays we will deliver meals for the week between 10-12 (pick up is between 8-12) and on Thursdays we will deliver new work and pick up completed work between 10-12.

For meals and work we ask that you have a container at the end of your driveway.

Work may be picked up or dropped off on Thursday and Friday between 8-12 only. The other days are spent copying and putting all of the work together in packets. You can only imagine how busy the copier is right now.

If you want to sign up for meals, please contact Danielle Limoges at danielle.limoges@ccsuvt.net. For work delivery or pick up, contact your child's classroom teacher.

Thank you for your continued support. Everyone appreciates all of the kind words and cards that we have received.

We will be transitioning to ""Continuation of Education"" plans over the next week, to carry us through the remainder of the school year.

I have been expecting an extension of the school closure order, and I am not surprised by this announcement. Teachers, staff and administrators will be working together on our continuity plans, and we will be sharing these plans with our families. Please give us a few days to work through this - for now, the plans that were implemented to carry us through until April 6th remain in effect.

Much more to come starting tomorrow and beyond. You can read the Governor's press release at the link below.

Previously, March 20th was scheduled to be an early release day to make up for a cancelled one at the beginning of February. Due to scheduling issues with presenters in the Supervisory Union, the NEW early release date is April 10th. This is the day before our April break. School will be dismissed on April 10th at 11:45 am. We will have a full day of school on March 20th.

March 10th is our last day of winter activities. Please make sure that your winter activity bill is paid before the 10th. Thank you to all of the chaperones that have volunteered this year.

Recently, Mark Tucker, CCSU Superintendent, sent out a letter about the Coronavirus. He reminded us that if your child is sick, keep them at home.

I will see everyone tomorrow morning! Enjoy the warmer weather!

- Be patient on estimated times. We anticipate Friday being closer to schedule now that our drivers know the route, but it could run behind (we will make sure we are not early).
- We have enough meals for anyone that has submitted the interest form up until this afternoon. We will open it back up tomorrow afternoon for Monday's deliveries. If you have submitted the form, we are assuming you will be getting meals daily. There is no need to complete the form multiple times.

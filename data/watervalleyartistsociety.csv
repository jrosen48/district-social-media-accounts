It is an honor and a privilege to share with you one of our Thesis Artist's Solo Exhibition's from our Graduate, Kelsey Humiston. Her exhibition includes works created solely from her thesis course studies. Please take time to enjoy her comprehensive and well thought out bodies of artwork as she confronts how we affect our world and how our world has been adapting to the changes that we cause using her art processes and content to lead the viewer through the journey. Kelsey's visual constructs connect well with her overall statement and year-long research. Kelsey has been an amazing student. Her willingness to take risks with her materials and through complex mixed media engagements has been inspiring. Kelsey has added a fearless complexity to the conversation concerning our plant and the issues of our modern world.

For my art student's final assignment of the year, they were to create a personal narrative to reveal a feeling based on their reflection or feeling concerning elements of a season, event, existential elements or time of day being studied, using Giuseppe Arcimboldo as our guide.

I gave my students the flexibility to choose what aspect they chose to study as long as they are able to visually connect it to their personal feeling or identity with relation to the subject matter they chose.

I asked my students to create 3 to 4 original “selfie” portraits using imagery to tell their personal story using the subject matter and assemblage of objects and filters to further form their personal narratives.

I hope you enjoy their final artistic discoveries.

For my art student's final assignment of the year, they were to create a personal narrative to reveal a feeling based on their reflection or feeling concerning elements of a season, event, existential elements or time of day being studied, using Giuseppe Arcimboldo as our guide.

I gave my students the flexibility to choose what aspect they chose to study as long as they are able to visually connect it to their personal feeling or identity with relation to the subject matter they chose.

I asked my students to create 3 to 4 original “selfie” portraits using imagery to tell their personal story using the subject matter and assemblage of objects and filters to further form their personal narratives.

Due to a unforeseen event, the Water Valley Artist Society of Water Valley High School will be unable to show at the upcoming Young Artists display exhibition at Fort Concho. My daughter needs to see a specialist in San Antonio and I would be unable to set up the show and possibly would be unable to take the show down. We will still be exhibiting at the Coop Gallery of the San Angelo Museum of Fine Arts May 4th through the 6th. Thank you so much for your encouragements.

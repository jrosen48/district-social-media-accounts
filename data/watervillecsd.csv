Creative people are able to look at the world in original ways. They are open to new experiences, and have an imaginative and independent thought process. They are able to generate lots of different ideas, and have the capacity to go after certain ideas they‚Äôve generated with energy and enthusiasm. Creativity is a process that takes courage. Anytime you‚Äôre putting your original ideas into the world, you risk being criticized or even ostracized.

Positive psychology breaks creativity into two components. First, he/she must produce original ideas or behaviors. Second, the original idea or behavior must make a positive contribution to that person‚Äôs life or others lives. There are big acts of creativity, exemplified by great artists and scientists. And, there are everyday acts of creativity, such as how people create solutions to deal with problems at work or at home.

According to Cindy Igoe, SJ-BH Rotary Member & Interact Advisor, kids run the clubs with a president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, community service, fundraising, PR, membership, mentoring, and international directors, and project leads. The kids arrange for speakers and choose what projects they will work on in the community and internationally. Rotary International requires Interact Clubs to do one community service project and one international project each year.

Interact involvement helps with community service on college applications and builds self-confidence and self-esteem. It’s also a great way for parents to be involved with their kid’s activities.

Attention: Healthcare Workers. We were contacted by a nurse friend asking Bryce Priebe if he could 3D Print something to take the mask off the nurses ears. Their ears were getting so sore they had been putting tissues behind to cushion their ears.
Anyway Bryce was happy to help and jumped into action. He is printing them as fast as he can, and we have ordered filament to keep all 4 printers going.

2020 KIA Art News
Exciting news from the Watervliet Art Department: Accepted entries were announced today for the Kalamazoo Institute of Arts High School Area Show. This prestigious juried competition draws over 300 entries from nine counties around Southwest Michigan.

Congratulations go out to Braidyn Buskirk and Carlos Gomez Cruz whose ceramic pieces were accepted into the show. In addition, Mercedes Tingue had two pieces accepted into the show. One is a colored pencil portrait of her dog Chloe, the other, a mixed media painting which focuses on climate change and the plight of koalas in Australia.

Unfortunately, because of the recent events regarding COVID-19, the artwork will not be dropped-off or installed in the gallery this year, nor will there be an opening reception. On the bright side, the Kalamazoo Institute of Arts will create a non-traditional, online exhibit of all the accepted artwork. They will also be announcing scholarship award winners virtually.

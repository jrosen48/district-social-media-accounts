“This remedy was urgently needed. I thank Gov. Stitt for taking this action to ensure certainty for the cafeteria workers, custodians, bus drivers, teachers’ assistants and so many others whose work is critical to our schools. This executive order helps bring a measure of comfort and stability to these valued workers and their families and ensures our focus remains on public health and instruction through distance learning during this unprecedented crisis.” - State Supt.

Starting tomorrow at 9am, we will share a daily workout video each weekday of the P.E. with Joe series! With schools closed and us all spending more time at home, it's more important than ever that we keep moving and stay healthy and positive. Exercise is an amazing tool to help us feel happier, energized, and optimistic. The workouts will be fun and suitable for all ages and even adults can get involved.

We love being able to surprise some special teachers with a little something from the Brody Gene Sims Memorial Benefit in memory of Brody! 👩🏻‍🏫

Today, Brody’s Grandma B (Janet Blankenship) and Aunt Ter Ter (LaTara Blankenship) visited Weatherford East Elementary and Watonga Elementary to deliver some special gifts to the 3rd grade teachers! 📚

Seeing that Brody is still leaving an impact on others is what makes all of this worth it! 💚

All NINE teachers in Weatherford and THREE teachers and ONE student teacher in Watonga received a “Third Grade Crew” shirt and a “In Loving Memory of Brody Gene Sims” bracelet! 🥰

Huge thank you to both schools for allowing us to come in as well as all of the teachers for allowing us to sneak a picture with them! 📸",0.0,"Brody Gene Sims Memorial Benefit

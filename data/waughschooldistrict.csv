Waugh will make a formal announcement regarding plans for school closure after we proceed with a consultation with the Department of Health Services and other Sonoma County school districts early next week. At this point a closure beyond Spring Break appears imminent so families should be finalizing their childcare plans.

Please also be aware that all Waugh Kids Care programs, including the Wallabies preschool program and our Spring Break childcare program, are closed starting on March 16 (Monday). Families with students enrolled in these programs were notified of the closure earlier today.

I will provide you with an update by Monday at 5:00pm. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.

SIncerely,

Waugh will make a formal announcement regarding plans for school closure after we proceed with a consultation with the Department of Health Services and other Sonoma County school districts early next week. At this point a closure beyond Spring Break appears imminent so families should be finalizing their childcare plans.

Please also be aware that all Waugh Kids Care programs, including the Wallabies preschool program and our Spring Break childcare program, are closed starting on March 16 (Monday). Families with students enrolled in these programs were notified of the closure earlier today.

I will provide you with an update by Monday at 5:00pm. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.

SIncerely,

Mike Gardner",2020-03-14 20:57:34,,

Every month our Wallabies Preschool has a great time with Mrs. Howe‚Äôs fourth grade class. Big buddies are the best!

Today Wee Wallabies and Wallabies enjoyed an informational dental health presentation from Dr. Ramos‚Äòs dental office. Stacy engaged preschoolers in interactive demonstrations of brushing, flossing and games involving healthy and unhealthy food choices.

We congratulate our program in earning the top ranking in QIRS (Quality Improvement and Rating Review)! Thank you teachers and staff!

Check out what a great time our Fun Run Top Earners had on their Limo Ride and Lunch with the Principals! A big shout out to Pure Luxury Transportation for donating the limos to us, also to our Principals who went ALL out as always, and to the kids who worked so hard to raise money for Fun Run and to be a part of this Waughsome experience! We hope this was a day they will never forget! üèÉüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüçîüçüüèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

We have a fantastic opportunity to express our appreciation to individuals impacted by the Kincade Fire. This Saturday (11/23), 3:00-8:30 a group of local businesses will be hosting a free dinner for fire survivors, first responders, and relief volunteers at the Santa Rosa Hyatt Regency.

We are proud that two of our Waughsome parents, Dominic Magnani and Jamie Lloyd, are deeply involved in the planning of this great event. The organizers are in need of drivers to deliver meals to every firehouse in Sonoma County on Saturday. We would love for Waugh parents to step into this important volunteer role, and to consider bringing along our students for the ride so they can also experience this important community event.

More information about the Giving Thanks Dinner is attached to this message. Please contact Dominic Magnani bayarea49er@gmail.com if you have any questions.

Seriously, wow!! We had THE.BEST.NIGHT! Our Back to School Pints for a Purpose Mixer was amazing because of YOU! Such a fun evening hanging out with fellow Waugh parents and community supporters, and meeting so many new ones!!

Many thanks to Lagunitas for being such generous hosts, our seriously amazing band Dirty Red Barn, Chunky‚Äôs Taqueria for a grubbin‚Äô dinner, and of course our awesome community who came out big time for this event!!

Last night The WISE Foundation was elated to give the district an additional $8,000, which was from our Paddle Raise at Visions & Vines. These funds will directly purchase 25 new Chromebooks for our students! We are so grateful for all your support in making Music, Art, Library and Technology Programs available to our students!

The month of October is designated as National Principal Recognition Month. It’s a time for us to deliberately recognize and honor the hard work and dedication of those who serve in that capacity. Waverly-Shell Rock is fortunate to have six principals serving seven buildings and over 2300 students. These six individuals— Micky Bahlmann, Donita Dettmer, David Fox, Jeremy Langner, Christi Lines, and Brady Weber—are truly dedicated to their staffs and students.

The key to student success is having a great school. And great schools don’t happen by accident. It takes a caring, dedicated staff, led by someone who understands what it takes to make it great. Principals work countless hours in support of our students and our staff, yet they are often the least recognized. We have great appreciation for the work that our principals do, and they deserve recognition for their efforts. They are truly a key component to the success of our district and, more importantly, our students.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1981348245257028&id=395071843884684,,0.0,"Recognition of our Building Principals

An important aspect of the project is an interactive display that tells the stories of people involved in trafficking, including the victims/survivors, counseling specialists, law enforcement officers, prosecutors and even the traffickers. The display will be available today at W-SR High School from 8:15 am to 3:30 pm.

You will have your eyes opened and be challenged by what you see. A representative from Friends of the Family will be there to answer any question you have about their efforts to combat trafficking in Iowa and offer new hope to survivors.

Distance learning will continue for all Waxahachie ISD students until Thursday, May 28. While this school year will not end the way any of us hoped it would, we are confident in our teachers’ abilities to end the year on a high note in their virtual classrooms.

We know that some students still have personal effects on campuses. We are developing a plan to allow for the retrieval of these items, while continuing to observe social distancing protocols.

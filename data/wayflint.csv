Starting 5/28/19, WAY Academy of Flint will be starting a referral incentive program, which will continue while supplies last.

This program is set up to reward current families for referring new families to sign-up for WAY Academy of Flint.

For each student that a family refers and fills out an enrollment application, the family will receive a $5 gift certificate for the Flint Farmer's Market. If the referral is accepted and enrolled into the WAY program, then the family will receive and additional $10 gift certificate to the Flint Farmer's Market. So potentially, a family could get up to $15 of gift certicates for each referral, if they fill out an application and are accepted.

The key is make sure our main office knows about the referral so we can make sure you are rewarded.

Again, this referral program will run until gift certificates run out so act fast...and thank you in advance for your support.",,,0.0,"WAY Academy of Flint - Referral Program

WAY Academy of Flint - Blended Learning Model

Blended learning is providing students a new education opportunity. Today's educational technology allows students the ability to learn anywhere, which is what makes the blended learning model possible. Is blended learning for everyone? No. There are many ways to learn and there is no one-size fits all model.

What does it take to be successful in a blended learning model?

You need...Self-Motivation, Self-Discipline, to be a goal setter, the ability to be proactive with your learning, willing to collaborate with others, curiosity and desire, a good support sytem to keep you going to reach your goals, your top priority to be your education, and the ability to be an independent learner.

If you have many of these qualities, then blended learning just may be the opportunity that helps you accelerate your education and takes you to the next level.

It is May, we are heading into Memorial weekend. In the educational world, these are the signs that the school year is almost done, or is it?

At WAY Academy of Flint, when other schools are wrapping up their year, we keep going. We continue to provide our students an education that helps them to move closer to graduation. We provide an education that uses the research and makes sure we do not have long gaps in breaks to help our students retain the information they have learned. Do we get a Summer break? Yes, but it is shorter than a typical break so we can help our students be successful. Our model is based on a year around program, which provides the opportunity to accelerate their learning or to catch up, if they have fallen behind a little.

We provide an education that uses the research and makes sure we do not have long gaps in breaks to help our students retain the information they have learned. Do we get a Summer break? Yes, but it is shorter than a typical break so we can help our students be successful. Our model is based on a year around program, which provides the opportunity to accelerate their learning or to catch up, if they have fallen behind a little.

Education is the opportunity to discover...to learn something new...maybe even find somthing that no one has ever known before.

At WAY Academy of Flint, our curriculum is based on project-based learning, which allows young people to explore subjects in a way much different than traditional education. Here students are no longer students, they are called researchers. Why? Well, education isn't just information that is provided and/or passed on. Education is about exploring, applying, creating, discovering, and much, much more. At WAY Academy of Flint, we believe education doesn't have to be boring.

Blended learning is providing students a new education opportunity. Today's educational technology allows students the ability to learn anywhere, which is what makes the blended learning model possible. Is blended learning for everyone? No. There are many ways to learn and there is no one-size fits all model. What does it take to be successful in a blended learning model?

You need...Self-Motivation, Self-Discipline, to be a goal setter, the ability to be proactive with your learning, willing to collaborate with others, curiosity and desire, a good support sytem to keep you going to reach your goals, your top priority to be your education, and the ability to be an independent learner.

If you have many of these qualities, then blended learning just may be the opportunity that helps you accelerate your education and takes you to the next level.

Are you driven to accelerate your learning? In a traditional school model, students can only earn a limited amount of credit within a semester, trimester, or school year...so students can only move at the pace the school sets.

At WAY Academy of Flint, we remove the limitations. We don't have semesters or trimesters. We encourage students to just ""GO FOR IT."" This allows students to take control of how much credit they earn within a school year. Furthermore, since our program is a year long model, students have even more opportunity to continue to earn more credit.

Traditional learning vs Blended Learning

In a traditonal school model, students are mostly assigned their grade level according to their age. Typically, at the end of each school year, a student will be promoted to the next grade level, even if they didn't perform well. This is how you can have a student that is in the 12th grade, but still hasn't passed English 10 and 11.

Our blended learning model is based off the college model. A student's grade level is determined by the credit they have earned. We base everything on the merit system. If you work hard, you will be rewarded. This is how in our system a 16 year old may be a Senior. The student has pushed his/herself to master the content and move ahead.

At WAY, our blended model removes the barriers of the traditional model and pushes a student to ""Just go for it.""

In a traditional school model, students can only earn a limited amount of credit within a semester, trimester, or school year...so students can only move at the pace the school sets.

At WAY Academy of Flint, we remove the limitations. We don't have semesters or trimesters. We encourage students to just ""GO FOR IT."" This allows students to take control of how much credit they earn within a school year. Furthermore, since our program is a year long model, students have even more opportunity to continue to earn more credit.

So the only question left is, ""How bad do you want your diploma?""

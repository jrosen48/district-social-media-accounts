What you need to know about the operating millage renewal proposal:

* The non-homestead renewal only applies to rental properties, business properties and vacation homes - homeowner and agricultural property taxes will not be impacted.

* A four-year millage renewal of the current 18.387 mills will support day-to-day operations, such as instructional materials, teachers, support staff and school counselors.

* This is not a new tax but a continuation of the current rate. This millage was approved by voters in 2014 and will expire with the 2020 tax levy.

* Without the operating millage, the school district would experience an estimated $3.6 million loss in revenue each year and require significant cuts to programs and services for our students.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157149917141039&id=197925461038,,0.0,"Non-Homestead Millage Renewal

A bit about me… My husband, Kevin, and I are celebrating our 22nd anniversary this weekend. We have two sons, Calvin (17) and Andy (13). We have two dogs: a pug, “Sally Snorts” and a chihuahua, “Big Mama.” We’re in the process of selling our house in Mattawan and purchasing a home in Wayland. Our hope is to become Wayland residents by the end of August!

In May, I completed my doctorate in Educational Leadership from Michigan State University. I have a Master’s Degree in Educational Leadership and Special Education Administration. My Bachelor’s Degree is in Special Education - Emotional Impairments with endorsements in Elementary Education and Family Life Education.

What happens if the millage doesn’t pass?

The revenue generated from the tax on non-homestead property totals approximately $3.66 million annually. Failure to renew the non-homestead mills would change our state school aid foundation amount from the current $8,111 per student to a much lower $6,883 per student. The State will not replace the funding and the Wayland Union School District will be forced to reduce or eliminate instructional and support programs for our students to offset the reduction of revenue.

For anyone looking to use the lights at Kern Track here is some information about them. The lights can be turned on using the button by the light pole (pictured) in the parking lot just north of the track. The lights can come on as early as 5 a.m. and will turn off automatically at 10 p.m. When you push the button, two lights on each pole will come on for 1 hour and it is plenty of light to be able to exercise in the morning or at night. The second picture shows a unit at the west end of the track with a light on top. That light will begin flashing when 5 minutes are left on the timer so if you want to keep exercising you will have to go push the button again.",6.0,"Wayne Community Schools Foundation

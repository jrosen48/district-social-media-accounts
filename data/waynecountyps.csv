Car riders will need to show the attestation form signed by parents to our drop off staff EACH DAY. The form can stay with the parent in the car. Temperatures will be taken at the car before parents drive off.

Bus riders must have this form signed by parents EACH DAY and show it to the bus driver EACH DAY before boarding the bus. Temperatures will be taken when students arrive on campus.

The Wayne County Public Library takes an active role in helping Wayne County’s youth thrive during the summer through our annual Summer Reading Program. Beginning the week of June 22, we will be airing programs most weekdays for 7 weeks, ending these special programs on August 6. Our theme this year is “Imagine Your Story,” and we will hear many folktales, myths, legends, and old stories told in new and exciting ways.

When you register, you’ll receive a Summer Adventure Packet, which will include craft supplies and activities for your family to use to follow along with us at home and to have your own fun whenever you please. To ensure you receive your Summer Adventure Packet before our programs begin, register before June 5.

We are so thrilled to spend another summer with you, and are looking forward to imagining and writing the next part of our story together.

Thanks to you, our students have found a signal!

Wayne County #parkadnddlearn sites are ready for our students. Flyers will be distributed at Wayne County Public Schools feeding sites this week. Please help us share this information.

To remain in compliance with Governor Cooper’s Stay at Home Order, families and students taking advantage of “Park & Learn” opportunities must stay in their vehicle while parked and return home once they are completed. At no time, should any student or family member leave their vehicle to congregate with others who are also visiting the public wifi sites. The WiFi signal strength will vary from site to site. We encourage you to find a site that works best for your child and the mobile learning device they are using. UWWC and Wayne County Public Schools thanks all of the WiFi Sponsors who have made this ""Park & Learn"" initiative possible for students to take part in online remote learning!

waynecountyschools.org",0.0,"UPDATE: Spring Break will be held as scheduled, April 10 through April 17 to give all of our students, parents, and staff a needed break after being thrown into this new style of remote teaching and learning that has been put in place during the statewide school closure.

During Spring Break, we will not be distributing meals in order to give all of our hard working cafeteria workers a needed break too. We are working with the county and local agencies to ensure there are community meal programs in place, so that there is no gap in service for students over the break.

More information will be provided once details are finalized. As always, these and other updates are available on the district website, www.waynecountyschools.org.

-Washing hands with soap and water, often! When washing, use soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after you have been in a public place.

-Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.

-Always cough into your elbow or sleeve and avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or eyes.

-Avoid close contact with people who are sick. This is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.

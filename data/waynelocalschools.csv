Wayneville High School has established a new class for high school students that will teach them the life skills of finance and personal responsibility.

The class is taught by Ron James, Treasurer for Wayne Local Schools. Just sitting in on the class for a few minutes, it was obvious that Mr. James had the students captivated and engaged with the topic of the day.

Overall, the class will touch on real life topics such as credit score, the power of a paycheck, taxes, money management, investing, borrowing, financial services, and insurances. Each topic can be quite expansive and invaluable for our young adult students to learn.

We are very lucky that our knowledgeable treasurer is willing to volunteer his time to serve the students in such a way, and teach them the skills that will be necessary for a lifetime.

While adhering to social distancing guidelines and following school protocols, the seniors have done a great job with their parking spots.

Waynesville High School students are offered the opportunity to take the PSAT test on Wednesday, October 14, 2020 at 7:45 a.m. The cost of the test is $18.00. Please fill out the registration form by September 11.

As a junior in high school, scoring well on the PSAT test gives students a chance to enter the National Merit Scholarship program and gain access to college and career planning tools. Taking the test earlier than Junior year may provide a valuable learning experience. For more information on the PSAT, potential scholarship opportunities associated with the PSAT, and preparation materials, go to the website: collegereadiness.collegeboard.org.

**If Wayne Local School District goes remote and is unable to administer the PSAT on the original test date, the College Board has agreed to allow a winter administration of this test.

RE: ATHLETIC/GROUP PRACTICES AND WORKOUTS

In light of COVID-19, we want to assure you that the health and safety of our students and staff is a top priority. We are taking precautionary steps to provide a clean, safe and comfortable environment. The administrative staff has been working on procedures for athletes, students and staff to follow in accordance with the Warren County Health District.

As we are finalizing these new standards, athletic workouts will NOT start before Monday, June 8th, 2020 for incoming 9th through 12th grade students. We will be communicating final guidelines with head coaches as soon as they are available. In the near future, we will determine when the younger students may resume practice and workouts.

We will continue to monitor this situation closely and make decisions based on what is best for our students, staff, and district.

We are monitoring the weather very closely, but ultimately, it is beyond our control. We are trying to be as adaptable as possible so as to make the best out of an uncooperative Mother Nature.
There was some discussion regarding moving Senior Sunset to Wednesday in an effort to beat the weather, however, the forecasts are telling us otherwise. So, the high school is moving forward with the plan to hold Graduation Parade followed by Senior Sunset (weather-permitting) on Thursday, May 21st as previously scheduled. The rain date for both events is Friday, May 22nd. In the event that a Senior Sunset is not feasible due to weather, we are going to plan this for a more suitable night when weather is more cooperative.

Attached are the lists for parade line-up. Find your name, parking space number in the back parking lot, and your arrival time. If you are in Group 1, you should arrive at 5:00pm; If you are in Group 2, you should arrive at 5:25pm.

NOTE: these times are slightly different from the originally posted times.

Waynesville High School partners with area businesses in a way that allows experiential, hands-on learning as part of the high school program. Students are paired with these businesses in a way that allows hands-on learning in their field of interest, while still attending high school. Through this program, students can engage active/situational learning, which enhances the state expections of the standards subjects of math, science, language arts, and history. The end result is a diploma with job experience behind it, and increased employability for our graduates.

The OHSAA has not provided guidance at this time as to the extension or expiration of current physicals. Families should not worry about physical expiration dates at this time. We will post updates as they become available.

COVID-19 - CollegeBoard Updates & Plans for Advanced Placement

The College Board has determined that traditional, face-to-face Advanced Placement exam administrations will not take place this spring. There will be two different testing dates for each AP subject. The full exam schedule; specific, free-response question types that will be on each AP exam; and additional testing details will be available by April 3.

The College Board is developing secure, 45-minute online exams for each course. Each exam will focus on the content most schools should have been able to complete by early March.

Beginning Wednesday, March 25, students will have access to free, live AP review lessons delivered by AP teachers from across the country. These classes also will be available on demand so teachers and students can access them any time.

This is a situation that none of us have ever experienced, and we will all get through this together! Please be patient with us as we navigate bringing your child‚Äôs classroom into your home. I can not stress the importance of keeping your children learning. We need to work together to keep them engaged and focused in all avenues of learning. This gives you the opportunity to teach your child skills outside of the classroom such as cooking, gardening, etc. I will be using the Elementary page on the District‚Äôs website to post information. We are missing our students and thinking of all our families during this difficult time. Please stay healthy and safe.

We have had yet another successful drive with a full schedule consisting mostly of students, but also a few teacher (Ryan Hill and Clay Cleaver), our high school principal Dr. Sam Ison, and even a few parents for the event.

We have so many reasons to be proud of these students for giving selflessly in such a way.

The Student Council volunteers were amazing as they worked to organize the event, set up the donation space, keep the event running smoothly, and serve up the sloppy joes!

RESULTS:
49 people registered to give blood!
39 were successful! (36 was the goal)
108% percent of goal!
22 First Time Donors! WOW!
Over 117 lives will be positively impacted as a result of total donations!

Great job everyone!! Waynesville Proud!

We have had yet another successful drive with a full schedule consisting mostly of students, but also a few teacher (Ryan Hill and Clay Cleaver), our high school principal Dr. Sam Ison, and even a few parents for the event.

We have so many reasons to be proud of these students for giving selflessly in such a way.

The Student Council volunteers were amazing as they worked to organize the event, set up the donation space, keep the event running smoothly, and serve up the sloppy joes!

RESULTS:
49 people registered to give blood!
39 were successful! (36 was the goal)
108% percent of goal!
22 First Time Donors! WOW!
Over 117 lives will be positively impacted as a result of total donations!

Great job everyone!! Waynesville Proud!

Today on the construction site, the teams were pouring a new pad for the kitchen freezer. Because it is just a small area, and because of the nature of the uneven ground, it was necessary to use different pieces of equipment. This SkyJack with an Extend-a-Boom arm was used to transport loads of concrete over to the freezer pad of Area B.

Watch the video as the SkyJack extends the arm of the boom over the space and dumps the concrete mix. The team them begins smoothing the concrete mix out over the space.

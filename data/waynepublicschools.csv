Today, I am writing to you to provide an update about how we are evolving as a school system to make distance learning better for everyone. For the sake of brevity, my letter is organized around four important topics as follows: Click here for the complete letter:

March 25, 2020

Dear Parents, Guardians, and Caregivers,
I am writing to share my appreciation for the feedback we received from parents through our most recent Thoughtexchange, which closed yesterday. Over 1,000 parents participated in this exchange and over 600 unique thoughts were shared. The administration reviewed your thoughts and we shared the main themes with teachers and school administrators. The thoughts will be used as guidance as we work toward planning for the coming weeks in combination with other guidance we receive, feedback from the staff, consideration of best practices for delivering online instruction, and consideration of other issues like health and wellness.

This necessary modification to the school calendar will allow for each of our schools to plan for extended learning opportunities that will be made available to students through online access.

Westover's educational philosophy appealed to the teachers of George Washington Middle School to the extent that they planned and participated in a two-month long dialogue about this important book.

Members of the GWMS “Don’t Call it a Book Club” Book Club met early Friday mornings throughout February and March. By sharing personal experiences and their reactions to Educated, teachers shared ideas about what education is, and what it offers: the perspective to see one’s life through new eyes and the willingness to change it.

Only the bell signaling the start of the school day interrupted the rich discourse that could be overheard as students entered the building. The group is currently researching book titles for their next book chat which will resume in May.

This morning, we received a number of calls from parents regarding whether or not the district will have an early dismissal due to the anticipated bad weather. At this time, the weather forecast calls for some snow followed by rain. Based on this forecast, an early dismissal would mean we would be placing students and employees on the road when the weather conditions will probably be the most hazardous. At our regular dismissal time, the forecast calls for warmer temperatures and rain. Safety is our first priority and we will have a regular dismissal for today. At your discretion, if you choose to pick up your child before the regular close of the school day, we will accommodate your request through our normal sign-out procedures.

Regards,

Mark Toback, Ed.D.
Superintendent of Schools

This morning, we received a number of calls from parents regarding whether or not the district will have an early dismissal due to the anticipated bad weather. At this time, the weather forecast calls for some snow followed by rain. Based on this forecast, an early dismissal would mean we would be placing students and employees on the road when the weather conditions will probably be the most hazardous. At our regular dismissal time, the forecast calls for warmer temperatures and rain. Safety is our first priority and we will have a regular dismissal for today. At your discretion, if you choose to pick up your child before the regular close of the school day, we will accommodate your request through our normal sign-out procedures.

Regards,

Mark Toback, Ed.D.

Dear Parents, Guardians and Students: The end of January usually marks a time when we receive a flood of correspondence from parents regarding their desire to not have their children participate in the New Jersey Department of Education standardized testing program. With the 2015 transition to a computer-based testing program (PARCC) and the resulting skepticism over the use and sharing of student data, the widespread unpopularity of the Common Core State Standards and other state-mandated reforms, and a host of other problems too numerous to list, parents and students had many reasons to be concerned.

As of today there is no lead parent for basketball. Without a lead concession worker we will not be able to open by game time. Is there any parent or person that would be able to help with set up of concessions. There are 5 home games. Monday also only has 1 person signed up for concessions. We need to have a minimum of 2 per game. If no volunteers we will not be able to run concessions. Please offer a helping hand. Anyone who helps gets into game that day free.

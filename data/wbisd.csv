Attached please find information about the virtual option of learning. This document serves to lay out the broad expectations for students who will be participating in school through a remote setting as well as for all students on Fridays. They are also the expectations for all students should the district need to move a class, building or district to a virtual setting for their learning.

Should you have questions about these expectations and other questions specific to your students grade level, please feel free to contact the building principals.

Students who will be starting school in the virtual setting should plan to pick up their Chromebooks, should they need one, on either Friday or Monday. Building principals will communicate the times and details to this pick up prior to Friday. Should you have your own device to use, please contact the building secretary and let them know.

Students who will be attending face-to-face instruction will receive their Chromebook on the first day of school.

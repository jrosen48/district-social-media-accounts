Yesterday was a pretty big deal here at SES....It was World Kindness Day! In honor of this holiday we spent time spreading extra kindness throughout our school. Students complimented others, wrote positive notes to others, cleaned up areas around them and spent time at Grade Level Meetings learning how to change the world with kindness. Now our goal is to keep it going!!!

OK Parents, here we go!

If you have not already downloaded the PikMyKid App, please do so at this time. It will help us keep your child safer during dismissal times.

A PikMyKid Car Tag will be available for you at our Open House on Wednesday, August 21st . As you register in the App, use this number. You will be the Primary Parent for your child and in control of their dismissal. You can delegate alternate individuals, but they should have the App also as it will send a matching number to the phone for us to validate the correct person is picking up the proper child. If you are part of a car pool, each child’s number will be sent to the phone for validation. You will be asked for the necessary information (Child Name, Grade, Teacher, Dismissal Mode, & Car Tag Number) upon registration.

That’s All There Is To It!! We are on our way to a Safer School.

TIP #1 - Try Practicing with the App over the next couple days. We will notify you when we go live in approximately 5 days.",6.0,"Important information for parents of students a Surline Elementary!

Current Position:
2nd Grade Teacher at the Rose L. MacDonald School

- I graduated from Wheaton College in 2018 and am currently getting my Master's Degree at Bridgewater State University. Prior to this position I worked in the New Bedford Public School System and the Marshfield Public School System
- While at Wheaton College, one of my majors was Studio Art and I was a member of the women's Swimming and Diving Team. Swimming and art are still two of my greatest passions.
- West Bridgewater is such a wonderful small community. I have always wanted to teach in a town like this one.
- I come into work everyday happy and excited to see my students and co-workers. Everyone has been so welcoming and thoughtful. I could not imagine a better place to work!

West Bridgewater Sophomores have been participating in STEM Week-Project Lead the Way sponsored by the Mass STEM Hub, October 21-25. Students have been engaged in a real-world problem-solving adventure tackling the issue of managing and disposal of e-waste. Students worked towards understanding the scope of electronics usage in our daily lives, exploring electronic waste and ecotoxicology, and practicing systems thinking to consider how we can promote a more sustainable product life cycle.

Students were arranged in research teams with assigned roles in order to produce several different work products associated with e-waste. Each research team contained a project manager, recorder, presenter,and quality assurance person. Teams either produced a social media campaign to create awareness or organized an e-waste community disposal drive.

Top proposals will be chosen and submitted for review by STEM professionals and sustainability experts. Top proposals will also be made public on the web through the school website in the coming weeks.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2513941015366883&id=342235655870774,,0.0,"#WBwildcats ""Lead the Way"" during STEM week

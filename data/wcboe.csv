The day started out at 7am the team left the hotel, all with goals of their own hoping to fulfill them by the end of the day. The reward, another week of practice, another week of weight management, but ultimately a trip to the big show.

Bennett Wrestlers set out to complete this task and unfortunately 2 fell short. With their heads held high they supported their teammates the rest of the way.

For the first time since 2005 James M. Bennett will be sending 5 Wrestlers to the State Tournament!! I’m am so incredibly proud of these athletes. They fought so hard today and it paid off.

Today to close out our #blackhistorymonth series, we're featuring two amazing members of our community! First, meet local musician, composer, and music educator/choral director with Wicomico County Public Schools, Stephen P. Harvey. Read our interview with Stephen below 👇

SBY: You’re an accomplished musician and educator, is there an African American artist that has had a significant impact on you, your creative process and your teaching and directing?

Stephen: I couldn’t name it down to one artist. Since we don’t exist in a vacuum there’s a litany of black (is say that because not all are American) artists that have influenced my musical palette, my educational process, and goals in the profession of music. However, if I had to pick a list of African American artists, I would have to choose Billy Strayhorn, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Wayne Shorter, Dexter Gordon, Langston Hughes, Dudley Randall, and Kendrick Lamar.

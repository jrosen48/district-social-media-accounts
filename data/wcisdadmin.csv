Mrs. Steele and I miss you guys so much. It just doesn't feel right being at the school without all of you here. We hope that your remote learning is going well and want you to know that we are here to support you with whatever you may need. We miss the hugs, the hello's, the laughter, the noise and even the weird smells.

Thanks for joining us today on hat day. Can't wait to see your bed head tomorrow, pretty sure we have already seen some of yours. Don't forget to send me pictures.

We just wanted to brighten your day a little with a short video of two stars bound for American Idol. Hope you enjoy.

Join us in recognizing and showing gratitude toward each member of the Wolfe City Board of Trustees: Dwayne Humphries, De Henslee, Ola Owens, Jill Woodruff, Charollete Gardner, James Scott, and John Tisdale.

Our school board members are volunteers who shoulder critical responsibilities and often make difficult choices for our district, all without pay. Their goal is always focused on the future success of the children in our district. Celebrating School Board Recognition Month is one way to say thanks for all they do.

We appreciate all that these individuals do to help ensure that Wolfe City ISD provides the best-possible experience for our students.

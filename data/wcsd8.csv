Due to recent occurrences in our county, the WCSD8 administration has decided to move into the Yellow Phase of our Restart Plan. Please review the Restart Plan for more information.

If you have further questions, please contact your child’s school.

Beginning September 8th, we will no longer be checking student’s temperatures outdoors. If your child is riding the bus, they will still be taking temperatures upon entrance to the bus. Please make sure that your child’s temperature has been checked and they are moving toward their assigned seat before leaving the pickup location. Students who are dropped off by parents will have their temperature checked upon entrance to the school. If your child has a temperature of 100.4 Fahrenheit or higher, the school will contact you as soon as possible.

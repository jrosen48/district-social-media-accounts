I also know there is a considerable amount of frustration around the inconsistent information regarding cheer, band and ability for parents to attend athletic events.

The PIAA has shared a press release letting us know that they will be meeting tomorrow and they will have another press release tomorrow afternoon.

In an effort to be perfectly clear, at this time, the District has not cancelled any athletic activities. We have worked hard to make sure we are providing opportunities for our students to participate in the activities they love. We will have to see what PIAA shares tomorrow. Stay tuned.

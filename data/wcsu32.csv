We are so excited for our U-32 students. Books can now be checked out of the U-32 Library again - see an email from Meg in your mailbox for the process. THANK YOU to our Library Commons staff for making this work.

Ps. If you want to return a book, you can drop it off at U-32 or meet the food delivery buses and send it back with them.

The orderly dismissal of schools is essential to support both the State’s response to COVID-19 and the needs of children and families across Vermont. We must ensure children are safe, nourished, and still learning even as the traditional structure of school is disrupted. The work of educators will be essential in this effort.

In times of crisis, we all need to make sacrifices. But Vermonters, and all Americans, have risen to the challenges before - and this time will be no different.

The Central Office goal was 150 bananas in honor of the office mascot Bob the Minion (because Minions love bananas) and from the look of what I found in the office today, I will soon be heading out to our schools to take selfies with the kids.

I have had a few people ask me what is next for budgets and employee contracts. At this very moment, I can honestly say I do not know. I will say that I am reaching out to our boards (6 local boards) to learn if they would like to meet and discuss possible next steps for school budgets, specifically employee contracts, and other potential items affected by last night's action. As I know more I will let you know and keep you all up to speed.

What is keeping me focused is the kids and how can we help each and every child, every day. I know things are difficult when the path forward is not clear, but that is always what brings me back to our important work of serving the children of Washington Central.

Good afternoon,

First, I want to thank everyone for your flexibility this morning with the water main break. We found out at 7 am that we did not have water and by then our students were on buses and in cars on their way here. I appreciate everyone working out ways to get their kids taken care of on such short notice. We still do not have water service as I write this email.

Unfortunately, U-32 will be closed again tomorrow, Wednesday, January 30 due to the water main break in Montpelier. With the boil order in place we will not be able to provide food service or enough water for drinking for all students and staff and therefore will need to close an additional day. We do not foresee any additional issues once the boil order is lifted. Students should take this time to read a good book, clean up their rooms, and even help out around the house. I am sorry for the inconvenience and I look forward to everyone getting back to school and back into learning.

Have a good evening,

Hi Folks –

I know Monday was a busy afternoon for all of us. If you had a conflict and you were not able to attend the Student Learning Outcomes (SLO) Graduation Exemplar Gallery Walk and still would like to either look at what proficiency looks like for the SLO and /or give feedback to the teachers, you are in luck. You can view the exemplars on-line and give feedback through a survey form. If you go to the Zoo News section of the U-32 home page at www.u32.org/domain8, you can see the teacher and student work. This site will be up until Friday April 7th.

The Washington Central Supervisory Union community is shocked and saddened by the death of a teacher, colleague, and friend, Laure Angel, who passed away tragically Sunday, February 5th in a snowmobile accident. Laure currently was a member of the Porthos Middle School Team at U-32 Middle/High School as a Social Studies Teacher.

Laure joined WCSU in August 2011 and in addition to her work with students, Laure was a respected member of the Social Studies Curriculum Council and Negotiations Team. Her loss will be felt greatly.

Please know that the U-32 and Washington Central community have grief counselors in place from Washington County Mental Health and we are providing supports to our staff and students and will continue to do so. Please join me in keeping Laure’s family, near and abroad, as well as the entire U-32 and Washington Central Educational Community in your thoughts and prayers.

Please make sure that your children stay in either a warm house or car as they wait for the bus. If you are concerned that the bus might not wait, a child or parent can leave a backpack at the bus stop - this will be a signal to the driver that the students will be taking the bus to school.

WHAT WILL SCHOOL LOOK LIKE IN THE FALL

I want to encourage parents and families to be prepared for three types of school in August (In-person “normal school”; Remote Learning School; Hybrid School.) In the next three weeks school districts are supposed to be receiving guidance and direction from the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) and the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH). I believe schools are made for social connections not social distancing.

It is with a heavy heart that I share this message with our community about a recent tragic accident that resulted in the death of Brody Wilson, a sophomore at Williamsville High School. Brody grew up in our community and was the son of Steve and Carla Wilson. He was one of five siblings and a very outgoing young man. Brody was active in student life at WHS and participated in soccer, fine arts, and band. Brody was a hard worker who loved everyone. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Steve and Carla Wilson and their family.

Good Afternoon Williamsville & Sherman Communities!

As many of you are aware, the $40million dollar WCUSD#15 facility plan referendum was overwhelming approved at the March 17, 2020 Primary Election.

I wanted to take the time to THANK the Williamsville and Sherman Communities for coming together to support a facility plan that will provide opportunities for our students and solidify the district’s facilities for the future.

The Board of Education will continue to be good financial stewards to the taxpayers.

We are very fortunate to live in these two wonderful communities and raise our families.

Our communities demonstrated we value education and we value opportunities for all students.

Thank you Williamsville Subway!

As we all know, Illinois has closed schools temporarily in an attempt to control the spread of COVID 19. In addition, restaurants are only able to operate for drive thru, curbside pickup, and delivery.

We believe this is the right decision, but also understand that it may present challenges to families in our community. We're here to help.

If you are concerned about ensuring your children have lunch, please call us and order a kids meal free of charge. Kids meals consist of a mini sub (turkey, ham, roast beef, or veggie) a side item, and 20oz. fountain drink.

We sure have had an interesting last few days. I am so proud of everyone’s understanding and compassion for our school district.

We still have a very important and historic opportunity for your school district. Tomorrow is Election Day.

I want to remind all families there is an important ballot issue for your school district. We encourage all of our parents and families to learn about the referendum and to vote in the election tomorrow.

The referendum is a plan to improve all of our schools throughout the district. This proposal will maintain our district’s commitment to providing the type of up-to-date facilities our children need and our families expect.

The facility plan is a smart financial improvement plan that will not change the district’s overall tax rate. These facility improvements can be made with zero change in the property tax rate to support our district.

One Hundred Percent Need; Zero Percent Tax Rate Change; Benefits All Families

Tuesday, March 17, 2020, the registered voters and the residents of Williamsville and Sherman CUSD#15 will be asked to approve a proposal to provide funding for the WCUSD#15 Zero Tax Rate Change Facility Plan.
In schools that thrive in communities such as ours, we educate the students of each other’s neighbors, friends, and family members. Such close-knit relationships result in high expectations for our schools as well as the educational programming and services we provide, and justifiably so. The WCUSD#15 Zero Tax Rate Change Facility Plan is a way for the communities of Williamsville and Sherman to provide opportunities for our students, enhance, upgrade, and build district facilities so that our students may learn in a quality educational environment for many years to come.

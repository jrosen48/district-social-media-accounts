As we all know, Illinois has closed schools temporarily in an attempt to control the spread of COVID 19. In addition, restaurants are only able to operate for drive thru, curbside pickup, and delivery.

We believe this is the right decision, but also understand that it may present challenges to families in our community. We're here to help.

If you are concerned about ensuring your children have lunch, please call us and order a kids meal free of charge. Kids meals consist of a mini sub (turkey, ham, roast beef, or veggie) a side item, and 20oz. fountain drink.

PSA for all soon-to-be kindergarten mamas...
Practice eating “school lunch” with your kiddo. Make sure they can open everything you send with them. Talk about not eating off of the table in the lunchroom!!! Set a timer for 15 minutes and talk about how they may not finish eating and that’s ok. (This was HARD for little man.) Practice packing everything back up and talk about what is trash and what should come back home in their lunch box. Kindergarten lunch is a big adjustment and your child’s teacher will be super appreciative if you have prepared them for the experience!",0.0,"This would be so beneficial for everyone involved.

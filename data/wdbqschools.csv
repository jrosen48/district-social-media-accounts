We will not hold the powder puff game, the community pep assembly, the parade, or the homecoming dance this year. I know this news is disappointing to so many people, but the decision to cancel these activities is based solely on the safety of our students, staff, and communities. If things improve later in the year, we might be able to hold some of these activities in the spring of the school year.

HOW AWESOME IS THIS? Fairmeadows Elementary (WDMCS) fifth-grader Audrey H. always works hard to get 100% during the school's Spelling Challenge, which is an annual fundraiser for each grade level. Due to #COVID19, however, the challenge was canceled.

Audrey was inspired to still participate in the Spelling Challenge on her own as a way to challenge herself, and she collected pledges to donate to WDMCS Nutrition Services. After long study sessions, Audrey scored 100%! With the help of her family and friends, she raised $665 that will be used for additional freezer meals for our families amid the COVID-19 crisis.

THANK YOU, Audrey, for your determination, grace, and generous donation that will impact our district! #TigersTogether #weareWDMCS",2020-05-08 12:57:14,,

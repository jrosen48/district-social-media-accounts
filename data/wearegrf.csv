Pine Crest Elementary, Mary Miller Junior High, and Georgetown - Ridge Farm High School joined forces for a combined Two-Quarter Tuesday. The schools raised over $500 for GRHS graduate and previous Georgetown canine officer Michael Vice, who was in a serious accident a few weeks ago as he was responding to an accident call on I-74. He is now a county deputy. A woman, going 70 mph, ran into his vehicle. He has sustained a serious spinal cord injury and is at a spinal cord rehab facility in Chicago.

Remember Scott’s Law – move over and slow down when an emergency vehicle is on the side of the road.

Deputy Vice, your GRF family is behind you for a full and speedy recovery. ❤💙💜💛

Lomega High School is communicating with parents/guardians of students who will participate in the CCRA junior state testing program this school year.

Our school district plans to administer the ACT test in the spring on April 7 to all eligible juniors as part of the state contract with the Oklahoma State Department of Education and ACT.

Since most Oklahoma colleges and many colleges in surrounding states use the ACT score for basis of admission, our district feels this is an excellent opportunity for juniors to take this test with no cost to them or their families.

Should you have any questions/comments, please feel free to email me before November, 2019.

The elementary school celebrated raising $7,200 for a special girl! Since Mrs. Kramer was the teacher with the most in her can this week, she got to kiss a pig! She put on her red lipstick and gave it two big smooches. All of this fun was to help Jennifer Peneran and her family with medical expenses.

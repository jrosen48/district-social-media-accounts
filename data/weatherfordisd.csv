It's National Volunteer Week and our opportunity to send a big thank you our campus PTA officers and members! Our PTAs partner with school administrators and raise funds that are used to support our students and teachers. This year, five of our elementary PTAs sponsored the Dinosaur George traveling museum. By booking this exhibit as a group, our PTAs collectively saved over $6,000 and our students got to learn about dinosaurs in a fun and interactive setting. Here's a recap of the amazing Dinosaur George experience. #thankyoupta #nationalvolunteerweek",2020-08-25 12:13:27,https://video-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/94307189_525712728142251_7012519011145482240_n.mp4?_nc_cat=103&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=ySpSos2ot8kAX95IStX&_nc_ht=video-atl3-1.xx&oh=00e9f9552ac50b8494d0d8b41a0effff&oe=5F64CA5A,

I hope this message finds you and your family well.

Today, the Texas Education Agency announced that Texas schools may delay the start of the school year or limit in-person schooling for the first four weeks of 2020-2021. This information was announced this morning prior to any school district in Texas being given the opportunity to review details. As a result, our team will be studying the information released today and consulting with local officials to determine how this new information might affect Weatherford ISD.

In the meantime, Weatherford ISD is finalizing plans for the 2020-2021 school year. This information will be released to families and staff on Tuesday, July 21.

Please be patient with us as we plan for a safe start to the 2020-2021 school year while navigating the changes resulting from the COVID-19 virus. We will communicate with you as we learn new information or need to modify existing plans.

All the best,

The individuals selected perform their duties in an outstanding manner and make positive contributions to their campus or department.

The Maintenance Employee of the Year has been employed with district for 19 years. He started his career at WISD as a night custodian but his willingness to get the job done was quickly noticed and he was soon promoted. He then became interested in furthering his education in the plumbing trade‚Ä¶earned his apprentice plumber‚Äôs license‚Ä¶and is currently taking evening classes at Weatherford College. You may have seen him repairing outdoor sprinkler systems on our campuses, repairing roof leaks, or addressing dripping sinks. He is an essential part of the Maintenance Department and willing to go above and beyond what is asked of him.

A parent or guardian must be present to pick up the device and sign a waiver. Families that do not have internet access at home will be provided a mobile hot spot. These hot spots are not available today so these families will be notified when to come to the school and pick them up. Please make every attempt possible to come to the school in the designated time tomorrow between 9 am and 11 am. Teachers will be working with students all next week to make sure that every student is able to access the on-line platform needed for future instruction. Thank you for your cooperation.,2020-03-19 15:11:08,,

In order to provide flexible learning options for families, we will be shortening the school schedule for first quarter by 45 minutes each day. This will give teachers valuable time every day to provide online instruction to their students who may be learning from home. It will also give our custodial staff extra time to clean and sanitize our buildings.

Following our Safe Weber Framework, other adjustments to the schedule may be necessary if circumstances change. For more information on our reopening plans, please visit:

Competing in San Antonio, Texas among 12,000 students in over 70 categories, Koby Pack, a Weber High student brought home 1st Place and the title of National Champion in the Sales Presentation Category.

Congratulations to Koby Pack led by Mr. Alan Rawlins, business/marketing instructor and FBLA advisor.

Although 105 individuals competed at the national leadership conference in the Sales Presentation event, it is not easy to get there or to get into finals. Only two percent of FBLA students advance to the national level, so just getting there to compete is a great achievement. For students to make finals at Nationals they must be in the top 2 of their preliminary section out of 13-14 students.

Koby took first place at the State competition in March out of 28 individuals where he had to finish in the top two to advance to Nationals. Along with Koby, 12 other students from Weber High also attended Nationals in a variety of other events.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157459953123421&id=108286348420,,0.0,"Weber High School’s Koby Pack takes 1st place at FBLA National Leadership Conference

Recently, Weber School District had to make some changes in our recycling efforts, but that doesn't mean we've stopped recycling! Schools like Country View Elementary continue to promote a very robust, community-based recycling program.

Students from the sixth grade classes help recycle cardboard and paper products every day. These materials are placed in seven Green Fiber recycling bins located in front of the school that are also available for use by the community.

The school receives hundreds of dollars each year for these recycled goods and the money goes toward purchasing trees that are planted in honor of retired teachers, maintaining an outdoor learning center, and helping to fund Eagle Scout and other school projects.

Weber School District will continue to promote recycling as much as possible, and examples like these teach us that we can still make a difference in our world!

On Monday, August 20th, parents, students, school officials and members of the community celebrated the opening of a new playground at Hooper Elementary.

Previously, the school had no playground for the older grades but that all changed thanks to the efforts of one mother, Krishel Karras. Krishel started a fundraising effort in the community that raised almost $88,000 in just five months, part of which as a $50,000 R.A.M.P. grant. The Weber School Foundation and numerous local businesses also made generous contributions.

The project shows the power of people coming together to make a difference in our communities. A big thanks to everyone who made this possible!

Did you know almost 3,000 students in Weber School District suffer from some form of asthma? On high pressure days this can be very problematic as air quality deteriorates due to smog and particle pollution.

There needs to be a greater collective effort to better protect the environment and our children’s health! In partnership with the Weber Morgan Health Department, Weber School District is launching a “Turn Your Key, Be Idle Free” campaign at all of our schools.

The goal is to reduce vehicle idling and unhealthy emissions while parents and others are dropping off and picking up students. The problem is particularly worse in the afternoons when vehicles are sometimes left idling for up to 20-30 minutes. This idling creates an area known as a hot spot, exposing children to higher levels of concentrated pollution.

We’re asking everyone to please help eliminate excessive emissions at our schools. The rule of thumb should be no idling for more than two minutes.

Thank you for all you do to keep our students healthy and safe!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10156323820343421&id=108286348420,,0.0,"CLEAN AIR

Students had the opportunity to listen to various speakers from Kimberly Clark. The students now have a better idea of all the things that happens behind the scenes to make and produce diapers and other products made by Kimberly Clark. The information the speakers provided gave our students additional resources as they make decisions about their career choices.

One highlight from the event was when each speaker talked about what it took to work in their field, whether it was additional education or on-the-job training. It showed they never stop learning. Students also heard them talk about the passion they had for the job they were doing! This is something that all students need to hear and see in action. It was great to hear from people who love their careers or jobs, and make learning fun!

Parents and students can learn about career opportunities and participate in engaging hands-on activities.

The event will be held on November 6, 2017 from 4:00 - 7:30 PM at the Davis Conference Center.

We look forward to working with students and parents in this engaging, informative and educational setting. These experiences have tremendous power to shape the future for our students and initiate an interest in STEM education and careers.

We truly appreciate any help you can offer in getting this information to parents, students and anyone else you feel would be interested in this event.",2017-10-23 11:17:00,,

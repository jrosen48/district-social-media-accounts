Our administrative specialist in charge of payroll and benefits, Lora Thompson, passed away unexpectedly on Tuesday. Lora was a dedicated colleague with WBCCSC for over 20 years. Prior to starting in the admin office in 2015, Lora worked as a paraprofessional and in the front office at Thorntown Elementary. Her passing leaves huge void. Each day, Lora brought a pleasant disposition and willingness to help with any situation. There is no doubt that she loved the Western Boone and Thorntown communities. Above all, those who knew her well know that her family meant the world to her. Please keep all of them in your thoughts and prayers during this very difficult time. A link to her full obituary is provided in the comments.

Lora's passing is difficult for us to fully come to terms with because she was here in the office with us last Friday. However, Western Boone is a special community, and we will pull together to grieve the loss of one of our own and lift her family up in our thoughts and prayers.

For anyone who lives near any of our schools or drives past any of our schools on their morning after afternoon commutes, please read below for an important traffic advisory starting tomorrow morning at about 7:30 AM.

Webster Central School District schools will be opening tomorrow morning, Thursday, Sept 10. Due to new COVID guidelines and safety measures now in place, we expect more parents will be dropping their children off / picking their children up via private vehicle rather than relying on district school buses. This will probably result in significant traffic congestion at or nearby our schools buildings during AM drop off times and PM pick up times.

If your commute goes past one of our schools, please consider an alternate route to avoid likely delays in and around school zones.

We don't know what to expect, but we are hoping for minimal delays for commuters. There is, however, a real possibility of significant traffic congestion and delays.

We hope everyone has a great first day of school.",12.0,"Webster Police Department, New York

Just sent this calendar project to press today! This labor of love for the Webster PTSA (my second year of donating the design) involves working with a large collection of supplied student artwork, optimizing and organizing images, paying close attention to season and color scheme, while working each page as a puzzle to make the images fit. It's a wonderful piece for the community, and a welcome annual tradition. I always marvel at the talent of the students across the district!

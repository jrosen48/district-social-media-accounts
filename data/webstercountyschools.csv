If your teen has trouble remembering what he reads for history class, he may have trouble picking out what is most important in the text. Making a cause and effect chart can help. Have him list these questions down one side of the chart: What is the problem? What or who caused the problem? What solutions were tried? What was the result? Which solution worked? What happened? As he reads, he can fill in the answers.

Interpreting your teen's behavior is easier when you know how she thinks. Kids in their early to mid teens are often critical of people who don't share their opinions. Let your teen know that you respect her right to her opinions, and you expect her to respect yours. Teens also think that other people are judging their every move.

To help your teen practice for adulthood, allow her to take more responsibility for herself. At this age, she should have a say in most everything that affects her. Let her make mistakes (unless it's a matter of health or safety). Instead of trying to control her actions, put controls on your own. For example, say, ""I'll be able to let you watch a movie after you do your homework"" rather than ""Do that homework now.""

To help your child sharpen her spelling skills, ask her to write your grocery list. Name the items you need, and challenge her to sound the words out on her own before you help with spelling them. When you bring the groceries home, can she match the words on the list with the words on the items on the shelf? She'll learn to spell, and she'll feel competent every time you ask her to make a list you can take to the store.

Children learn creativity by watching others. And when kids learn that there are often many ways to solve a problem, they learn to think creatively and become better problem solvers. So let your child see you tackle problems in different ways. Regularly create new solutions for old problems. He'll learn that fresh thinking can turn up new (and maybe better) approaches.

Many great songs mention real places. When you sing a song like ""This Land is Your Land"" with your child, talk about the places in it. Look them up on a map. ""London Bridge is Falling Down"" is about a real bridge in London, England (one version of which is now in Arizona). Help your child find out more about it. The next time you take a long trip, pass time by singing as many ""geography"" songs as you can.

Telling bedtime stories is a great way to connect with your child and promote responsible, caring behavior. For an endless source of new story ideas, try making the characters' names rhyme with family members' names. Then you can tell stories from your lives that teach the lessons you want. A character could realize the effect her behavior has on others, or model sharing without fighting, for example.

Emmanuel Acho is a Nigerian-American NFL player who created videos it in response to those looking to him, asking how they can help in the current climate. “So many of y’all have reached out to me, and by y’all, I mean White people,” he says, before diving into why we must be fully educated to understand the pain and to stand with him and the others who are fighting for equality.
Since he started his series, his videos have gone viral and educated many.

At this point in time, WGSD is still planning to have summer programming for students, which will be online.

High school students (rising 9th through rising 12th grade) will take online classes in a virtual format. High school summer school courses will run from June 1 through July. Students who have already enrolled in a summer class will maintain enrollment in these virtual courses. Space is still available in some courses and interested students should reach out to their counselors regarding enrollment.
The district is exploring online options for summer school programming for rising first through eighth graders. More information will be shared when plans are solidified.
The district won't offer a Preschool or Adventure Club program.
All summer school programming is dependent on full state funding. Any possible cuts to funding may prompt the district to change what it offers.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3051390604882393&id=470778219610324,,0.0,"Summer School Update

Bill Sellers, retired principal at Clark and Steger schools

This is a message from Dave Sellers, his son:
I wanted to make you aware of the fact that my father, Bill Sellers, passed away last Thursday. Dad was the Principal at Clark and Steger back in the years of 1970 to somewhere around 1988. Based on this fact, as a part of Dad’s obituary, we will ask folks, in lieu of flowers to consider making a small donation to the Webster Groves School District Foundation and hope you all receive a few dollars to help kids in the Webster Groves School District.

Yours truly, from a 1982 WGHS Graduate,

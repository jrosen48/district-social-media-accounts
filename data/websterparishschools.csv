Today is the 19th anniversary of the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. There’s not a Lakeside student walking our halls that was alive on that day. Some of our teachers are even too young to remember the tragedy and the aftermath. The only positive thing to come from all the death and despair was a sense of unity and the rallying of one American people. Politics and division was put aside for a time and we focused on the things that unite us rather than divide us. Our shared humanity. Politicians no longer demonized one another and demagogues did not profit off of the fear and hate that so many of our citizens have for each other. We were not white Americans and black Americans. We were not Red States and Blue States. We were Americans. We were the United States.

The 2020 Census counts the population in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territories. A complete and accurate count is critical for all Louisiana communities, because the results of the 2020 Census will affect community funding, congressional representation, and more.

The 2020 Census count impacts the federal funds that communities receive each year for programs and services that are critical for schools, students, and younger children, such as:
-Special education, Head Start, after-school programs, and classroom technology.
-Food assistance, including free and reduced-price school lunches.
-Maternal and child health programs.

Your child should have received an invitation to their google classroom accounts. They have to log in and accept the invitation. Once that is done, they need to log in at the regularly schedule class time on Thursday. So if you have Mr. Cammack first block you need to log in at the beginning of first block.

Each class has a google meet link in the header under the class name. That is the link you click for the live class every morning. If your child misses a class live one day, there will be a recorded video of the lesson later that day posted as material under the class work tab.",,,

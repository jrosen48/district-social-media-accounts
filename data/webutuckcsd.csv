We want to take a moment to recognize Makenzsilea Watson for earning a place on the 3rd Quarter Merit Role for EBIS. Unfortunately, we inadvertently left her picture out of the initial video created for the 5th Grade Class for those who also earned Merit Role. So, we wanted to be sure Makenzsilea is also properly recognized for her efforts. According to her teachers, Makenzsilea is also off to a great 4th Quarter, working hard from home and is making some great progress on an upcoming essay!

We are so proud of you, Mackenzsilea, and are happy to see you doing great things during your 5th Grade year!! - Mr. Pascale and the 5th Grade Team of teachers.

PS - we will work to highlight the achievements of other grade levels for 3rd Quarter performances in the days ahead...stay tuned, stay healthy, stay happy, and blessings to all!!",2.0,"Eugene Brooks Intermediate School

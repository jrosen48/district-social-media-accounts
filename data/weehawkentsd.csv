TRS Parents,
The TRSPTA needs you! Three of the four current board members have children in 6th grade, so we can no longer serve on the board of TRSPTA.
If you or someone you know is interested in being on the board please let us know.

If no one volunteers by June 4, 2020, we will sadly be forced to formally end our relationship with the PTA and close our chapter.

Please spread the word & consider volunteering. Without the PTA, there would be no book fair, after-school enrichment, Fun Day, gardening, class trips, dances & socials, DARE reception, Teacher Appreciation, graduation, and many other things!

Adults like me tend to like my vertical lines to be vertical and my horizontal lines to be horizontal. You should take the opportunity to express yourself more freely. Tilt the camera this way and that and see what creative-looking photos will arise from it.

April 19 - Day 7
Lighting
Let’s learn a little bit about how to put different kinds of light to work. You can use a lamp, flashlight or different angles in the sunlight. You will need to be aware of where the light is coming from and how that will affect your image.
Front Lighting: This is when the light source is in front of the subject. Front lighting lights up a subject very well, but bright front lighting may cause long shadows behind the subject.
Side Lighting: Side lighting is light that comes from one side of the subject. This type of lighting is often used to add a moody look to a photo because it tends to cast shadows across the front of the subject. Think of it this way: If you take a photograph of a person with the sun to that person’s right side, you’ll often find that the left side of that person’s face is shadow because it isn’t in direct sunlight.
Pick one subject and try two different kinds of lighting. Submit both photos.

Close-Ups or Macro Photography
This is a genre of photography that involves extremely close-up shots of objects to make them take up most of the frame. Get really close to what you are going to be photographing today. If at first, your close-ups are blurry, you may be too close to the subject; stand back a bit and try using the zoom. Every lens has a minimum focusing distance. If the subject is closer than this distance, the camera cannot focus the lens. Some of the most popular subjects of macro photography include living organisms such as flowers and insects. However, inanimate objects can also be photographed in this style. Don’t limit yourself to these options, anything can be photographed like this! Make us guess what it is!

Rule of Thirds
An essential principle of good photography, the Rule of Thirds divides a photo into thirds vertically and/or horizontally and places important features at intersections or along the dividing lines. Place an imaginary grid on top of your image. The grid breaks the image down into 9 parts. The rule of thirds consists in positioning your main subject in one of the four intersections of your imaginary grid, immediately improving your photos by making your compositions more balanced and interesting.

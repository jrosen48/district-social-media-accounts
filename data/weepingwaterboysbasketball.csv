An interesting scenario happened at the end of the first half in the Nebraska - Penn State basketball game on Wednesday night. Terran Petteway, Nebraska's leading scorer and a projected 1st round NBA draft pick, was on the bench because he picked up two fouls. Depite his absence the Huskers increased the lead before the end of the half. When the horn blew, instead of hustling off to the locker room Petteway stayed and shook the hand of every player coming off the court. His excitment for his teammates success was genuine. Petteway, beyond being the Huskers best player is also the hardest working practice player. Leadership is many things, including but not limited to, performance, work ethic, and enthuasism for other team members success. I hope Nebraska fans appreciate what they have in Petteway . . . talent is not always accompanied by other leadership traits. He is a special person.",0.0,"Terry Pettit

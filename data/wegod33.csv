This individual is currently in a role with Aramark that does not typically come in direct contact with students or families.

Dear Currier Families,
It was wonderful to see so many of you today during the tech pick up. We are grateful to all of the families that showed up today. Your patience and kindness kept us going. Thank you all of you for remaining calm, as many of you waited a long time to get your child’s tech device. We were glad to see you and ask how your children are coping. We miss them all very much. Please stay safe, make sure to keep social distancing.

Estimadas familias de Currier,
Fue un places ver a muchas de Currier hoy al recoger los dispositivos. Estamos agradecidos con las familias que lograron venir hoy; su paciencia y amabilidad nos dio más energía para echarle más ganas. Agradecemos por permanecer con calma, sabemos que muchos de ustedes esperaron un tiempo Larco para recibir el dispositivo de sus hijos. Estuvimos contentos de verlos a ustedes y preguntarles sobre sus hijos. Les extrañamos un montón. Favor de mantenerse seguros, y guarden la distancia social.

Hello friends! Today is Spirit-Wear-Wednesday! Miss Desiree is wearing one of her favorite penguin shirts. Check out the cool science experiment you can try at home! Don't forget to post your pics here or on SeeSaw.

How you do it:
Use a funnel to add 1/3 cup baking soda to the inside of a balloon.
Fill a plastic bottle with approximately 1 cup vinegar.
Attach the balloon to the mouth of the plastic bottle, then lift the balloon upright so the baking soda falls and causes the reaction.

Good Morning!

Today I'd like to pose a challenge to all of my Currier students called the COLOR WHEEL CHALLENGE.

Your mission is to make a color wheel, at home, without any art supplies. Make sure you set up your wheel in the correct order (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple). This is a great way to practice keen observation and a fun way to use your creative brain. What objects can you find around your house to create this array of colors??

When you are done with your color wheel, take a picture of it and you can share it with me through ClassDojo messages, on your art Seesaw portfolio, or send it as a private message to the Currier Specials Facebook page.

Don't forget to put everything back where you found it once you are done :)

Have fun!

Currier School - Don't Worry, Be Happy

Currier Elementary School
March 23 at 9:58 AM ·

Estimadas familias de Currier,
Sabemos que estos tiempos son diferentes y hay momentos en los cuales nos agarra la preocupación o ansiedad. Deseamos recordarles que nos tienen a su lado, solo comuníquese con el/la maestro/a de su hijo/a o con el Sr. Truckenbrod/la Sra. Barros porque, ¡juntos somos fuertes! Y como dice esta canción, “…no se preocupe, sea feliz.” ¡Extrañamos mucho a nuestros estudiantes! Les mandamos unos saludos cariñosos desde la distancia.

Dear Currier Families,
We know that these are different times and at times you may find your mind worrying or feeling anxious. We would like to remind you that we are by your side, all you have to do is communicate with your child’s teacher or Mr. Truckenbrod/Mrs. Barros. Because, we are stronger together! As the song goes, “…don’t worry, be happy.” We miss our students dearly! We are sending you all warm greetings from afar.",0.0,"Such a great video to watch over and over again!

Go Noodle has some active screen time options for families, at family.gonoodle.com . Brainercise is a fun choice for all ages, and one that challenges me! If you are looking to burn some energy, check out Maximo. You will find the Electric Slide, the Hokey Pokey, the Chicken Dance, and a lot of other fun choices. When it is time to calm down, try Flow.

Future Problem Solvers International uses a research-based problem solving process to develop critical and creative thinking skills, increase awareness of the future, and enhance communication and collaboration. Students worked in small teams of 3-4 to apply this problem solving process to a fictitious problem of the future.

On Friday, Craig County moved to the orange level according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health COVID-19 risk map. (Found here: https://coronavirus.health.ok.gov/covid-19-alert-system). We are at Orange Level 1 according to our Return to Learn Plan. We are at the lower end of Orange Level 1 and will continue with the safety protocols that we have already been using (masks when you cannot socially distance, no visitors, etc.).

We will continue to monitor the situation. If we continue to climb in the orange category we may have to move to an alternative (A/B) schedule. Our team has that schedule figured out and will send more information out IF we climb higher in the orange category in future weeks. The color coded map is updated every Friday.

We have had a great first full week and we are looking forward to great 2020-2021 school year!

Hopefully, this finds you happy and healthy. The pandemic and subsequent school closure have caused hardships for many and a nontraditional education for our students. In March, before rolling out a distance learning plan, Welch Public School concentrated on student and family needs, taking care of faculty and staff, and how we could facilitate learning from a distance. There was no ‘playbook’ for addressing a school closure, but our faculty and staff performed admirably to shift to a distance learning model quickly. With the uncertainty of what school will look like next year, we would like your feedback to help us make decisions regarding what will be best for WPS students during the 2020-21 school year.

Check out our how-to video on teaching phonemic awareness to your kids at home! Phonemic awareness skills such as phoneme isolation, segmentation, blending, and manipulation build into later phonological skills such as rhyming and syllable structure of words.

These are our basic foundational skills for literacy development!

We know stress is high for parents at home working with their kids and switching to distance learning, so we hope little activities like these can help! We will be posting a how to video every couple of days of language based activities. Reach out to us if you want us to cover something specific or even if you have any questions!

WSFR understands the importance of having trained babysitters available, especially while more children are at home and need quality care. We are happy to announce that we are re-starting our Safe Sitters classes.

Safe Sitter classes teach young teens how to be safe online, when accepting jobs, and how to manage children of all ages. Students will receive full AHA CPR and First Aid certification upon completion of the class.

Classes are limited to 8 students in order to maintain proper social distancing requirements. All students will have their temperatures taken and parents will need to answer a COVID symptoms medical questionnaire before entering the fire station.

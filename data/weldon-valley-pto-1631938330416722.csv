Dec 7th is the Christmas Program at school. Don't forget you can get a good meal before hand. I believe it is smoked pork and the fixings. Correct me if I am wrong.

The Senior Dinner is 5:30 – 7:00 pm. There will be an option for take-out orders from 4:00-5:00 pm. Please Pre-buy your dinner tickets at the main office or find any senior student.

Weldon Valley School has decided to offer its students a Home Economics class and I'm the lucky duck that gets to teach it.

We are needing a few supplies to help us out (this probably won't be the first time I ask). If you have any extra kitchen items: bowls, whisks, spatulas, baking sheets, hand held mixers, mixing spoons, rubber spatulas, basic cake decorating tips, aprons, knifes, dish drainers, loaf pans, muffin tins, pots and pans, etc. I would love to have them.

Please bring donations to the school office and we will get them taken care of.

During the Annual Views of Youth event selected students polled their peers to find out what they have to say about their schools. The groups found out that students enjoy learning and thriving in their respective buildings. They also had menu requests for the cafeteria such as ratatouille.

Two Valley High School Alumni, Cori Aafedt and Justin Hersh, kicked off the program by talking about their own experiences and advising students to take advantage of the variety of activities available to them.

Tomorrow is the 46th Annual Viking Invite Wrestling tournament. At some point in the late afternoon or early evening we are going to pay our respect for all that the late, great Viking Gary Sandau did for our community and the wrestling community. The timing of this is TBA as we just can't predict when the finals of the tournament will start.

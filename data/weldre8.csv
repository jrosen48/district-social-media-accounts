With the cancellation of in-person learning across Colorado for the remainder of this school year combined with the continued requirements for Social Distancing due to COVID - 19, we established two options for our seniors at Fort Lupton High School for a graduation ceremony. A survey was sent this past weekend to each Senior with the options of a virtual ceremony or a “parade” ceremony. The overwhelming majority of our students want to participate in a parade followed by walking across the stage at the High School Stadium / Bob Felps Field at the culmination of the parade through Fort Lupton.
This parade will begin at 8:00 AM on Saturday, May 23, 2020. As the details are worked out this week, we will provide you with all the information. We are partnering with the City Of Fort Lupton to create a memorable graduation for our students.

One way we would like to do this is through a Ribbon Project. Red and yellow ribbons are the color of Covid-19 Awareness. Starting on the 4th we would like students and families to write a message to teachers and school staff throughout the district on a yellow or red ribbon and tie them onto fences around the school buildings or even around trees in yards. Students and families can also record a video message and post it to the school or district facebook page.

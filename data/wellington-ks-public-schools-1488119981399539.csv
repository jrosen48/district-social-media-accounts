I spoke with Jared Brown at Impact Bank and he is also involved with the Booster Club...Jared said,

""This has long been a need and wish for the coaches, namely AUFTY. We had a local benefactor reach out to the Crusader Club, wishing to do something nice for the community. It was their wish that it be more of a capital project vs operating funds. We were able to get plans from Chris Craig who oversaw the project. All funds were donated and no district or city funds were utilized.""

Thank you Jared and Crusader Booster Club, thank you benefactor person and Chris Craig - we live in an awesome community!! Image removed.",2020-07-08 13:48:00,,

Considerations for Masks/Face Coverings

July 2, 2020
Based on Governor Kelly’s Executive Order 20-52 (released July 2, 2020), and unless specific guidance within your county indicates otherwise, masks or other face coverings should be worn by participants in any organized sports activity anytime participants are around others and unable to maintain 6-foot
physical distancing.

Per CDC guidelines, individuals who are engaged in high intensity activities, like running, may not be able to wear a mask or face covering if it causes difficulty breathing. Additionally, masks should not be worn during activities that cause the mask to become wet.

The KSHSAA encourages coaches to consider alternative activities if adequate physical distancing cannot be maintained in the absence of the participant wearing a mask. All non-participants in workout activities such as coaches, staff and non-participating students should wear a mask or face covering at all times when around others and 6-foot physical distancing cannot be maintained.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2680312998846892&id=1488119981399539,,0.0,"KSHSAA Statement on masks/face coverings...

A little more history about one of our schools...how many of you knew (I didn't until I ran across this architectural drawing), that the original plans (or at least the plans at some point perhaps) for the then new high school at 605 North A, (present middle school) built in the late 50's / early 60's were twice as large as what eventually was built. Only the left half (or so) of this drawing was actually constructed, the two pods that are there now weren't added for almost 10 years after the original build. (1970). When the pods were added, that also included the addition of the cafeteria. Prior to that, all schools had an open lunch hour (and it was for an hour), many students would go downtown to eat at Glasco Drug or Chief Drug (and other places) or of course Dick's Drive In, A & W or home for lunch. In middle school, prior to changeover to a closed lunch hour, I remember walking downtown and eating lunch with my dad who's insurance office was next to Glasco Drug. Good times.",0.0,"Steven Sturgis

HAPPY 100th BIRTHDAY WELLINGTON HIGH SCHOOL!!

In the FALL of 1920, Sumner County HS closed, and in its place, Wellington High School began. WHS was housed in the same building until 1929 when students were moved to the new 3 story structure at 8th and A Streets. That would be the home of the Crusaders until the early 60's, when 2 blocks north the 3rd HS came to be (to accommodate baby boomers from WWII) and the Classes of 1962 thru 2004 called it their Crusader Home. (The picture below was taken in 1970 after the ""pods"" had been added.) The 2020 graduating class this year will be the 16th class to graduate from the present facility located on E. 16th.

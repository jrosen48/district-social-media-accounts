We must have a signed waiver for your child to come on campus. If your child rides the bus we also need a signed Transportation Rules form returned. These waivers will be delivered today during lunch. Students will need to have these signed on Monday in order to ride the bus or come on campus.

No backpacks will be allowed this year. Students will need to bring the Chromebook to school. We have ordered plastic tote bags and a zippered pouch for each student who attends school. The Chromebook and charger needs to come to school each day and will then go home for homework.

Uniform shirts, a solid colored polo shirt, are required.

Any questions, please call the office at 785-3311.

Under Executive Orders from Governor Tim Walz, Minnesota is social distancing and prohibited from having large gatherings that could facilitate the spread of COVID-19. So WEM held a drive-through for students to return school materials after weeks of distance learning at the end of the school year. A special time was set for seniors to return their items, receive awards announced the previous night at a virtual Night of Excellence, see their teachers and friends, and ride in a parade on the street between the school and the football field. Everyone had a great time, and it was a beautiful day! Congratulations, Class of 2020!

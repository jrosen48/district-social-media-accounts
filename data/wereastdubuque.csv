This is my first official year as a certified teacher, although you might have seen me around, as I was a paraprofessional here at East Dubuque the last couple of years while finishing school.
My husband and I are both East Dubuque natives and are raising our two children here. Our daughter Mia just started her Freshman year of high school and our son Theo just turned two in July! We also have an almost three year old puppy named Maddon. I love spending time with my family and friends, watching Mia play sports, going for walks, online shopping, watching the Cubs, and last but certainly not least, teaching!
I feel genuinely blessed that I am beginning my teaching career at the very school that I went to as a child.

If the East Dubuque School District were going to update its facilities just for space needs based on national averages we would need to do a $3.9 Million dollar project at the Elementary School and a $2.4 Million dollar project at the Junior High/High School.

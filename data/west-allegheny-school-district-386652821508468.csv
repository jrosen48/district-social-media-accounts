In addition to the desktop application, Canvas also offers an App with both Android and iOS support, which we recommend downloading free from the App Store. Both platforms allow families convenient and timely access to student attendance, schedules, assignments, grades, calendars, teachers and much more once school begins.

Later this evening, parents/guardians should receive an individual email for each of your children that provides a unique pairing code generated by the District that is necessary for you to access your child's Canvas account.

Due to today's weather, we are changing the location of pickup for your caps / gowns and announcements. Mrs. Brickley will now be located at the rear of the school.

1. If you are also coming to pick up meals, enter the property at the elementary driveway and proceed through the meal distribution line. After the YMCA pickup, please turn right at the corner and proceed toward the back of the property. Mrs. Brickley will be at the portico right past the band room.

2. If you are here just to pick up your cap / gown and announcements, enter the property by the football stadium and proceed toward the back of the property. Mrs. Brickley will be at the portico right past the band room.

Take some time to appreciate our Earth today while practicing mindfulness. Let's get creative and mud paint!

Ingredients:

- Dishwashing liquid
- Water
- Cardboard
- Paint brushes

Directions:
1. Place your mud in individual containers
2 Add a color source from the ingredient list
3. Add a squirt of dishwashing liquid (this helps the mud paint spread and helps remove the color from clothing!)
4. Mx it up with some water to reach the desired texture

Hello, Middle Schoolers!
GREAT job with last week's puzzle challenge!

This week's challenge idea came from Mrs. McGonigal and should be a fun one! The challenge is to take a ""forced perspective"" photo - this means you use the power of optical illusion to make an object or person look much smaller or larger than they actually are. See the examples here. Send Mrs. Porter your challenge pics by Friday, April 17th. Can't wait to see what you come up with!

Here we are in week 4 of staying home and I don't know about you guys, but I am really starting to miss everyone! Mr. MItchell, the middle school teachers and I spent some time last week thinking about ways that we could stay connected to each other while school is closed and decided to have a weekly ""challenge"" that our students, faculty and staff can all participate in. There will be a new challenge each week that school remains closed. The challenges are designed to remind us that We Are All In This Together!

PUZZLE CHALLENGE!!!

This week, your challenge is to complete a PUZZLE - ANY puzzle - 50 pieces, 1,000 pieces, or somewhere in between! You can work by yourself, with a sibling, or anyone else at home. Take a picture of yourself with your completed puzzle and email the picture to Mrs. Porter (jporter@westbranch.org) by 3:00 on Friday, April 10th. We'll post the pics on social media, email, etc so that we can all see each others' work.

Dear West Branch Families and Staff,

Following a communication from the Department of Education this morning, we are aware that Governor Wolf has issued a declaration that all State Agencies (including School Districts) shall postpone or virtually host planned large meetings, conferences, trainings, or community events. Although we recognize that the information we have is subject to rapid change, we will be cancelling all large gatherings as well as out-of-district student-travel beginning today until further notice to be in compliance with this directive.

Please watch for re-scheduled dates to be established once we receive additional guidance. We will keep you updated on any future events/closings as information/guidance on the situation develops.

Sincerely,
Michelle Dutrow

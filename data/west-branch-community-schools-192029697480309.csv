Herbert Hoover National Historic Site would like to congratulate and thank the Architecture, Construction and Engineering (A.C.E.) program at West Branch High School for their recent completion of the Thompson Farm Brooder House. The students built a brooder house similar in design to the originally constructed building for our turn-of-the-century Iowa farmstead. The original Brooder house was prefabricated by Green Gable Builders out of Onawa, Iowa which began business in 1923 through the 1950's.",0.0,"When your school is in a town with a ton of history, you happen upon some really unique learning experiences.

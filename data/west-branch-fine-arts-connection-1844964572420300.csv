Information re Glenwood Show Choir Competition:

We have secured 2 charter buses for our trip. We will depart around 5am. I will confirm the departure time on Monday, Jan 27. Our performance time is 10:50am. Final awards will be at 8:55pm.

I want to thank the Fine Arts Connection helping us get the charter buses set up. We will need to raise roughly $2500 for the buses. We are planning a few fundraisers to generate the $2500. More to come soon.

BUT, we do have the following fundraising opportunity to help raise money for the charter buses - Carver Concessions (Men’s BB vs Wisconsin) this Monday, Jan 27. We would need 6 students (age 16+) and 2 adults. Guaranteed minimum of $100 per person! That would be $800!!

Groups performing will be the High School Marching Trojans, Drumline, Colorguard, and the 8th Grade Band. Each section of the band will be performing a selection too.

The West Central Music Association will be serving “Marching” Tacos, a dessert, and a drink for $5 from 5 p.m .- 6:45 p.m. in the HS commons. Proceeds will go towards scholarships for band students, equipment, and financial help for the East Coast trip this summer. Each section will also create gift baskets that will go to the highest bidder in a silent auction to help them raise money individually for the trip.

The concert usually lasts 55-60 minutes and will be the last time they perform their street and field show. This year has been a historic year for our program and the students are so proud of their show.

The WCHS fall play The 39 Steps will be showing in the WCHS Auditorium on Thursday, October 16th @ 7PM and Saturday, October 18th @ 2PM AND 7PM

*Tickets can be purchased at the Hartford Community Library any time next week (Oct. 13-17) during regular business hours, or at the WCHS Auditorium between 6 PM and 7 PM, before each performance.
This is a comedy murder mystery, based on the film by Alfred Hitchcock, but re-written as a “Young Frankenstein-esque stage play”. Our cast of 8 brilliant WCHS students play nearly 40 characters, and the technicians have done an absolutely outstanding job on the productions lighting and sound effects. We are thrilled to present this show at WCHS, and we are sure that the community will love what we’ve created.

The adult male identified has not been on district property within the last week.

In consultation with the CDC, South Dakota Department of Health, the Governor‚Äôs Office, and local officials, an action plan has been developed to mitigate the potential spread of COVID-19. The district has initiated steps to deep clean all school buildings and sources of transportation. All district buildings are closed and all activities are canceled for today. This includes outside groups who have reserved facility space for Community Education and/or practices.

Please stay tuned to media outlets for further updates and information coming regularly throughout the day.

Homecoming is this Friday. We run an abbreviated schedule that day in order to accommodate the students attending the parade and pep rally. The parade starts at 1:30 and students return to classrooms following the parade. We then attend the pep rally which generally ends about 3:30.

Students are required to attend all of the school sponsored activities that day and stay until the end of the pep rally. The buses will run on the regular schedule. The only way students are excused from the activities prior to the end of the day is if they are picked up by a parent or an adult designated by the parents. Due to the chaos around the parade and the many people in town that day, students are not dismissed to walk home or ride their bikes home after the parade. Notes, emails or calls can be directed to Sara Jost if you intend to have someone pick up students prior to 3:30.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

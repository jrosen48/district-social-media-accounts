Hartford, SD- April 19, 2018 – West Central has been honored with the Best Communities for Music Education designation from The NAMM Foundation for its outstanding commitment to music education.

The Best Communities for Music Education designation is awarded to districts that demonstrate outstanding achievement in efforts to provide music access and education to all students.

This award recognizes that West Central is leading the way with learning opportunities as outlined in the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). The legislation guides implementation in the states and replaces the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) which was often criticized for an overemphasis on testing-while leaving behind subjects such as music. ESSA recommends music and the arts as important elements of a wellrounded education for all children.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1617614291626439&id=603775593010319,,0.0,"West Central’s Music Education Program Receives National Recognition

6th Annual Indoor Marching Band Concert
Monday, October 20th at 7 p.m. in the new gym

Groups performing will be the High School Marching Trojans, Drumline, Colorguard, and the 8th Grade Band. Each section of the band will be performing a selection too.

The West Central Music Association will be serving “Marching” Tacos, a dessert, and a drink for $5 from 5 p.m .- 6:45 p.m. in the HS commons. Proceeds will go towards scholarships for band students, equipment, and financial help for the East Coast trip this summer. Each section will also create gift baskets that will go to the highest bidder in a silent auction to help them raise money individually for the trip.

The concert usually lasts 55-60 minutes and will be the last time they perform their street and field show. This year has been a historic year for our program and the students are so proud of their show. We hope you can come check it out!",0.0,"West Central High School

Two West Genesee High School juniors were invited to attend the American Legion Boys State sponsored by the Camillus Post #1540.

The boys who were selected to attend are: Andrew Sheedy and Keegan Scharoun.

Two girls from West Genesee High School were selected for Girls State as delegates and three girls as alternates. Danesia Patterson and Mia Coots were chosen to be delegates and Velika Zaitseva, Sarah Petrus, and Julia Colabufo were alternates.

These events involve a week of educational programs that teach government from the township to the state level. These selected students exhibited the most outstanding qualities of leadership, character, scholarship, loyalty, and service to their school.

These are annually scheduled to occur at the end of June. Unfortunately, both summer programs were cancelled due to COVID-19.

Congratulations!!!

The West Genesee Class of 2020 is paying an admirable tribute to the first responders who have been at the heart of treating patients with COVID-19. This will take shape in a message that will begin appearing on the electronic billboard at Township 5 beginning today, Thursday, June 18 through June 24.

The images are of graduates in caps and gowns, and medical personal in full PPE. The message to all these medical heroes?

“WE CAN WEAR OUR CAPS AND GOWNS,
BECAUSE YOU WORE YOURS.
THANK YOU
FROM THE CLASS OF 2020
WEST GENESEE”

This tribute image and message was created by artist, Julia Winfield, a 1983 graduate of West Genesee High School. Julia has an art and design business in Charlotte, NC, and has donated this piece to her alma mater, where she believes students are encouraged to value the accomplishments of others.

This year we were proud to establish the West Genesee High School chapter of the National Art Honor Society (NAHS).

The goal of NAHS is to not only recognize students for their artistic ability, but to also empower students to become leaders in our school and local community through arts-based service and professional artistic development.

Our inaugural group of 45 members are led by our officers:

Hailey Kremenek, President
Fateema Islam, Vice President
Maison Lamanna, Secretary
Gabriela Corso, Treasurer
Riley Kiteveles, Event Coordinator

While we could not have our in-person exhibition and ceremony, we are excited to share and celebrate these students through this video posted at the top of this webpage or directly by clicking here: https://ensemble.cnyric.org/Watch/Qc42Hty8. We hope you enjoy!

This afternoon, at the daily press conference, NYS Governor Andrew Cuomo announced the continuation and extension of “pause” (previous Executive Order) until April 29, 2020.

In order to further promote the need for social distancing, school property (including playgrounds) will remain closed through April 29, 2020. We look forward to opening these facilities when the environment is safer at a later date.

Also today, at the NYS Board of Regents meeting, Chancellor Rosa announced that the June Regents exams are cancelled. Additional guidance on this matter will be released soon. Updates will be forwarded at that time.

We would like to thank all of you for your generous donations to date. The most common question is, “What items are you in need of most?” Currently our plan is to utilize most pantry items to provide food for what would have been our April Break Week (April 4-12).

With this in mind, we believe simple, non-perishable meal items would serve the community the best. Ideas are as follows:

Man n Cheese
Pasta and Sauce
Canned Soup
Tuna Fish
Peanut Butter and Jelly
Bread
Boxes of Cereal
Beverages
Granola
Snacks
Etc.

Thank you for your continued support of our community during this challenging time.

Donations can be dropped off at the main entrance between the hours of 9:00 a.m. to Noon, Monday-Friday, at West Genesee High School, 5201 West Genesee Street, Camillus, New York 13031.

First off hope everyone is doing well! With help from our Instructional Technology Department and the go ahead from my administration at West Genesee Central School District, I have brought our Makerbot #Z18 #3DPrinters out of quarantine and set up a mini print farm to help Budmen Industries, a local company, 3D print #COVID19 face shields! I am proud to work for a district that understands how important this issue is and am proud to report I'm up to 8 #3DFaceShield parts and now printing 6 at a time. A big thanks also to my wife Daniella and puppy Charlotte for putting up with all of the strange Star Wars type noises coming from the basement haha. #flatteningthecurve And not to be blunt but if you think this is no big deal, that it won't happen to you and are walking around like nothing going to happen to you please remember there are many that you love that ARE at risk and ARE in harm's way so STAY HOME! https://budmen.com/

As per the order of the County Executive, students will be out of school beginning Monday, March 23, 2020. Students are scheduled to return on Tuesday, April 14.

The District plans to share more information tomorrow regarding this announcement. As we prepare for continuity of instruction for all of our students we anticipate using next week to solidify plans to meet the needs of our students.

We recognize that some of you may be uncomfortable sending your children to school. Please know that we respect your right as parents to choose what is best for your child.

Thank you,
David C. Bills

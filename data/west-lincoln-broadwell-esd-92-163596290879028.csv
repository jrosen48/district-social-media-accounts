Teachers will be sending updated learning opportunities for the few days between the original resume date and spring break. These are learning opportunities for your children while they are at home. These are not graded assignments that are mandatory. We are just offering some type of continuity of learning as best we can at this point. Do not stress about getting everything accomplished. Many teachers are offering Zoom meetings to connect with their classes. Please keep an eye out for those schedules.

Meals will continue to be provided Monday to Friday. Please reach out to me if your family needs anything. I will do my best to provide what is needed for your family.

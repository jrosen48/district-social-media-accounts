According to Indiana State Law, PRIOR to beginning their senior year, students are supposed to have a second MCV (meningococcal) vaccine, and 2 doses of Hepatitis A vaccine. Due to all of the recent issues with COVID, many seniors were unable to get these immunizations. On Sept. 28th, the Noble County Health Dept. will be coming to West Noble during the school day to administer these vaccines. If you are interested in an information packet, please have your student pick one up in the nurse's office. If you are unsure if your student still needs these vaccines, contact Nurse Robin at 260-894-3191 ext. 3040.

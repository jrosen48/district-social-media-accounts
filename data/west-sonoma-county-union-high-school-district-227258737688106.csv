Fire season started early this year. We know that many of you live in evacuation areas, but as of now there appears to be no imminent danger. However, fire can change quickly as we’ve learned over the recent years.

Please do not worry about school work if you are in an affected area; your safety is our main priority. As always, we are here to help and support our El Molino families. Please do not hesitate to let us know if you need anything to help get through this. Your well being is of paramount concern to us.

El Molino senior Sasha Senal made her mark in a stellar, multi-year volleyball career, helping to restore a winning tradition to a storied program. During her four years on the varsity squad, Senal rose to become one of the top outside/middle hitters in the league, posting big numbers of kills and blocks. She was also a respected court leader, serving as a team captain during the Lions’ run to the North Bay League Redwood Division title last fall.

Today I finally got to see some of my (other) kids. It meant a lot to me to hand deliver these packages. Most of these students have been with me since their Freshmen year. The 2020 class was my first graduating class, so they’ve had a special place in my heart.

It’s disappointing they missed out on special moments this spring- the van rides, the memories, the pictures, the proms, games, state conferences, concerts, productions, etc. It just sucks. Although I know they’ve missed so much, in the last couple months, I hope the memories of the rest of their time at Analy and in ANX 3 will override what was missed. Class of 2020, you are one for the books & I love you all!

We're so proud of you, Adyson Posner, for winning The Press Democrat's 2020 Youth Service Award for Health Science. The Press Democrat said:

""Authentic and humble, this nominee has committed the last three years to being a volunteer Peer Educator at the Forestville Teen Clinic.

""Her volunteer work includes; working in laboratory processing, patient charts, data management, community outreach, public speaking and sex education.

""She has always been a shy person, and credits her volunteerism for her growth. Through her work she has grown to understand the importance of community. She quoted, 'healthcare is about more than just one’s physical health,' and acknowledged that sexual health, building healthy relationships and safety are all integral parts of a person’s health.

""Because of her involvement in many aspects of healthcare, the award goes to Adyson Posner from El Molino High School."" Read more here: https://www.pressdemocrat.com/lifestyle/10959108-181/meet-this-years-winners-of",2.0,"Congratulations!!

A tribute to senior Colman Hayes

El Molino’s Colman Hayes was among the top athletes of his graduating class, excelling on football, wrestling and track teams. There were few better on the gridiron, where he was a fierce, all-league linebacker who led the Lions in tackles for two seasons. In addition to three years on the El Mo wrestling team, Hayes enjoyed success in track and field, where he was among the team’s best shot put and discus throwers and a North Coast Section qualifier.

What is your favorite high school memory?
Performing Laramie Project my sophomore year because it allowed me to explore characters that were incredibly different from anything I had done before or since. Every night when we finished, you could see the tears in the eyes of every audience member. Knowing we changed people every performance was magical.

We know the coronavirus has created challenges for AP students and teachers. Here’s how the College Board will support you during this time:

1️⃣ We’re providing free, live and on-demand AP courses

To support AP students affected by school closures due to COVID-19, students and schools will have access to live AP review lessons, delivered by AP teachers from across the country. Lessons will begin March 25.

2️⃣ We’re developing a new at-home testing option

Because of the challenges created by COVID-19, we’re developing a new at-home AP Exam option. Students will be able to test on a computer, tablet, or smartphone.

We will invest so that every AP student impacted by COVID-19 has the tools and connectivity they need to review AP content online and take the exam from home.

During this challenging time, we will work to give every AP student the opportunity to earn the college credit and placement they’ve been working toward all year while maintaining a focus on the health and safety of our AP community.

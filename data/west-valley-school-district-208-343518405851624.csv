Drum roll please...
This event is ON FOR TODAY! Our amazing custodians are working on the parking lot and sidewalks. Our DECA students are so excited to host and help you have a great time.

We realize this new day and time won’t work for everyone. We also realize some of you will choose to stay off the roads. We are really sorry this year didn’t work out differently.

When I can talk to the right people and make sure I have the correct info and forms I will post about how you can get a refund if you’ve purchased tickets you won’t be able to use.

This is a fundraising event for DECA and helps our students with the expenses of their state and national competitions. They will be happy with any amount they can raise and if they have to be creative because this year’s attendance is really down - that will be a real world, real life lesson we can work through.

Thanks for sticking with us and for your patience this morning. It was nice to not have my phone blow up with notifications!",0.0,"West Valley High School, Yakima

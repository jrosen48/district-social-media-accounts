Exciting news: we are offering FREE admission for the month of January 2020. Thanks to a grant from the Davenport Trust Fund, admission fees will be waived through January 31, giving visitors the opportunity to explore the museum free of charge, including the new exhibit The Frozen Kingdom: Commerce & Pleasure in the Maine Winter.

As a nonprofit that receives no state, local, or federal funds‚Äîwith the exception of the occasional competitively awarded grant‚Äîthe museum must charge admission to cover its costs. Unfortunately, this cost can be a barrier to access for some. Waiving admission fees for January will give all Mainers the opportunity to discover and celebrate the state‚Äôs rich maritime heritage and to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Maine‚Äôs statehood.

We hope you'll join us this January to explore the museum!

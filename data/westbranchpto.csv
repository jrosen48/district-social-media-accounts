Good morning! I am the Program Specialist at Big Brothers Big Sisters of Johnson County. For the past few years we have enjoyed a special partnership with West Branch schools and are able to support 12-15 one-to-one mentoring relationships in West Branch. Half of the equation is identifying ""Littles"" (kids in need of positive, fun relationship with an adult mentor). The other half is finding committed, compassionate ""Bigs"" who are interested in being a positive influence in someone's life. Please email me or comment if you are interested in learning more about being a Big in West Branch, or if you know a child in West Branch who may love to be a Little: dina@bbbsjc.org

Parents for Great Iowa Schools will be presenting about how current legislation could affect Iowa public schools and what parents can do to have a voice. The goal is to provide updates in a non-partisan, easy to understand format - perfect for people who love public schools, but are a little new to the political process when it comes to advocating.

Please help spread this invite to your community in an effort to turn out a great attendance and support of public schools in Eastern Iowa. There is an event created on Facebook if you'd like to share it on social media. SearchEastern Iowa Corridor Public School Rally

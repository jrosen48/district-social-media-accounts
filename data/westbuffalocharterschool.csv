In staying true to our word to share what we know about reopening when we know it-- here is today's update.

The New York State Education Department today presented the framework of guidance to help schools and school districts as they plan to reopen, whether that occurs in person, remotely, or in a combination of the two. In addition to the framework presented today, formal guidance will be disseminated later this week that will enable New York‚Äôs schools to continue to safely educate their students this fall.

The formal guidance is expected to be released on Wednesday. We will continue to update you.

One step at a time...

Today, Governor Cuomo announced that summer school will not open for in-person instruction this year and that all summer instruction will continue remotely.

The Governor has not yet made a decision regarding the upcoming fall semester. However, he stated that schools will be required to submit their Fall re-opening plans in July and that guidance for developing those plans will be released in early June.

WBCS eagerly awaits the Governor's guidance as it will assist us in making any plans for Fall 2020!!!! Stay tuned...

Lately, I‚Äôve been feeling like I‚Äôm a bit stuck. Stuck in the house because it‚Äôs freezing. Stuck in the same routine day after day. Stuck waiting for guidance on what school should look like in Fall 2020.

I‚Äôm sure you feel It, too. But...I‚Äôm trusting the wait. I‚Äôm embracing the uncertainty, although as someone who likes control, it‚Äôs not a very comfortable feeling. I‚Äôm eager and excited to plan for whatever the future may hold.

Why am I excited at a time like this? Because some day in the future (I‚Äôm not exactly sure when) we WILL be together again. And that will be a beautiful thing! The future is ours. The possibilities endless.

Hang in there! Waiting is hard. I understand. When we know something more about next school year you will be the first to know. I promise.

We got this!

Dear WBCS Teachers,

We know your work is never done and your day (even when virtual) never ends. There are still lessons to plan, assignments to grade, and ""meetings"" to attend.

Now that your home has become your classroom, your whiteboard is now a Chromeboook and your students, who wish they could see you in person and hug you, are miles away--you continue to do an AMAZING job. We are so lucky to have you.

So, thank you for the lessons. For inventing new ways (in an instant) to keep your students engaged, and for making a difference in our lives. This week we celebrate YOU and all that you are doing.

Happy Teacher Appreciation Week!

So what does this mean for WBCS? It means we will continue what we are doing. We will continue to put our students' learning and social-emotional needs first. We will continue remote instruction until the end of June. We will have ""reimagined"" classroom celebrations, moving up days, and graduation ceremonies.

1) print out the image of the WBCS letters or draw your own letters
2) color and decorate the whole page of paper any way you would like

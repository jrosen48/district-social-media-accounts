Dear WCV preK - 6th grade families,

We understand the challenges you may have faced, time you spent and school work you accomplished during the COVID-19 closure. To simply say thank you doesn't seem to be enough. We are sponsoring one yearbook for every preK - 6th grade family. And, to the 6th graders, we'll sponsor you for your own copy.

6th graders, you will be given your copy during your ""moving up day"" time slot at the school. Everyone else will receive yearbooks on WCV's last bus delivery.

Again, thank you for all of your efforts and hard work!

Gratefully,

Hello Everyone,

I hope you are all doing well! As the days roll on, it is getting harder and harder to walk through the halls without seeing all of your smiling faces. We miss you very much and can’t wait for this to be over! For now, please make sure you are checking your Google Classroom regularly and completing all assignments from your teachers. They are doing their best to stay in constant communication with all students. If your teacher is not currently using Google Classroom in the primary grades (K-2), please continue communicating through email. Packets for these classrooms should have been delivered by mail or a WCV bus driver. If you are lacking materials, please let me know. I am checking my emails regularly and will respond to both parents and students if you have any questions (or just want to say hello). I wish everyone a very Happy Easter! Keep smiling and stay healthy.

As of today, all Chromebooks requested have been distributed to students who are enrolled in a grade or class that require digital use (4-12).

Victoria,

We are so proud of the bright, caring and beautiful young woman you have become. It seems like only yesterday you were learning to walk at Gymboree with Katie, reading your favorite book Little Bird Biddle Bird before bed and performing at your first dance recital. We watched you learn to ride Roxy at Drakestown Equestrian, show courage and bravery when we moved to Pennsylvania and beamed with pride when you moved up to high heeled tap shoes. Now you have learned to drive and you are graduating High School.

We are so excited for you to start this next chapter in your life. No matter what you choose to do or where life takes you remember to always be true to yourself. To quote our favorite Dr. Seuss book “You’re off to great places! Today is your day! Your mountain is waiting so get on your way!”

To our son, Shane, we wish only the best of everything. This year’s graduation may not be what anyone expected, but it is certainly unique and that is certainly representative of you! You have always been a curious kid and loved to learn about all sorts of things. You have always been a kind and caring person. We loved watching you explore new things whether it was in Boy Scouts, or learning to play the violin and the piano, or playing baseball, soccer, golf or snowboarding! You were self-taught in many things that you found interesting and wanted to research, including your love of astronomy and telescopes which is leading to your next step to study Astronomy and Astrophysics at Penn State. We learn something new from you every day ourselves! Our warmest thoughts and highest hopes are with you as we celebrate your graduation. Always remember, there is no limit to what you can achieve.

To Pete Nelson and the Class of 2020, aka Senior Skip Day Champs,
For everything, there is a season. Go ahead and cry and mourn for the things you missed out on but don’t forget to laugh and dance as well. The human mind can’t even fathom the things God has prepared.

The world will continue to change—sometimes too fast and sometimes not fast enough. But the truest things--they still remain true even when the dust settles.

What is the truest thing you know? Uncertainty can be scary but rest assured, your future is still bright and still lies ahead of you. It may be slightly delayed but it’s still there and will still work out the way it’s meant to be. Hold onto the truest thing you know.

God bless the class of 2020!",,,0.0,"We love our seniors!

It feels like just yesterday we were bringing you home from the hospital, and here we are - graduation. We are so proud of you both with all that you have achieved. Putting others before yourselves with your jobs during the pandemic; taking on additional hours while keeping up with your studies is impressive!

We are so proud of the young man and musician that you have become. From the initial days of gritting our teeth while listening to you practice so you could earn your belts on recorder to these past years watching you perform both on the field and at WCU, we could not be prouder or more amazed at seeing just how far you have progressed and what a truly fantastic performer and man you have become. I am so sorry that your final senior performances have been taken from you, all of the milestone *things* that you and your peers should have been able to experience. Instead of focusing on what has been missed, continue to look forward to all the new performances you will have as you move on to college and the future that lies ahead for you. The new fields and stages that you will grace. We look forward to seeing you continue to grow into an even better performer and kind, generous, giving man than you already are.

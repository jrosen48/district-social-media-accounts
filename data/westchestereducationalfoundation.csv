Did you know that every time you support one of our fundraisers that you are helping to fund classroom parties, dances, special events, and also helping the principals purchase items for their schools? The WPTC gives money to every principal at the start of the school year. This is called their school needs fund. We try to give them $2,000 per year. The principals have used this money for various things over the years: new laminators, recess equipment, banners for the school, and so much more. This money has funded many things that may not have normally been in their budgets to purchase. YOUR generous donations have made this possible. This year, because of your generosity, we were able to give the district a $2,000 donation. Our treasurer, Tammy Flynn, presented Mr. Salemi with a check this week. This money will be used to purchase something to benefit the district as a whole.

Mrs. Marolt, a classroom sponsor through the Westchester Education Foundation, joined Mrs. Lappe's first grade class to help teach the students about other cultures. The class used the money we received from the WEF to purchase multicultural books. Mrs. Marolt read a wonderful book, ""Off We Go to Mexico, An Adventure in the Sun"". She also introduced the children to the work of Frida Kahilo, a famous Mexican artist. The children were inspired by a picture to create their own sun/moon paintings in her style. The students brilliantly worked on their projects.

Adopt a Class and See the Future!
Please consider giving a helping hand to classrooms in Westchester School District 92 ½.  Your $250 tax-deductible gift, specially designated to a classroom of your choice, will help provide classroom tools for grammar school students that might not otherwise be available.  Your donation will also impact the mission of the Westchester Educational Foundation (WEF) – to enhance the quality of education and provide District 92 ½ students in Westchester with expanded learning opportunities.

Each donor will be recognized during the 2013-14 school year with:
•  An invitation for you and a guest at a recognition reception at the beginning of the school year.•  The opportunity to visit your specific classroom and  students during the school year to see the impact of your gift.  Depending on the grade level, reading stories or career days are appropriate.  Or do you have an interest or hobby that you would like to share?  This is a great mentoring opportunity!
•  Donor recognition on the District 92 ½ website and the WEF Facebook page.

Classroom sections are limited.  We have a need for 28 donors at WPS, 19 at WIS, and 22 at WMS (including specialized classrooms such as art, music, and gym).  Room sponsorships are great opportunities for corporate, municipal leaders or departments, or parent donors.  Plus, individuals or families can consider pooling together for a sponsorship.  If you choose to sponsor a specific classroom (your child’s, for instance) preference will go in the order that gifts were received and you’ll be contacted once classroom assignments are announced.  Please mail the information below and your $250 check made payable to the Westchester Educational Foundation to:
Westchester Educational Foundation
10526 W. Cermak Road
Suite 101
Westchester, IL 60154

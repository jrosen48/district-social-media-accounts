We are asking all West Clermont families to color/decorate this #LoveWC poster and/or make a bigger one of your own and then post it on your house, in a window, or on your front door all next week during Spring Break. With many families unable to travel outside the state, we encourage everyone to get outside and walk or drive around to see all the #LoveWC there is across the district! Be sure to take pictures of your own poster & tag @westcler on Twitter or on Facebook with the hashtag #LoveWC.

LILA BARNETT

How long have you been a teacher?
I’ve taught for 30 years. All of my years have been at West County aside from one year at Richwoods.

What subjects have you taught?
I have taught elementary 3-5 grades and all core subjects at the high school level.

What’s your favorite memory of your teaching career?
My best memories are when a former student at West County takes the time to tell me what an impact I made in their life. I have had students tell me that they would not have graduated without me, chose to become a teacher because of me and named their child after me. My students are my school children!

What will you miss the most about teaching?
I will miss the students and my co-workers the most. I have two sons and grandchildren that attend West County so I will be around from time to time.

How do you plan on spending your retirement?
I plan on traveling some and being a grandparent.

Parent/Guardian Names: Jake & Deanna Miller

What are your plans after graduation?
My plans are to go to college at Missouri S & T.

What is your favorite High School memory?
My favorite memory is going to state for cross country.

What do you miss the most about school during the pandemic school closure?
I miss seeing my friends the most.

What is an accomplishment you are proud of?
I am proud of making it to state for cross country.

Whom do you admire, and why?
I don't admire anyone, because I think you should be your own person and plan to be different than other people.

Where do you see yourself in 10 years?
I see myself having a small family and a job in ten years.

What is your advice to underclassmen?
My advice to underclassmen is to not procrastinate on homework, it just makes it harder and more stressful than it needs to be.

Congratulations, Korbyn! We are so proud of you!

Parent/Guardian Names: Shannon & Randy Beckett

What are your plans after graduation?
Going to college to start a radiology program. (not sure which college yet).

What is your favorite High School memory?
All of them. Never thought I’d miss school but I do.

What do you miss the most about school during the pandemic school closure?
Not being social with people.

What is an accomplishment you are proud of?
Making it this far, and overcoming anything in my way!

Whom do you admire, and why?
I admire Mrs. Black because she’s always kind of been like a mother to everyone, and definitely knows how to make me laugh on my worst days.
I also admire Mr. Lashley, because I feel like I could talk to him about any troubles I had or ask for any advice and he’d always know the answer.

Where do you see yourself in 10 years?
Having a job in radiology and having fun doing it.

What is your advice to underclassmen?
Enjoy it while you can.

Congratulations, Brittany! We are so proud of you!

My message to our girls was to stay positive through this and good things will happen, well as most of you know Missouri cancelled spring sports yesterday. For a few hours my positivity ran out, then I get this video message from one of my assistant coaches. It definitely brought a smile to my face and gave my household back some positivity. The smiles on every girls face brought a joy to us. I have been missing those moments when the success brings shear joy to the face of an athlete. I got a little of that watching this video. Needless to say I’ve watched it over and over!! Thanks Hannah Marie Hollock, you did a fantastic job on this!! I hope everyone enjoys watching the 2020 WC Bulldogs softball team!!",12.0,"💜🥎

If this were any other year, we would have been celebrating the hard work and dedication of our Buffalo students in our Hand-to-Hand program with our annual Spring Launch at #HoytLake. Unfortunately, our students won’t get to put their boats in the water this spring, but the Hand-to-Hand program is not just the Spring Launch. It is the process along the way that brings mentors together with students so that we all continue to learn.

We’re asking you to please take the time to see this year’s students of BMC’s Hand-to-Hand Program in action. Help us celebrate them and congratulate the work they’ve done and will continue to do! Thanks to students of #WNYMaritimeCharterSchool, #RiversideAcademy, #AcademySchool, #StMarysSchoolfortheDeaf and, of course, our #volunteer #mentors ! We miss you guys and can’t wait to see you again in the Fall!

If this were any other year, we would have been celebrating the hard work and dedication of our Buffalo students in our Hand-to-Hand program with our annual Spring Launch at #HoytLake. Unfortunately, our students won’t get to put their boats in the water this spring, but the Hand-to-Hand program is not just the Spring Launch. It is the process along the way that brings mentors together with students so that we all continue to learn.

We’re asking you to please take the time to see this year’s students of BMC’s Hand-to-Hand Program in action. Help us celebrate them and congratulate the work they’ve done and will continue to do! Thanks to students of #WNYMaritimeCharterSchool, #RiversideAcademy, #AcademySchool, #StMarysSchoolfortheDeaf and, of course, our #volunteer #mentors ! We miss you guys and can’t wait to see you again in the Fall!

Alex Althaus is no ordinary seaman; although technically she is.

An OS deckhand in her third season sailing with Interlake, she says she does whatever it takes to “hang with the boys on deck” and makes whatever improvements or sacrifices she needs to to reach her goals working on the ships.

“There aren’t many females that have it in them to do what I do in a male-dominated industry,” says the 29-year-old Findlay, Ohio native.

She says one of the most interesting aspects about being a merchant mariner is that as you sail away from land, it’s really an invisible yet essential industry.

“The country simply wouldn’t progress without these materials we haul, and that’s something to be proud of despite all of the challenges of being underway and out on the Lakes,” she says. “If you invest in Interlake, it will be returned. My job absolutely has challenges, leaving everything I know and work hard for is difficult but with great risk comes great reward.”

With the Governor's latest update closing New York schools for the rest of the year we want to let you know that we are working hard to develop plans on finishing up the school year and will release details early next week.

While this year ended in a way none of us could have ever imagined, now is the time to take full advantage of the opportunity to finish and graduate or move up to the next grade. Our teachers are working diligently to ensure all students can complete the assignments given the current situations and are being very generous in their grading. If students are not passing their online assignments, there is a chance they will not move on to the next grade or graduate. Students are fully expected to continue their online classwork and participate, log in to Google Classroom or Schoology on a daily basis, stay in touch with their teachers, and reach out for help as soon as they need it.

We hope you are all doing well, staying home, and staying healthy. We all miss our Candidates and Cadets very much and cannot wait to see them. However, with the Governors extention today of the New York Pause, we are now required to stay closed until May 15th.

Shipping has historically been a male-dominated industry and that tradition runs long and deep. However, through its global programme on the Integration of Women in the Maritime Sector, IMO is making a concerted effort to help the industry move on from that tradition and to help women achieve a representation within it that is more in keeping with twenty-first century expectations.

National organizations such as WIMO’s brings together women working in operations roles within the maritime industry. WIMO’s provides a networking environment, and also gives women in maritime operations opportunities for additional training and volunteer work.

8th March Celebrating Women’s day #InternationalWomensDay #WomenAtSea",0.0,"Since we are the WNY MARITIME Charter School.... Here's to the women that work in the Maritime sector.

Shipping has historically been a male-dominated industry and that tradition runs long and deep. However, through its global programme on the Integration of Women in the Maritime Sector, IMO is making a concerted effort to help the industry move on from that tradition and to help women achieve a representation within it that is more in keeping with twenty-first century expectations.

National organizations such as WIMO’s brings together women working in operations roles within the maritime industry. WIMO’s provides a networking environment, and also gives women in maritime operations opportunities for additional training and volunteer work.

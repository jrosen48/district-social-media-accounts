Because of this, students mainly walk during recess. We have started to purchase items (jump ropes, balls, etc) that each individual child or pair can use during recess. Several individuals and businesses have asked how they can help the school this year. Here is your chance.

* Student pick up in the back of the building begins at 2:45. Again, please maintain one lane of traffic at all times, do not block any roadways, students will be released to the parents, parents will need to remain in the vehicle, diminishing the congregation of large groups of people.

I’m saddened by the news that we will not be going back to school this year. Although I knew this was coming, it is very hard to accept the fact that we will not get to say good-bye to our students! I love my students! I wish I could give them a hug, tell them how proud I am of the progress that they have made, tell them how much I will miss them next year and wish them well on their way to 4th grade! I know that this is certainly a safe and smart choice by our governor however, this situation that we are all in is so sad.

1. Governor DeWine just announced school will remain closed for the rest of the year. While this does not surprise us, we are so upset that we will not be able to finish out the year as we normally would.

2. I know you have a lot of questions as far as grades, if school will start early to make up for lost time, what about all the graduations? We will be meeting as an administration team to decide how to move forward. Once we have a plan in place, we will contact you.

3. It is very important that students make an effort on the packets that have been sent home. This will be our only way of getting grades for the last 9 weeks. All we ask is that an effort is made. If your students need extra help with completing the packets, please contact their teacher.

Families, if you need anything at all, please let us know.

Thank you for your patience and understanding as we have tried to get student work to our students.

Unfortunately we are in a situation that no one asked for. We didn't ask for a virus to come causing the government to shut down school and we know you all didn't ask to be placed in the role of being a teacher. 🙂

We are required by the state to provide work to our students. We tried to make the work as simple as possible, with no new work, only review. All we ask is that students try their best to complete the work.

If you have any questions about the work, please contact your child's teacher. All of our grade levels have Facebook pages, and their email addresses were included in the packets. If you need another way to contact the teacher, please comment below and we will make sure they reach out to you.

Each year when prom season rolls around our juniors and seniors spend a great deal of time preparing for their prom, a landmark event in their life. With the hope of providing them with a memorable experience, many selfless hours are spent behind the scenes in preparation. First and foremost, WR would like to extend their appreciation to Daniel Stober of Danielion ideals that BLOOM for the beautiful arrangements and the selfless time he spent helping with Grand March. In addition, we would like to show some appreciation for Mrs. Jenn Nolan and Mrs. Summer Warzinik for planning the prom, Mrs. Sarah Beck for arranging a Prom Promise assembly, various staff for chaperoning the event, our custodial staff for making it all possible and our students for staying safe throughout the weekend.

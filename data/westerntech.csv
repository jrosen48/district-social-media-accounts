Motivation:
My future and my family motivates me because I want to make my family proud and I also want to have a good and successful life.

Strategy for success:
Note-taking is a strategy that has helped me succeed in school. I use the notes that I take in class to review, prepare for test, and it gives me extra practice.

College/Career Plans:
After high school, I plan on attending college with scholarships and grants that I have earned.

Mountain Park's Diversity Site Councils bridge organizations
and individuals to support each other’s missions and empower
our community. For the last nine years, summit attendees made
time for human connection and challenged the ordinary
through the day of storytelling. The annual summit reminds us
that our collective work truly does matter and inspires us to
continue building for today and tomorrow.

Since we are forgoing the traditional in person gathering to
keep everyone safe and healthy during the pandemic, we hope
this virtual storytelling will further cultivate a sense of belonging
and build upon the bridges between us to better support our
community.

WSST plans to move forward with a start date of August 3rd, not August 17th, with full online learning. There are multiple reasons to make this decision. First, we must always prioritize student learning, and the sooner students are back in classrooms, even virtually, the sooner we can continue teaching and learning. Second, our community relies upon our services -meals, counseling, social work, and more. Third, the Governor’s orders did not waiver the 200-day requirement, and so WSST students would need to make up those days at the end of the 20-21 school year. We remain committed to providing students the needed preparation for the academic rigors of college graduation leading to career success. We also remain committed to the safety of our staff, students, and families.

A survey was sent out via Remind today. We would like to gauge your readiness to return to campus after August 17th given this information. Please complete this survey by Friday, July 10th.

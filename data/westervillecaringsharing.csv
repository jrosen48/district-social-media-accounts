Welcome back to Wildlife Wednesday from your Ohio Division of Wildlife as we spotlight the American Goldfinch.

The summer male goldfinch is another of the brilliantly colored birds - a bright canary yellow, with a black cap, wings, and tail, and white rump. The female is a pale yellow with black wings and white wing bars. Winter birds are a tan to olive shade, but retain the black wings and white wing bars. The flight pattern is another good identification aid - undulating like the woodpeckers.

Goldfinches are among the latest of our nesting birds, waiting until the thistle seeds mature. The nest is a well-made cup of grass and bark strips, with the main ingredient being thistle and seed down. It is placed in an upright fork of a sapling and will hold four to five pale blue eggs. Peak breeding is in June and July, and incubation lasts 12-14 days.

It's time for another Wildlife Wednesday from your Ohio Division of Wildlife. Today we feature the Southern Flying Squirrel - the most common squirrel in Ohio. Because they are nocturnal and seldom seen, most people don't recognize that they live with flying squirrels.

Flying squirrels are easily distinguished by a “gliding membrane,” which is a flap of loose skin that extends from wrist to ankle. When outstretched, this skin allows the squirrel to glide from tree to tree. The fur is an olive-brown color on the upperparts and white on the underparts.

For more info on this species, please go to https://ohiodnr.gov/wps/portal/gov/odnr/discover-and-learn/animals/mammals/southern-flying-squirrel.",0.0,"Did you know the most common squirrel in Ohio is the southern flying squirrel?

In the process of self-discovery, you will meet internal and external opposition that will challenge your faith and your resolve. You might receive a fatal diagnosis, or something may happen to someone you care about.
Or you may literally have your life as you know it snatched out from under you.  In some cases, family members and friends will turn against you, and you will begin to doubt yourself.
However, I can tell you based upon my own experience that, in spite of those things, you have something special.
You have greatness in you. You are greater than your circumstances, or anything that you have ever experienced or are facing right now.

Welcome back to another Wildlife Wednesday from your Ohio Division of Wildlife. Today we spotlight the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail which is the most common swallowtail butterfly in Ohio. They love to siphon mineral salts from mud puddles forming “puddle clubs.” Like most swallowtails they are very strong fliers. Their wingspan is 3.5 inches to 5.5 inches.

Host plants for these butterflies are a variety of woody plants, including sassafrass, spicebush, various ash, tulip tree, and black cherry. Ohio Department of Education",0.0,"Eastern Tiger Swallowtail Butterfly

Today's Wildlife Wednesday from your Ohio Division of Wildlife spotlights the popular Bluegill. These fish are a popular target for anglers and are common throughout Ohio but they prefer clear ponds and lakes with rooted vegetation. Bluegill typically build nests in large groups, or beds. Males select an area and sweep out a saucer shaped nest with their tails. The females then lay between 10,000 to 60,000 eggs in the nest which are guarded by the male. The eggs usually hatch in about five days. And how do you fillet your catch of the day? Here is a helpful video on how to do so! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akz5Byv0f6o&list=PLDq4oeheMIrf6DWdsJ-xuZwLIof2WPRji&index=6",0.0,"Spotlight on the bluegill fish 🐟

Westerville’s very first post office was not a building but a box! Originally made to hold candles, it has a slot carved into the back to drop letters in. The postmaster had the key to open the box when people came to pick up and pay for their mail.

Three times a week, local stagecoach owner George Stoner delivered the mail to this post office box. The box sat in Jacob B. Connelly’s store on the corner of State St. and W. College Ave., where Graeter’s Ice Cream now stands.

This extraordinary looking bird is what inspired legendary ornithologist Alexander Wilson to take up the study of birds. This woodpecker favors open woodlands and savannas, especially those that have plenty of oaks, as they are fond of acorns. Typical calls are loud, rough kweer or kwrrr notes, but they give a variety of chattering calls, especially when in family units, which remain together into winter.

Who loves Zucchini!?

Zucchini is such a versatile vegetable, which makes it a great vegetable to stock up on weekly and gives you so much freedom to play with different textures, flavors, and uses!

Zucchini is packed with fiber, vitamins and minerals, which of course makes another great reason to add them to your meals.

Zucchinis have been shown to contribute to a healthy gut and optimal digestion. Their fiber content is comprised of both soluble and insoluble fiber, where the insoluble fiber specifically helps with GI transit.

👩‍🍳 How To Use Zucchini 👩‍🍳
Zucchini can be used raw, roasted, steamed, grated and spiralized in various recipes. You can also use it in baked goods and for grain free “noodles.”

Zucchini can even be made into sushi, hummus, dips, dressings and sauces. It can easily be puree to add bulk or a thick texture without using cream.

You can even use zucchini in place of banana in smoothies to add in more greens and keep the creamy texture!

They’re truly so versatile!

It's Wildlife Wednesday from your Ohio Division of Wildlife! Today's spotlight is the American Kestrel. Formerly known as the “sparrow hawk,” this raptor is the smallest North American falcon and not much bigger than a blue jay.

Because it prefers to hunt open fields, the kestrel population in Ohio grew as the state’s forests were cleared for agricultural uses. Today, it is common to see kestrels almost anywhere in Ohio, hovering and hunting for prey in the grass median between many of the state’s major highways.#WildOhio",0.0,"Ohio Department of Natural Resources

Rix has been a fixture in the Westfield school system since 1996, working in a variety of administrative roles. His career includes six years as a science and health teacher in Agawam from 1980-86; three years with the Connecticut educational system; and seven years in New York as a director of programming and director of training under contract with the U.S. Department of Education and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Retirement, Rix said, is bittersweet, and Superintendent of Schools Stefan Czaporowski, as well as School Committee and City Council members, had high praise for him and his accomplishments as an educator and as a human being.
“Ron has been invaluable,” Czaporowksi said. “He’s been more than a pleasure to work with. I will miss his advice, insight and sense of humor.”

EEE (Eastern equine encephalitis) is a rare but serious disease that is generally spread to people through the bite of an infected mosquito. EEE can cause severe illness and possibly lead to death in any age group; however, people under age 15 are at particular risk.

To reduce the chance of becoming infected, the Department of Public Health (DPH) recommends always applying an EPA-approved mosquito repellent to children before they go outside.

Now he’s retiring to enjoy his beach home in Maine.

Rix has been a fixture in the Westfield school system since 1996, working in a variety of administrative roles. His career includes six years as a science and health teacher in Agawam from 1980-86; three years with the Connecticut educational system; and seven years in New York as a director of programming and director of training under contract with the U.S. Department of Education and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Retirement, Rix said, is bittersweet, and Superintendent of Schools Stefan Czaporowski, as well as School Committee and City Council members, had high praise for him and his accomplishments as an educator and as a human being.
“Ron has been invaluable,” Czaporowksi said. “He’s been more than a pleasure to work with. I will miss his advice, insight and sense of humor.”

Westfield’s Ronald Rix retiring after 40 years in education",15.0,"Ronald Rix, the city school department’s chief financial officer, has spent 40 years working in education, with more than half of those years in his hometown of Westfield. Now he’s retiring to enjoy his beach home in Maine.

Rix has been a fixture in the Westfield school system since 1996, working in a variety of administrative roles. His career includes six years as a science and health teacher in Agawam from 1980-86; three years with the Connecticut educational system; and seven years in New York as a director of programming and director of training under contract with the U.S. Department of Education and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Retirement, Rix said, is bittersweet, and Superintendent of Schools Stefan Czaporowski, as well as School Committee and City Council members, had high praise for him and his accomplishments as an educator and as a human being.
“Ron has been invaluable,” Czaporowksi said. “He’s been more than a pleasure to work with. I will miss his advice, insight and sense of humor.”

Congratulations Mr. RIx!

Proposals that affect our school district are as follows:
1. Modifying the MCAS by permitting the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education upon recommendation of the Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education to modify or waive the required competency determination for high school graduation. The Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education would also be allowed to modify or waive the MCAS testing requirement.

2. Extending a Student Opportunity Act deadline by permitting the Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education to extend the April 1, 2020 deadline for each district to submit its first 3-year plan to address “persistent disparities in achievement among student subgroups.”

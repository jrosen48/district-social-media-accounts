The Technology Access Survey can be found at the link below. Responses from this survey will help the Iowa Department of Ed prioritize $26.2 million in federal relief through the Governor’s Emergency Education Relief (GEER), which focuses on providing and expanding broadband access and improving access to technology in other ways. The survey is open until June 24. The survey is very short and your input is extremely important. ONLY FILL THIS OUT ONCE, PER FAMILY!

We just received word from the Governor and HCPH that we can continue with a graduation ceremony! It will look different, but will be ONE CEREMONY with EVERYONE!

More information will be sent out soon with more guidelines, but here is what we know:
1. It will be held June 21 at 6 PM. It will take place outside at the football field.
2. We will follow social distancing guidelines, similar to that of our ball games.
3. There will be a reception line, just no hugs or handshakes.
4. Seniors will choose a special person in their life to sit with during the ceremony. This person will present the graduate with their diploma.

Seniors:
* Mrs. Birdsall will send a survey to vote for attendants/ushers. VOTE!
* We need to practice! We will meet FRIDAY, June 19 at 8 - 9:30 am. Breakfast will be provided. Look for a Calendar invite and plan to be there.
* You will need to be in the Commons for robe fitting and preparation on June 21 at 5 pm

Please share this information with seniors and their families to ensure that everyone is informed!

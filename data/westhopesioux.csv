Lots of changes have occurred to schedules this season! Be sure to download the Activity Scheduler App to be kept up to date on all of your Sioux Athletics. The ""rST"" photo of a baseball cap is the app you want to use.

Steps for finding Westhope Public School on the app:

1. Once in the app, click ""Set Up"" at the bottom.
2. Scroll through the states until you find North Dakota.
3. Scroll through the conferences until you find the ""North Dakota"" list for conferences. There are 6 schools, and we are the bottom one.
4. Click on Westhope.

DO NOT use the Conference ""Westhope-Newburg Sioux"" as that isn't linked to the site we currently use.

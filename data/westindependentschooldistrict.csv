With the first day of school coming soon, it’s time to remind all Trojans & Lady Trojans about the importance of social distancing (6 feet) when in classrooms, shared spaces, labs, hallways, and other learning areas.

Now is a good time to talk about how COVID-19 spreads mainly among individuals who are in close contact (within about 6 feet) for a prolonged period. Spread happens when an infected individual coughs, sneezes, or talks, and droplets from their mouth or nose are launched into the air and land in the mouths or noses of people nearby. The droplets can also be inhaled into the lungs.

West ISD has worked hard to reduce the number of students in each classroom through the master schedule, course offerings, removing furniture, purchasing desk shields, relocating some classes to larger spaces, and offering outdoor learning spaces. All students must remember to always wear a face mask and social distance.

Is it safe to drink from a water fountain during the pandemic? Yes, if you follow West ISD’s Safety Tip #5! With the first day of school coming soon, it’s time to remind all Trojans & Lady Trojans about the advantages of using the water bottle fillers over the water fountains. Though public drinking water supplies are safe to drink, the surfaces around the fountain including the spout, button/leaver and nozzles could pose a risk for the transmission of COVID-19 and other germs. With this news, all West ISD campuses now have water bottle fillers. Yahoo!

Now is a good time to talk about which water bottle you plan to bring to school. There will be time in the day to fill up your favorite bottle (without touching the spout) in order to have water during breaks from learning.

With the first day of school coming soon, it’s time to remind all Trojans & Lady Trojans about the advantages of washing their hands or using hand sanitizer whenever possible.

Now is a good time to talk about how germs are everywhere. Germs can get onto hands and items we touch during daily activities and make us sick. Cleaning hands at key times with soap and water or hand sanitizer is one of the most important steps our students can take to avoid getting sick and spreading germs to those around our buses, classrooms, and schools.

Here are a few reminders when using hand sanitizer: (1) Put enough sanitizer on your hands to cover all surfaces, (2) Rub your hands together until they feel dry (this should take around 20 seconds), and (3) Do NOT rinse or wipe off the hand sanitizer before it is dry; it may not work well against germs.

Also, please consider wearing the face masks for short and long periods of time over the next week as practice for the start of school. Finally, the style and comfort of the face mask and how the straps adjust around the ears all need to be considered before Tuesday, September 8, 2020.

The key for this event is to be appropriately distanced along the route - either in your vehicle, by your vehicle, on your vehicle, on the sidewalks, in parking spaces, or from your home/business.

TSA just released the scores for TEAMS (Tests of Engineering Aptitude, Mathematics and Science) state rankings. West placed 15th in multiple choice, 5th in essay and 1st in Design and Build. This led to a 3rd place finish in the state for West High School (1st place was McKinney HS and 2nd place was The Hockaday School).

The team consisted of Colton Meurer, Madison Nichols, Rachel Coffer, Taylor Mynar, Hailey Routson, Kaylin Gerik, Jesse Corvin, and Alec Roessler. We are so proud of our students!

West ISD TSA
March 31 at 8:08 PM ·

TSA just released the scores for TEAMS (Tests of Engineering Aptitude, Mathematics and Science) state rankings. West placed 15th in multiple choice, 5th in essay and 1st in Design and Build. This led to a 3rd place finish in the state for West High School (1st place was McKinney HS and 2nd place was The Hockaday School).

The team consisted of Colton Meurer, Madison Nichols, Rachel Coffer, Taylor Mynar, Hailey Routson, Kaylin Gerik, Jesse Corvin, and Alec Roessler. We are so proud of our students!

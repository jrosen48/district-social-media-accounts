Even though the quarantine curtailed the group’s plans to tie dye socks, TJHS Best Buddies Club encouraged our WJHSD Family to wear their favorite colorful, fun and even mismatched socks to celebrate all of our students’ differences and abilities!

World Down Syndrome Day, March 21, is a global awareness day and is celebrated on 3-21 because it symbolizes a third copy of the 21st chromosome in people with Down syndrome. Communities all over the world were celebrating by “rockin their socks” for the acceptance and inclusion of people who have Down syndrome and rock an extra chromosome.

To gain conceptual understanding of fractions, 4th graders folded paper strips to compare the fractional parts of 10 different denominators.

They applied their learning in different contexts like partitioning a newspaper into fractional parts, playing fraction games and ordering written fractions.

Inquiring about things that ignited their curiosity led to discoveries of patterns and relationships between fractions! Students developed and shared strategies for ordering fractions.

Do you need an extra mask for your child? Donated masks range in size from very small (for our preK kids) to adult size (for our high schoolers). We've got some really cool patterns to choose from as well.
You can pick them up at the West Liberty Food Pantry (You don't need to be a food pantry client to pick up some of the donated masks)

This will be an ongoing process. As long as we are getting donations, we will be sharing them through the food pantry.",3.0,"If you need masks for your children you can pick them up on Thursdays and Saturdays at First Church United!

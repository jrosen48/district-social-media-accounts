The shelter in place at WMHS has been lifted. The joint WMHS-WMPD investigation has been completed and the rumor of a weapon in the school has been declared as unfounded. All children are safe and in their classes. I would like to take a moment to thank the WMPD for their effort and professionalism today. Their assistance allowed the issue to be resolved in a timely manner.

Lastly please take a moment to speak to your children about the deleterious effects of social media and the spreading of rumors. As always, if they see or hear something, they should tell a trusted adult such as a parent, teacher, or law enforcement officer.

Best,

To celebrate National Mentor Month, BPN is shining a spotlight on our wonderful M&T Bank employee mentors in our BPN Mentor Program. The program, which runs in partnership with BBBS of Erie County, pairs the M&T employee with a student from either Highgate Heights or Westminster Community Charter School. One of our most recent matches is especially close to BPN‚Äôs heart, because it involves our own Janelle Franasiak. Janelle is the Volunteer Engagement Specialist for BPN, and Angel is a 2nd grader at Westminster Community Charter School. Recently, the pair created a canvas using melted crayons. The canvas highlights both of their love of math, using mathematical symbols focused around the number 7, Angel‚Äôs age. Angel made sure to choose all of her favorite colors for the art piece! Angel and Janelle are a perfect pair ‚Äì quizzing each other on math questions every time they are together! Congratulations to both of you on your wonderful artwork!",0.0,"Buffalo Promise Neighborhood

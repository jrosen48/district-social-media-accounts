As we prepare to return to school in the fall, numerous factors are being considered in the planning process. While we are trying to anticipate what will and will not be allowed based on guidelines from government and health care officials, we are asking for your input on the following survey.

¬∑ English - http://mywps.org/returntoschoolsurvey
¬∑ Spanish - http://mywps.org/returntoschoolsurveysp
¬∑ Vietnamese - http://mywps.org/returntoschoolsurveyviet

School in the fall, under any circumstances, will not be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù but we will do our best to weigh the input we receive, including factors that arise over the coming months.

Hot Spots needed!

The WPS Foundation is looking for donations of Hot Spot devices. If you have one that you are no longer using and it is in working order, please contact me! The Foundation will cover the monthly charges.

They will be used to support Westy students with at home learning. There is a national shortage right now and we need to ensure every student has access to the internet.

Please help spread the word!",2020-03-26 17:42:50,,

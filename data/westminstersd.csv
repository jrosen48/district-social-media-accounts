The students took notes about what makes WAGS special and why the Westminster City Council should chose us for the Animal Care Services vendor!

First, students were taken on a guided tour of the campus, which provided a wonderful opportunity for students to see the university and learn about various programs and some history of the school.

Next, students visited the Working Memory and Plasticity Laboratory where they learned about working memory and how it is an essential system that underlies the performance of virtually all complex cognitive activities.

Last, they toured the UCI Applied Innovation Center. This center brings campus-based inventions and entrepreneurship together with Orange County's vibrant business community to support job creation and economic growth.

Johnson Middle School proudly hosted the first annual Special Olympics for our local elementary schools today. Students played soccer, hockey, bowling and bocce ball.

A very special shout out to Mrs. Marjorie Schubert , Mr. Jason Carey and Mr. Todd Canavan for organizing such fun games, activities and lunch for over 100 elementary students from our local elementary schools.

We had volunteers from administration, adaptive P.E., Down for Dance, speech pathology, psychologists, leadership, cheer and JMS students to help bring everything together for our student athletes.
Mr. Coatney’s class made 3D mini trophies for each class to take home and Mr. Schammann’s class came out to fly drones overhead to make it extra special.

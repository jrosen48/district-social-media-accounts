If you haven't heard, Governor DeWine is issuing an order which will require all students to wear a mask while at school.

The district's reopening plan was released last Wednesday and can be found on the district website at www.westmschools.org. We ask that you take the short survey on the final page in order for us to make plans for the 2020-21 school year. Please complete a separate survey for each school-aged child in your family by Friday, Aug. 7.
We have answered many questions through email and on Facebook, before and after the plan was released. We know that there are still questions to be answered. Waiting on Governor DeWine, the Ohio Department of Education, Ohio Department of Health, and the Ohio High School Athletic Association to give us answers has been grueling this summer and we understand your frustration, as we are constantly playing the waiting game too.
I invite you to join me in a Facebook live information session this Wednesday, Aug. 5 from 7:30 to 8:30 p.m., to answer any questions you may have so I can to help you make an informed decision.

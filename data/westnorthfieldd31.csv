Teachers and staff completed a needs assessment, identified data to be reviewed during the audit, and determined focus group questions.

The District is partnering with the DuPage Regional Office of Education to conduct a five-phase, year-long process that identifies specific equity needs through a quantitative and qualitative process.

In the fall, 30+ focus groups on equity will occur with students, staff, and parents.

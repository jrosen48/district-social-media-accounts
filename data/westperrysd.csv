This is to honor the graduating class of 2020, healthcare workers, first responders, and all who are on the front line fighting the COVID-19 Pandemic. The lights will be turned on for 20 minutes at 8:20pm (20:20 military time) and the scoreboard will read a score of 20-20 with a down and distance of 4th and 19 to signify that we will overcome COVID-19.

Our hope is to provide a drive-thru opportunity to our seniors, families, and community members to give them a few minutes of light and hope that these tough times are almost over. Families who do happen to drive by the stadium are reminded that this is intended to be a drive-thru and should not get out of their vehicles.

Please enter the campus between the HS and MS and exit near the baseball field. Pictures of the stadium will also be shared on soci meal media and the West Perry School District website.

Thank you for your support and understanding during this uncertain time!

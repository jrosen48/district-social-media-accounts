For the Royals' parade in 2015 when they won the World Series, our student attendance was at, or above, 70%. Assuming a similar number in 2020 would suggest a number of our families may lack the work flexibility, child-care availability, or the interest to attend. That, in turn, would suggest we should be in school.

Of course, there will be several families who opt to attend the parade, and will want their kids with them. Have fun! All we ask, the same for any absence, is that we receive parental verification so the absence can be excused.

As you can imagine, this was a very difficult but yet thoughtful process. This year, likely more than others, the need was so great. As the school year progresses, we will be monitoring program numbers and may be able to increase. For now, and due to health and safety requirements, as well as the many restrictions put into place, we have filled all available slots. If you are in need of care, and require additional assistance, please contact me at jchaves@westportschools.org. I truly thank you all for you patience and understanding at this time.

As you know, Friday night's activities got postponed because of the wind storm and it was rescheduled to last night. The night went wonderfully and it was humbling to a part of it. We are pleased to announce that we have raised over $3,600 dollars for the 100 Club of Massachusetts and the families of fallen police and firefighters in the Commonwealth. A night like last night and the week leading up to it shows how special our school and community is and will be. We cannot thank all of you enough, we are truly grateful and humbled by your caring and generosity.

A special thank you to Mr. Chris Nunes and the band for an award winning performance as always!

Thank you all!
Mike Ponte and Jen Gargiulo",2020-02-12 08:33:56,,

It is that time of year again for WJSHS's Ambassadors for Autism and All Abilities. With the support of our district community last year, we raised over $730.00 to Sophie's Promise , a local charity that benefits children, schools and families in our area.

Attached is the picture/form of the shirt we will be ordering. The sleeve will say Westport Community Schools 2020. It promotes ACCEPTANCE of all abilities and inclusiveness.
All shirts are only $10.00. Which will include a donation to an Autism charity. We will be wearing them on Fridays in April, Autism Awareness month. Shirts are pre-shrunk cotton. Those who bought our shirt the previous years can wear them if you are not interested in a shirt this year, or just wear blue!

If interested, please fill out the form below and return it with $10.00 to Dianne Pereira at WJSHS, Lori Melo at WES or Judy Oliveira at MAC by Friday, February 14th.

Be on the lookout for our additional fundraising efforts in April!

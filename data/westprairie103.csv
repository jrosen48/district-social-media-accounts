Have a routine! Do things the same way each day and at the same time. It does wonders for everyone!

Spend time each night after the kids are in bed (or each weekend) preparing their activities for the next day. Our girls have a hand written checklist in their notebook each day from me that helps them stay focused on what they need to do next. They love checking off things they finished and then can see how much is left to do.

We have a small plastic snack box for each child for the DAY. They pick 2 snacks for the day (1 has to be healthy), place them in the box along with their cup or water bottle. That helps with less dishes for the day and prevents them grazing all day long.

I tell my kids no electronics (except what they need for their schoolwork) during what would be the school day 8-3, just like if they were in school. If they get work done, they find other non - electronic things to do. It's a struggle some days, and sometimes there's a lot of pouting and arguing about it, but we stick to it.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1014806945622512&id=374492096320670,,0.0,"Parent to Parent tips for Remote Learning!

Be calm and patient with your children, they are struggling too and this is new for everyone! If you see they are struggling or upset, give them a 15 minute break to regroup, before trying again!

Stay with a schedule in the home. If you are struggling with an assignment, walk away for a bit and come back to it.

Don't give the entire day's work at one time. Don't expect younger children to sit and complete all work at once.

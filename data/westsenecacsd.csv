We said back in January that this year was going to be our #yearofgiving and we want to live up to our promise now more than ever. We never want to lose sight of who are and what we love doing, especially during hard times like these. So, we are VERY excited to be donating 600 assorted coloring books and activity books to West Seneca Central School District! The books are being delivered to the students with their free breakfast and lunches and we cannot wait for everyone to receive them! We hope the students enjoy the books and that they provide some fun activity time! Thanks in part to our friends at Dover Publications who helped make this possible.

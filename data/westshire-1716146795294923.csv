Are you a Star Wars fan? Who is your favorite character? What is your favorite movie?

For this week's activity, I'd like you to listen to some of the beautiful music that composer John Williams has given us. Not only did John Williams write the music for the Star Wars films, but he has a long list of blockbuster hits that span decades.

Let's play a game! Ask an adult or older sibling to get these videos ready for you. See if you can guess what movie each piece of music comes from. All of these songs were written by John Williams. Try a couple, try them all!

THUMBS CHECK IN:
Hello followers out there! Being a new Westshire blogger this late in the year, and with the remote learning,

I'm going to share my check in and for the day which will be THUMBS. Give your thumbs sign that represents how you are feeling....

Today I am THUMBS UP!!! The day started out right, the sun was shining and I had a great talk on Zoom which motivated me more and overall just made me feel good.
Yesterday I was a THUMBS DOWN, most of the day. It was rainy and I've been emotional but it's okay to have those days. I was able to reach out to some close people in my life and ask for some support and they did a great job making me laugh and just being awesome.

I hope you are all doing well. I'll be back soon!

Families, I will be transitioning to using Seesaw rather than this blog as we move forward. On Seesaw I can send out announcements to parents, students, or both. We can also share photos by having your child post them and then we can share them to the Seesaw blog. For now, if you prefer to send me your photos, I will keep posting them here under the choice board tab. My hope is that you and your child will play around with Seesaw and become comfortable sharing things on your own. I will be assigning math and Fundations to your children on Seesaw as well starting today! Please don't stress if you don't get this all figured out on day one. Feel free to contact me with any and all questions you have as we navigate this new territory together.

Hello Artists!

I hope you all have been able to get outside and enjoy the fresh air and MUD! I know I have. As I was taking a walk the other day, I was captivated by the oozy muddy tire tracks I was walking on and decided to turn it into a piece of art! I really loved the geometric shapes and patterns I saw. I really did not have a plan to make this drawing this way but I just let my imagination take control of my pencils! The repeated shapes reminded me of the artist, Piet Mondrian.

I call this piece, ""The Muddy Mondrian"". I began with a pencil and then used watercolor to fill it in.

P.E. with Joe
Hi Everyone!
A BIG shout out to Mrs. Duvall for sharing with me an excellent resource for in home physical activity! In turn, I would like to share it with all of you. Joe Wicks, also known as, “The Body Coach” is creating daily 30 minute PE workouts. I have tried out a couple myself and I love them! He is energetic, fun, and the workouts use minimal equipment. He posts the workouts to his YouTube channel, The Body Coach TV and the PE workouts are listed under P.E. With Joe.

My favorite so far is Wednesday’s workout - Be careful during his Spiderman Moves segment- I may have accidentally knocked down a picture frame in my living room trying the wall jump move...WHOOPS!

P.E. with Joe
Hi Everyone!
A BIG shout out to Mrs. Duvall for sharing with me an excellent resource for in home physical activity! In turn, I would like to share it with all of you. Joe Wicks, also known as, “The Body Coach” is creating daily 30 minute PE workouts. I have tried out a couple myself and I love them! He is energetic, fun, and the workouts use minimal equipment. He posts the workouts to his YouTube channel, The Body Coach TV and the PE workouts are listed under P.E. With Joe.

My favorite so far is Wednesday’s workout - Be careful during his Spiderman Moves segment- I may have accidentally knocked down a picture frame in my living room trying the wall jump move...WHOOPS!

I hope everyone is happy and well! I miss you all!

Sincerely,

Mrs. Claflin

Hello First Graders!
Today is Tuesday. I got at least 7 inches of snow where I live. What about you? Today, if you can, try to get outside and enjoy the snow. You never know when spring might stay for good!
Love, Miss Lloyd
P.S. Bella says she'll play in the snow later. Right now she's warm and cozy in bed!

Today I wanted to share GoNoodle with you. From what I heard from your children, some of you already do GoNoodle at home! We do GoNoodles at school as a class every now and then. They're a fun way to get up and moving and be silly together!

Also, I'm working on what remote learning at home will look like if this extends beyond April 6. I would love your feedback on what's working right now, what isn't working, and what you would like for your first grader moving forward. The materials you have should get you to April 6 and I will continue to share any extras I can. Feel free to comment or email me with your feedback!

Stay well-Miss Lloyd

BEST TIME TO REACH OUT TO WESTSHIRE TEACHERS IS 8:00 AM-10:00 AM
WES teachers and staff realize that the amount of work and supplies that are being provided to each student may seem overwhelming at first. It is important to keep in mind that the work is designed to be accomplished over 2 ½ weeks. Students should take their time.
Please carefully read ALL expectations and instructions from your teacher before your child begins ANY work.
Remember, you can ask the teacher questions. Contact the teacher by email anytime. You can count on getting a reply on weekdays between 8-10 am.

Tips for working successfully at home
* Set up a quiet, clean place to do your work.
* Have a routine where you do your work at the same time, in the same place each day.
* Ask for help (email your teacher).

I just wanted to let you know that the teachers and staff have been working very hard today to put together materials and plans for your children to use at home. We will be providing details throughout the week and arranging pick up (or drop off) of the materials.

Expect to get a phone call from a teacher or staff member tomorrow. We are gathering information on your internet access, so that we know what materials will be most useful.

During Coding Activities students use a mix of online resources and ""unplugged"" lessons, as well as little robots, Blue Bots, iPads, and Chromebook. Many of the online experiences are self-guided and self-paced tutorials and provide programming instructions and practice.
In the process students will develop skills such as critical thinking, logic, persistence, creativity as well as problem-solving skills.

We believe that every student should have the opportunity to learn computer science.

Students recommend Kodable, Daisy the Dinosaur, Dance Party, Minecraft, Angry Birds, Code with Anna and Elsa, PlayLab, Make Music with Scratch, Tynker Programming, SCRATCH Get creative with coding.

The mission of the program is to foster a love of reading and language.

Everybody Wins! increases children’s prospects for success and engages a diverse range of volunteers in our school.

Our visit was all about recycled art from different cultural groups. We studied a sculpture made by a Native American artist. It reminded us of a giraffe. We noticed some parts were recycled, other parts were new. Another piece of art was made from motherboards from electronic devices. The piece was impressive in its size and composition.
For our pre-visit lesson we saw a video of this artist, El Anatsui from Nigeria, Africa. We saw how he worked with many others to make this art from bottle caps. Back at the studio we enjoyed making art out of recycled materials.

Good evening,

There will be a two-hour delayed opening for all Rivendell schools on Tuesday, 1/22/19.

Due to the extreme cold, we are concerned about buses not starting and leaving students in the cold waiting for a late bus. By delaying, we will have more buses on reserve to transport students, even if a bus doesn't start or stay running.

There will be no school today (March 13, 2018) in Rivendell due to the storm. It looks like the rate of snow is predicted to pick up by mid-day, which would make dismissal difficult, so we're not able to get a partial day in today. Again, no school and no activities in Rivendell today. Please be safe.

To celebrate the start of the Olympic Games, second graders had their own Snow Bot Olympics. Working in groups, they had to program their Snow Bots to compete in three events: slalom, giant slalom and snow cross. These Olympic Games challenged the second graders by asking them to accurately measure how many forward commands were needed before programming the Bots to maneuver around cones and to make turns.

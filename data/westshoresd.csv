Additional resources will be made easily accessible to AP students and teachers through mobile phones and other devices. These include free online AP lessons and review sessions from some of the top AP teachers in the country.

The AP program is finalizing streamlined AP exam options that would allow students to test at home, depending on the situation in May.

We received more than 560 responses to our calendar survey this year. After careful review of the comments, concerns, and questions received, one change to the proposed calendar was made; November 30, will be a non-school day, and in exchange, April 1, will be a student day.

This afternoon, families and staff were emailed additional information regarding this change, answers to frequently asked questions, and a copy of the complete calendar. This information can also be found on our website.

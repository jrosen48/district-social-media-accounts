These Warriors just graduated from Westside High School, and will leave home this week to begin their next chapter. From Mom, Jane Hanigan-Kinney: ""Total denial that our kids' years as Westside Warriors is a chapter now closed.
It was a ride better than any of us could ever possibly imagined (thank you, Westside!) -- and one that we, as their parents, are sad to see them leave behind. But, we couldn't be more excited to see what they each accomplish in the next chapter!""

Help us honor the Class of 2020! #WeAreWestside

Congratulations to Jeff Schulz! Jeff went to Swanson Elementary and will be attending the University of Nebraska at Omaha in the fall to major in Civil Engineering. Fun fact about Jeff and the Class of 2020: their 9th grade/HS orientation was cancelled due to snow when they were 8th graders. It was never rescheduled and they survived without it. Warriors from the beginning!

We have now been forced to hire a uniformed security guard to help monitor activity at our WHS athletic facilities.

Again, we want people to be able to come up and walk and exercise in a safe, social distancing manner. We appreciate the way our students and patrons are using the facilities. We need visitors to do the right thing as well.

The uniformed security guard is prepared to issue citations to those that want to play 7 on 7 football games, soccer matches, etc. that are NOT safe during current social distancing guidelines.

Acceptable - small groups of folks working on drills, jogging/walking, playing frisbee, etc. in a spaced out manner.

UNacceptable - touch football games, soccer matches, and large group gatherings of any sort.",2.0,"Mike Lucas

Westside’s annual Battle of the Books competition, sponsored by the Westside Community Council, was scheduled to take place on Saturday, March 21. We were expecting 58 teams and almost 250 kids to participate this year!

Although we were disappointed to have to cancel the event, we were able to use the competition questions that were already created to set up 8 rounds of Battle of the Books from home! The teams have been meeting virtually to answer battle questions in Kahoot! quizzes. Kahoot! is a game-based learning app. So far, approximately 40 teams have competed in each of three rounds, and we have five more rounds scheduled through the end of the month.

Congratulations to all the teams on their hard work this year preparing for the Battle. And THANK YOU to the hardworking volunteers who made this possible: Jackie Anderson, Mary Schafer, and Ashley Wegner",0.0,"Westside Community Schools - District 66 added 9 new photos.

Congratulations to Jake Kroeger! Jake went to Swanson Elementary School and is headed to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where he will major in Music Education and plans to continue composing music. Favorite Westside memories: Jake had a great experience in Show Choir, with two years on ATSC and two on Warrior Express. He also took the unusual step of being in Marching Band for the first time as a senior, which was also a very positive experience with great kids. Mr. Johnson and Mr. Krueger were both strong influences for Jake.

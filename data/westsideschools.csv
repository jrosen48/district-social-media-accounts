Good Morning Leona Valley Families,

As many of you have heard on the news, strong Santa Ana winds are expected again in Southern California.

We have been notified that Leona Valley School is located in an area that may be subject to a power outage. At this time, we do not know when or if that may happen. School will open and we are hopeful to maintain our regular school day. However, if a power outage is called, we will need to send students home.

The power outage may also impact the homes in the area surrounding the school, so if you haven’t done so, you may want to take time to prepare.

Thank you for understanding this situation. I am hopeful to see your child in school today. If you have other questions, please feel free to call us.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2624218390974798&id=299344310128896,,0.0,"MESSAGE FOR LEONA VALLEY FAMILIES:

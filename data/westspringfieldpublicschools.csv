Meghan writes, ""Our mission is to reduce food waste and alleviate hunger in Western Massachusetts. This spring, we are having our bi-annual Outrun Hunger 5K. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it has become a virtual 5k event including an individual walk/step challenge. We are raising money for area food banks, soup kitchens, and food pantries, which is especially important during these unprecedented times. We are trying to get this message out to as many people as possible to raise awareness of this widespread issue.""

✨Happy Thursday, Coburn Family! ✨

Weekly on Thursdays we focus on 👉GRATITUDE👈. We can use lots of words to describe feelings of gratitude: We might say we feel thankful, lucky, fortunate, humbled, or blessed. Somedays are easier than others to focus on gratitude but there are benefits to it.

👍Gratitude doesn't just feel good.
Making a habit of gratitude can also be good for us. Like other positive emotions, feeling grateful on a regular basis can have a big effect on our lives. Brain research shows that positive emotions are good for our bodies🦵, minds💭, and brains🧠.

💙 Positive emotions open us up to more possibilities.
They boost our ability to learn and make good decisions.

On Mondays we like to focus on mindfulness and coping skills. If you are feeling stuck inside on this raining day and need a break...try this trick!

Below I have included one of my favorite grounding exercises - 5,4,3,2,1. It is a little game I like to use with students when they need a break or to manage some feelings of anxiousness. We use each of our senses to re-center. Often we can regroup and get back to what we were doing right after!

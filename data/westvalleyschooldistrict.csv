Seth student Rylee was recently awarded with the PACE Award! This is what Rylee's teacher has to say about Rylee's tremendous attributes!

The maturity and compassion that Rylee shows her classmates have had such an enormously positive impact on our learning environment! She participates in such a way that shows that it's okay to make mistakes and to be honest when we need help. She encourages others to participate and to be willing to share their mistakes, learning, and achievements. She encourages others to be themselves, listens to others when they need to be heard, and most importantly leads by example. She has a stronger self-assured confidence that I have seen in a 5th grade student and that kind of confidence builds people up. It has been wonderful to watch her grow and I can only imagine what she will grow up to achieve.

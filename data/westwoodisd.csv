The number one social issue we have in our society is fatherless homes. Even homes with a dad who lives there sometimes does not have an active role with their children. Studies show the average father spends 2.5 minutes per day in ‘meaningful conversation’ with their children….amazing!!

We must do what we can to help fill the void. Our coaches will be great role models, but we also get other men involved using our Breakfast with Champions program.

HOW IT WORKS..
Each mentor ‘adopts’ a player for the season.
Program is on Friday mornings at 7:30.
7:30 – highlight video from previous week
7:35 – introduce Guest speaker
7:50 – announce award winners from previous week
7:55 – talk about upcoming game

Eligible families that have children 5-18 years old and received SNAP benefits for March have already received P-EBT benefits. All other eligible families must apply to receive P-EBT benefits.

Thousands of families across Texas have applied for the Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer (P-EBT) program. However, there are still many more students that are eligible for this program. On average, only 70% of eligible families in Texas have applied for P-EBT. The deadline to apply for P-EBT is Tuesday, June 30.

We would like to recognize WHS sophomore Hannah Walters for donating her FFA show rabbits to serve as therapy pets to Truecare Living Center. 🐇🐇🐇

Since the Covid-19 Pandemic halted FFA livestock exhibitions across the nation, Hannah has prayed about what to do with her show animals. She will be introducing the rabbits to the Truecare residents, with the help of D.O.N. Wanda Lambright. She hopes they bring a little sunshine and joy each day, just as they did for her while raising them. ❤️

The future is bright for these 1st graders ☀️ They’re spun up on everything from the water cycle to severe weather to climate change & the green screen.

Congratulations to our 2019 Joann Blum Inspiration in Environmental Education Award winner: Second grade teacher, Catherine Starsiak of William Sheehan Elementary School in Westwood, Massachusetts . In 2019 Catherine inspired and helped her 2nd graders start a compost initiative by presenting to and convincing the administration to bring composting to the Westwood (MA) Public Schools during lunch. Catherine shows students that they can have a positive impact on their environment, displaying the beauty that comes from one person's commitment to nature. Catherine is helping to grow students who value the environment they live in and this will have a lasting impact on the #WestwoodMA community and beyond.

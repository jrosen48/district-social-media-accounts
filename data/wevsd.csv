🌳 Place or space: Choose activities in open places with a lot of space, like outdoors.
👪 People: Choose activities with less people, from fewer households.

From Mrs. Drake, 6/22

Good afternoon Class of 2020!

I know many of you are anxious to get your senior banner that was displayed downtown on graduation weekend. I will be in the office tonight (Monday, June 22nd) from 6 until 7 pm, and the main office will be open tomorrow (Tuesday, June 23rd) from 9 am until 1 pm if you or a family member would like to stop by to pick up your senior bag. The only item I am still waiting for is a copy of the graduation ceremony for all of you that participated in the graduation.

If you are unable to pick up your bag tonight or tomorrow, no worries, I am hoping to get enough staff members to deliver the bags either the week of June 29th or the week of July 6th.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks and take care,

As the school year closes out, so does the career of band director Toni Novotny. The former WHS graduate has led the band since 1999 and made sure they were ready for every football game, basketball game, parade, concert and competition.

The signs at the village entrances proudly display the years the WHS marching band achieved a Superior rating at the state finals. Under Novotny’s direction, the band brought home state titles in 2002, 2009, 2013, 2015 and 2016.

On behalf of the Village, we thank Toni for her dedication to her craft and her students. The band always served as excellent ambassadors of both the school district and the village. Enjoy your retirement Toni!",0.0,"Congratulations! #DukePride!

NOTE: Because of the news of a verified case of COVID-19 in Wellington, Mr. Baxendale is cancelling tomorrow’s work pick-up/drop off. He will send out new guidance on Sunday. Sorry for any inconvenience.

Good Morning McCormick Families,

Due to the conflicts that many families face preventing them from coming to school during normal hours I will be at McCormick on Saturday March 28, 2020 from 10:00am to 2:00pm. During this time I will be collecting completed work, passing out additional work you may need and allowing for pick up of essential personal items from student lockers. If you simply need to drop off completed work you can do so in the crate which will be located in the vestibule. If you have any other needs please e-mail me ASAP at nbaxendale@wellingtonvillageschools.org so I can schedule an appointment time. This process will provide adherence to the recommended social diistancing practices.

Thank you all for your continued patience and support and have a great day.

Dear Wellington School District Families,
Thank you for all your cooperation and coordination with our schools during this underrepresented past week. Given the Governor's orders today to shelter in place as much as possible, we are moving our food service program to once a week, where you can pick up 10 meals per child. This is available for all Wellington families. Our new meal pick up times will be Wednesday's from 3:00 PM until 6:00 PM. Please remain in your car and wait for our service staff to deliver curbside behind the high school. For those already planning on meal pick up tomorrow, We will be open on Monday, with breakfast service from 7:30 until 8:30 and lunch service from 11:30 until 12:30, but then it will be Wednesday's only from 3:00 PM until 6:00 PM.

Alicia Learn - Overall Female Coach of the year and winner of a $500.00 scholarship from Guthrie. She is able to give this to another athlete of her choice! This is the second time in 3 years she has received this honor! This is a huge honor getting two of the large scholarship awards in our little district. I big think you goes out to ESPN 1160 and all their sponsors. For those who do not know, this awards banquet is part a year long - weekly athletic recognition. Local booster clubs are given $50.00 for each male or female athlete of the week chosen from their respective school and athletes are given sports merchandise. What a great, thoughtful and well organized program they put on.",2019-06-10 12:55:34,,

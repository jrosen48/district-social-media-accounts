For those of you who are participating in today's Super Bowl Squares sponsored by our HS Football team, here are today's squares! Remember, there will be a winner after each quarter and at the end of the game. I'll be posting the winning numbers as we go! The last digit of each team's score at the end of the quarter will match up with the corresponding square and that will be the winner! Thanks to everyone who supported our program! Good Luck!",0.0,"Waynesfield-Goshen Sports

A storage trailer has been set up in the parking lot of the police department, where members of the community can drop off non-perishable items.

The trailer will be open next week between the hours of 9am-3pm for Wharton residents who can use some of these goods.

We are also working on a secondary location to assist any residents of Mine Hill Twp who need assistance. This will also take a little time to stock up but will be available shortly.

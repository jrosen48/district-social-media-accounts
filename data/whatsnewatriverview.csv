Huge shout out and many thanks to the Riverview High School Football Team who came to The Blessing Board in Oakmont on Wednesday! We received an entire SEMI full of twin mattresses from IRN, an organization that “connects those in need with those who have surplus.” Coach Trevor George and his team did a fantastic job helping to unload and stack over 300 mattresses that will go to local families in need. Coach George said,”They all have to have temperatures taken, answer safety protocol questions and have masks on whenever they do activities like this.” Even with the restrictions, they were excited about the opportunity to help and hope to do more in the future. We loved having them at The Blessing Board. Thank you all!

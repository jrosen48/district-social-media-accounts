Cameron walked across the stage with his associate’s degree of arts in hand -- well before he is set to graduate high school in 2021.

“Everyone is usually pretty surprised when I tell them I’m only a junior in high school,” said Cameron, who will go on to study film directing at Cleveland State University next semester.

Cameron began preparing for his early start at Tri-C in middle school through the Ohio College Credit Plus program.

Warrensville’s dual-credit program and partnership with Tri-C gives students like Cameron a head start to college and career at no cost to parents and families. Ohio College Credit reported that it saved Ohio families more than $148 million in tuition in 2017-18.

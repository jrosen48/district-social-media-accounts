I spent most of my teaching years as a fourth grade teacher, so I definitely understand that it is not an easy feat!

King teachers want what's best for their students and are willing to go the extra mile, try that new initiative and support the mission and goals set before them. It truly does make my job just a bit easier and for that I am grateful!

Middle School is a passage in the journey of our students' lives. The issues that middle school teachers face is like none other. Students are in the stages of evolving from children to young adults and it is a hard journey for students that do not have any issues. Compound that with the many things that our students face today and the journey is almost unbearable... or even unattainable. Our middle school teachers deal with this daily. Your hard work is not unnoticed and I appreciate all that you do!

HAPPY TEACHER'S APPRECIATION WEEK!

On March 13th, Mrs. Tremmel's math classes celebrated Pi Day (March 14). The Pre-Algebra and Algebra 1 classes created Pi art by using different colors to represent each digit 0-9, then used those colors to go from the first digit of Pi to the next, to the next, etc. to make a beautiful art piece based on the digits of Pi. The Algebra 2 classes explored how Archimedes first approximated Pi. They drew inscribed and circumscribed polygons in and around a circle to get an upper and lower bound for the circumference of the circle. Archimedes eventually used a 96-sided polygon, but that would be a lot to draw so we stopped at 16! The Advanced Math and Calculus classes got a chance to eat some pie! Then they watched some videos about the special number and discussed how it is used in real life! It was a fun day to celebrate such an important number!",0.0,"West Hancock Community Schools added 25 new photos.

Wheatland-Chili Senior Sarah Allen was selected for this honor due to the leadership and service that she has demonstrated within and outside of the school community, as well as her focus on academics.

Sarah was a member of the Jazz Band, Pit Band, Drama Club, International Club, Leadership Asset Training, and the National Honor Society. She played Varsity Soccer, Softball, Swimming, and Tennis. As a junior, Sarah received the Frederick Douglass/Susan B Anthony Award. We wish her all the best as she heads to the University of Oregon to study Marine Biology.

2nd place out of 5 at the Genesee Region League Championship!!! With a team of only 5 they killed it! They also Hit 0 (zero deductions) with a flawless routine 😍

For those that don't know, having a team of less than 8 makes it very difficult to score well because certain things are required of teams. Such as having a minimum of 2 stunts. While it is technically possible to do with 6 or 7, it is impossible with 5. So we enter every competition at an automatic disadvantage. For this small team of 5 to be able to grab second place against teams larger than ourselves is a monumental feat. These are very hardworking and determined kids. They know that the odds are against them everytime, but they still go out there and perform because they love this sport. As a coach, I know I've done my job when my athletes love the sport as much as me. The wins aren't as important as the passion.

Now we will spend the next week preparing for Sectionals on Saturday! Watch out, because these Wildcats are comin' for ya 🐾",0.0,"Good luck at Sectionals on Saturday, Wildcats!

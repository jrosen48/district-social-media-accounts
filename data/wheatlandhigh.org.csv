We will have the virtual graduation completed by the end of next week and will distribute to everyone! We are thankful that we had the graduation parade to celebrate our graduates! What a great tradition we have started!!!

April 17 at 10:49 AM · Facebook Fundraisers

A HUGE THANK YOU for all of your donations! Every Senior at Wheatland High School & Edward P. Duplex will receive a Class of 2020 sign in their yard this evening. Thank you to parents who will be delivering the Senior signs tonight.

We are still taking donations. We are looking at alternative ways to honor our Seniors and make sure they know they’re not being forgotten. This fundraiser helped us purchase yard signs for every Senior and will continue to help with Senior Gifts for Graduation.

If you’d like to support the Class of 2020 and purchase a yard sign for your yard, you can. Yard signs are $15 and will be delivered next week.

Class of 2020! Wheatland Pirates! Honor the Code! We are all so proud of you.

WUHSD will be following the approved board calendar and will be closed for Spring break the week of April 6 – 13, 2020.

All online learning platforms will be available for students to access during Spring break, but there will no new, required work assigned.

We encourage students to resume working online on Monday, April 13th. Online learning will officially resume on Tuesday, April 14th.

There have also been a lot of questions about grading for the second semester especially since guidance was given yesterday from UC and CSUs. We have not made a decision yet about the direction we will go for grading. We have a leadership meeting tomorrow afternoon and will have a decision released no later than Monday, April 6.

Stay safe Pirates!

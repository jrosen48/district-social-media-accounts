My name is Lisa Neumann. This is my first year teaching Math at the secondary level since I graduated from Concordia College in 2019.

I am originally from Annandale MN, where I grew up on a dairy farm.When I wasn't helping at home, I worked as a cashier at the local grocery store. I was also a member of the high school bands, choir, track and tennis teams. I continued playing tennis during my time as a Cobber and then coached tennis for a year after I graduated. I enjoy being outside on the lake, but I often find the time to read or cross-stitch.

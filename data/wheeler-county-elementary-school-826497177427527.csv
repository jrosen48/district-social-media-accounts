A review of progress reports at every grade level reveals that we have many students who are not meeting expectations, especially in regards to completed/submitted work. While I realize there were many challenges regarding computer and internet issues, our expectation is that each student will complete their assignments. Teachers have worked with parents and family members to try to resolve many of these issues. Progress Reports go home Wednesday, 9/9/20 and should be signed and returned by Thursday, 9/10/20. Averages at progress report time can change based on student performance over the next 4 1/2 weeks. However, grades earned at the completion of each 9 weeks grading period are final. Please help us by ensuring your child is completing all assignments in a timely manner and please report any specific issues as soon as they arise.

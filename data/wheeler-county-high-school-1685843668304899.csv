Parents/Guardians,
we are trying to develop a way for you to sign a required technology agreement online before receiving hot spots, but we will need your email address to send it. If you need a hot spot for your child, please complete this last survey with ALL information. We will let you know a time for you to come to the school, drive by, and pick the units up. Again, first priority will go to students whose information was submitted on earlier surveys. Please do not request a device if you already have reliable internet at your home. These devices are for those most in need. Click on the link or the QR code to complete.

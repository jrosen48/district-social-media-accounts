Again, first priority will go to students whose information was submitted on earlier surveys. Please do not request a device if you already have reliable internet at your home.

NEWS:

In his press conference this afternoon, Governor Brian Kemp announced that Georgia's K-12 public schools will remain closed for in-person instruction for the remainder of the school year. Essential functions (including school meals and distance learning) can continue.

We appreciate the teachers and parents who have worked so hard throughout this transition.

WCMS students made “recycling paper” in art class. Here are the steps to making it. First you must cut paper into small pieces. We used lots of scrap paper. Then fill a bucket with water. Gather all the pieces and put a small bit of the paper into water. Mix the paper and water. When you are done mixing you should have a substance that is a light gray color and looks like pulp. Now pour the pulp-like substance into the bucket. Next, get the wood part of a picture frame, called the deckle, and put it in the substance. You then push the deckle all the way to the bottom of the bucket. Pull it up to where you can see it and make sure it’s not too thick or it will take a long time to dry. Now clean the deckle. Get a sponge to press the substance. You can add things to it now or you can leave it blank. Leave it to dry for 24 hours. Now you have “recycling paper.” My favorite part was getting my hands dirty on purpose and everyone had a certain job to do.

The Dairy Cattle Career Development Event emphasizes skills in dairy cattle selection and dairy herd management and provides experience in the evaluation of dairy cattle type, production records, and dairy herd management. Participants evaluate dairy animals and place by type, give oral reasons for their class placing and take a written examination. Team members included (pictured form left to right) Joshawa Shaw, Marcy Delgado, Carson Ford, and Trent Butler.

Monday & Tuesday: Jostens will be in the High School Parking Lot from 10 - 2 handing out caps and gowns to seniors. Do not get out of the car, it is a drive up and they will hand it to you.

Also Monday, we start with providing lessons each week. It will go live this evening. The website will have all the lessons posted. If you requested a paper packet, you will get that later. An email will go out to families who requested packets as well. Keep in mind these are extended lessons to keep students learning during this time.

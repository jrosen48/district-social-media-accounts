Hello Families!

Starting this week, the 4th and 5th grade Lil' Spartans are going to challenge teachers, students, and the community at large to compete in an Attitude of Gratitude challenge! Research has shown that giving thanks to people makes them feel good, as well as ourselves! Let's give each other a little happiness!

This week's challenge to kick things off is to make a card, write a letter, draw a picture, color a paper, etc. to express our gratitude to medical workers. They are working hard to save lives and keep us safe.

Instead of mailing these, we would like to put this together in a video. Please snap a photo and send it to athibault@sau36.org by Friday April 17th.

Wow, what a storm we got last night! Please have some fun this week, and make a sculpture with snow! Think of your three dimensional form from all angles and sides. Feel free to add any additional materials to enhance your work, such as leaves, sticks, rocks, or anything you can find outdoors!

You can make anything! A penguin, whale, fish, Disney character, anything that comes to mind! As long as you’re having fun, and exploring the three dimensions. Then share your photo with us, so we can see your creativity shine and share it with the community!

REMINDER: Tomorrow there will be a Renovation and Redesign informational session at the Lancaster Elementary School at 6:30pm.
Additionally, The Rotary Club of Lancaster is kindly sponsoring an informational session at The Granite Grind on Main Street in Lancaster next Tuesday, February 25th, at 5pm. To RSVP for this event, email Roxanne Ball at rhball@sau36.org, or call (603)-837-9363.
Finally, if you can't make it to either of the above events, there will be a full day of informational sessions at WMRHS on March 5th. The sessions will go from 9am-7pm, starting every hour on the hour, and will include tours of the facilities that will be affected by the renovation.
All three events are a great opportunity to learn more about the project..

Did you know that the need for welders grows more and more by the year?
Luckily, we have an amazing welding program that prepares students for the work force & helps them find opportunities to further their welding education post-grad! Love to see it😆 #weldingwednesday #CTE #ThisIsSparta #OwnYourLearning",2020-02-13 09:22:00,,

Yesterday we had some educators from Springpoint, an educational consulting company, visit us to give feedback on our work with the Barr Foundation. They spoke with admin, teachers and students about life as a Spartan, and gave us an outsider’s perspective on the work we do here. It was a very meaningful visit, and we’re so thankful to have opportunities like this to help us improve!😆 #DoingHSDifferently #BarrFDN #ThisIsSparta",0.0,"White Mountains Regional High School

Happy #MotivationMonday ! There’s nothing more motivational & inspirational than our fellow Spartans’ successes! 2 of our senior athletes, Noah Dutkewych and Kevin Schanlaber, had amazingly successful competitions this past weekend!
Noah captured his 100th career win at the Plymouth wrestling tournament and Kevin won the NHIAA Division II indoor long jump title while setting a DII state record of 21 ft, 10.75in.
We’re so proud of our Spartans! Keep up the great work👏 #SpartanAthletics #Proud #MotovationMonday

We are sadden to share the news that Jake The Fire Safety Dog has passed away. Jake held a key role in teaching others how to stay safe and properly evacuate a fire. Every year during Fire Prevention Week, White Pigeon Community Schools students always looked forward to seeing Jake and learning from him. Our condolences go out to Mike and Scott during this tough time. Jake will definitely be missed and we thank him for his many years of service 🐶💙🚒",7.0,"White Pigeon Township Fire Department

Today the Governor of Michigan issued an unprecedented Executive Order, one that will cause us to think, work and live very differently than we are used to. This health crisis is unlike anything we have experienced, but together we will get through this tough time.

The Executive Order stated these key points-

* Face to face learning for the 2019-20 school year has ended
* Requires WPCS to provide education for all our students
* Requires our plan to be approved by both the ISD and the SOM
* Gives WPCS flexibility in delivering the education

Please be patient as we work with our teachers and administrators to develop lessons and plans for our children. Please continue to watch the website and Facebook for additional information.

Next week we will continue to offer lunches to our students, as we will for the remainder of the school year.

As we get closer to our new dates to celebrate the Class of 2020, we wanted to let the community know how they could support if they would like to do so!

1. On the day of the CRUZE, B103.9 radio station will play the names of our Seniors at a specified time during the CRUZE. If local businesses would like to support this and help advertise in advance, you can contact Jen Theodore at B1039bigrapids@gmail.com. They will be running ads that announce your business name leading up to the June 6th broadcast.

2. We will be honoring the Class of 2020 on our electronic sign and the scoreboard on Thursday, May 21st - (which was the originally scheduled graduation date.) Seniors! If you want to ""see your name in lights"" drive by the High School on Thursday! We will run the names again on June 6th and on July 23rd.

3. On June 6th, have your yard or business decorated to celebrate our Seniors. The CRUZE route will be in town and will be released on May 28th.

Again, we want to thank the White Cloud community for all you have done to support the Class of 2020.

Many families are very impacted recently with loss of jobs, having their hours cut, and many other hardships. There is help available from the State of Michigan, and the process now has many less steps during these very trying times.

Visit www.michigan.gov/mibridges to apply online. If you are not able to apply online, call 689-5500 (the DHHS office number in White Cloud) to have an application mailed to you or to see if there are applications you can pick up outside of their lobby since their lobbies are closed.

On behalf of White Cloud Public Schools, I would like to thank the WC Community for being so supportive of our efforts as we navigate through these uncertain times. Big “Thank You” to the White Cloud Food Service Department, White Cloud Transportation Department, and White Cloud staff volunteers who have helped make the lunch delivery happen.

There are still a lot of questions out there, that currently, we do not have the answers to at this time.

We will continually update the community when more details are determined and provided.

Thank you for being an AMAZING community that I’m proud to call home.

We have been monitoring our K-12 building's student attendance for the past few days. Due to a large number of students out with the flu and/or fever, White Cloud Public Schools will be closed Thursday, January 30 & Friday, January 31 for the health and the safety of our students and staff. We will be utilizing our cleaning crews and transportation department to properly disinfect all touch-points in buildings and buses during this time.

I am incredibly proud of our students. They came in the REACH room during lunch/recess to finish their candy Ferris wheel. The Ferris wheel had to turn all the way at least once. They took home first place in the elementary division. We also had a team competition based on teamwork and product. Groups consisted of students from different school districts.

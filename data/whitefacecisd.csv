What a great group! Corona shut down the school before we could elect officers and have a banquet. Normally, officers are elected during the month of May and serve a one year term. As most of you may know, this year is significantly different than most, and we must adapt and overcome. I am proud to announce your 2020-21 officers! These kids are absolutely amazing and truly represent the best and brightest!

Good Friday Morning to all!!

PARENTS.......

If you are bringing your child to any athletic workout, PLEASE be mindful of our students who may be running or walking around the campus. Sometimes it may be dark when you are dropping them off so Please be CAREFUL!! The BUS LANE should NOT be a drop off lane and we would rather you not drop students off at the back to avoid any situation involving our students and vehicles.

The beginning of school inches closer everyday!! YAY!! I hope our students are ready for back to school!! We are SOOOOO ready to see our students!!

PARENTS!! If you are new to the district, on our website we have an emergency information sheet which needs to be completed and submitted. The emergency information sheet is basic parental and pick up information. Once the information is submitted, at your convenience, you will need to produce a photocopy of your driver's license and the other adults you have allowed to pick up your child when you cannot. You can turn it into either the HS or Elementary office secretaries.

This is also for parents who have not completed a form since your arrival at WCISD, changes that have taken place since last year, or just need to make changes in general.

There will be a QR Code which all you do is use your camera and hover it over the QR code and it will have a notice on your screen. Once you have touched the banner, it will take you directly to the form to complete.

Carson Rice

Carson will be an Honor Graduate this year.

Her future plans are: Travel around the world to help people and animals.

Her favorite teachers are: Coach Gruhlkey, Coach Rocha, Mr. Ladd

Her favorite high school memory: Going to watch the blue man group. We all got to go out together for a few hours and have fun. It was the first time in the whole year I got to forget every worry on my mind and just relax, have fun, and be able to yell in a building without being told to be quiet :)

Her advice for next year's seniors: Treat your classmates like a family. You never know when something might happen where you never get to see them again. Then you get to live with every regret you have because you didn't appreciate them when you had the chance. High school isn't everything, plan ahead. Live a good life every day you can. Make the most of the time you get with the people you have to see every day whether you like them or not. Try to understand them and be there for them.

The ELEMENTARY students will pick up their belongings under the awning where they normally pick up packets. Teachers will be waiting for you so we can get all your things to you!

PLEASE BE PATIENT!! We will try to mitigate this process the best we can!!

The SECONDARY students will pick up their belongings at the Band Hall. We will allow students to come in (a few at a time) and retrieve their belongings as quickly as possible.

PLEASE UNDERSTAND, we bagged all personal belongings solely from the locker it came from. If you find something in your bag that belongs to someone else, you may leave it with us to get it to the right person. We will have staff to help facilitate this as well.

The time of pick up is to allow flexibility, PLEASE KNOW that you may come during the regular lunch time to prevent multiple trips into Whiteface, although we would LOVE TO SEE YOU!!

My favorite high school memory would have to be during basketball season when me and Sam Hodge would be spectators/managers. Always laughing and having a good time.

His advice for next year's seniors: Choose something you have a passion for and strive to go higher. Be your own path taker and don't change your mind because people disagree with your choice of career or college or the way you dress. There are leaders and followers so pick which one you would want to be.

A special shout out to this group of Seniors who has stuck with the program all the way to the finish. Such dedication and leadership is a big contributor to the longstanding success of the Whiteface Band!

Counting, graphing, and addition too; there were so many fun things to do!

Misael Castanada had a great day in the gym!! He improved 65 pounds from two weeks ago for a total weight of 1210. He had 300# pushed and locked out on bench press, but the spotter racked the weight before the judge call for rack, and he had to try again. He didn’t have much rest before he tried again and fell short. Still had 2 PR’s in bench and dead lift. Finishing 4th for the day.
Kaden Coats also did great!!! This was Kaden’s first ever power lifting meet. He got bumped into a heavier weight class. Kaden also had 2 PR’s today in bench and squats.
Jose Borunda did AWESOME today!!! This was also his first power lifting meet. He medaled with a third place finish. He had 3 PR’s in squat, bench, and deadlift!!!
These young men greatly represented Whiteface today. Not only in strength but in character and integrity!! We are so proud of our Antelopes!",0.0,"Victory Line -Whiteface Athletic Booster Club

I just wanted to take a moment to invite you out to the Marching Band's Home Show (which is actually the TOB Eastern PA State Championships this year) on Saturday, October 19th at Zephyr Stadium.
The band is having an outstanding season thus far, and is actually ranked 3rd out of 22 Group 1 Open bands in the entire circuit at the moment!
I know it would mean a lot to the students to have a strong show of support from the home crowd at our show. If you would like to attend, you can purchase tickets in advance or at the gate. Tickets are $10. Just get in touch with me and I can get the tickets to you. The show is scheduled to begin at 6:00 PM.
Thanks for your time and continued support! Hope to see you at the show!

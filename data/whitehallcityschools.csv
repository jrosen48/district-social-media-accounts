Thank you.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2956050791082596&id=281117585242610,,0.0,"Attention Beechwood Elementary Families:

Due to primary election voting going on at Beechwood this coming Tuesday, March 17th, we are going to cancel school for that building only to make it easier for voting to occur.

Voting will also be taking place at WYHS. However, the logistics of their voting location within the school will not hinder the normal day-to-day routine.

Beechwood families will be receiving a robo call on this today.

Thank you.",2020-03-12 10:34:30,,

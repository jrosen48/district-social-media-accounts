Meredith Clayton, a dual-enrolled student, plans on finishing her core classes at North Georgia Tech and then attending Nursing school to eventually become a Nurse Practitioner. Meredith’s favorite quote “If it doesn’t challenge you, it won’t change you.” Her favorite memory at MECHS is finishing Algebra ll. Mrs. Brandi Turner is Meredith’s favorite teacher because Mrs. Turner was her 7th-grade teacher at White County Middle school. Then when Meredith saw that Mrs. Turner worked at MECHS, she knew she could go to Mrs. Turner for whatever English questions she had. Dr. Theresa Anderson, one of the counselor’s at MECHS, has been the most helpful for Meredith. No matter what was wrong, Dr. Anderson knew how to fix it.

Congratulations to Grace Teater from the White Site! Grace plans on finishing school at UNG and becoming a clinical therapist. Grace’s favorite quote is, “You don’t get rid of yesterday by talking about it all the time, you get rid of its effects on you by moving forward.” During her time at MECHS, she looked forward to break because she got to talk and mingle with new people. Grace’s favorite staff member is her mentor, Mrs. Ronotta Stiles, ""because she has watched me grow up to be the woman I am today."" Mrs. Stiles helped when Grace was truly struggling at the bottom. Grace feels that she probably wouldn’t be where she is today without her mentor.

Emma Flanagan is a senior from the White Site. Emma plans to attend Lanier Technical College and start her nursing career and hopefully become a surgical nurse. Emma’s favorite memory is when she finally finished her very last module and all the excitement just came flowing through her for finally finishing high school when she thought that would never happen. Mrs. Whitlock is Emma’s favorite staff member because she took the time out of her day or night to help Emma better understand what she was learning at the time. Mr. Tench, the Math teacher in the senior room, was the most helpful teacher for Emma.

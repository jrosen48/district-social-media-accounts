White Oak Community: Please know that White Oak ISD is monitoring the weather and Hurricane Laura closely. Depending upon where the hurricane makes landfall, and the timing, this will have a big impact on what happens in the state, and where it tracks northward. Please know that we are monitoring this VERY closely. As of now, it looks like a lot of rain is possible with high winds and if this comes to fruition, possible power issues. Once again, a lot depends on the location of landfall and timing.

White Oak ISD is in communication with DPS, the Weather Service, WO Emergency Management, and WO PD. We will monitor the situation closely. As of now, everything is on-go for school tomorrow (Thursday), but we will continue to monitor and adjust as needed.

Parents/Guardians:

This afternoon we experienced some electrical issues at White Oak Primary and Intermediate campuses. Currently, SWEPCO is on-site and working through the issues.

At this time we are expecting to have power restored and a regular school day tomorrow, Friday, January 31st.

If the issue is not resolved we will notify you by 6:00 a.m. in the morning.

Please check the campus Facebook pages, campus blogs and teacher blogs for notification and updates.

This would affect the primary and intermediate campuses only.

Thank you.

COME EARLY

on Wednesday, January 29th

White Oak Intermediate will have their first in-house UIL meet this Wednesday, January 29th. Even though not every student on campus participates in the competition, every student will be affected in some way on this day with the accommodations we’ve made to hold competitions in our own classrooms.

In order for us to get started with competition in a timely manner, we are asking that all Intermediate car riders arrive at school no later than 7:40 a.m. on this day. This will allow time to have ALL students in their designated locations. Students can be dropped off as early as 7:15 a.m. as outside personnel is on duty.

If at all possible, we would appreciate your help on this day. We are very excited to begin our UIL journey and look forward to many competitions for years to come!

Also, don’t forget this is an

The Board of Trustees at White Oak ISD invites the community of White Oak to Active Shooter Response Training. The event will take place in the CC Simmons Auditorium on Sunday, March 11, 2018. The event will begin at 2:30 pm and end by 4:30 pm including a Q&A time at the end of the presentation.

The trainer will be Mark Seguin, TBG Solutions Inc. Tyler Texas. He recently provided training to all employees at White Oak ISD and we feel his message and insight will be beneficial to everyone in White Oak.

There will be an updated report by the district on the security measures in place at WOISD and our commitment to providing a safe learning environment for our students, faculty, and staff.

On behalf of the District, I hope to see you next Sunday.

It's that time of year! It's time to start clipping those Box Tops, bagging them up, and sending them to school to help your classroom win one of the Box Top Contests. Students need to send their box tops in an envelope or in a baggie with the name of their teacher clearly marked. There will be one winner in each grade level.

Box Tops for Education is a program supported by General Mills and other companies that aid schools in raising money for various purchases and products they deem important for their students. For each Box Top we mail to General Mills, White Oak Intermediate will receive 10¢. We hope everyone will join in supporting our school and our kids with our 2017-2018 Box Top Contest.

This is an easy way where our campus can earn money by simply shopping at Brookshire's, Super 1 Foods, and Fresh. Just have your tag, ""Cash for my Class"" scanned at checkout.

Brookshire's will earmark 1% of qualifying purchases to donate to our school. Letters will be coming home with your student, along with one scan tag. Should you need another tag for your household, please stop by the intermediate office. We have just a few extra we would be glad to give away until they are all gone.

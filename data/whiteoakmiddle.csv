From Monica Pearce:
Hi Class of 2023 and Parents,

Hopefully, everyone received an email about the 8th Grade Parent meeting next week and the student/parent registration meetings. The Parent meeting scheduled for 6:30 – 7:00 pm February 4th is an optional informational meeting about House Bill 5 graduation requirements. This information will also be covered in the student/parent meetings.

Please click on the 8th Grade Info page to schedule an appointment for a meeting. The meetings are for Feb 5, 6, 7 & 8th. The previous link to the google form had incorrect dates.

We look forward to meeting all of you!

The Board of Trustees at White Oak ISD invites the community of White Oak to Active Shooter Response Training. The event will take place in the CC Simmons Auditorium on Sunday, March 11, 2018. The event will begin at 2:30 pm and end by 4:30 pm including a Q&A time at the end of the presentation.

The trainer will be Mark Seguin, TBG Solutions Inc. Tyler Texas. He recently provided training to all employees at White Oak ISD and we feel his message and insight will be beneficial to everyone in White Oak.

There will be an updated report by the district on the security measures in place at WOISD and our commitment to providing a safe learning environment for our students, faculty and staff.

On behalf of the District, I hope to see you next Sunday.

This threat was taken very seriously and White Oak PD took swift action to investigate the validity of the threat. By mid-morning, Saturday, February 17th, it was determined the threat was not real. Instead, it was a very ill-advised “prank” that led to a heightened level of concern for the District Leadership Team, White Oak PD and many members of the community.

Rest assured that this situation was handled swiftly, thoroughly and with the extreme level of concern merited by the message/picture sent. For those in the community that notified officials to raise this concern, Thank You for your action and level of awareness that allowed this to be handled in the appropriate manner.

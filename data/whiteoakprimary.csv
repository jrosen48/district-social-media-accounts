While it is difficult to predict the weather, due to Hurricane Laura, I am concerned about the possibility of heavy rain and wind tomorrow morning (Thursday) when our route buses will be

has determined that it is the best interest of safety that we close school tomorrow, Thursday, August 27. We wanted to send this out tonight so that parents would have an opportunity to
make any arrangements necessary. We apologize for any inconvenience.

Prior to leaving for spring break, White Oak Primary completed our “World’s Finest Chocolate” fundraiser. We had plans to have the chocolate delivered and distributed to students the first week of April. As we all know, all of our systems have changed or stopped due to the COVID 19 pandemic. We have paid for the chocolate and it is being held for us in a climate-controlled warehouse. The safety of our staff, students, and community is our top priority. We cannot have the chocolate delivered from our distributor in Shreveport until restrictions have been lifted and it is safe for our employees and you to handle the shipments. You will get your products as soon as it is deemed safe to distribute and/or school has resumed. Thank you for understanding. We apologize for any hardship this may cause.

Sincerely,
Claire Koonce

Prior to leaving for spring break, White Oak Primary completed our “World’s Finest Chocolate” fundraiser. We had plans to have the chocolate delivered and distributed to students the first week of April. As we all know, all of our systems have changed or stopped due to the COVID 19 pandemic. We have paid for the chocolate and it is being held for us in a climate-controlled warehouse. The safety of our staff, students, and community is our top priority. We cannot have the chocolate delivered from our distributor in Shreveport until restrictions have been lifted and it is safe for our employees and you to handle the shipments. You will get your products as soon as it is deemed safe to distribute and/or school has resumed. Thank you for understanding. We apologize for any hardship this may cause.

Sincerely,
Claire Koonce

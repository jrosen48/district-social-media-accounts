Distance learning was challenging, and our thanks and gratitude go out to our families, our staff, and our White River students. Our number one priority was the health and safety of our students and staff coupled with keeping our students learning. We have all learned that we can persevere through things that are harder than we could have imagined. Have a wonderful summer, and we hope to see you all this fall.

- The purpose of sleep hygiene is to help us get deep sleep. This will help your mood, increase your mental health, and keep you more alert during the day.
- Getting outside and getting sunlight helps the body prepare for sleep. Daylight regulates your body's internal clock.
- A bedtime routine is important for the whole family and save your bed just for sleep if you can.
- If it takes longer than 20 minutes to fall asleep, get up and do something relaxing in another room. Resetting outside of the bedroom is better than staring at the time or worrying about falling asleep.

Challenge: If you are having a hard time going to sleep - quickly jot down the thoughts that are overwhelming you so that you think about them later, or do something from your night time routine to reset.

Distance learning is hard and you might be feeling defeated.

You may think other families have it “all together” and are playing the comparison game.

Perfectionism is holding ourselves to an unattainable perfect standard, this is not a time for perfection! It is hard to not feel like you have control over things.

Doing the best you can is good enough!

It’s OK if you or your student don’t know something, you are not alone in that. Reach out to your school! We want to help.

Challenge: Don’t feel like you need to do everything alone, when you are struggling this week reach out for help! Try to drop that expectation for perfection in that moment.

In our Second Step program, we teach students when they are upset to stop, name what they are feeling, and do a calm down strategy.

Belly breathing is a type of calming strategy where you take a slow deep breath in through the nose and exhale out the mouth. It is called a belly breath because you should see your stomach expand.

Deep breathing activates something in our body called the vagus nerve; this is the biggest nerve in our body and is super powerful!

Breathing during the day and when we are upset helps our mental and physical health! Research shows it improves our sleep, reduces headaches, helps our memory and thinking, and reduces anxiety.

Challenge: Try doing some belly breathing every day this week, even if you aren’t feeling upset. It is a great practice to do daily.

Research on Adverse Childhood Experiences (or ACE’s) tells us the common thread of resilience is a loving and supportive caregiver.

Spending time with our students doing something they are interested in, validating their feelings, and encouraging them when they want to give up will all help.

When you are stressed, stop and think, “Do I have control over this?”

If we don’t have control, it is better for our mental well being to try to accept and try not worry about it.

Acceptance means accepting things for what they are, even when we don’t like it.

White River families:
- CDC recommendations have changed in the last week and as a result, the Governor has announced that schools in King, Pierce and Snohomish counties will be closed as of Tuesday, March 17th and that schools will remain closed at least until April 24th.
- White River will close Monday, March 16th. Teachers will use Monday and Tuesday next week to plan and coordinate providing distance learning. Friday, March 13th is the last student day.
- Otherwise healthy children are not at high risk for contracting COVID-19. Schools are being closed to reduce the possible transfer of the virus within our community and in particular to high risk populations.
- As the Governor said, it’s critical that we contain the spread of the virus, and we have reached the point where we need to drastically change community behaviors to mitigate the effects of the virus. We are all being asked to practice stringent social distancing - you can go out in public but stay 6 or more feet from other people. Wash your hands! And don’t put your hands to your face. If we all practice these simple precautions we can have a huge impact on the spread of COVID-19.
- Closing our schools is a difficult decision and has involved MANY conversations with King, Pierce and Snohomish school districts, OSPI, the Governor’s office, and Health Departments. It is not made lightly. We know the impact this will have on our community.
- This is difficult, but we know we can do it if we work together to support each other and the children of our community. Thanks to our generous voters, we have the ability to move to distance learning almost immediately.
- Pre-school, early kindergarten, kindergarten, and first grade will receive weekly learning packets from their teachers, and teachers will be using Seesaw to communicate with families.
- Second through eighth grade students will have a Chromebook and charging cord checked out to them on Friday, which they will be bringing home.
- High school students already have devices checked out to them. If you have a high school student who does not have a device, please contact principal Cody Mothershead.
- We are working hard to provide services for our students and families, but this is going to take families, neighbors, faith communities and organizations working together to support each other! We know that closing our schools is a critical move to meet the greater good of our community.
- We will continue to provide breakfast and lunch from central distribution points. Details will be coming to you.
- We will be providing you with a lot of information in the next week about what this is going to look like, but we want our families to have some time to prepare. We apologize for this short notice to our families, but these changes have happened rapidly over the last 24 hours. We will continue to update information on our website, www.whiteriver.wednet.edu and you can click on the COVID-19 Coronavirus Updates.
We will be sending you additional information as we work through our plans. Some of the specific major topics on our list are:
- Special Education Services
- English Language Services
- State testing
- Graduation requirements
- Athletics
- Early Learning registration

We are so proud of the many programs and services that White River School District is able to provide to our students. Many of these are supported through Levy funding, provided by our generous community.
Here we are showcasing some of those programs – Preschool, our Safety and Security staff, Nurses, Counselors, and Mental Health staff, Special Education, the Arts and Athletics. None of these are fully funded by the state, and in some cases (like Athletics) we receive zero state funding.

Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department hosted U.S. Representative for the 8th District Kim Schrier, at a community meeting at White River High School on Nov. 25.

White River is one of the Health Department’s Communities of Focus where we work to ensure our most vulnerable residents have every opportunity to be healthy. A local team has led efforts over the past year to develop and address local priorities.

Residents and local leaders shared about partnerships, participatory budgeting and planning, and civic engagement to improve health.

High school students shared about a participatory planning and budgeting project in which students developed proposals and voted on projects. With a grant from the Health Department, they chose to invest in water bottle filling stations to improve health at their school.

We have such amazing students in White River, we thought we would brag on some of our high school grads.
We would like to introduce you to Casey Lee. Casey attended Pierce County Skills Center her senior year. When she talked about her journey to get there, she said the high school staff was incredibly supportive, helping her get caught up on her credits, which gave her the ability to attend the Skills Center. Casey knew she didn’t want to go on to a four-year college, and was interested in the automotive field. At the Skills Center she took classes in the Aerospace Components pathway. She was Outstanding Student of the semester her second semester. Casey got several job offers before she graduated, and has accepted a job with General Plastics in Tacoma, where she will be working in their shop making airplane parts. She will start in July, after she turns 18! Casey said she just wishes that more kids knew about the programs offered through the Skills Center.

The assembly was kicked off by Dr. Steve Leifsen, White River Director of Equity and Acheivement. Dr. Leifsen welcomed three of our high school students who sung an traditional welcome song to the students.

Melanie Cunningham works in the Campus Ministry department at Pacific Lutheran University, and is the winner of the Greater Tacoma Peace Prize for 2018. Tacoma is one of the few cities with a Peace Prize recognized by the Nobel Prize Foundation. She has recently returned from Norway where she took part in the Nobel Peace Prize festivities.

I want to give a HUGE shout to Jeanette Schuster, leadership and all other staff and students who helped provided winter wishes for Foothills Elementary. This morning, about 60 kids and a few staff got to go over and give a gift to EVERY student at Foothills Elementary, all 650 of them. It was priceless to see the joy, smiles and excitement on the faces of the kids, both elementary and high school, when the high school students walked into classrooms calling each student one by one to give them their gift. This was an amazing event and a great way for our students to help others in our district. Thank you for this incredible event and everyone's generosity. Go Hornets!!!!!",0.0,"This is an amazing project that took the leadership of Jeanette Schuster and her students, as well as a whole bunch of other staff and students to pull off.

Our students set up and began preparing for the three panels of judges that they would present to on robot design, working as a team, and a research project related to astronaut mental health. After the three presentations, each team completed three rounds of the robot challenge, in which teams' autonomous robots attempted to complete as many missions as possible. The teams did very well and made amazing improvements compared to last year! Congratulations to the kids, teacher Joel Bale, and a huge thanks for all the parent support!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1980667648707292&id=250274578413283,,0.0,"On Saturday, December 1 at 8:00 a.m. the Glacier Robotics Club pulled into the parking lot at Auburn Mountainview High School for the FIRST Lego League competition.

Parents, if anyone in your household is experiencing multiple C-19 symptoms (fever, cough, loss of taste or smell, etc...) please keep them home until you receive a negative test result or an alternative diagnosis. If you are waiting on a test result, everyone in your household must remain in quarantine until those results come back negative. If positive, everyone in your household will then move to a quarantine status for at least 14 days.

Please understand that a quarantine is not punishment. The quarantine is to prevent a ""mass"" spread of COVID - 19, which would cause a major ""shut-down"" within the district, not to mention introducing the virus to multiple families. Let's keep each other healthy!

It is also important to note that not everything is COVID - 19. Allergies, Strep throat and various other illnesses are prevalent right now.....and flu season is just around the corner.

Sad day! But one that had to happen! We have cleaned out all our athletic lockers and placed all personal belongings in bags with your students names on them.

We will be collecting any athletic gear your child may have of the schools and returning their personal belongings on Wednesday May 6th from 10 AM to noon.

We will have a pick up line at the MS using the carport next to the gym on west side parking lot (normal parent drop off and pick up point) for all MS athletes.

At the HS we will use the gym roll up door on east side of campus for girls athletics and the north locker room door closest to Hwy 82 for boys athletics.

We ask that you stay in your cars and simply give us our things and we will track down your students bags and bring them to your vehicle.

See you all next week!",7.0,"Details coming for Campus specific, personal item pick-up, in the days ahead.

Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller recognized the Whitesboro ISD Cafeterias with the Best of the Bunch Award for reaching top level in the Texas Department of Agriculture Farm Fresh Challenge! Every October, participating schools pledge to incorporate more local products in meals and provide important lessons about healthy lifestyles and Texas Agriculture. The challenge was: Eat Local. Teach Local. Be Social. We are doing our part to support local farmers, ranchers, and distributors by bringing these healthy Texas foods to school meals and teaching children about the value of agriculture.

🏃‍♀️ 🏃 Cross County State 🏃‍♀️ 🏃

A memorable state XC meet. Kelli pr'd for the season, Michael is the state runner up and pr'd, and Max medaled in 9th place. And even though the boys team was only 8 points from the medal stand, the fact that they posted the fastest Whitesboro xc team time ever and the best Whitesboro xc team place in state meet is testament that hard work, determination, and working as a team pays off. Osvaldo is the third fastest 9th grade xc runner in Texas 3A. I am looking forward to the future teams. Thanks to all the parents, Brad, and Coach Garner for always being there for these young athletes. As max and Michael received their medals, my eyes got a little misty. I am going to miss the inspiration the seniors, Michael- max- Manuel- Kelli- emma- and Kayla, have been to the other runners. But, I have no doubt next year's team captain's will be ready to step into those shoes.

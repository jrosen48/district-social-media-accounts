The police in both Meagher and Lewis & Clark counties have been investigating the threat and have determined that the threat is no longer viable. The individual responsible for the posts on social media has been identified and law enforcement is handling the situation. The threat originated in Helena and law enforcement there is working with the individual responsible.
Again, we want to thank everyone involved and we look forward to seeing our students and staff on Tuesday.

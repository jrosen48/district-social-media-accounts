Dalton, GA – This year’s DRIVE-THRU FLU SHOT CLINIC, conducted by Whitfield County Health Department, is Tuesday, September 22nd from 9 am to 3 pm at the Dalton Convention Center! It’s especially important this year that you’re able to remain separately and safely in your vehicle while driving through to get your flu shot from public health staff wearing COVID-19 protective gear. The shot is no cost if covered by one of several health plans. If paying out of pocket, the cost is still relatively low at $25 for regular flu vaccine and $65 for high dose flu vaccine for people aged 65 and older. Both vaccines guard against 4 different strains of flu. Cash, check, Medicare, Medicaid, Aetna Blue Cross Blue Shield, Cigna, Coventry, Humana and United Healthcare Insurance will be accepted.

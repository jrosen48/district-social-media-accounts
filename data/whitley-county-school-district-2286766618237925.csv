This week our Play & Learn Groups focused on shapes. Learning to recognize shapes is an important step on the way to learning to recognize letters. When children learn about shapes they are not only building skills that will help them with reading but also with writing, and math.

We are very thankful to have such a wonderful group of parents, grandparents and caregivers that are so involved in the lives of these children and dedicated to bringing them to our play and learn groups each week.

Tonight is the last night for A Christmas Story! Curtain at 7pm. Admission $5

So blessed to have such a wonderful Director in Melissa Gail Satterfield Woods. She has done such an incredible job with these young actors and has allowed me to take a back seat as technical director with this show at a time when I needed a different focus.

This young cast is wonderful. Many have stepped up for their first show or first major roles. I am looking forward to the future for Colonel Players.

We are blessed to have such great support from our community, school family, WCHS administrators, maintenance staff, and Board of Education. This show features our new stage, some new lights and new curtains and several new actors in the troupe.

We also want to thank Scott Powell for some fantastic photos. We hope you can join us tonight!",0.0,"David Sweet‎Whitley Co. High School Drama

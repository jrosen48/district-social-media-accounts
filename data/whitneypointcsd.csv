🌸Hello ladies and gentlemen of Whitney Point School District!! I hope this finds you well. The PTA has been trying to think of something that we could do during this time to support our families. We have a large assortment of small carnival like prizes that we are going to distribute to our families. Our thought was something fun for kids to do and small enough to be used for a fun scavenger hunt. They will be bagged up and sent to the school to be picked up with the lunch distribution. Each bag will have several items, one bag per child. Just ask them for the “PTA Spring Pack”!!! 🌼",0.0,"Jillian Halstrom Saddlemire‎Whitney Point CSD PTA 2019-2020

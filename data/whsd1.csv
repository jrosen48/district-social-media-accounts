We are living in a rapidly evolving time with changes on how to maintain a safe and orderly environment for all of our students, staff, and families in Winthrop Harbor. It is with a heavy heart that I have decided to cancel school all next week and use them as our back-up emergency days. This will take us to our scheduled spring break during the week of March 23rd. We anticipate this short break will allow for better planning and time to understand the effects of the spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19). The building principals will be following up with a letter to parents explaining how students may continue to learn using their Chromebooks.
We will send out further updates when they become available. I apologize for any inconveniences this may cause families, but we must continue to make student safety a priority.

At this point the Board is seeking input in the search process and has requested staff, parents, and community members to complete the online survey provided by the IASB. The results will be tallied and used by the Board and Screening Team to develop a brochure to advertise the position to the ideal candidate.

Puzzles are a great way to help build early reading skills. Getting that puzzle piece in the right place takes some manipulation. Sometimes the piece is in the wrong place or just turned the wrong way.

Working puzzles to make sure the pieces fit helps children understand that letters fit together to make words and words fit together to make sentences. Just like puzzle pieces, letters and words fit together to create the words and sentences we need to read and write.

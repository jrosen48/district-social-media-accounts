This also benefits our graduating seniors because as a thank you, the Red Cross will provide $2500 in scholarship award to participating High Schools!
Our blood drive theme this year is My Heart Beats for Others... Donate, Don't Hesitate! We will be honoring the victims of the recent Stoneman Douglas High School Tragedy. Please consider coming out to support our students and humanity!

Locker Rooms: Wichita County will provide visiting team locker rooms. Social distancing in the locker room may require changing and showering in groups rather than the entire team.

Pre-Check: We ask that all teams perform temperature checks before leaving their school to ensure bringing safe athletes and personnel into our building.

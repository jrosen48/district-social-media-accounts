Locker Rooms: Wichita County will provide visiting team locker rooms. Social distancing in the locker room may require changing and showering in groups rather than the entire team.

Pre-Check: We ask that all teams perform temperature checks before leaving their school to ensure bringing safe athletes and personnel into our building.

Crowd: We will have designated areas for team crowds to sit in utilizing the pod system to keep communities separate. We ask that social distancing and masks be worn while in the building.

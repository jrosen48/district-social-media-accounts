⭐️ Stacy Kurlakowsky is a Star Student. ⭐️ She is a Sophomore and the daughter of Mike Kurlakowsky and Deanna Lloyd. She enjoys riding four wheelers and hanging out with friends. Her favorite thing about school is FFA.

These are the comments from Stacy’s teachers:

Mr. Johnson: Stacy is a very good student! She does well with her grades and has a great attitude.

Mr. Bryan: Stacy does her work constantly in a class that can be very distracting to some students and maintains a good attitude and grades.

Mrs. Siemer: Stacy works hard on anything she sets her mind to both in school and FFA, she sets high goals for herself and is determined to achieve them, she is constantly looking for ways she can improve herself and she is always willing to lend a helping hand to others.

Ms. Capranica: Stacy is a wonderful student! She works so hard and is so kind to everyone. Her smile is contagious and she is a joy to have in class!

⭐️ Roman Angulo is this week’s Star Student. ⭐️ He is a Freshman and is the son of Genesia and Alex Angulo. His favorite thing about school is Spanish, but maybe because Señora is the one who asked. 😉 His favorite hobby is playing video games.
Roman’s teachers said,
Roman is great at participating and keeping class flowing. He has excellent grades and helps the freshman class with anything that’s going on. Roman works well in class and likes doing well. He is always happy and smiling! He is a hard worker with a positive attitude, always works really hard in class and tries to help his classmates. He is a great example of a good student!

THANK YOU EDINBURG COMMUNITY!
The class of 2023 thanks you for participating in the basket raffle and the 50/50 raffle at Friday's basketball game. Congrats to all the winners!

And on a personal note, señora Skinner (me) is so thankful to everyone. I am new to the small-town life and have never seen people come together like they do around here! Thank you for supporting my students (who I LOVE) but also helping me learn so much every day!
I never raised money for things as a student or at the other schools where I've worked. I never took a senior trip - too hard with a class of 560! I never built a float for a parade. I never had a ""labor day"" celebration. So many things are new to me and I'm loving it.

So; thank you parents, students, admin, and community for being patient with me as I learn to host events and fundraisers. It's out of my wheelhouse and I learn so much every time I do something new. MUCHAS GRACIAS to everyone!

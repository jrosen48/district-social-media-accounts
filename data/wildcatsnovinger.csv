Coach Jason Daniels

Years of Experience: 22

Current Position: K-12 Physical Education

Bragging Rights:
Coach Daniels does his best to make sure our students are physically fit by creating engaging activities during his classes. Forget boring old school house games, he implements self created games like ""hoop ball"". He combines critical thinking skills with physical fitness so the kids don't even know they're sweating. We have to give him credit as P.E. class with preschoolers can't be easy, but he manages to get all of our PK-12 students playing by the rules in a short amount of time. As a coach he never lets a player or a team give up. We would say we ""hit a home run"" when it comes to Coach Daniels!

Coach Jason Daniels

Years of Experience: 22

Current Position: K-12 Physical Education

Bragging Rights:
Coach Daniels does his best to make sure our students are physically fit by creating engaging activities during his classes. Forget boring old school house games, he implements self created games like ""hoop ball"". He combines critical thinking skills with physical fitness so the kids don't even know they're sweating.

Meagan Roan

Wildcat School Nurse

It's National Nurse's Day. We could not let the day go by without saying thank you to this ""groovy"" nurse right here. Nurse Meagan tends to all our sniffles, bumps, and bruises. For students she plays the role of a fill in mom by showing the same love and care to all her students as if they were her own. She doesn't just care for the kids, she takes care of every person in the building. Nurse Meagan is always showing her school spirit (as seen in the picture).

We will set a tentative date when we are given a more secure guideline of when the social gathering bans can be lifted. July or August are in our sites for possible dates.

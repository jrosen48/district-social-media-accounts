They just did it, then did it again! The girls and boys teams both picked up big wins and cruised to easy victories by out hustling, out working and out scoring their opponents as they've done all season long. This completes the perfect basketball season for the girls as they remain UNDEFEATED!! The boys have throttled teams all season long too and only dropped one or two games against teams of older players as they've had to play up all season. Both teams had INCREDIBLE seasons and made lots and lots of memories. We are all so very proud of each and every one of our athletes! GREAT JOB MUSTANGS AND LADY MUSTANGS!!🏀🏀🏀

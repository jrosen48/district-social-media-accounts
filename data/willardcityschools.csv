The girls meet in small groups over the course of 20 weeks to discuss topics such as healthy assertiveness, healthy relationships/friendships, social media and its influence on self-perception, safety & self-defense, healthy body image, leadership & career development and stress & coping skills. Providing girls with a supportive environment where they are valued, able to take risks and try out new behaviors allows them to see themselves as capable of mastering difficult relationships, situations and choices ~ and to Rule Their Own Experiences!
Michelle Aplin, school counselor has been facilitating this national program for the last 3 years and is doing a fantastic job with these girls!",2020-02-21 11:57:40,,

PBIS stands for Positive Behavior Intervention & Support. The PBIS core team introduced Snapliments last year as the physical representation of these positive choices. Ribbons are distributed to every HS student & snaps are distributed on a quarterly basis.
We have 3 core values; Respect, Responsibility and Resiliency which every student can earn a snap for. Students also have the opportunity to earn department and/or club snaps.
In addition to snaps, students also have the opportunity to earn other tangible rewards such as dress down days, movie & popcorn days, ice cream treats, boat regatta & cookouts!

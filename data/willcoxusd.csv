WES Families,
We will begin school in-person, using our A/B schedule on Monday, August 17.

Buses will run, although we do not yet have the complete schedules. If your child rides a bus, plan to be at their bus stop early so you don't miss the bus.

The cafeteria will serve breakfast and lunch.

If you bring your child to school, please be aware that parents will not be allowed to enter campus beyond the office.

Students with a last name beginning with A-L should arrive on Monday. Students with a last name beginning with M-Z should arrive on Tuesday. We will continue the staggered schedule so that half of our students are at school on Mondays and Wednesdays, and the other half on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

We appreciate your patience as we begin a new school year, and we are truly excited to see our students and begin this year's learning journey!

As always, if you have questions you can call the school office at 384-8603, Monday-Thursday from 7am - 5pm.

See you next week!

Mr. Downs, we will miss your puppet shows and Motown revues, and your students will definitely miss how you always find a special nickname to use when you call on them in class and the many ways you engage them in learning!

Mrs. Downs, we will miss your smile and friendly nature, and your students will surely miss your special morning greeting for each of them, along with the many ways you kept them actively learning those kindergarten skills!

Concocting jelly beans requires many steps. First, liquid sugar and flavors are heated and mixed with starch and glucose. This is poured into bean-shaped starch molds and left to dry overnight. The next day, the starch is removed and the beans go through a steam bath and get sprayed with sugar. Next, they undergo what candy makers call ""panning."" They're put into a machine with a rotating drum, and while they spin, colors and flavors are added. Finally, grains of sugar are poured in‚Äîthis sugar creates the bean's hard shell. As a finishing touch, hot syrup and wax are applied to give shine. After all this shaking and making, the beans are thoroughly dried before they are packaged and shipped.""

""Though it wasn‚Äôt called pi until the 18th century, the numerical relationship between a circle‚Äôs diameter and circumference has been pondered since antiquity.

King Juba II of Mauretania, an ancient Kingdom in the Maghreb, is thought to have named the island of Grand Canaria due to the presence of many large dogs on the island. Eventually, the entire archipelago became referred to as the Canary Islands.

Another possible theory is that the name was derived from the Guanches who were the original inhabitants of the Canary Islands. The Guanches treated dogs as holy animals, worshipping and mummifying them. There is thought to be a connection between the dog-worship of the Guanches and Anubis, the dog-headed Egyptian god.""

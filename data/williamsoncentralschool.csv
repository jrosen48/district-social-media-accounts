Good afternoon,

This is Dr. Macaluso calling to inform you of a survey for families to complete on their feelings regarding the reopening of school.

The initial feedback on school reopening will take less than two minutes, and the survey as a whole will take less than five minutes. Your survey will help us gather insight and understanding first on your perspective on reopening school and then on the impact of virtual learning over the past few months. While guidance from NYS and directives from our own local Public Health Department are governing forces in our decision making, we would like to make sure that we are as inclusive and as sensitive as we can be to the needs of the families we serve.

To provide feedback on your feelings on school reopening, please complete the survey. The survey can be found in your email, on social media, and our website.

Dear Williamson Families,

This is Dr. Macaluso writing to inform you that the Governor announced today that all New York schools will be closed through the end of 2019- 2020 school year. At this point there are many unanswered questions and we are awaiting guidance from the State Education Department so we can put a plan in place and get you answers. For now, we will continue with remote learning as we have been doing. I will have more information regarding a modified school calendar once we receive guidance from the state.

I want to thank you all for doing your part in keeping everyone safe and for keeping the learning going during this uncertain time. One thing I can say for certain, is that we all miss having our buildings active and seeing your smiling faces every day. We can help to control this pandemic, please be sure that you are doing your part to maintain social distancing and to stay safe and healthy.

Enjoy some sunshine tomorrow and have a great night . . .",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3431090103570765&id=210353332311141,,0.0,"May 1, 2020 Message from Dr. Macaluso:

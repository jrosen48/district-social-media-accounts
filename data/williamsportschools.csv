As a district, we believe that it was important to share with you some resources that may assist you in talking to your child about the COVID-19 and to help you assist with their stress during this situation. Included at the in our resource listing are some local resources should your child have significant mental or emotional needs.

The most important thing we can do right now on a daily basis is to reinforce to children that they are safe, not to be afraid, to answer their questions and try to keep them in some sort of routine at home.

Many children struggle to understand what is going on currently with the coronavirus pandemic and why they cannot go to school or play with their friends. As a district, we believe that it was important to share with you some resources that may assist you in talking to your child about the COVID-19 and to help you assist with their stress during this situation. Included at the in our resource listing are some local resources should your child have significant mental or emotional needs.

The most important thing we can do right now on a daily basis is to reinforce to children that they are safe, not to be afraid, to answer their questions and try to keep them in some sort of routine at home.

The resources provided at the link below have been made accessible from our website and have been reviewed by our counselors and social workers.

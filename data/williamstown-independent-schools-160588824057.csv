Many of you have probably heard the KHSAA has lifted their dead period effective today. It is always our goal to ensure safety of our students and this includes our student athletes. The Board of Education and school and district administration will be meeting to discuss the KHSAA and Governor guidelines for a safe reopening to athletic and non-athletic activities. The first phase is June 1-June 14 and is considered a “communication phase”. There will be no face-to-face athletic or non-athletic activities held on or off campus, but coaches can meet virtually with their team or players. June 15-June 29 is Phase 2 and will allow some conditioning and skill work. Once again, we will work with the BOE, coaches and administrators to develop a plan for this phase.

While this is not sponsored by school we want to remind and encourage participants to practice the safety guidelines and stay socially distant. The parade will begin at the old courthouse and travel north to Tractor Supply where they will cross the bridge and then head back to school for a tassel turn and cap throwing. Please line the route and show your support for these students. When you arrive on our campus you MUST stay 6 feet apart from those not in your immediate family. Please follow these guidelines!

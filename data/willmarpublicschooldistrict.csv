Hello everyone,

We are excited to share that we will be providing free meals for students under the age of 18 from June 4th-August 21st (no meal service on July 3rd). We will continue to provide a cold packed breakfast and lunch meal to students.

Due to limited funding for busing, we have changed our bus routes and limited where we will be going to deliver meals. If you have children under the age of 18 years of age and do not live in an area where a bus stops, you are welcome to come to any bus stop or to Lakeland Elementary or Willmar Senior High to pick up meals starting June 4th.

Update bus routes for June 4-August 21st are in new photo albums: 1 for Willmar Bus Company and 1 for Palmer Bus Company.

*Please note that there has been a change for our buses and they are now required to have their 8-ways on and their stop signs out. Please make sure to stop for buses if you see them on the street with their lights on*

Please let us know if you have any questions.

Breakfast of Champions is a program that allows any staff member to pick a student that they feel stands out above the rest. There are no requirements for who is picked other than they can receive this honor just one time. A letter is sent home by Principal, Mr. Miley, inviting the parents to come to the celebration breakfast. The staff member calls the student up to the front and gives a one-minute description of why that student was nominated. The student is then given a t-shirt and a medal to symbolize recognition!

One more Breakfast of Champions is scheduled for May 18! Approximately 35 students are honored each year at WMS! #GoCardinals",,,0.0,"Breakfast of Champions took place last week at the Middle School!

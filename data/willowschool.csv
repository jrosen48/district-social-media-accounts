1. The last day to pick up your belongings from the high school will be Saturday, May 9 from 9:00-12:00. Most things are gone by now, but this is your last call.

2. Still having lots of questions on prom and graduation. Both events are still scheduled for June 13 and 14. All details will be determined at a later date. We will have more information for you by Memorial Day, but I'm sure you can understand, things change quickly with our current situation and we don't want to make a decision we have to go back on later.

3. It's Teacher Appreciation Day! Do me a BIG favor and email some words of encouragement to one of your teachers (past or present) today!

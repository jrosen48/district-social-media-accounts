As we prepare to begin the school year online, we need once again to hear from you. When we sent out a survey in the spring, we thought we would definitely be back in the building with students in September. We are unable to do that right now but, with fingers crossed, we are hoping to work toward that goal. The information you gave us confirmed what we also wanted, students in school! Now I am asking you to take another short survey so we can make changes in how we do online instruction. Our staff is already working hard to make sure things go smoothly for all students.

I am sending this notice out based on a decision for the safety of our students, staff and parents. As we are in a unique location, weather can be seen and unseen...with that said, when I have traveled the roads, our supervisor of transportation has traveled the roads and our staff and parents have traveled the roads deeming them treacherous, we must look to close school. School districts in the vicinity with whom we are combined are closed, I do not think it is safe to run our buses and have school. We have faced some very bad weather and tomorrow will serve to be a cleanup day with no promised time frame for road safety cleanup... therefore, a two-hour delay will not suffice. I am making a decision to close our schools out of respect for the department of transportation an any emergency personnel who answer to calls. We will keep you posted on days we may need to make up and days waived due to the state of emergency governor Inslee has addressed.

Please stay home and be safe.

As you may be aware, we are working aggressively this year to make Family Access a better source of information to our families. With that said, we are moving forward with the Skyalert application! 😊 This application involves merging School Messenger and Family Access together. In order to complete the process to merge/sync the two systems, we will be taking School Messenger offline for two weeks. Starting Thursday, October 4th through the 18th, the system will be taken offline and Food Service and Attendance notifications will not be sent out.
The changes to the Skyward system will open up a number of ways to communicate with our families and will streamline the systems we currently have. This process will allow families to have access to their personal preference settings regarding notifications right from their Skyward Family Access account. Additional information will be posted on our district website once the system is back online.

Thank you and have a great night.

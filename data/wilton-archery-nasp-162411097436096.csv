It is not about bringing home a medal or taking home a trophy. Archery is about how YOU improve. With ANY sport you know you will have your good days and your bad days. Not every day will be great, but every day you learn something. If you came home defeated or not feeling good about yourself, DON’T. If you truly enjoy the sport (any sport), don’t give up, just dig deep and become the best person YOU can be and just practice, practice, and then practice some more.

If today was your last archery shoot, be proud of how you did and how far you have come as an archer, and as an individual. Look back at the good times and remember why you joined to begin with. Not for a medal, trophy, or a trip, but because you simply ENJOY the sport. I hope to see you back next year as we continue to work together as a team and we all improve and learn together. ~~coach Ell",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=614400152237186&id=162411097436096,,0.0,"To all the Wilton Miner Archers…..I want you to know how very proud coach Caitlyn & myself are of EVERY ONE of you.

The North Dakota Youth Archery Advisory Committee created a new designation starting in 2016/17 to recognize student archers who had excelled throughout the regional archery tournament season.

To qualify for this honor, student archers must participate in a North Dakota NASP regulated regional tournament and achieve the following scores:

Elementary (Grades 3-5) – 240 points or higher
Middle School (Grades 6-8) – 270 points or higher
High School (Grades 9-12) – 275 points or higher

• The top twelve student archer scores (regardless of gender) in each division will receive the designation as a member of the North Dakota All State Archery Team.

You be the best YOU can be. The only person you are in competition with is yourself. Remember…when you step up to that line you are the only one you are shooting against. It doesn’t matter who is on the same bale as you, you compete against yourself…one arrow at a time.

We are proud of how each one shot today! Rest up archers, next week we show two towns what we have……..Two tournaments, One day…Let’s go Miner Archery!

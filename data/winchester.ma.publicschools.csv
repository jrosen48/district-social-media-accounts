WINCHESTER HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S DIGITAL DOSE:

FLU CLINICS: Public and school-based clinics will be held in Winchester. Details coming soon!

FluMist and Shots, including High-dose for seniors will be available. The flu vaccine is now required by December 31st 2020 for all children six months of age or older who are attending child care, pre-school, kindergarten, K-12, and colleges and universities in Massachusetts. There is no change in CDC’s recommendation on timing of vaccination this flu season. Getting vaccinated in July or August is too early, especially for older people, because of the likelihood of reduced protection against flu infection later in the flu season. September and October are good times to get vaccinated. To learn more go to: cdc.gov/flu/index.htm.

Design the Farm's New Weathervane!

With everyone looking for home-based activities, we thought that this could be a great time to ask for your help to design an important piece of the Farm landscape. Our new All Seasons Barn will have a weathervane and we would love some ideas from the community! You may be familiar with the 1827 Barn's classic horse weathervane (above) - an homage to the Lockes' horses and the Farm's past. We are looking for ideas from the community as to what to put up on this new barn -- something that symbolizes the farm as it is now: community-centric, educational, organic.

Design specifications:
- Should have a clear ""point"" that indicates wind direction
- Easy to fabricate out of metal
- Should be easily seen and understood from 50 ft away
- No larger than 3x3 ft in dimension
- Sent to info@wlfarm.org by April 30th
- Can be scanned in sketch, pdf, or other digital format

We will assemble a panel made up of engaged farm community members to decide which design will be immortalized at the farm for years to come. Let the creativity begin!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2465147067081954&id=1595701937359809,,0.0,"From Wright Locke Farm:

Half of Massachusetts COVID-19 cases are in Middlesex County. We need to act now to effectively limit the spread of the virus. In Winchester we are recommending strict guidelines to be protective of our most vulnerable residents, the elderly and the medically compromised (More information on high risk individuals).

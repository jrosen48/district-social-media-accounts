Artwork: Abigail Sprague from Winchester, NH.

Abby is a junior at Keene High School and has been impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic, just like many others have. She chose to use illustration to express her feelings toward this pandemic.

Abby said: ""During our period of Social Distancing, I have felt both lonely and sad. The only people I have seen over the past few weeks are my family members. I miss my boyfriend dearly, and even though I can still message him, it's not the same as if I could see him in person. I wanted to show this though illustration. The masks illustrate the distance created by the Pandemic we are living though and the COVID-19 orbs represent the fear for getting sick. It’s all around us and we can get it at any time... without knowing. Both lovers have sad expressions because they can’t meet in person. The wall represents distance and the hands represent keeping in touch. Lastly, the window and the vent show how the virus leaks in without people knowing.""

Good Friday Evening Monadnock!

Welcome to tonight's two-post special edition of Unsung Heroes.

It's 'Teacher Appreciation Week' and tonight we are honoring the teachers and staff in our Monadnock area schools.

Tonight will feature pictures of teachers and staff, videos of students, videos of parents demonstrating how homeschooling is going and pictures of events that have taken place through the week across several posts.

2020 has been a year to remember but we hope this puts a smile on faces all across the state.

Now that we know children will not return to the building this year, teachers have begun gathering their personal belongings for pick-up. Attached is a schedule with different times by grade level to come in and pick up. We have offered an earlier and a later time each day, and different times for Thursday and Friday. Each grade has 4 possible times to pick up. We hope this will work out to fewer people here at once. Please be prepared to wait to enter the building in case we have too many families at one time. We will be as efficient as possible. If you have children in multiple grades, you will be permitted to pick up for all of them at whichever time you select.

Please feel free to contact me if you have questions or concerns. Private message through Facebook, email v.carey@wnhsd.org or text or call 903-9039.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1559470064217445&id=176869449144187,,0.0,"Hi Everyone,

Conor Hill has been very busy this past year. In addition to his duties as 2019 class president, he has been heading up the KHS Sierra Club and helped organizing the Keene Youth Climate Rallye to promote environmental awareness, all that in addition to working on a local farm.

Conor’s true passion, however, lies with politics. During the 2016 election season he worked with the Hilary Clinton campaign in Keene and with State Senator Jay Kahn. Not surprisingly, Conor will be heading to UNH in the fall to begin his studies towards a degree in Political Science and Environmental Studies with the goal of a career in public service.

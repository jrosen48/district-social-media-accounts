Last week in Windham Raymond School Nutrition Program, Jeanne Reilly and I tested a new recipe from USA Pulses: Rockin' Ranch Hummus ... which according to some students tasted like ""Cool Ranch"" chips. Introducing new foods takes promotion, signage and a delicious product. Based on our experience and the endorsement of a first grader who tried it with a whole grain chip, I can totally recommend this dip! Recipe information and link below in Comments.

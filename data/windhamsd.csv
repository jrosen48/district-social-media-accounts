The purpose of this survey is to get a better understanding of parent’s comfort levels with returning to school for the 2020-21 school year. Your participation in this survey will not commit you to any final decision. Please respond to questions for each of your individual students enrolled in district schools for the fall. Please note that any decision made by the board about the model that will be used to start the school year could change throughout the year based on new assessments of educational and safety conditions for students and staff.

Back in April, Mr. Blair recorded an illustrated video poem about the students of Golden Brook and “A Most Unusual Year” (i.e., this one ...). He framed the poem and story as a “book” for the video, but he never intended to make an actual book. That is, until people started asking him when “the book” was coming out. So he made one—and it looks pretty good! “Golden Brook 2019-20: A Most Unusual Year” will be available for order this week. Mr. Blair made the 29-page, hardcover storybook as a gift to the students and families of GBS, so it is being sold at cost, and he is not making anything from sales. To make it more of a keepsake, he tidied the book’s drawings and updated the story to reflect the current situation. It also has a special dedication at the end.

Mr. Blair is working with the company to bring the price down a little, set up ordering, etc. As soon as that’s taken care of, he’ll post the link in case anyone’s interested in getting a copy.",0.0,"Golden Brook School

Change in plan! Here are today's pickup times for your child's remote learning work (those haven't changed). If you have students in more than one grade level, please come to the later time (i.e., if you have both a first and fourth grader, pickup for both would be from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m.). The change is that we are bringing materials out to cars. Please see your email for instructions and traffic map. If your email isn't there yet, give it time. Sometimes there's a bit of a delay.

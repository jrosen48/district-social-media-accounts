Please be aware that as a result of COVID-19, camp offerings will be fewer and shorter in duration this summer. Additionally, all camps will be outdoors, weather-dependent, and, as a result of the strict guidance regarding buses, transportation will not be provided.

Despite the changes and health regulations, these camps will still be a great opportunity to get kids active, engaged and reconnecting with friends in the great outdoors over the summer.

More information regarding summer camp opportunities will be available within the next two weeks.

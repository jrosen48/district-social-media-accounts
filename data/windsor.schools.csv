- If you have not done so already, please contact Coach Forsythe at forsythej@windsorcusd.org if you intend on participating.
- If you are wanting to participate, but lack the equipment needed, do not let that discourage you. We have extra sets of clubs that athletes can use for the season.
- You can find information regarding the season schedule, player expectations, and parent/spectator expectations for the season on Coach Forsythe's school webpage by following this link https://sites.google.com/windsorcusd.org/forsythe/home/hatchets-golf

Parents/Guardians:
Our 8th grade night for players and cheerleaders will be conducted at tomorrow evening’s home basketball game vs. Mattoon. The original plan was to have it on the 16th but our cheerleaders have a volleyball game that night at Teutopolis. We will recognize the players and cheerleaders along with their parents/guardians during halftime of the 7th grade game. We will introduce players and cheerleaders on the floor and will ask for parents/guardians to stand up in the bleachers when called.

Thank you,
Brian Lee

Regional Office of Education 11 is pleased to recognize State Senator Dale Righter with the ‘Friends of Education’ award.

Senator Righter serves the 55th district in the Illinois Senate. Senator Righter has regularly advocated for legislation that served the best interests of students and educators in our region and across the state, including recent legislative efforts to assist in reducing the teacher shortage. Always accessible and willing to listen, Senator Righter has visited Lerna Bridges, attended our annual legislative superintendent seminar, and met with us in his office at the capitol on multiple occasions.

Windsor FFA took a team of 4 to the Greenhand Quiz Bowl last Thursday. While they were knocked out of the double elimination contest I’d have to say that they did a great job. They were studying all the way to Newton and knew most of the answers....those darned buzzers just weren’t activating quick enough on our side of the table. ☺️.

Nice job Sierra, Caiden, Joe & Rhett!!!",0.0,"Windsor FFA Chapter

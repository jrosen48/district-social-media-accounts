Dear Staff, Parents and Caregivers:

We have decided to close all schools in the Windsor Southeast Supervisory Union today. This was based as much on the forecast as it was on the current conditions. It looks like the line of snow and freezing rain will come directly through the upper valley. I always want to fault on the side of caution. As I have said before, these are never easy decisions. We have also experienced a lot of student and staff sickness over the last couple of weeks. Perhaps this extended weekend will help us to eradicate whatever bug seems to be lingering.

Have a great weekend and stay safe!

HEY BAND!

I MISS YOU!!!!! No, really, I REALLY DO! Hope you are all enjoying the extra time with your family and staying safe and healthy.

Just wanted to let you know that I have sent assignments via your school email address. I hope you enjoy the assignments. I will be at the band hall next week on Monday and Wednesday 8-12pm so you can drop by and pick up your instruments.

It is very important to come by and at least pick up your mouthpiece and clean it! People around the world are having ""musical moments"" when they go on their balconies and play their instruments. Maybe Windthorst could use a group ""play session"" when we all go outside and play in the wind! I wonder if I would hear you from my house? Might be fun!

I want to congratulate all who send their children to Windthorst ISD. I have posted assignments online and the students have been logging onto and completing the assignments. If there is a problem, they email me. I know this is being done with many of my coworkers across campuses. This is an amazing response to a very difficult time in history.

Read books every day! As you read, look for rhyming words, shapes, letters, make predictions about the story, etc. Go outside and talk about the weather. Observe the clouds and moon. Count to 30 while doing an exercise of your choice. Go on a shape walk and see how many triangles, squares, rectangles, circles, ovals, hexagons, trapezoids, and rhombuses you can find. What were there the most and least of? Go on a letter hunt. Pick a letter and see how many objects you can find that begin with the letter. Build with Legos, blocks, or empty containers.

Read books every day! As you read, look for rhyming words, shapes, letters, make predictions about the story, etc. Go outside and talk about the weather. Observe the clouds and moon. Count to 30 while doing an exercise of your choice. Go on a shape walk and see how many triangles, squares, rectangles, circles, ovals, hexagons, trapezoids, and rhombuses you can find. What were there the most and least of? Go on a letter hunt. Pick a letter and see how many objects you can find that begin with the letter. Build with Legos, blocks, or empty containers. Play with play dough, color, paint, or cut paper. Sing and dance. Visit learning websites such as starfall.com, pbskids.org, and scholastic.com/learnathome.

Last week we missed two days because of bad weather. We will be required to make up one of those days because we are short of the 75600 minutes requirement for the students. There were two days we could have used to make these up, the day after Easter or the day at the end of the school year.

The District Improvement Team chose to make the day up at the end of the year. So, we will not be out for the summer until Thursday, May 21st at noon.

At this point going forward we will be required to make up any day or hour we miss. If we have a late start we will have to make it up. If we have to miss a day we will have to make 8 hours up.

Dena Wolf

Hello, my name is Dena Wolf and I am currently the 3rd grade Reading/ELA teacher. This school year started my 11th year as a teacher. I am a 2003 graduate of Archer City High School. Which is where my career began as the varsity softball coach immediately after graduating from MSU in December of 2008. I coached for 2 years along with teaching kindergarten. I taught k-2 and 5th/6th grade while in Archer City. This is my 3rd year at Windthorst. I married my best friend, Brad Wolf, and we have been married for 10 years. Our precious daughter, Riley, was born in June of 2011. She is truly a blessing from God! In our spare time we are usually running her to games and practices and we wouldn't trade it for anything. I feel so blessed to be a part of Windthorst ISD.",0.0,"Windthorst Independent School District added a new photo.

I consider my position in Windthorst as one of my greatest blessings. The stars were aligned just right for me to show up at Notre Dame high school 23 years ago. The principal at the time, desperately needed someone to teach computer applications. Three days later that person was me. Then serendipity once again prevailed when Howard Neeb did my evaluation for Notre Dame. Windthorst offered me a job as a computer teacher that fall. When I finished my administration degree, my beautiful new bride and I headed south. We stayed there for a decade, until Mr. Hise decided to part ways with the principal's office. As luck would have it, we were wanting a new opportunity. My wife and I are very happy to be back in this area. I am especially so, as I am convinced that providence, not luck, the stars, or serendipity, guided me to return home to Windthorst.",0.0,"Windthorst Independent School District added a new photo.

Hello, my name is Travis Vaughn and I am the Agriculture Science Teacher. This is my 23rd year in education, and my 13th year at Windthorst. I received my Bachelors of Science in Agriculture Economics from Texas A&M University Commerce, and completed my agriculture teaching certification from Tarleton State University. Before becoming a teacher I worked on the crab boats in Alaska & was the dairy herdsman for Willie Hoff’s dairy. My wife Juhree and I have three kids who graduated from Windthorst ISD. Our oldest, Kayci is a innovation specialist for Burkburnett ISD, Kayla is respiratory therapist at Comanche County Hospital & Trevor is a wean calf specialist for Transova Genetics.

Hello, I am Lavern Lindemann. I am starting my 30th year at WISD. In 1990, I began work as a kindergarten aide, helped with the Big Blue Band for 11 years, as well as serving the students with reading interventions.

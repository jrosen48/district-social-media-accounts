Online Free/Reduced Meal Applications are not available for parents/guardians to fill out for the 2020-2021 school year. It is especially important for all students (including those who are 100% virtual learning students) to have an application on file. Please visit www.winfield.k12.al.us/applynow to fill out your online applications.

The online method is the preferred way for you to fill out an application as it is the fastest way to get your application processed and the most confidential. Your child has received a paper copy on the first day of school. If you have already completed the online application you DO NOT have to fill out the paper application.

If your child received free/reduced meals last year, a new application must be completed each year.

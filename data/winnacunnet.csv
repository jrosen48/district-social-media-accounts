August 26 at 9:24 AM ·

Good news! If you couldn't attend Tuesday's ELO Information Webinar, here is the recording. In this 50 minute webinar we review what ELOs look like at Winnacunnet High School. It also details ELO requirements, how to request an ELO and changes to the program amid our pivot to Enriched Virtual Learning. You can also access the slideshow for this presentation in the details section of the video.

Extended Learning Opportunities (ELOs) are learning experiences that happen outside of the traditional classroom setting. These typically are things like career explorations, internships, independent studies, project based learning or even service aides (where a student helps a teacher in the classroom).

For more information please email Donna Couture, Director of Extended Learning at dcouture@warriors.winnacunnet.org",2.0,"Great information from our ELO Program!

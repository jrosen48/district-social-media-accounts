Ok to alleviate some of the hassle of calling in everyday. It was decided that we will start an extended list. So call 878-2930 when asked how many say number and everyday. Example (3 everyday) this will help us alot. Also then you dont have to worry about calling everyday.

If you call in delivery, please don't pick up, just because the delivery isn't there right away. We are delivering about 200+ so allow them time. Sorry if it's not in the time you want, but we are trying our hardest. Thank you and please share.",0.0,"Winnebago Public School Kitchen.

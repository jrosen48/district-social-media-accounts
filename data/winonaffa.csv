Success is often measured by growth. For some the growth measured by these young may seem as baby steps! For me I have watched grow to unmeasurable heights. Today these special girls fell one spot short of a goal they set to be in the top ten at the state milk quality contest. After initial tears the conversation on the ride home became lighter and the car filled with singing and laughter. I truly don’t know if they realize the impact they have had on their ag. teachers and their program. I could be more proud of them. The placing means little but the talks about college, next year, goals, maybe being an ag teacher has allowed me to even more of the decision to return to ag. Teaching. Winona proud thank you Jocelyn, Jimena, Sydney and Mackenzi",5.0,"Congratulations to our Milk Quality team! Mr. Reynolds puts it best.

The FFA doesn’t point kids in just one direction—it gives them direction. The world needs innovators, leaders, and workers who are ready and willing to get the job done, and Texas agriscience education and the FFA are preparing them for the challenges ahead.

The blue and gold FFA jacket is about so much more than farming. When a student puts on the FFA jacket, an almost endless horizon of opportunities appears. In a world where students are trying to find their space and their voice, FFA offers something for everyone.

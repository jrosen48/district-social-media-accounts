We will be starting in Green at this time. Masks are optional but encouraged in this level, as we can social distance. There are several areas that masks may be required (bus and vans) in Green. If this is the case the district will provide several cloth reusable masks to students and staff. If we move into the Yellow, masks will be required. This is a consistently changing pandemic and all mask requirements or color levels could change before school starts. If that happens, we will let you know immediately.

Mrs. Straight is a Kindergarten teacher at Winside School.

She has touched so many hearts and inspired so many kids. She is fighting cancer right now and I’m hoping by setting up a GoFund me page. It can help with some of the financial stress that illnesses can cause.

Even a small donation could help reach their fundraising goal. If you can't make a donation, it would be great if you could share the fundraiser to help spread the word.

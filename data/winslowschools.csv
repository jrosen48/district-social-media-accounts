Had so much fun today with Winslow Township Middle School the grand prize winner of the Bernzomatic Find Your Fire Community Grants Program!

These kids were amazing and I'm so proud of the work they did to build an outdoor classroom and maker space. Great teachers inspire creative solution seekers :)

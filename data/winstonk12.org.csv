IMPORTANT UPDATES FOR BUS RIDERS! Please Share!

Due to Covid-19 precautions, Winston Co Schools buses are limited to regular route riders only. Parents are not allowed to send notes for their children to ride home with other students on a bus. All seats will be pre-assigned with families sitting together if possible and seating charts made for contact tracing should a child become sick. Masks must be worn at all times on the bus, and no food or drink (including water) will be allowed on the bus. Also, please note that most routes will be approximately 20 minutes later than last year due to buses not arriving to school until 7:35 am.

Please share this information with your child as we prepare for the new school year. We truly appreciate your cooperation and understanding as we strive to meet guidelines.",0.0,"Meek Elementary School

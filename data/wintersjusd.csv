I brought kids out today to do some community service. We cleaned up several bags full of garbage in the dollar general area. They were actually excited to help the community. We got many offers of monetary gratitude from members of the community that we turned down but appreciated the offer and this is a huge reason why we love our small town. In the end the employees working at dollar general were so appreciative and even contacted their manager to give the kids a small reward. (FYI: the kids were wearing gloves and used tools to pick up the trash, used hand sanitizer when they finished and thoroughly washed their hands when we got home)",0.0,"Joseph and Sophia Jara spent time yesterday cleaning up around Dollar General..

We would like to provide updated information from what we reported on Monday. First, I would like to compliment the High School staff for their quick response in this situation. I (Todd Cutler) was on campus at the time of the gathering of students in the Library parking lot and Principal Mr. Barsotti and I were in the area of the library within moments of the call. We were able to determine quickly that there was no threat to the school or students. Our team worked effectively with our safety partners as we addressed this issue. The Winters Police Department has informed us that there was no evidence to substantiate or verify that there was a weapon present. Thank you for your continued support and understanding.

Parents, Families, and Friends:

I want to thank everyone for their support and flexibility with the challenge of the loss of power. As you may know, today we had power at Winters High School and Winters Middle School, however power was out at Waggoner, Rominger, Wolfskill and Preschool.
We have been informed that we will not be losing power to sites that have maintained power and that we should expect power to return to the other sites by tomorrow afternoon. With this said, we are going to move forward with school tomorrow. We will have a regular schedule for Middle School and High School, Wolfskill, and Preschool. Rominger and Waggoner will remain on a shortened schedule (Wednesday schedule). Transportation and Food Services will be fully functional.
At this time we are planning for a regular school day for all, on Friday. We will continue to monitor the situation and send another update tomorrow.

Thanks,

We were informed last night that the PG&E would most likely shut power off to our community at midnight tonight.

Good afternoon, Parents & Guardians.

After consultation with superintendents throughout Yolo County, all schools in the Winters Joint Unified School District will be closed tomorrow, Friday, November 16 due to the health concerns related to the smoke.

Under normal circumstances we would remain open at Air Quality Index levels of 151 to 200. However, we have concerns about the continued increases in AQI and prolonged exposure to staff and students occurring this week.

I wish you all a happy Thanksgiving with friends and family.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1950142955101270&id=868286009953642,,0.0,"Winters School Closure for Friday November 16, 2018

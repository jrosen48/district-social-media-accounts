Reading is one of the most important skills that you can teach a child. Of the skills children learn, it is the one you can influence the most. Giving kids access to good books and the opportunity to choose books will motivate them to read more. And like most acquired skills, the more kids practice reading, the better they'll get.

We invite you to visit our Scholastic Book Fair and experience a celebration of reading that provides families the opportunity to get involved in a universal mission: encouraging kids to read everyday os they can lead better lives.

Reading is vital to every child's success and raising kids as readers means getting involved while they're young. Now is the time. Since there will never be a substitute for a parent's direct involvement in his/her child's education, please make plans to visit our Book Fair.

Book Fair Dates: Monday, April 9th - Friday, April 13th

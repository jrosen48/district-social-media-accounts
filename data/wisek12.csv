Here is my portion of my recent collaboration, but in 6 different ways. Primarily this activity is great for eye hand coordination and graduation of force. But, just by simply changing the position into a tall kneel or half kneel it works or incorporating an unstable surface like a BOSU BALL, you're working on a new set of skills from balance and even core! This includes the hips, the pelvis, the spine, and the torso. These positions are great for some of kiddos working on balance and postural stability amd so fun! This activity constantly surprises me at how difficult it can be for our kiddos.
🏐
The activity can easily be modified for at home sessions from using a tee ball and some simple yarn and using a pillow as an unstable surface.

They had to slow down and work together.

Hi everyone! As some of you may know, I attended a summer program at Virginia Tech over the summer called Pathways for Future Engineers. I expected to go and be absolutely miserable, but it ended up being one of the best choices I’ve ever made. I learned so much and made so many new friends from all over the state of Virginia. I highly encourage anyone who is a first generation college student (both parents have equal to or less than an Associate’s Degree) and are currently in the 9th, 10th, or 11th grade to apply for this program. Even if you are not interested in any STEM majors, it is still a great experience and I promise you’ll learn a lot! I know that I probably don’t have many underclassmen on my facebook page, so I would greatly appreciate it if any of my teacher or student friends could share this post! Thank you!! 🧡🧡🧡 If anyone has any questions, feel free to message me! I have flyers and stickers that can also be found in the library or guidance office. You can also send an email to pathways@vt.edu and let them know your name and what school you are from!",0.0,"Madison Shuler

I have to brag on my Junior Beta Babies and our 8th grade Student Government. Today, we loaded them up and took them to the Family Crisis Center in Norton to unload a tractor trailer. This truck was full to the brim with clothes and supplies for our community. They unloaded the truck in an hour and a half. As soon as we got there, they jumped off the bus and got to work. And, let me just say that those bundles that they unloaded were extremely heavy. I couldn't be more proud of these kids and all they do for our community and school.

The Title I Reading classes at Wise Primary School celebrated the power of reading this week and participated in Read for the Record. Each class read Thank You, Omu! written by Oge Mora. In the story, Omu made a large pot of thick red stew for her evening meal. Everyone in Omu’s neighborhood smelled the delicious stew and one by one they followed their noses toward the scrumptious scent. Omu shared her stew with each person and then had no stew left for her evening meal. At the end of the story, Omu’s neighbors and community come back to give dinner to Omu. This was a wonderful story in teaching our students the importance of sharing and the importance of a community coming together to show love and gratitude.

The students had fun making thank you cards for our wonderful cafeteria ladies who prepare our breakfast and lunch each day. Ms. Phillips, Mrs. Taylor and Mrs. Balthis also shared yummy soup with their Title I Reading students.",0.0,"Wise Primary School Family Engagement

[CONCERT REPLAY] Thank you to singer/songwriter Avery Hirsch, Junior at Wissahickon School District High School for a wonderful concert tonight. We had over 1,000 views in a short amount of time and we hope THIS REPLAY reaches even more!

Not only is Avery a beautiful singer but her songwriting is inspiring. We can all now say, ""We remember when Avery sang at the Kane Partners/Kane Partners Social Media Gratitude Concert.""

Although we had a little technical difficulty with the Premiere feature, we were still able to ""Go LIVE"" at 6:00pm with a little ingenuity and duct tape. Thanks for your patience while during the show. Below is the uninterrupted version of the concert. Enjoy!

Please SHARE.

Each week, we will spotlight some of the creative ways we are doing virtual teaching and learning! This week, our focus is on Ms. Cantwell’s Class at Lower Gwynedd. Ms. Cantwell uses her computer as a Smart Board where she can simulate exactly what students would see on the Smart Board in the regular classroom. She shares math journal pages, highlights important information, and solves problems! She has also been rolling out self-directed lessons where students follow along virtually. Since students are currently studying the American Revolution, they are taking a virtual field trip next week to the Museum of the American Revolution to explore the different exhibits and artifacts AND a virtual walking tour of Philadelphia to visit historic sites such as Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell. #WissLearns",0.0,"Wissahickon School District added 5 new photos.

The shiniest.
Mardi Gras 2020 with the HJO.
Starting with a TV appearance....moving onto to two Mardi Gras parties for my students at school with 2 King Cakes and mocktails and then.... the apex of a BIG house for both seatings at Chris's Jazz Cafe where we played our purple, green and gold hearts out for three sets.
Dang y'all....
That was the best Tuesday I remember ever having!
A HUGE thank you to everyone who came out to see us and especially to my long-serving band mates who quite literally make it all possible. And Chef Mark!!!
The cherry on top?
An actual New Orleanian who was stranded in Philly on Mardi Gras day was amazed at the authenticity of the music and food and general level of revelry and let me know very enthusiastically!

He was selected by Ms. Duke, the Faculty advisor, because of his commitment to Interact and the community. He attends every meeting with a positive attitude and a willingness to help everyone. He will even tell coaches that he will miss practice to attend meeting. Not many 7th and 8th graders are willing to skip sports to help others. Grayson does it with a smile on his face.

Over the past three years, Grayson has helped with every project from making gift tags for holiday gifts for patients who have not had visitors in over a year to making inspirational posters and cards for a parent of a middle school student who is awaiting a heart transplant. He has helped in our fundraising activities that help to support the Veteran’s Memorial and the Rotary’s school in Africa. He does everything with great gusto and enthusiasm!

He was selected by Ms. Duke, the Faculty advisor, because of his commitment to Interact and the community. He attends every meeting with a positive attitude and a willingness to help everyone. He will even tell coaches that he will miss practice to attend meeting. Not many 7th and 8th graders are willing to skip sports to help others. Grayson does it with a smile on his face.

Over the past three years, Grayson has helped with every project from making gift tags for holiday gifts for patients who have not had visitors in over a year to making inspirational posters and cards for a parent of a middle school student who is awaiting a heart transplant. He has helped in our fundraising activities that help to support the Veteran’s Memorial and the Rotary’s school in Africa. He does everything with great gusto and enthusiasm!

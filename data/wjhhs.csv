Favorite memory: My favorite memory was senior night this year for basketball. I never thought that night would come, but it did.

Advice for Underclassmen: Stay active and involved! It is exhausting, at times, but so so worth it. Clubs and sports are great ways to make memories and build relationships with your classmates. You gain a lot of experience in different areas when you get involved. Start early! When people say the four years fly by, they aren’t kidding!

Plans for after High School: My plans after High School are to attend UIS as undecided.

Thanks for sharing Elyse and best of luck!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=629942647591935&id=301710043748532,,0.0,"Senior Spotlight: Elyse Copelin

Favorite Memory: One of my favorite memories is sitting in the student section during basketball and football games or getting cheered on by them!!

Advice for Underclassmen: I would advise you to branch out! Try something new. We are given a lot of opportunities to join a club like chess, to take an Ag class at franklin, or to join a layed-back sport like golf!! You can meet so many new people, and it makes high school a lot more enjoyable!

Favorite Memory: Favorite memory of senior year would definitely have to be cheering in the regional game against West Central. The fan section was so excited, the crowd was shocked, and the boys were playing so well! It was easily my favorite game that I cheered for all season.

Advice for Underclassmen: Enjoy the time you have in high school. It does go by faster than you think and each year goes by faster than the last. Make everything fun, there is a positive side to every situation no matter how bad it may seem at the time, try to make the best of it with your friends and you will have memories that last forever!

Hello W-K Families,

As you know, we had July 17 reserved for Prom. As that date has become closer, we needed to make a decision.

We will need to cancel Prom.

We are saddened to do this, but the MN Department of Education and MN Department of Health mandates have not lifted enough to allow for an event like this. We know this is disappointing news, and we wish that we could continue the tradition. We are hopeful that we will be able to offer Prom in 2021. If any members of the class of 2020 would like to attend at that time, they are welcome.

Distance Learning Appreciation Parking Lot Parade

Monday, May 4th
8:30 AM - 9:00 AM
W-K Main Parking Lot

Staff will line the sidewalk of the main parking lot keeping proper social distance. Staff will be holding signs of encouragement, positivity and gratefulness.

Parents and students will enter the main parking lot and drive around the main parking lot. We will direct all cars leaving the parking lot during this time to turn right and go toward Wabasha. We know this may be inconvenient, but it will make it safer as we are hoping for and planning for a big turnout.

This event is a chance for us to see each other and say hi AND also say thanks for what we have all done during the COVID-19 pandemic while still being safe.

Staff will stay on the sidewalk and parade participants will need to stay in their vehicles.

Please be careful entering and exiting the parking lot.
We hope to see you even if for just a bit on Monday as we are so excited to see you!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1358898567637781&id=431111620416485,,0.0,"https://www.wabasha-kellogg.k12.mn.us/sites/wabasha-kellogg.k12.mn.us/files/files/Private_User/jfreihammer/FinalAppParade.pdf

This includes electronic devices, textbooks, other learning materials, the first two weeks of packets as well as other items in student lockers. Students will need these items for distance learning so it is necessary to get these materials in the hands of our families. A pick-up day is one way of distributing these important materials.

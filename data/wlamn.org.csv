Students learned about how scientists play an important role in our understanding of how the world works. Our students learned about the range of concepts studied in science by briefly reading about two scientists, Issac Newton and Jane Goodall. The K-2 kiddos learned about diffusion art, 3-5 students designed a never before seen robot, and the 6-8 students created a rocket with unique features when planning a safe trip to Mars.

Students learned about how scientists play an important role in our understanding of how the world works. Our students learned about the range of concepts studied in science by briefly reading about two scientists, Issac Newton and Jane Goodall. The K-2 kiddos learned about diffusion art, 3-5 students designed a never before seen robot, and the 6-8 students created a rocket with unique features when planning a safe trip to Mars.

Color Wheel:
After learning about scientists, it only seemed fitting to learn about theory. This week focused on color theory and the mixing of colors based upon the color wheel diagram. WLA kiddos found a unique way to visually represent the color wheel.",2020-05-14 09:07:08,,

We wanted to make you aware of an article from Pioneer Press regarding a ""dispute"" between Woodbury Leadership Academy and the St. Paul Public Schools. Below is our official statement:

""There is no friction between Woodbury Leadership Academy and St. Paul School District. When SPPS purchased the building we were leasing in February of '18, we were thankful that they absorbed our lease and allowed us to finish our 2017-18 school year uninterrupted. After the conclusion of our school year, SPPS understandably became anxious to begin their remodeling efforts. Due to their remodeling efforts during the last month of our lease, SPPS and WLA agreed on a rent reduction. WLA is very complimentary of the way that both organizations worked through the facility transition and wishes SPPS a successful first school year in their new building.""

Woodbury Leadership Academy will participate in the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) on February 27th, 2019.

NAEP is the largest nationally representative and continuing assessment of what students know and can do in various subjects. NAEP is administered by the National Center for Education Statistics, within the U.S. Department of Education. NAEP is different from our state assessments because it is a common measure of achievement across the country. The results are released as The Nation‚Äôs Report Card, which provides information about student achievement to educators, parents, policymakers, and the public.

If you have any questions, please contact: Ms. Grubisch at kgrubisch@wlamn.org. She's our District Assessment Coordinator (DAC).

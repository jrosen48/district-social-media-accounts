We usually observe Earth Day in our schools with a learning activity, celebration, or service-learning project. Though we can’t physically come together for those events at this challenging time, you can still join in with others to celebrate Earth Day at home with your families if you would like to do so.

The first Earth Day in 1970 resulted in the creation of the Clean Air, Clean Water, and Endangered Species Acts, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the United States, and many other countries soon adopted similar laws. We usually observe Earth Day in our schools with a learning activity, celebration, or service-learning project. Though we can’t physically come together for those events at this challenging time, you can still join in with others to celebrate Earth Day at home with your families if you would like to do so.

The annual Honor Our Teachers campaign is a special West Linn-Wilsonville tradition. Make a donation to Honor Our Teachers today. You choose the teachers and staff members to recognize, and each will receive a special certificate of appreciation and a note that your gift was made in their honor. It's a meaningful way to say thank you for the work they do with our students.

With a donation of $250 or more, we will include a $10 gift card for up to 4 teachers or staff members. (Gift cards are funded by a generous grant, so your total tax-deductible donation will be used to help fund additional teaching positions.)

Especially during this season of celebration, we appreciate your support of the excellence of our schools.

Wilsonville High School received a Unified Champion Schools National Banner at the Youth Leadership Summit on Tuesday, Oct. 9.

Unified Sports is a program through Special Olympics that blends equal numbers of Special Olympics athletes and athletes without intellectual disabilities (also known as unified partners) into one team.

Wilsonville High School was named a national Champion school after completing an application process last spring, joining just a handful of high schools across the country to receive the honor.

Special Olympics determined that Wilsonville School had met national standards of excellence in the areas of inclusion, advocacy, and respect.

We have been preparing to take our learning outside even more during these unprecedented times. Studies have shown that students who learn outdoors develop: a sense of self, independence, confidence, creativity, decision-making and problem-solving skills, empathy towards others, motor skills, self-discipline and initiative. In order for us to make sure students are comfortable and ready to learn this fall, we know they will need some shady areas, and while our 62 acre campus has forests for students to meet and learn, we still need some assistance with keeping cool and shaded.

Yesterday Gov. Whitmer announced the ""Return to School Road Map"". Our team is currently updating our plans and will be sharing and seeking feedback from all of you throughout the month of July. Thank you for all of your support during this time of uncertainty and know that we want nothing more than to see each of our students' smiling faces in the fall!

We want to answer all of your questions! This is why we have scheduled a virtual town hall on July 30th from 5:30-7:00. Details will be sent closer to the event.

In the meantime, check your email because a more detailed letter was just sent out. Included in the letter is a survey to hear from you. We are doing our very best to openly communicate and do what is best for our students. Our work will continue in the coming weeks as we utilize the Road Map.

Thank you!

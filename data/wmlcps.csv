A message from our Fifth Grade Team...

Good Afternoon,

Cople Elementary School will be holding a small ceremony at Cople to recognize the student's hard work. We are inviting families to drive through the Cople bus loop on Friday, any time between 3-6p.m. We will have certificates and goodie bags to hand out to each student and a designated area for photos if you are interested in taking pictures. Journee's garden will be available for picture opportunities as well.

Kayla Brown, Madison Clark, Lillian MacNamara, and Emily Swann participated in the 4th grade competition, and Izabella Bojorquez, Adrianah Brown, Kelsea Hill, and Nicole Rosier participated in the 5th and 6th grade competition. The students undertook 4 arctic-themed STEM challenges, from creating miniature catapults to ward off polar bears to building igloos out of marshmallows. In the 4th grade competition, Kayla, Madison, Lillian, and Emily placed 1st in three of the four challenges, and came home as the overall winners for the day.

The haircuts and drawing were all for a worthy cause. Each year Cople Elementary hosts a ""Haircut"" raffle in support of ""Children With Hair Loss"" and Relay for Life. ""Children With Hair Loss"" is an organization that creates wigs for children who have lost their hair due to medical treatments. All of the proceeds from the raffle go to Relay for Life-Northern Neck.

There will be a few more children who will receive wigs thanks to Lezlee and Mrs. Hutt. Also, Relay for Life - Northern Neck will receive a $108.00 donation thanks to the students and staff of Cople Elementary. Way to go, Cople Eagles!

Next week Mr. Cottom will bring robots to class and have the students use number patterns to program the robots.

Students in the other stations practiced place value by making groups of tens and writing numbers from 0-30. Math stations are allowing our students to collaborate, think creatively, and use their problem-solving skills.",0.0,"Cople Elementary School

Simply put...You can run for free if you volunteer three (3) hours of community service to any organization or pay a $20.00 fee. As we continue to push for the Pay it Forward mentality we thought this was another avenue to use.

This Westmoreland native came to teach nine years ago, and the impact he’s made since has been profound. As an involved staff member, Mr. Hutt not only shows his passion and love for our students in the classroom as a physical education and driver education teacher, but in athletics and in the community as well. Mr. Hutt coaches volleyball, baseball, and in his busy schedule even finds time to coach little league baseball.

This quarter, 29 of my students at Montross Middle School wrote 77 poems for a poetry quilt. Our purpose was to put the rest of the Northern Neck on notice: not only are Westmoreland students intelligent, but they’re talented too. Come out and check out their handiwork, buy a few raffle tickets; you might just get a piece of Westmoreland history to pass down to future generations.

Today was very special as we end Teacher Appreciation Week. My office paid a surprise visit to Mr. Wes James at Washington and Lee High School. He is retiring after 40 years committed to Westmoreland County Public Schools. He was my teacher and has made an impact on me and thousands of lives including other teachers. I encourage everyone to reach out to a teacher that made a difference in your life and thank them. Mr. James, we love you for all you have done to inspire the next generation and your co-workers!",8.0,"Margaret Bevans Ransone

Our PBL super stars!!!

PBL aka Project Based Learning, is a way of teaching so students can learn through creating. During the PBL process, students not only learn the content, but they learn how to collaborate with each other, manage their time and responsibilities, and problem solve.

By the end of this science PBL, our students will have learned about sound AND will have created a musical instrument out of at least 5 different recycled materials that can play 3 different pitches. 🎵🥁🎷🎸

Check out some pictures from an instrument building day today. Products are already looking (and sounding) great!

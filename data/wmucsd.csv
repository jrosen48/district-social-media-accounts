A few helpful first day of school things for the WMU 6-12 graders:

1. Instead of meeting in the big gym, like usual, we will meet in homerooms (don’t freak out yet)

2. Tomorrow I will post a list of students and their homerooms. Please check the list. If you are not on the list, please email kathy.mullin@wmucsd.org or rita.williams@wmucsd.org and it will be fixed.

3. If you forget what homeroom you are in, there will be lists posted around the school and all of the teachers will have the lists also. So breathe.

4. If you don’t know what room you are going to, or recognize the teacher’s name, we will help you.

5. In your homerooms, you will get schedules (things are still changing a bit), ids, talk about block scheduling, lunches, the return to learn plan, lockers, and all those things.

6. Remember, we will all be in the halls to help you between classes. If you need help at anytime, please ask. It’s a very different year, but one thing hasn’t changed, we are excited to see you all!!

WMU reminder- At the start of the 2017, there were changes made to Iowa immunization laws. Just a reminder that this affects our incoming 7th graders and 12th graders. I will need to have an updated form on file for this.

This change requires that all students entering, advancing or transferring into 7th grade will need proof of one dose of meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) and a Tdap (Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis/whooping cough) booster. All students entering, advancing, or transferring into 12th grade will need proof of two doses of the meningococcal (A, C W, Y) vaccine (or 1 dose if received when the applicant was 16 years of age or older).

Please note that a updated form needs to be turned into WMU prior to August 1st in order to start school. This is a great time to get in for the vaccines while the clinics are still slow! If your insurance allows, Public health is also a good place but don't forget to check their hours in the event of a change for covid.",0.0,"Brooke McArtor‎Winfield, IA Events & FOR SALE group

Dear W-MU Students and Parents,

We regret to inform you that the 2020 W-MU Junior-Senior Prom has been canceled. This decision is based on the recommendation of the Director of the Henry County Public Health Department, and taking into account the overall health and safety of our students and staff.

This is a very difficult decision, and one we’ve tried to find safe alternatives and solutions. However we’ve not been able to construct a viable plan or venue where health risks could be mitigated to the degree necessary for our students and staff.

Let’s go on a BEAR HUNT!!

Winfield I found this idea and I want to see if our community can do this for our families. I know my preschool kids and many other kids love the song “going on a bear hunt” so lets give them a bear hunt. This will give families something fun to do to get out of the house this weekend.

Anyone that wants to participate just put a teddy bear in your window so the families can go on a “bear hunt”. If you don’t have a teddy bear just put some sort of animal in your window so kids can look for them.

For 6-12 grade students and parents:

Starting on Monday, teachers will post activities on whatever site they use, Google Classroom or Edmodo. These will not be required or graded, but will help keep students active and working on their skills.

For students in Composition II, we will continue to work online so that you will receive college credit. Make sure your paper that was due today is in by Sunday and I will post something this weekend about the next thing we will be working on. They are allowing us to continue with Google Classroom, so that is much easier.

Any parents who want extra resources, please let us know. We will all be posting and trying to stay in contact as much as possible. All emails will be answered within 24 hours and some of us will post our phone numbers so you can message us that way also.

Please spread the word to anyone who may not have facebook or may not have follow this page or my page. Thank you!!

I couldn't be more proud of this young man. From getting his tail whooped as a freshmen, defensive mvp as a junior, and now a college football player. Your journey is just beginning, glad I was a part of it. You'll always be a wolf.

Yesterday was a day of trying something new for the Intro to Agriculture class too! There was struggling with remembering flower parts...so, we tried out a flower lab.

Students were given a cup with materials that had everything they needed (Mrs. Brown did a sample first to make sure they had enough supplies but hid hers away from students' eyes.) A list of parts was listed on the board and a sketch of a flower by Mrs. Brown to jog their memory. From there, students had to use their materials and list of terms on the board to create a flower, once they got it correct (flowers had to be labeled correctly OR they had to explain to Mrs. Brown the flower parts in their flower) they could eat their flower and the extra ingredients. #wmucsd",0.0,"WMU Ag Ed & Crooked Creek FFA

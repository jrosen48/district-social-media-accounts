And when you turn back and walk the the halls for the very last time, know that the walls are silently weeping and maybe you are too because you both realized that in order to go somewhere in life, you must have home.

If you need shoes (and all 8th grade students will need them) you must order them using this link. The instructions are easy and you can have them shipped to your home. These can be used next year in band as well, so this will eliminate one cost at the start of the year for you.

White Oak Band Booster Meeting Minutes
Jan. 12, 2015, 6:30 pm
Board Members Present: Donna Jennings, Tina Moyers


Topics discussed:  Disney Trip, Chaperones, Trip Payments, Calendars, Basketball Concession, Booster Treasurer, Sweet Auction


Calendar:  The calendars or the money for them is due!!  Please turn in one or the other.  Over 100 students have still failed to turn theirs in.  Please take care of this ASAP.


Disney Trip:  Mr. Steele sent email during Christmas break with information.   Please refer to it for details.  We are still not sure of hotel yet.  There has been a park added to make 4 parks we will be visiting.  A meal trip plan was discussed, but it ended up being too costly.  The band directors may possibly hold the students money and divvy out a set amount each day.  This will help ensure we have no starving children or broke chaperones (from loans).  Each meal averages $10 at the park.  So please plan accordingly.  Deposits have now been made on the busses and trip.  Any payments made toward the trip are NON-REFUNDABLE.  The itinerary is not set in stone yet and could still change.


Online Trip Payments:  We have uploaded our instructional video to YouTube. This video will show you step by step how to update your Charms Information and how make your trip payments online as well. Please remember that our trip payment deadlines are approaching. We hope the added connivence of online works well for many of you. This will help you make sure that your student doesn't lose a check, lose the cash or forget to turn things in on time. To view the video click the link:

http://youtu.be/ZmCFnmOodh8


Chaperones:  Once we have the first payment in, we will have a better idea of how many students will be going.  Once we know this, we will then be able to decide how many chaperones we will need.  Mrs. Jennings has a list for parents wanting to be considered as a chaperone.  Please contact her if you are wanting to be added to that list.  This does not ensure your being chosen.  Mr. Steele will choose chaperones from that list.


Sweet Music Auction:  Currently set for Feb. 28, but that date could change.


Treasurer:  Michele Cloer has stepped down, Mrs. Jennings will take over those duties for the rest of the school year.


Basketball Concession:  Please stay and help clean up at the end of your shift.  We have had an issue with students leaving before the concession stand has been closed down.  Stay until all the work is done.


Booster Officers:   President:  Donna Jennings JenningsD@woisd.net, Vice President:  Tina Moyers (manages concessions and foods), Secretary:  Melissa Schaetz (all correspondence & manages volunteers) MelissaSchaetz@gmail.com


Correspondence:  Please make sure your contact information is correct within your students profile on charms.  In order to receive mobile text messages, you MUST select your cell phone provider.


Facebook Page:  Please like our White Oak Band Booster page to receive last minute volunteer needs, Fundraiser information, and photos of the band.


Band App.: Mr. Cartwright has helped put together a free app for us to use. You can now go to the apple app store *iOS users* or the google play store *Android users* and search for ""White Oak Band"".


Charms: The middle school and high school bands use the Charms system online to keep all the students information and to communicate within the organization. Please take time to login and update yours and your student’s info if you have not done so already. The school code is woband, student area password is their school student ID.  Thanks so much for all the help you all give!

White Oak Band Booster Meeting Minutes
Jan. 12, 2015, 6:30 pm
Board Members Present: Donna Jennings, Tina Moyers


Topics discussed:  Disney Trip, Chaperones, Trip Payments, Calendars, Basketball Concession, Booster Treasurer, Sweet Auction


Calendar:  The calendars or the money for them is due!!  Please turn in one or the other.  Over 100 students have still failed to turn theirs in.  Please take care of this ASAP.


Disney Trip:  Mr. Steele sent email during Christmas break with information.   Please refer to it for details.  We are still not sure of hotel yet.  There has been a park added to make 4 parks we will be visiting.  A meal trip plan was discussed, but it ended up being too costly.  The band directors may possibly hold the students money and divvy out a set amount each day.  This will help ensure we have no starving children or broke chaperones (from loans).  Each meal averages $10 at the park.  So please plan accordingly.  Deposits have now been made on the busses and trip.  Any payments made toward the trip are NON-REFUNDABLE.  The itinerary is not set in stone yet and could still change.


Online Trip Payments:  We have uploaded our instructional video to YouTube. This video will show you step by step how to update your Charms Information and how make your trip payments online as well. Please remember that our trip payment deadlines are approaching. We hope the added connivence of online works well for many of you. This will help you make sure that your student doesn't lose a check, lose the cash or forget to turn things in on time. To view the video click the link:

Chaperones:  Once we have the first payment in, we will have a better idea of how many students will be going.  Once we know this, we will then be able to decide how many chaperones we will need.  Mrs. Jennings has a list for parents wanting to be considered as a chaperone.  Please contact her if you are wanting to be added to that list.  This does not ensure your being chosen.  Mr. Steele will choose chaperones from that list.


Sweet Music Auction:  Currently set for Feb. 28, but that date could change.


Treasurer:  Michele Cloer has stepped down, Mrs. Jennings will take over those duties for the rest of the school year.


Basketball Concession:  Please stay and help clean up at the end of your shift.  We have had an issue with students leaving before the concession stand has been closed down.  Stay until all the work is done.


Booster Officers:   President:  Donna Jennings JenningsD@woisd.net, Vice President:  Tina Moyers (manages concessions and foods), Secretary:  Melissa Schaetz (all correspondence & manages volunteers) MelissaSchaetz@gmail.com


Correspondence:  Please make sure your contact information is correct within your students profile on charms.  In order to receive mobile text messages, you MUST select your cell phone provider.


Facebook Page:  Please like our White Oak Band Booster page to receive last minute volunteer needs, Fundraiser information, and photos of the band.


Band App.: Mr. Cartwright has helped put together a free app for us to use. You can now go to the apple app store *iOS users* or the google play store *Android users* and search for ""White Oak Band"".


Charms: The middle school and high school bands use the Charms system online to keep all the students information and to communicate within the organization. Please take time to login and update yours and your student’s info if you have not done so already. The school code is woband, student area password is their school student ID.  Thanks so much for all the help you all give!

The contest officials work to keep the event on time, but there are times where it may be behind or ahead of schedule. Just to be safe, we would suggest you go ahead and start the live feed at 2:30. This way if we are running ahead of schedule you won't miss the performance. Our entire performance from setup/performance/exit will only take up 10 minutes at the most.

Due to our inability to get together with the entire group that is going on the Band trip this Summer we are required to have a few practices before we depart to get everything together for our performance. These practices are vital to our performance and anyone not in attendance will not be allowed to perform on the trip with the main group. We do not like to take time away from anyone during the summer but this is a necessity. Also, there will be 2 television stations that will be here to cover the practices for a story that will be broadcast throughout East Texas while we are on our trip.

We gave educators almost no notice. We asked them to completely redesign what school looks like and in about 24 hours local administrators and teachers ""Apollo 13'ed"" the problem and fixed it. Kids learning, children being fed, needs being met in the midst of a global crisis.
No state agency did this, no so-called national experts on curriculum. The local educators fixed it in hours. HOURS.
In fact, existing state and federal policies actually created multiple roadblocks. Local schools figured out how to do it around those too. No complaining and no handwringing - just solutions and amazingly clever plans.
Remember that the next time someone tries to convince you that schools are better run by mandates from non-educators. Remember that the next time someone tells you that teachers have it easy or try to persuade you that educators are not among the smartest, most ingenious people in society. And please never say to me again, ""Those who can't do anything else just go into teaching.""

The Centers for Disease Control provide excellent guidance for all of us in trying to prevent the flu:
* Wash and/or sanitize your hands frequently.
* If your child is sick, please keep them home.
* Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. After using a tissue, throw it in the trash and wash your hands.
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
* Clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with germs like the flu.

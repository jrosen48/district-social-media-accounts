First place goes to Payson Gohn, for his ""alternate alphabet""--very creative
Second place goes to Ethan Nelson for his ability to guess some of the things I would like to do
Third place goes to Lanessa Finn for the most creative entry, complete with artwork.
Honorable Mention goes to Faith Nelson for suggesting I try to get along better with Priscilla (my computer) and Eric Klanchnik who not only suggested I write a play, but gave me a premise for one.
I have no idea when prizes will be given, but these people will be receiving something--probably when I see them in the fall!

I appreciate how easy it was to come up with a continuous learning plan because we knew, we were working with the best school staff in Oklahoma to implement the plan. I am thankful for Rachelle, Kim, Donna, Tina, Carol, Deb, and Guillermo who are keeping our kids fed, daily. I am so proud to be a Woodall Wildcat! We are Woodall! Some wish for it....WE work for it! Thank you!",2020-09-16 12:53:32.435326,,

With the action taken by the State Board of Education today, we now have a directive. The leadership team along with teachers and staff will work virtually next week to develop our plan for continual learning for all Woodall students through May 8th.

We look forward to unveiling our plan and are excited to get back to the business of educating students. The delivery method may look different but I can assure you it will be good!

Please be watching for a survey about the technology you have available in your home. The information you provide will prove valuable as we gather resources to make available for students.

Notes from a Social Studies teacher:

Parents, I don’t have pre-teens or teenagers in my house yet but I’ve seen a few of my friends post and all I can say is... may the odds be ever in your favor. 🤪 BUT I came up with an idea for students that I think would be a fun and educational thing for them to do.

For my 6th-8th classes we have talked about what a primary source is. Right now your kids are living through history. A history lesson that they will probably take in the next few years and even beyond that will talk about with their kids one day. They are a primary source, a first hand account of whats happening. I’ve attached a possible *lesson* or fun activity that you all can do together. Tell them to save them! It will come in handy some day. Enjoy and please share what they come up with to satisfy my nerdy teacher heart. ❤️",0.0,"Something for our older Woodall students. Thanks Mrs Fourkiller.

5/6th grade girls lost their opener 24-12 but played hard and never quit.

5/6th boys won big 26-7 they got after it and played really tough.

Varsity Girls picked up right where they left off from last year. They look to be extremely athletic and will have key pieces coming of the bench that will help them continue to get up and down the court. They won it going away 47-4!!! They also broke out some new threads for tonight’s game!!!

The football boys were still in football form and haven’t quite made the transition to basketball with only practicing a couple days. It was not pretty at all but came away with the win. They play hard and you won’t lacking for entertainment 😀!!! They came away with the 49-27 win. Good night of basketball for the Wildcat Nation.

I also understand that the 3/4th grade boys were the winners of our tournament.
Congratulations Fellas!!!

Woodall Orange places 3rd in the girls bracket!! Way to play ladies!!!

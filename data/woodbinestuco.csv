Tigers survive and advance with a huge rivalry win in OT over Logan Magnolia in the first round of district play 52-49. We dug ourselves two double digit holes but our boys never quit and refused to let their season end early. Wyatt Pryor took over in the 2nd half and led the way with 18 points. Layne Pryor made a surprise return to the court to add 13 as well. Dylan Hoefer played inspired defense on a tough assignment all night and our other four contributors played steady and with incredible effort for all 36 minutes. As a wise man once said (Layne) “The band is back together.!” We get our third crack at rival Boyer Valley on Tuesday back at St Alberts at 6:30. Our crowd was incredible and we are looking forward to at least one more opportunity to play in front of all of you!

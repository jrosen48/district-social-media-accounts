Consistent with guidance from the CDC, the Delaware Division of Public Health recommended that Delawareans should wear cloth face coverings in public settings where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Those settings include grocery stores and pharmacies.

Delaware’s response to COVID-19 has been driven by science, and will continue to be driven by science. Our goal is simple. We are working to prevent a surge in cases, protect hospital capacity, and save lives. The science tells us that wearing a face covering in certain public settings can help prevent transmission and spread of the COVID-19 virus.

But wearing a face covering is not an excuse to spend more time in public. Stay home. Don’t go out in public unnecessarily. Wash your hands. Disinfect surfaces frequently. It’s important we all do our part to get through this.

Today, we launched Delaware Housing Assistance Program to help to renters affected by shutdowns, closures, layoffs, reduced work hours, or unpaid leave due to COVID-19. The Delaware State Housing Authority (DSHA) program will provide eligible households up to $1,500 in assistance, with payments made directly to the property owner or utility company.

From restaurant workers and small business owners, to hair stylists and barbers, we know many Delawareans are facing a very challenging time as they struggle with the economic effects of the public health emergency.

We hope this assistance program will give Delaware families, especially our most vulnerable neighbors, some peace of mind as this situation continues to evolve.

The additional protections in this order are essential to help support Delawareans – especially our most vulnerable neighbors – as this situation evolves. This is an extremely challenging economic situation for many of our neighbors, and we need to do what we can to support them.

After consulting with various community partners and reviewing current COVID-19 State quarantine guidelines, we have decided to deviate from our original plan to host a physical elementary wide teacher parade on Tuesday, April 14th. We have decided to err on the utmost side of safety for our students, staff and the broader Woodbury community. We are committed, however, to maintain a connection with our students, families and staff at this time. As a result, we will be modifying our original plan and holding an Elementary wide VIRTUAL school spirit week from Tuesday April 14th – Friday April 17th. We believe this will allow us to connect with our Woodbury families and create multiple opportunities to celebrate each other in a way that maintains the safety of all.

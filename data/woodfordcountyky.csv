Mr. Wade is the maintenance director for the Woodford County Fiscal Court and his duties extend to nearly every county owned property from the Courthouse to the Jouett House. He has worked tirelessly since March to ensure Woodford County employees have clean workspace to carry out their tasks and continues to incorporate physical changes to allow better delivery of services to the community. As if that weren't enough to keep him busy in addition to his normal responsibilities, Rick is overseeing the startup of a multi-million dollar energy efficiency project.

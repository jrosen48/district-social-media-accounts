With all that our students are exposed to through the news outlets and adult conversations, please have a conversation with your children about the importance of not using the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) as a joke. You might have heard that a student made an announcement in class which has been investigated and found untrue. These tall tales so to speak can cause unnecessary panic in our schools and community.

Thank you for your assistance.

Tonight Officer Leathers and I (Officer Colin), had the pleasure of meeting Gabby and Ashlynn. They have stopped to talk with dozens of Officers, Deputies, and Troopers from Gennesse County to St Clair County, and give them a lovely gift. Gabby and Ashlynn wanted Officers to know that they have our backs! Mom said the girls goal is to stop in every county in Michigan!

Both Officer Leathers and I received awesome Thin Blue Line canvas'. Officer Leathers canvas said ""Matthew 5:9 - Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God."" My canvas said ""John 15:18 - If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first.""

Thank you Gabby and Ashlynn! Both of our canvas' will be hung in our office! Keep up the good work! We appreciate you.

Combining science, sensory, and art into age appropriate lessons that help build the foundation for future academic success.

Mrs. Mayberry and her Kindergarten students made Oobleck yesterday. In the science world, Oobleck is knows as a non-newtonian fluid. What that means is it acts as both a solid and a liquid. When you apply pressure to the substance, it becomes solid. Then when you loosen up on the substance, it flows like a liquid.

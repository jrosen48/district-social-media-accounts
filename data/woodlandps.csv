Unlike the past spring, Woodland’s teachers hold live classes on a daily schedule this fall with student attendance being mandatory unless a student’s family arranges for asynchronous learning using recorded video lessons. Students receive assignments and earn grades just like in traditional in-person school, with teachers offering additional time for students who need one-on-one or small group assistance with lessons.

Grace and Abigail Heffernan perform on oboe and flute",2.0,"Grace and Abigail Heffernan continue their learning from home by practicing their musical instruments.

Grace Heffernan, a seventh grader at Woodland Middle School who plays the oboe, and her sister, Abigail who’s in sixth grade and plays flute, both take Bryana Steck’s Beginning Band class and have continued working on their performance pieces as well as playing new songs from their books during the statewide school closure.

Grace also participates in the Trojan Band where she plays the flute. Abigail, a budding artist, has been taking part in daily art projects following WMS Art Teacher Nicole Caulfield’s inspiration prompts at #Bunkerart. (https://bunker-art.com/)

Both sisters take part in school athletics. Abigail’s basketball season was cut short and both of them are missing track and field, however, their dad has helped them stay in shape by coaching them both in running.

Way to go, Grace and Abigail!

Serious health issues were found in more than 6% of the screened students – 1,336 students so far – and those students received further follow-up and treatment thanks to the results of their health screening. “We’re just as concerned about students who are less active as we are about student athletes,” said Lydia. “This service offers another level of health protection for our youngest population, helping them identify potentially life-threatening conditions and beginning treatment before they become serious.”

NEW ROUTE FOR PARADE!

Event organizer Chris Gehrke and the VFW, will be hosting a Memorial Day Parade Monday, May 25th. This will not be the typical parade due to COVID-19 and Governor Pritzker’s Executive Orders.

Interested participants are asked to meet in the parking lot(s) of Northwood Middle School, Verda aDierzen, Mary Endres at 10:30 AM where they will line up; the parade will be leaving the site at 11:00 AM. Vehicles may be tastefully decorated to honor the men and women who died serving our country.

Real Woodstock is about bringing people together in one of the prettiest towns anywhere. The new ""Welcome Home"" campaign raises awareness of Woodstock as a great place to call home. In addition to a digital campaign, Real Woodstock can be seen in Chicago on JCDecaux bus shelters, at Woodfield Mall and at Chicago Wolves games at the Allstate Arena.

The campaign highlights Woodstock's excellent schools, its charm and history and its independent, creative streak through the stories of Lori Miarecki of The Cherry Tree Inn Bed and Breakfast, community leader Pam Moorhouse, Arlene Lynes of Read Between The Lynes, the D200 Dual Language program and many more.

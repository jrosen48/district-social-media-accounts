NHS Fundraiser
The Woonsocket National Honor Society is doing a Flusher Fundraiser this year to raise money for their organization, which will take place throughout the town from September 16th-30th. It is a decorated toilet that will be going around town as a lawn decoration. It will be $10 to be removed from your lawn, and placed on a new lawn of your choice. You can call/text Emily Henriksen at 605-933-1102 or Dayna Rodriguez at 605-520-4544 and one of the NHS students will be there as quickly as possible to remove it, collect the $10 and take it to its next destination. NHS Students will knock on you door to collect funds. You can pay in cash or make checks out to the Woonsocket National Honor Society.

If you would like to purchase “Insurance” for an extra $5 to make sure the Lawn Decoration doesn’t return to your house, just let us know!",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1857834954336320&id=824134774373015,,0.0,"Reminder!! It starts tonight!

""How can we maintain predictability, consistency and sense of belonging? Given the stress and the potentially traumatic impact of the COVID-19 crisis, predictable and consistent routines are critically important in helping students feel calm and comfort in the face of stress. Providing a structure that enables students to know when their teacher will be available to them can be a lifesaver for many children. Knowing that there will continue to be an opportunity to interact with peers online can be exciting and energizing for students, solidifying their sense of belonging and their enthusiasm about returning to the school community when the crisis is over.""

Unfortunately, due to school closures, our annual art show was cancelled. I am thankful to have found Artsonia and appreciate their support in connecting the art program with families.

Student work is displayed publicly only if your child has been granted permission on Artsonia. You can do this at any time. Please let me know if you need assistance. Additionally, 5th grade art was scheduled for quarter 4, so I do not have any work that was completed at school. You can email me artwork or add it to Artsonia via classroom mode (directions were sent home last month in school deliveries and are posted on this facebook page). I will gladly add any 5th grade art to the art show.

Good morning WCS families!

On Friday, April 3rd, we will be parading through the streets of Worcester and East Worcester in our cars to see you! Make signs and show us your WCS Pride!…But please remember SOCIAL DISTANCING! Remember to stand at LEAST 6 feet from others.

#COVIBOOK
Supporting and reassuring children around the world
Dear families and educators all over the world,
I have created this short book to support and reassure our children, under the age of 7, regarding the COVID-19. This book is an invitation for families to discuss the full range of emotions arising from the current situation. It is important to point out that this resource does not seek to be a source of scientific information, but rather a tool based on fantasy. My recommendation is to print this material so children can draw on it. Remember that emotions are processed through repetitive play and stories read multiple times. Share COVIBOOK and help ease kiddo's anxiety all over the world.
With love,
Manuela Molina - the author

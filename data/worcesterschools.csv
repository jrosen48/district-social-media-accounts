Good Evening,

This is Maureen Binienda, Superintendent of the Worcester Public Schools.

Earlier today, Governor Baker announced that public schools will stay closed through the end of the school year. The last day of school for the WPS is June 12th. The Governor shared this is a necessary step to keep everyone as healthy as possible. I understand this announcement may result in a range of emotions among our staff, students and families. I want you to know the WPS staff will continue to help our students and their families through multiple ways such as phone calls, google chats, zoom calls and google voice. Remote learning is even more important now, and we will issue additional guidance to students and families later this week. The WPS District staff will be working during the next two weeks with high school principals and staff to address senior interests such as graduation, college acceptances, scholarships, and final grades. I will continue to keep you updated.

We’d like to thank the members of the Worcester Police Department (Official) and Worcester Fire Department that joined us at our school as part of the Community Readers Initiative. Our students enjoyed listening to our community members read, and hear from them of the importance of reading and writing in their professional lives. We had a great time focusing on reading here at Clark St Community School, and learning about the various roles Police Officers and Firefighters play in the community. Above all, we celebrated the reader in all of us during this Reading Across America Week.

One of the world’s extreme vistas, the Salar de Uyuni of Bolivia is the world’s largest salt flat. A prehistoric lake that evaporated left behind this massive salt flat stretching for over 4,050 square miles of the Altiplano. A thick crust of salt covers the entire landscape here. But the most magical part is when at certain times of the year, the surrounding lakes overflow and a thin layer of water covers the salt flat. You have the world’s largest mirror then! The entire salt flat reflects the vast blue sky and you can imagine how surreal that would look! The Salar de Uyuni is also of great commercial significance as salt and lithium are extracted in vast amounts at the site. The world’s first salt hotel is also located here.

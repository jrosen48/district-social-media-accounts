Junior High and High School are hard...there's the pressure you put on yourself. The pressure you get from your teachers. Pressure from your parents. And then friends. Anxiety and worry can drown all logical thoughts. I'm 35 years old and I can let the smallest comment - or lack of a comment make my head begin to swim with self doubt or loathing. I understand and I'm here.

This is a guidance lesson on anxiety that I was going to do with you this month....for state testing and life purposes. I wanted you to still be able to see my words and maybe in a moment of panic they will bring you comfort. I love you.",0.0,"Mrs. Duke's anxiety guidance lesson for junior high and high school üíô

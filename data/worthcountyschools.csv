Today we received a special donation of face masks. Janya Green, 4H farm manager of The Village Community Garden, Sylvester GA, donated face masks she made for healthcare workers. Also, in attendance was Rep. Bill Yearta who sponsored the face mask project.

Janya, who is 16 years old and already very active in the community, said she felt a need to do something during these challenging times to help. So, as part of the 4H Village Community Garden she started sewing masks and has posted virtual lessons on the garden's Facebook page to teach others within the community how to sew a face mask.

Thank you Janya and Rep. Bill Yearta for your support and donation!

Positive Attitude:

Being positive in any situation allows a person to find solutions rather than create problems.
Always have a positive attitude no matter what the circumstance.

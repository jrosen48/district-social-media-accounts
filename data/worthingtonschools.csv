Every day Worthington Schools’ officials are evaluating and re-evaluating decisions that need to be made to keep our families and staff members safe. Yesterday, Governor DeWine, along with Ohio Department of Health Director Amy Acton, M.D. MPH, made a recommendation that large, indoor gatherings in Ohio be canceled or postponed due to concerns over the spread of the coronavirus.

This decision is not an easy one, but we do think it is the right one. We have decided to postpone Pancake Day, scheduled for Saturday, March 14 at Worthington Kilbourne High School. Additional communication will be sent when we have more details.

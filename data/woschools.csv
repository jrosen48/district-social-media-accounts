Acknowledging the need for more direct and thoughtful communication on a very important topic, the West Orange Board of Education recognizes that our statement published yesterday fell short for our community, and we apologize.

We join all families in sadness over the wrongful death of George Floyd. At no point was our intention to minimize the pain that so many of our West Orange families and staff are experiencing or to fail to recognize and reaffirm that Black Lives Matter.

We are all committed to doing our part to work with the administration and community to identify and create sustainable action, and to amplify the work this Board has done and will continue to do for the equity of our black/brown students and their families. Watch for a further statement detailing this past, current, and future work.

Due to the unprecedented nature of the Coronavirus Pandemic, the National Honor Society application process and induction ceremony will be moved to the Fall of the 2020 - 2021 school year. As we do not have an official return date to school, this decision is in the best interest of rising senior students, allowing them time to complete the application and have the induction ceremony they deserve in the beginning of the 2020 - 2021 school year. Moving the application due date to the fall will also allow rising seniors to focus on E-Learning at this time and not stress about completing the application. Additionally, this provides the advisors and the NHS committee team a chance to properly and equitably review all applications to ensure that every student has a fair chance of becoming a National Honor Society member. Lastly, we want to assure students and parents that holding the induction in the fall will not affect a student’s chances of getting into college.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3453790077970845&id=161886643827888,,0.0,"𝐍𝐀𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍𝐀𝐋 𝐇𝐎𝐍𝐎𝐑 𝐒𝐎𝐂𝐈𝐄𝐓𝐘 𝐔𝐏𝐃𝐀𝐓𝐄:

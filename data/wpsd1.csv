We all know that our Coyote Family is full of smart, generous, caring individuals, so it should not come as a surprise that so many people showed up today to help us raise money for the Innovation Academy.

But to say we are overwhelmed by the support is quite possibly the understatement of the century!

So many people and companies to thank, but first and foremost, we need to give a huge shout-out to Equinor! Your commitment to the community is so appreciated. You guys knocked it out of the park and we can’t thank you enough.

We will share the other donors once we’ve had a chance to catch our breath!

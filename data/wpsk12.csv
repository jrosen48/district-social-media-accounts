As I am sure many are aware, with the exception of the Wilmington High School, none of the other schools in the district have building-wide air conditioning. While some schools benefit from AC in a few common spaces and classrooms, the vast majority of instructional spaces throughout our district do not.

Although forecasts point to temperatures being slightly lower tomorrow, it appears that the humidity is expected to rise. These factors, coupled with little opportunity for the built-up heat to dissipate overnight, will quickly lead to conditions that again will be extremely challenging.

30,0.0,,1.0,,261013264542035,"Due to the current forecast for the continued excessive heat warning, there will be an Early Release on Wednesday, August 29, 2018. All schools will follow the normal early release schedule (3 hours earlier than normal release). There will be no afternoon CARES or afternoon/evening activities.

I want to assure you that the safety of our students and staff is the priority in making these decisions. While I recognize that the timing is unfortunate given our start of school this week, the extreme conditions anticipated for tomorrow are of even greater concern than today.
Please note that revised orientation schedules for parents/guardians of incoming pre-school and kindergarten students will be sent out by the Early Childhood Directors later this evening.

The early release schedule is as follows:
Middle School 10:40
High School 11:05
North Intermediate 11:25
Woburn Street 11:25
West Intermediate 12:00
Shawsheen Elementary 12:00

Superintendent of Schools",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=261013264542035&id=131560690820627,,0.0,"Due to the current forecast for the continued excessive heat warning, there will be an Early Release on Wednesday, August 29, 2018. All schools will follow the normal early release schedule (3 hours earlier than normal release). There will be no afternoon CARES or afternoon/evening activities.

I want to assure you that the safety of our students and staff is the priority in making these decisions. While I recognize that the timing is unfortunate given our start of school this week, the extreme conditions anticipated for tomorrow are of even greater concern than today.
Please note that revised orientation schedules for parents/guardians of incoming pre-school and kindergarten students will be sent out by the Early Childhood Directors later this evening.

The early release schedule is as follows:
Middle School 10:40
High School 11:05
North Intermediate 11:25
Woburn Street 11:25
West Intermediate 12:00
Shawsheen Elementary 12:00
Thank you for your understanding.

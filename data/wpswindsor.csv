To learn more, please watch this 2-minute student video that describes the SWEAT experience: https://youtu.be/XS3RZfJhJlA

The SWEAT program (Senior Workshops Enabling a Smooth Academic Transition) is series of workshops focused on helping incoming seniors take a weight off their shoulders and get their post-secondary materials completed or started prior to entering into senior year. The three workshops offered to students are The College Application Process, The College Essay, and Resume Writing and Letters of Recommendation. Each workshop also involves SAT prep to help students boost their scores, as well as a crash course in college jargon to help students become aware of the financial aid, admissions, and academic language of the college world. Attendance for each day of the workshop you are enrolled in is mandatory.

Each workshop will also award one student a scholarship of $250 based on consistent attendance, participation, merit, and need.

For the past five weeks, using EvanLEE Organics grow racks, the cafeterias have been growing organic microgreens, basil, lemon basil, parsley, cilantro, and crispino (a cross between green leaf and head lettuce).

Students find these healthy greens in their lunchtime salads and sauces. Fresh basil is added to their pizza, and fresh cilantro is added to the bean salsa.

In the photos, WHS cafeteria manager, Cindy Todd, shows what's growing!",2019-04-05 09:45:28,,

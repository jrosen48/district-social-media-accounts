Recently, we've received quite a few calls and emails about 'not hearing anything' after registering for the 2020-2021 school year. Rest assured, that is completely normal (even during a global pandemic believe it or not). 😉
Despite the delay in communication, we are always here to help! The district office is also working diligently over the summer to ensure every Leaman kiddo is properly accounted for until we find ourselves seated in our new home on campus.
With the help of our district office team, we are working on compiling a list of pre-registered Leaman students so we can maintain open lines of communication, even during the summer months.

What can you do in the meantime to keep up with the Joneses? 🤠

Good morning LHS! I wanted to put on your radar this morning the cool site, ""Some Good News""- John Krasinkski is hosting a virtual prom for all of the high school students, like you guys, who missed out on having a prom this year! If you have not seen anything from this site yet, it is pretty darn cool. You should check out the experience he created for a young lady, and for the rest of us, who missed out on getting to see the play Hamilton due to COVID-19 closures. It won't be like having your own prom- but it might be worth a watch!

Here is an article with a link to his invite to his virtual prom!

When I heard that schools were closing until at least April because of COVID-19, like many people, I had a moment of panic. Not only would I not get to continue my relationship with the kids in our communities, but I am self-employed. My school visits are my only source of income for my family. I went to bed that night tossing and turning, worried about my family's finances, my mortgage, keeping everyone healthy, etc. But I woke up the next morning with a sense of peace and clarity. This is NOT the time to give up!

So, STARTING THIS TUESDAY, MARCH 17TH, AT 1PM, I will be doing live broadcasts on youtube every weekday for kids who are stuck at home, don't have many ways to spend their time besides cartoons and video games, or who just want to hear from me:) I will be sharing positive messages, be available for everyone to interact with me, and of course, sharing ways to stay active and keep moving at home!

Last week, a group of art students had the opportunity to take a trip to the Crocker Art Museum in Sacramento. Several students have never been to a museum before! It was a great experience for all!
In March, students will have the opportunity to go see the play Hamilton in San Francisco, with the help of a grant. They will even meet some of the cast members before the play! Increasing our student's exposure to the arts is just one way we are creating more opportunities our students.

Whether it is help in reading, writing, math, or even getting a GED, individuals can get one-on-one tutoring by library trained volunteers. This individualization means adults learn what they need or want to learn, at their own pace. Best of all, tutoring is free and only takes 1.5 hours of your time each week.

COVID-19 UPDATE: RESPONSE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

TO REQUESTS FOR LOCAL AIRPORT CLOSURES

Wrangell, AK – Many Wrangell residents have asked if the City & Borough of Wrangell (CBW) can mandate closure of the airport as a way to prevent further risk of COVD-19 being introduced to the community by an incoming passenger. The CBW does not own, nor does it have the authority to close the airport terminal (owned and operated by Alaska Airlines), or the airport runway (owned and operated by the Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities).

Recently, the Alaska Department of Transportation issued the attached letter explaining why the Department will not be closing any airports due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

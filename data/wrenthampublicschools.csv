I am very sorry for the late notice, but out of an abundance of caution I am closing Delaney and Roderick Schools tomorrow, Friday, March 13, 2020. Nothing in Wrentham has changed since my email from earlier today. However, I understand the concerns about coronavirus in our community and think it best to close school. I will participate in a conference call with the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education tomorrow morning. After that, I will make longer terms plans for the district in collaboration with the King Philip Regional School District. I will email you tomorrow with the details.

Again, I apologize for the late notice. Have a nice evening. I will be in touch tomorrow.

Good evening! I am writing to tell you about the weather forecast for our area. Wrentham will be under a winter weather advisory from 1:00 a.m. through 1:00 p.m. on Tuesday, 12/17/2019. We are supposed to get 2-4 inches of snow followed by sleet and freezing rain. The timing of the storm makes it difficult to know whether we will have school. I will talk with the Wrentham DPW, our Facilities Manager, and the KP superintendent tomorrow morning before I make the decision. I will call you by 5:30 a.m. if school is delayed or closed.

Have a nice night!

I just completed the after-action review meeting regarding our delay this morning due to the power outage. We identified many things that went well and areas for improvement in case we experience a similar situation in the future. I want to share three points about today that will bring closure to the day:

-The schools did not lose power when the accident occurred at 5:15 am. National Grid shut the power off when they arrived to fix the problem, around 7:10 am. That is why the delay notice went out so late.
-The YMCA, Wrentham PD, and Delaney and Roderick staff members were amazing! They remained positive, responsive, and supportive throughout the morning.
- Most importantly, the driver of the vehicle that hit the pole was not injured.

Thank you again for your patience today. Let's hope tomorrow morning is better!

Earlier this morning, Bus 7 had a minor accident involving a parked car at approximately 8:05 a.m. The bus tire connected with the bumper of a parked car. This caused a brief delay in traveling to school as the police arrived on scene following protocol. There were no injuries and Bus 7 families were alerted as soon as we were contacted by the bus company.

All arrived safely at school shortly after 8:30 a.m. and were greeted by Miss Maloney, Mr. Martes, and Mr. Worth. Students were happy and smiling as they walked to class and the day continued as planned.

Last week, the Sun Chronicle ran an article about the start of school in Wrentham. Unfortunately, they printed the wrong date for the first day of school. They printed a correction, but I want to make certain everyone knows when school starts for Delaney and Roderick students.

The first day of school for Delaney and Roderick students, kindergarten through grade 6, is Tuesday, September 3rd. This is the day after Labor Day.

I apologize for the confusion. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Yours truly,

The National Weather Service issued a severe weather warning for Norfolk County. They are predicting snow starting tomorrow afternoon around 2:00, transitioning to sleet and freezing rain overnight and finishing as rain around sunrise on Wednesday morning. Based on the timeline in that forecast, Delaney and Roderick will be open regular hours tomorrow, Tuesday, February 12. Depending on how the storm develops, I may cancel after-school activities. If that happens, or in the unlikely event that we have to close school early, I will send you an email tomorrow morning.

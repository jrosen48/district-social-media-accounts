“I'm super proud of several of my 8th graders. I realize this isn't 100% accurate. I have several students working with the packets and I have no way of knowing if those are complete or not. This is just regarding those students working solely online. With that being said, a HUGE congrats, kudos, thank you, well done, you're amazing, I think you're fantastic, SHOUTOUT to Jessica, Jada, Dillon, Kylen, Kirk, Timmy M., Lucy and Zakk for having EVERYTHING up to this point completed and turned in!! I know this remote learning isn't easy. I know this is new for all of us but way to stick with it!! If you're not done and need help finishing something, please let me know and I'll do my best to help out!” Great job to ALL students who are doing their best under these hard times of remote learning.

Mrs. Twichell's 6th grade students wrote letters to thank our local Law Enforcement for all that they do to serve in our community. Officer Thomas from the WRPD stopped by to pick theirs up, so I took a picture of him with one of Mrs. Twichell's classes. We appreciate our Police so much.

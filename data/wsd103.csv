Dear Woodburn School Community,

Thank you for your patience during these challenging times.
This evening, March 17th, Governor Kate Brown ordered that public schools are to remain closed to students from March 16, 2020, through April 28, 2020, unless that period is extended or ended earlier by the Governor.

We know this creates a hardship on our entire community and we will be communicating very soon on how we will work to support the continuation of the educational and support services provided by our schools.

We will be receiving further guidance from the Oregon Department of Education tomorrow and we will continue to provide further details and updates for you as this information becomes available. Our guidance continues to be informed by The Oregon Health Authority, The Oregon Department of Health and Human Services, and by the Oregon Department of Education.

Back to school means be alert!

The Woodburn Police Department will conduct traffic safety enforcement during the beginning of the school year, starting Tuesday, September 3 through Friday, September 13, 2019. This will take place throughout all Woodburn School Zones.

Officers will be focusing on enforcing speed, seat belt usage, unlawful use of mobile devices while driving and any other unsafe driving violations. The goal of traffic safety enforcement is to keep students, school staff and community members safe during this school season. WPD wants to remind everyone that most school zones in Woodburn have reduced school speed zone laws of 20 miles per hour between 7:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on all school days, and that traffic violations in these zones face enhanced fine amounts.

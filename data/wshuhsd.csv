Yesterday, Governor Gavin Newsom, State Superintendent Tony Thurmond and LA County Superintendent Deborah Duardo all called for schools to extend the closure of their facilities through the end of this academic year. These recommendations reflect a concern among health officials that the unchecked spread of the coronavirus could overwhelm our medical infrastructure. The extension of school closures enables social distancing and will help “flatten the curve.”

Therefore, I’m writing to let you know that the physical closure of all Hart District schools will be extended through June 4, 2020. School remains “in session,” but will continue to be conducted through virtual means.

This is Mike Kuhlman, Deputy Superintendent, with a special message to the Hart District community.

It has been nearly two months since that terrible day at Saugus High School. Despite the passage of time, we remain heartsick over those injured and lost. We recognize that many in our community continue to grapple with the fear and anxiety that understandably follows from such a traumatic event.

The purpose of this message is to share some of the work that has been done, and the plans that have been put in place, since the tragedy on November 14. We are determined to appropriately REMEMBER and honor the memories of the victims. We are committed to minister to the needs of those physically and emotionally impacted by this crisis – and to put supports in place to help them fully RECOVER.

Ravinder Athwal (Bowman), Tom Gavin (West Ranch) and Judy Jennings (Hart) had to first go through safety and mission training, and endured several flight postponements, before finally getting off the ground out of Palmdale. The mission was on NASA’s Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), which is a Boeing 747 that has been converted into a flying observatory. A 15-ton, infrared telescope was built into the fuselage of the aircraft, with the interior of the plane filled with computers and instrumentation capturing raw data from the cosmos.

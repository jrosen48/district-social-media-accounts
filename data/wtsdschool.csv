A few parents have emailed me about student drop off and pick up at Atco. Our procedure is not as involved as WES and Assumption. Buses will line up on Cooper Road and parents will drop off/pick-up in the parking lot along side of the school. We plan to have two options forpick up: 1) Drive up and form line along the curb or 2) Park in the designated area and walk up. Circles have been painted for social distancing purposes.

Parents will need to show identification, but not physically sign out. We will call students down similar to how we call buses to ensure social distancing.

All buildings are in the final stages of preparation. Teachers will be able to enter the buildings to get classrooms ready on Monday. Class lists have been finalized and mailed. Transportation routes are in process. The mailing will go out late next week.

Our only issue to date is... we could use DISINFECTANT WIPES! If you happen to be in a place where they have them in stock the district would appreciate the donation. Just send them into school with your child. Although we have a supply, they are very difficult to get at this time and we anticipate using them more frequently than previous years.

As always, we appreciate your support during this challenging time.

Stay healthy,

I hope you are enjoying the warm weather ad sunshine!

I have included a link to the Parent Survey results from earlier this month. As we await the NJDOE guidance, we will begin to carve out time for our committee discussions in regards to reopening.

After reviewing the results, I anticipate the need for at least one more parent survey. I will keep you informed as things begin to further develop. In the meantime, enjoy the summer!

I hope you are enjoying the warm weather ad sunshine!

I have included a link to the Parent Survey results from earlier this month. As we await the NJDOE guidance, we will begin to carve out time for our committee discussions in regards to reopening.

After reviewing the results, I anticipate the need for at least one more parent survey. I will keep you informed as things begin to further develop. In the meantime, enjoy the summer!

I realize it wasn't easy, even quite challenging at times, but we all pulled together as a community to make the best of it for the children.

In 15 years as an administrator, I usually hear from people when there's a problem, but during this time I had so many parents reach out to show appreciation. Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts! We all need a pat on the back now and then. Sometimes it's just enough to keep us going in a difficult time.

I will be providing updates about our reopening plans in the weeks to come, but in the meantime enjoy the SUMMER! School is officially out! üòä

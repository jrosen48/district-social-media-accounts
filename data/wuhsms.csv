Meet Alice Sperber:
Extracurricular Activities: Soccer, Alpine, Track and Field, Student Council (President - 12), NHS.
Favorite WUHSMS Memory: My junior year we had a strong soccer team, but at the beginning of the season we didn’t realize how strong. We had a winning record and ended up winning the Marble Valley League. In that same season I scored my first and only varsity goal against Hartford and it was really fulfilling because I have always played defense. Coming off of a great soccer season I transitioned into ski racing pretty quickly. We had a pretty good season with a deep roster too. Going into states we were confident in our ability to perform and we ended up winning states and I also made the eastern team to represent Vermont at the Eastern High School Championships along with two others from Woodstock.
Plans after WUHSMS: University of Vermont Majoring in Biology.

Congratulations, Alice!

Meet Sam Powers:
Extracurricular Activities: Cross-Country Running, Cross-Country Skiing, Tennis, Math Team, Scholar's Bowl, Theatre
Zack's Place Snowshoeing, Joshin' with Ms. Piccoli, Culture Club
Favorite WUHSMS Memory: Janet North came up to me in the library and asked if I would help present about the Ottauquechee Health Foundation's fundraising efforts. I said yes and she then proceeded to hand me a manila envelope. Inside said envelope was a one-piece swimsuit. She thought it would be hilarious if I presented about their Polar Plunge event in full swimming regalia. I agreed and, the following week, I presented in front of the entire school as a scuba individual. I like this memory, not only because of Janet North's trust in my ability to be goofy, but also because I looked pretty good in that one-piece and, isn't that what's really important?
Plans after WUHSMS: I have only one plan after my high school career is over: to try and enjoy the rest of my life.

Congratulations, Sam!

Dear HACTC Community,

Our intention every year is to try and notify students by the Friday before April Vacation if they have been admitted into the HACTC for the next school year. However, this year, due to a lot of variables related to the school building being closed and the staff working remotely, we are going to be about two weeks later than our intention.

If you know of a student that has applied for admission into the HACTC for the 20-21 school year, could you please pass along the above information? The sending school principals and school counselors have all been notified but we do not have a way to collectively notify the applicants.

Thank you for any assistance that you can provide and getting this message out.

Over the last several weeks so much has changed, and we recognize that many students are experiencing a major disruption to their educational plans and daily lives. As we adjust to this new normal together, we want students to have the option to continue their test prep for free in a healthy, safe environment.

Right now, we’re offering a free month of SAT On Demand, which helps students master the exam in a little as 30 minutes a day. We also have free live lessons for the AP exams including World History, U.S. History, and Biology. There’s a lot more in our full resource hub—including free ACT prep.

Molly went to Hartland Elementary school and then Woodstock High School, she is now currently at Saint Michael’s College in Colchester, VT where she is studying to become a college professor. Molly was born with Pfeiffer Syndrome, a disorder characterized by the prefusion of certain skull bones, along with a variety of other health issues. She talked to students about what it is like to have a disability and persevere. Molly is working to advocate for those who are different or have disabilities. She talked to the students about being kind, asking appropriate questions and be respectful to those who are different.

The opportunity to raise your Q3 grade can only help you. It cannot hurt your Q3/S2 grades. There are no Q4 grades this year. This opportunity for Q3 is also voluntary. I strongly encourage ALL students to take advantage of this opportunity. Some could go from an F to a passing grade and get credit, others might want to raise a B to an A. Please work with your teachers. Thank you!

Are you and/or your child interested in raising their 3rd quarter grade(s)?

During this Distance Learning Opportunity time, all WHS students will have an opportunity to reach out to their teacher(s) to express their desire to raise their Q3 grade(s). Individual students will work out a plan/agreement to move forward during the closure to improve their Q3 grade(s). Students MUST must be the ones to reach out.

Why improve Q3 grade(s)? This will be how WHS determines credit for semester 2 and because students did not have a chance to do so in the 4th quarter.

We want to take a moment to notify you that schools offer a nutritious breakfast starting at 7:30 AM and lunch each school day. The meals are offered according to your child’s approved meal status. Students can eat free, at a reduced rate, or full price. If you are not sure if your student qualifies for free or reduced meals, please feel free to contact Chris Sanders at any time Monday thru Thursday by calling 1-928-635-4428 ext. 124 or email csanders@wusd2.org. Our lunch ladies have noticed there are some students not eating during the day, so we are reaching out to parents to help us by encouraging their children to eat at school. Studies have found students that eat healthy meals perform better in school. We look forward to serving healthy nutritious meals to all students in accordance with the National School Lunch Programs (NSLP) guidelines.

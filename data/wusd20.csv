Dear Whiteriver Community,

Last week I was informed that CDJH Principal, Mr. Clark, is resigning in order to take early retirement.

After carefully considering the needs of students and schools in our district and the administrative resources that we have available in district right now, I am announcing the reassignment of the following administrative staff:

Mr. Gerad Ball: CDJH Principal
Ms. Misty Cook-Goseyun: SME Interim Principal

Changing school leadership rolls after the start of a school year is never ideal or easy. However, WUSD is blessed to have leadership staff with amazing talent and skills. Furthermore, we are blessed to have leadership staff who consider what’s best for children first and foremost. I am deeply appreciative of the professional commitment to students, families and staff in this district.

Please join me in welcoming Mr. Ball and Ms. Goseyun to their new roles. Your support of their added responsibilities is also requested and appreciated.

Be well and stay safe,

Jennifer Plath

Dear Whiteriver Unified Community,

It is with a lot of sadness that I announce all WUSD fall sports have been cancelled.

I would like the community to know this was not a decision that was made lightly. There was a great deal of discussion about and consideration of the processes and resources that would be needed to ensure the health and safety of students, families and community while maintaining a fall sports schedule.
In the end, current circumstances with COVID-19 transmission do not leave us confident that a fall sports schedule can accomplished safely.

WUSD is carefully considering the recommendations from AIA in order to potentially phase in a winter sports schedule safely. Health conditions will continue to be monitored throughout the first quarter of school. And we will continue to evaluate the processes that need to be in place in order to make a decision about starting a winter sports schedule.
Thank you in advance for your support of what was a very difficult decision.

Respectfully,

Jennifer Plath

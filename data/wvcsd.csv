Warwick, NY ‚Äì Did you know 4 out of 5 Warwick students choose not to smoke marijuana? Warwick Valley Prevention Youth Coordinator Francesca Bryson wants to make sure that you do!
The Warwick Valley Prevention Coalition will be initiating a campaign called the Sticker Shock in June. The stickers all have an important message on them taken from the Warwick Youth Survey results of 2019. The sticker shock is designed to be a conversation starter between parents and their children about topics such as drug and alcohol use. We will be distributing the stickers to these locally participating pizzerias: Luca Trattoria- Pizzeria in the Warwick Shoprite Plaza, Frank's Pizza on Main Street, Franico‚Äôs on Elm Street, Franico‚Äôs on Main Street in Florida, and Harvest Luncheonette in Pine Island.",0.0,"Warwick Valley Coalition

Hello all! I wanted to pass along a few resources from KET - Kentucky Educational Television and PBS

KET has launched a new website called Learn-at-Home. This website is for educators and caregivers! The resources are on air and online. https://www.ket.org/learnathome/

There are two collections in PBS LearningMedia to assist with NTI days. The collections have resources for children in PreK-12 grade. These collections were curated by PBS stations across the nations, including KET. There are printables as well as online resources that integrate with Google Classroom and other online platforms.

English: https://ket.pbslearningmedia.org/collection/emergency-closings-collection/

Spanish: https://ket.pbslearningmedia.org/collection/recursos-de-prek-12-para-cierres-de-emergencia/

If educators need other NTI resources they can reach out to KET at NTI@ket.org

There are many other resources out there. We at KET are here to help in any way we can! Please feel reach out to us! We have programming from Early Childhood to Adult Ed.

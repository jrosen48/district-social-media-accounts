WVMS Parents/Guardians:

Walton-Verona Middle School is holding a Reality Store event during the school day on Tuesday, March 3rd here at school. We are still in need of about 20 volunteers to help with the event regardless what grade level your student is in currently.

We are looking for people to run the different tables/booths we have for students to visit such as setting up a bank account, selecting a house, selecting a car, etc. based on the career the student is given.

This is a great event for our 7th graders and hope you or someone you know is willing to help. We do provide lunch for our volunteers. In order to be able to volunteer for this event the adult must have a current background check on file with the board of education. If you do not have one on file you can stop by the board office and fill out the form. The sooner the better so that we can get this back in time for the event.

If you are interested in volunteering please contact our Business Class Teacher, Patrick Luken.

WVMS Parents/Guardians:

Walton-Verona Middle School is holding a Reality Store event during the school day on Tuesday, March 3rd here at school. We are still in need of about 20 volunteers to help with the event regardless what grade level your student is in currently.

We are looking for people to run the different tables/booths we have for students to visit such as setting up a bank account, selecting a house, selecting a car, etc. based on the career the student is given.

This is a great event for our 7th graders and hope you or someone you know is willing to help. We do provide lunch for our volunteers. In order to be able to volunteer for this event the adult must have a current background check on file with the board of education. If you do not have one on file you can stop by the board office and fill out the form. The sooner the better so that we can get this back in time for the event.

If you are interested in volunteering please contact our Business Class Teacher, Patrick Luken.

The Safety Tipline, Online Prevention or S.T.O.P Tipline is designed for use as an ""online"" reporting/prevention tool. If students, parents or community members know of an unsafe situation in school (bullying, weapons, drugs or alcohol, etc.), they can anonymously pass on that information to school personnel by using this basic email format.

This tipline is not for immediate response. If anyone needs help right away, they should dial 911 for the police.

Walton-Verona Middle School's Open House is scheduled for next Tuesday, August 20th from 5:00-7:00 pm. This is an opportunity for you to walk your child's schedule and have a quick ""Meet and Greet"" with their teachers.

If you would like to schedule an actual conference with your child's teacher(s) you can request that for another date and time; just let your child's teacher(s) know that you would like to schedule it.

It has been a great start to the school year and we look forward to seeing you at Open House next week.

We have finally received approval to let students back in the middle school building so I am opening the building tomorrow (Wednesday) from 9:00-4:00 for students to come in, walk around to see their classrooms, and get into their lockers if they want to. The only spaces that are completely off limits are the basement area and the middle school gym but the gym will be ready for Thursday morning.

We will be able to accept fees and provide schedules if you did not make it to Fee/Schedule Pick Up last week with one exception; our 8th grade schedules are not yet finalized so we cannot pass our new 8th grade schedules until Thursday morning. However, 8th grade students are still welcome to come in and tour their classrooms.

Teachers will be in meetings until about 11:30 and then attending a district-wide luncheon so they will not be available. We look forward to seeing everyone on Thursday morning for the first day of school. Please feel free to email me with any questions.

We had to make adjustments to our master schedule and that required us to change all 6th graders schedules. It was a minor change and your child will still have all the exact same classes, just a slightly different order. We flip-flopped 1st and 4th periods so your child's 4th period class on their original schedule is now their 1st period class and visa versa.

If you have not yet picked up your child's schedule you can do so from the middle school office between 7:30-3:30 Tuesday or Wednesday. These schedules have already been adjusted. If you cannot make it up to school we will get your child to the correct class on Thursday and they will get a new copy of their schedule then.

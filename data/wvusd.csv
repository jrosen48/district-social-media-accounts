CLIP FROM YouTube's ""Dear Class of 2020""

Sunday, June 7, 2020, members of Diamond Bar High's Marching Band were part of YouTube's original production ""DEAR CLASS OF 2020"" intended to serve as a commencement ceremony for all the high school and college students who–thanks to COVID-19–can’t attend in-person events this year.

Whenever the marching band sounds were heard, those were played by DBHS students. They also were included in several video shots as well.

The Diamond Bar High School Marching Band, the AMDA College of the Performing Arts, and the Ramón C. Cortines School of Visual and Performing Arts will perform Shawn Mendes’ “Nothing Holding Me Back”–with Mendes (another newly revealed guest) himself.",4.0,"Go Brahmas!

CLIP FROM YouTube's ""Dear Class of 2020""

Sunday, June 7, 2020, members of Diamond Bar High's Marching Band were part of YouTube's original production ""DEAR CLASS OF 2020"" intended to serve as a commencement ceremony for all the high school and college students who–thanks to COVID-19–can’t attend in-person events this year.

Whenever the marching band sounds were heard, those were played by DBHS students. They also were included in several video shots as well.

The Diamond Bar High School Marching Band, the AMDA College of the Performing Arts, and the Ramón C. Cortines School of Visual and Performing Arts will perform Shawn Mendes’ “Nothing Holding Me Back”–with Mendes (another newly revealed guest) himself.",2020-06-08 11:10:03,https://video-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/103194923_901648606979006_3867068358699461772_n.mp4?_nc_cat=110&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=j_2ccNcfLusAX_dKVZh&_nc_ht=video-atl3-1.xx&oh=b36706a13273d8477e5fde47de4f0fe6&oe=5F5F73AF,

Tuesday, March 3, 2020, was the final DB Forum led by Mrs. Sandy Davis before she retires at the end of this year!

At DB Forum students and staff experience a unique, full-day conference that explores the challenges of student stereotypes, fosters student leadership, and provides an opportunity to meet new friends. Participants get the chance to expand their understanding of themselves and others.

DB Forum is also a bonding experience in which participants have fun with their fellow students, learn about peer issues on campus, and pick up a few life skills along the way!

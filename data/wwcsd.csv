The JBLL uses 3D printers in the Learning Lab, and with a shortage of personal protective equipment in hospitals, many schools have been printing headbands for face shields. Using the three printers from the JBLL lab, along with another printer from Wayne-Westland Community Schools, they are printing on average, one headband per hour for protective face shields. They have partnered with the Protect MI group, which has provided the 3D files for printing, as well as supply chain logistics.

The staff at Edison received an email from our Social Worker that one of our families was having a hard time getting food and every day things because of Covid-19. Within 24 hours the staff came together and dropped all of this at the curb at the school for mom to pick up and I took this picture before 5 more bags showed up. There may be a lot of bashing on schools and how they are handling this shut down right now, but this right here is more important than anything. This is how Wayne-Westland Community Schools handles a crisis. We come together and take care of our own.

Thank you to Warren Road Church for another amazing Family Reading Night filled with books, food, and fun. Thank you to Mrs. Ranstadler for having the book fair open and Miss Claire from the Westland Public Library for having library card sign up and event calendars.

Did you know it's National Poetry Month? Please join me in our Poetry Out Loud Challenge! Post your own video, either on Facebook or Instagram, use the hashtag #PoetryOutLoudChallenge, and be sure to mention or tag the Westwood Free Public Library so we can share your post.

When I was young, I was given a book of poems by A.A. Milne called When We Were Very Young. I loved this book and there was one poem in particular that I drove my family crazy with by parading around and reciting. What was it about this poem, I wonder, that made it stick with me all these years? For this challenge, please recite your own favorite poem out loud (it doesn't have to be perfect, as you can see!) and share the video with us to help celebrate National Poetry Month and spread some literary joy. Everyone who participates will get a prize when the library is open to the public again, which we hope will be soon!

P.S. The audiobook version of the book is available on HOOPLA, which can be accessed on our website.

FCS has almost 1700 students enrolled in virtual school utilizing two different platforms working with the Greene County ESC. Right now, the primary focus is getting everyone enrolled in the platform, scheduled in classes and able to access the curriculum. Once we complete this (again just the first week of the year) we will work on curriculum adjustments in regards to work load, assignments and supports.

To all of our WOJFC families, it is with very heavy heart to inform you that our board of directors voted to cancel the 2020 season. Our families safety and well being is our first and foremost priority. We would love for our children in this conference to have football and cheer but the risk of the current pandemic is too great to ignore. We have held off with high hopes that this season would indeed happen, but with the increases of COVID-19, we couldn’t risk harming anyone in the WOJFC family.
We will continue to work hard in the upcoming months for future football possibilities (to include Spring). We thank you for your patience and understanding throughout this entire process....

I am doing an unique fundraiser with the Fairborn Music Club. I have made over 130 masks that I am selling. After these are sold it will be several weeks before I can make more since I am also heading up the project of making bell covers for all the band instruments. (Contact me if you want to help make them.

Masks come in 2 styles...ear loops or elastic behind the head. All have nose wires. I have 2 sizes..ladies/youth and men. I personally prefer the men size for me.. the masks come in many different fabrics...music theme, flowers, rainbow and many more. There is a Skyhawk version...dark med blue one side and light blue the other side. Masks are $8 ea or $15 for 2.

I will have them available at the Monday Fairborn Music Club meeting or you can come to my home. Message or text me if you need to arrange to come to my home",3.0,"Great fundraiser for the Fairborn Music Club and we all need masks!

Summer lunch meals are provided at Baker & Primary on Monday & Wednesday.

Madsen played volleyball while at Baker High School, when the 1977 team was the Regional Runner-Up in the Ohio District tournament. Madsen was coached by former Fairborn Mayor and teacher/Athletic Director, Joan Dautel.

For our parents: HOW DO I TEACH MY KIDS AT HOME?

First rule: Your kids don't have to be doing work from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.

Here are some tips for you:

-Give yourself time to adjust.
-Create routines and stick with them. Let kids help with creating the routine.
-Assign the “big kids” to help the “little kids” with learning and playing.
-Adults might have to switch to doing things at home in the evenings.
-Set quiet time. Look up “mindfulness meditation” together on YouTube.
-Hold “H-Hour” or “Horizontal Hour” when we all lay down (in our own space) and read or rest - but no TV, no devices.
-Get outside more than once a day...for walks, play time, etc.

Check with different Homeschool resources online for more ideas. Again, grades are not the cornerstone or the goal of practicing at home.

Most of all, I want you to be reassured and calm with this recent change in all of our lives.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1572679586218437&id=551323168354089,,0.0,"Some great infromation shared by our Fairborn Intermediate leadership:

This means that beginning next week, we will pass out two lunches per student on Mondays and then pass out three lunches per student on Wednesdays. Food distribution will only occur on Mondays and Wednesdays.

Tomorrow is Thursday, March 19. We will pass out two meals per child tomorrow, which accounts for lunch on Thursday and lunch on Friday.

Pick up times remain the same: 10:00 a.m. to noon.

Together, we can keep each other safe and healthy. Please take every precaution possible and adhere to CDC and Ohio State Government guidance. Wash your hands, wash all clothing and backpacks, avoid groups larger than 10 people, and please stay home if at all possible.

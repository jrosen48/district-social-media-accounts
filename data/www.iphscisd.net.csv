We have been working to provide the maximum number of seats/tickets for each graduate given all of the restrictions. As you know, the state has specified that no more than 5 people may be in a family group (or pod) and that there must be 6 feet of space between each pod. After much work and measuring, we were able to ensure that each of our 120 graduates could have 2 pods each- which is a total of 10 tickets. Given the number of students, the dimensions of our stadium seating, as well as the regulations, what we came up with doesn’t leave much room, but we can make this work legally and safely. I wish we could make a larger number work, but logistics truly prevent it.

We will be assigning tickets based on a lottery system and will keep the assigned 2 pods near each other.

Further details will be coming soon.

Senior 2020 Graduates

Seniors and Parents,
Based on the new rulings concerning graduation provided by the Commissioner of Education yesterday, we are now able to schedule graduation. Our plan is as follows:

Date: June 5th (or June 6th if weather prevents the ceremony on the 5th)
Location: Hawk Stadium
Time: 8:00 p.m.
Practice: Practices are not permitted. We will contact students closer to time with details for the ceremony.
Attendee Numbers: According to state guidelines, only 5 household family members are allowed in a group. We are working to see if we can increase that number while still following the established guidelines of social distancing.

* Please remember that everything is still subject to change based on any new regulations provided by the Commissioner of Education and the Governor.

The High School will be on a normal bell schedule on Friday. We are not getting out early, however, there are a couple of things that will be happening:

We will have a “Sendoff for the FB players” combined with “Band Marching the Halls” @ 11:30.

Parents and Community are encouraged/invited/welcomed to help us line up in the Gym as the players walk through! The boys will NOT be leaving immediately- they will be going to the field house to load everything up!

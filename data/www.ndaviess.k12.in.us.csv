ATTENTION All North Daviess Parents and Students:

ALL BUSES are using the WEST ENTRANCE (CR 550E by the football field) to reduce traffic congestion at the SOUTH ENTRANCE (off of Hwy 58).

DO NOT ASSUME THE BUSES ARE TURNING INTO THE MAIN ENTRANCE (off of Hwy 58)!

Please, please, please pay attention to turn signals!
If you don't see a turn signal, be sure to not pull out in front of a bus/vehicle!

To all parents: As of now, please remember that we do plan on having the new COVID Online Academy for K-12 ND students who might not want to return to ""in-person"" school at ND. Our COVID Online Academy is not like the eLearning from this past spring. The entire curriculum is online; the teachers are not ND teachers but they are Indiana teachers. The cost is the same as the ""in-person' textbook rentals. However, COVID online students are not eligible for sports, activities, Dual Credit, or Early College credit. For those who are interested, we will be taking names of interested students during registration (next week) and will be sharing exact details later this week.

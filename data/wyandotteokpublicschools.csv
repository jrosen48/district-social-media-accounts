According to the State’s Color system, we are in Orange Protocol again for next week. That means we will continue with the A/B scheduling for the following week according to our adaptation to the Orange Protocol system. “A group” students will continue on-site instruction on Monday and Wednesday this coming week and “B group” students will continue on-site instruction on Tuesday and Thursday. We will re-assess again next Friday for the following week. I think it is good to consider the direction Ottawa County is trending in terms of new COVID-19 cases. The percent of cases that we rely on, starting from the first week of school has steadily increased every week and has doubled over the last week from the previous number. We say this to remind you to please be as vigilant as possible, report exposures and positive cases, and help us keep up to date information to avoid a prolonged move to full time distance learning.
Thank you and have a great weekend.

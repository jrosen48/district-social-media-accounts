Hello West York Friends! As some of you are aware I work in the District's technology department. Tomorrow we start a new adventure and I am asking for some help.... When you come to pick up a device for your student/s could you place a simple sign in one of your passengers-side windows with your student's last name and then their first name/s? (Again students in grades 4-12 only - right now) I am hoping this will help us get our families through quicker and provide our staff with a little assistance (not everyone's last name is super easy to pronounce or spell) 😉. Everyone has been working really hard for our students and I have never been more proud to be a Bulldog! This was not a suggestion of the District... this is just me asking you all a little favor. Thank you in advance for your help - please spread the word!!!",3.0,"Awesome Chromebook pick-up tip from our very own Amanda M Steigleman! This is making the process quicker and more efficient.

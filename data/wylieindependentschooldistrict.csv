Incredibly proud of these AMAZING band students and their superior performance this past weekend at the Big Country Marching Festival! If you missed it, don’t worry! We go again for UIL Region Marching on Monday, October 21st at Bulldog Stadium!

One of the most beautiful things about marching band is that you compete against yourself while finding community and connection with your competitors. It’s all about how we move each other’s hearts. Collaboration and community is key. It’s important enough where people voluntarily choose to work together to organize and host these events!

- 24 performing ensembles
- Over 1,400 Chick-Fil-A sandwiches
- 8 hours of judge commentary
- 15 props
- 215 band parents from all schools
- 2,000 band students from various schools
- 34 Wylie Booster volunteers

So thankful for the Wylie Band Booster volunteers who make this festival possible for our Wylie students and the surrounding bands in our area!

The book fair is quickly approaching and we have several spots open to volunteer. We love hosting the book fair and encouraging reading but if we can’t get volunteers to help run it the PTO won’t be able to continue with this event in the future. Use the link below to give an hour or two of your time so we can continue to encourage a love of books in our kids!

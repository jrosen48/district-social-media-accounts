This might be a different kind of school year for our teachers...but it will never change the way they care about their students or the way they feel about being a teacher. We are blessed at Wynnewood Elementary to have the best! They are caring, compassionate and totally committed to helping each child succeed. Please join me in saying “Thank You” to each and everyone.

Oklahoma has climbed to third in the country for Pre-K access for 4-year-olds, according to a new report from the National Institute for Early Education Research!

Oklahoma serves 86.5% of eligible 4-year-old children (WOW! 🎉) when public pre-kindergarten enrollment (76.3%) is combined with Head Start enrollment, the annual report states. Only the District of Columbia (87.3%) and Vermont (86.8%) serve more students.

“Oklahoma has a long tradition of excellence in early childhood education and stands out in the level of professionalism and expertise of Oklahoma’s Pre-K teachers. Preparing our children to be ready to read by kindergarten remains a key priority here as we value the health and development of our youngest learners."" - State Supt. Joy Hofmeister

These incredible efforts by child nutrition workers and school leaders to bring millions of meals to kids since March 23 is further evidence that educators instinctively put kids first. I am thankful and humbled by their work.” - State Supt. Joy Hofmeister

JUST IN: Oklahoma students statewide will soon be able to access two free meals a day following a USDA waiver, which was approved over the weekend after U.S. Senator James Lankford intervened.

Prior to the waiver, districts could provide free meals only if 50% of students at a school met eligibility for the free and reduced-price lunch program.

“Amid such uncertainty and instability, we should not be asking our families or schools to worry over needless red tape. This waiver means that, following a simple application, any district in the state can establish feeding sites for up to two free meals a day for every student who needs one.” - State Supt.

This isn’t our normal Sunday after Spring Break...no getting ready for school tomorrow, no making sure the baseball uniform is clean, no setting of an alarm. I have spent much of the past few days worrying about how all of this will affect our students. It’s crazy that it’s only been a week since we’ve seen them, but I’ve talked to many of my teachers and they already miss them so much, way more than they probably miss us! 😊

With some extra time on my hands, Bobo and I took a few minutes to write a short message to our kiddos! ♥️ (he was about as thrilled to help me with this as my boys!)

Let us all give a cheer for our newest caught doing something good students!!! Each of these kiddos were caught doing a kind act for another person. They are proving that kindness is contagious at Central Elementary!! These students will be enjoying lunch from our Wynnewood Sonic today!! Our employee spotlight is shining on two very important and devoted members of our team. Janice Dixon is our fourth grade ELA instructor and Sandy Brown is a teaching assistant in our PK program. Both ladies have been longtime employees for Wynnewood Schools. Congratulations everyone!!

Thursday's games against Stratford has changed. It will only be 1 HS game starting early at 3:30. There will be no junior high of JV games. Stratford has called and asked because they have parent teacher conferences that night.

Also I am in need of volunteers for concession stand for the game on Thursday and the games on Friday. I only need 1 parent for each game as I have some students that will help work it. I just need a parent/teacher in there to supervise. Thank You",0.0,"Wynnewood Savage Softball

The 6th grade Science students have been studying animal and plant cells. Friday Feb. 7th, it was their turn to put what they had learned towards a hands on approach with a little reward at the end.
Girls were instructed to make animal cells while the boys concentrated on plant cells. Using food related items they took basic candies and incorporated them into organelles found within each type of cell and recorded information. Eating the ""cell"" was the highlight of the lesson. We are so proud of the effort and creativity projected by the students, but most of all, the patience before eating! Way to go kids!",0.0,"Wynnewood Middle School Main

This child is a wonderful example of kindness toward others. After seeing on the news that students in other districts are denied meals because lunch bills are not paid, she decided to do what she could to help! She donated her own money and her dad matched the donation! She has asked that we apply the money to someone’s lunch bill.

Last night, the Student Councils of both Wynnewood High School and Middle School hosted our first Homecoming Week Alumni Dinner! The attendance may have been small, but a great time was definitely had by all! Thank you to the Student Councils and to everyone who came out and enjoyed the spaghetti, the laughs while looking through old yearbooks, and the fellowship in just getting to spend a relaxing time enjoying each others company! #hoco2019",0.0,"Wynnewood High School

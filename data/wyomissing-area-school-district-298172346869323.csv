We’re excited to announce a free, virtual summer tutoring program for students entering grades 1 through 4! The program will consist of one-on-one sessions led by high school students and personalized to each student’s academic needs. Tutors and elementary students will meet remotely twice a week for five weeks, beginning July 6th and ending August 7th. The curriculum will cover math and reading topics in addition to addressing the emotional concerns of young students experiencing social isolation during the Covid-19 pandemic. If you feel that your child would benefit from this experience, please register using the link in the comments or email Elizabeth Harenza at 204265@students.wyoarea.org with any questions.

🌟We know many of our spring athletes are disappointed to not be participating in their seasons so far this year. The Reading Eagle wrote a few feature articles on our track team and a few Spartan athletes who hope to return to the track this Spring. Links to those articles are in the comments.

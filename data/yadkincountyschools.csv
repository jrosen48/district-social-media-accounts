I appreciate you being patient as we worked on coordinating the days to be made up for our inclement weather. March 9th, which was an optional teacher workday, will now become a full student day. March 10th, which was a required work day, will now become an early release. We were unable to make March 10th a full day student day due to mandatory training that was pre-planned. The CPR training scheduled March 10th for coaches and staff is mandated by the state athletic association as well as the Pre-K training planned being a state requirement.

Please share and help us get the word out. The Mebane Foundation partnership with Yadkin County Schools is growing!

“The Foundation’s ability to be a catalyst for innovation and excellence in education would not be possible without the opportunities that Yadkin County created for Unifi to be a successful company,” said William Mebane, Foundation board member and Unifi employee.

Mr. Mebane founded Unifi nearly fifty years ago with Yadkin County as the epicenter of its global operations. He cared deeply for Unifi and the community as a whole, so it makes sense for the Foundation and Yadkin County Schools to further strengthen our partnership for the future.

The Foundation’s board voted unanimously at its most-recent semi-annual meeting to award an additional $57,000 to the Yadkin County School System for the coming year.

Please share and help us get the word out. The Mebane Foundation partnership with Yadkin County Schools is growing!

“The Foundation’s ability to be a catalyst for innovation and excellence in education would not be possible without the opportunities that Yadkin County created for Unifi to be a successful company,” said William Mebane, Foundation board member and Unifi employee.

Mr. Mebane founded Unifi nearly fifty years ago with Yadkin County as the epicenter of its global operations. He cared deeply for Unifi and the community as a whole, so it makes sense for the Foundation and Yadkin County Schools to further strengthen our partnership for the future.

The Foundation’s board voted unanimously at its most-recent semi-annual meeting to award an additional $57,000 to the Yadkin County School System for the coming year.

Initially the weather forecast had the storm moving southeast of Raleigh but it has shifted and is now projected to move northwest of Raleigh. With the shift has come increased rain and wind gusts. The worst of the rain and wind gusts are forecast to happen this afternoon between 1:00 and 3:00. Therefore, rather than release early and put our buses and student drivers out during the worst time, I made the decision to keep students in school where I know they are safe. We are planning to evaluate weather conditions as we approach our regular dismissal time of 3:00. If conditions have not improved I plan to keep students in school past dismissal time. If that becomes necessary I will send another message letting you know that we plan to hold students and I will try to provide an estimated time of dismissal. I know this will create an inconvenience for many, but providing for the safety of our students is my top concern. Thank you.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1796902893741591&id=101279816637249,,0.0,"Good afternoon. This is Superintendent Todd Martin. Initially the weather forecast had the storm moving southeast of Raleigh but it has shifted and is now projected to move northwest of Raleigh. With the shift has come increased rain and wind gusts. The worst of the rain and wind gusts are forecast to happen this afternoon between 1:00 and 3:00. Therefore, rather than release early and put our buses and student drivers out during the worst time, I made the decision to keep students in school where I know they are safe. We are planning to evaluate weather conditions as we approach our regular dismissal time of 3:00. If conditions have not improved I plan to keep students in school past dismissal time. If that becomes necessary I will send another message letting you know that we plan to hold students and I will try to provide an estimated time of dismissal. I know this will create an inconvenience for many, but providing for the safety of our students is my top concern. Thank you.",2018-10-11 18:52:35,,

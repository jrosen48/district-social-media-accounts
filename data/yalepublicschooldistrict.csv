The call came in for donations for soldiers who have been deployed. The Red Cross reached out and asked for a list of items to give soldiers who are dispatched into the field with only backpacks.
Mr. McIntyre's and Mrs. Gerardy's World History classes stepped up in a BIG way.
9 boxes of items were collected and mailed to a base in Europe. This will supply well over 100 soldiers with essentials such as soap, wipes, deodorant, and snacks.
As one student who helped organize said ""In Yale, ask and you shall receive.""

And all the chromatique between,

Here lies the dust of Africa;
Here are the sons of Rome;
Here lies the one unlabelled,
The world at large his home!

Can one then separate the dust?
Will mankind lie apart,
When life has settled back again

For communication, please reach out via email at communications@ycschools.org or directly to me, Shaunna Kaufmann, at kaufmanns@ycschools.org if you have any questions or need clarification. I monitor both email accounts.

Due to staff attendance and many working from home, the direct phone lines of the schools and district offices are not an effective method of communication at this time.

Lead secretaries of each school can be contacted if you require direct communication with the school itself. Though, keep in mind I will be forwarding any emails that they would be able to help with if need be.

Hello players, families and friends of YC football. The state of Oregon and the OSAA is beginning to re-open as we continue the fight against the corona virus. As soon as we are able, our normal summer schedule will resume with as many precautions as we can put in place.

When we are allowed, our summer schedule will be as follows:
Monday, Wednesday and Friday 6:00-7:30 PM - Conditioning and Weights Workouts.
Tuesday, Thursday 6:00-7:30 PM- Position specific workouts.

As camps and 7 on 7 tournaments become available, they may be added to the schedule.

I will update you all as soon as I have more information as to when we can officially open up.

Thank you and stay safe!

I have been reaching out to our local scholarship sponsors and committees to suggest they extend their application deadlines until the end of May.

As well, I've asked them to allow applications to be mailed directly to a contact person instead of being delivered to Counseling or ASPIRE (in case we're not back to school by then).

The majority have agreed.

We have been getting a lot of questions about large gatherings and events as things evolve with COVID-19, novel coronavirus.
Current recommendations are the following:
‚Ä¢ Adults over 60 years and those with chronic conditions regardless of age not attend large gatherings and events as they are the individuals at greatest risk for poor outcomes if they contract COVID-19.
‚Ä¢ Anyone who is ill, even with mild symptoms, should stay home.
‚Ä¢ Event organizers should make sure there is adequate handwashing facilities available.
‚Ä¢ Event organizers should be prepared to ask those who appear ill to leave the event.

At approximately 9:00 today, we received communication from YCSD administration that we were having an emergency situation that required our students to be contained in their classrooms. Our building (YCIS) was immediately put into Lock Down mode where all students remained contained in their classrooms. While this status is generally used when there is an imminent threat or danger, this was not the case. One of our students was having a medical emergency that required paramedics and emergency responders, this event took place as we were about to transition between classes and we wanted to give this student and the EMS workers as much privacy as possible. We want to be clear that at no time was our building under any type of threat or danger. We are very proud of the response by our students, staff and first responders. The entire Lock down event lasted less than five minutes.

So the YC boys basketball season has come to a close with a hard fought loss to defending two time state champs - DelaSalle. What has been a big win is the season. What a great ride. The boys went from a 4 win season last year to 16 wins this year and making state playoffs. They worked super hard, bought in to the program and came together as a team. We were also led by our outstanding senior - Gavin Tuning. What a leader and he will be missed.

Last night (besides the score) was the best. We played at the Salvation Army because DelaSalle doesn't have a gym. There is one set of bleachers - the crowd started filing in at 5. We had a great YC contingency there all sporting the orange and black. Crowd cheered and were a great support, we even did a YC chant at the end. The atmosphere was so fun and a lifetime memory. This is a great experience for the boys and hopefully next year we can make it to the tourney. Thank you so much for everyone who came and supported the team this year. It means a lot. #stayuponthatrise #hardworkpaysoff #funjourney #yctigers",0.0,"Heather Roberts YC Bbx is with Bobbi Mickey-Richmond and 7 others.

Dear YC Intermediate and High School Parents,

Unfortunately we had major problems with the boiler systems at both the Intermediate and High Schools today. The Intermediate School electronic controls systems are going through a retrofit and for some reason the new system quit working and heat was not directed to the classrooms. In an unfortunate coincidence, the boiler at the high school quit working as well. We have repair teams called out to get both systems back online.

The result of these issues is that the classrooms were chilly today. I apologize for this state of affairs, if we had realized that the heating systems were not going to be repaired by mid-morning, I would have canceled classes for the day. If the systems are not working tomorrow, school will be cancelled. A call will go out in the morning if that is the case.

Again, I apologize for the chilly learning environment today.

At SMART Reading, it is our goal to read to every single one of these great kiddos, but without more volunteers, we‚Äôre only able to read with HALF of these students. üòï

If you‚Äôre available Wednesday mornings, between 9-10:30, and interested in investing in the future of Carlton/Yamhill and its students, please contact SMART at yamhillcarlton@smartreading.org!

YC went 5-1 in duals at the Oregon dual state classic. This was good for fourth place overall.

On day 1 the 'gers went 3-0 besting ranked pleasant Hill, Santiam Christian and edging out second ranked Dayton. The pirates ended up placing second in the entire tournament.

On day 2 the tigers lost a back and fourth dual with Willamina. This dropped YC to the backside where they would win out and claim fourth.

Side Note:
YC, Dayton and Willimina are all in the same wrestling district - all of whom placed 4th, 2nd and 3rd; respectively. I personally think this shows how tough are league and kids are.

Side Note #2: Multiple refferess and other tournament officials complemented us on our sportsmanship and gentlemen-like behavior. Some things about our sport are bigger than actual wrestling. This to me was more rewarding than placing.

Special thanks to the parents who made this happen when the travel plans went awry.

Little late on this post but YC placed 5th at the talent-packed Pacific Rim Classic last Saturday out of 20 teams. YC was the top 3A team and only topped by the returning 4A state champions, Tillamook, 5A Scappoose, 4A Estacada and 5A St. Helens. St. Helens and YC went back and fourth the last few rounds to claim fourth but ultimately they best us by a few points.

YC was highlighted by a Champion Reily Liesegang in the 113 bracket, Asher Tindall 4th in the packed 120 bracket, and Jakob Jarvis placing 3rd in the 126 bracket that consisted of a 4A state champ and 3 other additional state placers.

Yankton Pizza Ranch saw a need and got a plan together to help fill the gap. Our Yankton School District had a lunch debt balance of $3,500 and the school district needed some community help to pay off this amount.

The Pizza Ranch team created a fundraiser that, for 2 weeks in May, donated $1 to the Yankton School District Angel Fund for every large pizza sold. In that time, the Yankton Pizza Ranch raised $1,607 and was able to erase almost half of the debt!

Thank you Pizza Ranch for your commitment to our community and school district!

Unfortunately due to the forecast of thunderstorms this afternoon, the graduation ceremony must be moved indoors to the YHS Main Gym. Graduates with the last name Ament-Lange will have a ceremony at noon and Langely-Yaggie will have a ceremony at 2:00 at YHS. Masks are strongly recommended for all in attendance.

The gates will open 30 minutes prior to each ceremony.

As a reminder, each graduate was issued 6 tickets to share. No one will be admitted without a ticket. Due to the limited number of tickets issued, click the link below to watch the live stream of the event(s) at no charge.

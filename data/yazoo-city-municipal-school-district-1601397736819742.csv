This past week my team (Lucy Ann Martin, Romeka R. Mack, Denise Robertson, Jay TheMaestro Rashaad, Tracie Green-Brown, and Tiwari McLain) and I had the opportunity to attend the 2019 Making Connections Conference and presenting before teachers all over the state in Biloxi. They each had their own session and when I say Yazoo City High represented well, they were phenomenal. I can’t be more proud of them. As an African American female educator/administrator I believe the best way to build up your teachers/team is to provide them the opportunity to grow and learn. Trailblazers did it for me and plan to continue to pay it forward. Mississippi has some great teachers/educators and I’m proud that some of the greatest are on my team!!!",0.0,"Deanne Austin is with Kalita Jones.

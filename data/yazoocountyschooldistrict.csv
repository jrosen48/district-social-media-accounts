2020 Yazoo County Panther Baseball Seniors
Our season ended before it really even began, but you are leaving as back-to-back district champions. Most of you have been with me since 7th grade, and a couple for only a season or two. Regardless of the time it has been an honor and privilege to have been your coach and watch each of you grow into outstanding young men. Thanks for the memories!

Please place your child’s name on the envelope as well as the grade level. If possible in reference to the high school, place the subject on the envelope.

Thank you so much for everyone’s patience as we prepared “Instructional Packets” for our students! Over 150 packets were distributed! We re-grouped after a busy day yesterday, and today was smooth sailing! We have plenty of packets left for every grade. You may continue to pick them up from 9-11 a.m. with meals on Friday, Monday, and Tuesday. Before 9 and after 11:00 you will be able to pick packets up from the file cabinets in front of the school. Please be sure all students have their packets before Wednesday. Thank you again for your support during this unusual time!",3.0,"Bentonia Gibbs Elementary School

What an AWESOME “packet pick up” day we had! Over 170 YCHS students now have instructional packets in their hands!

Remember-if you need help, your teachers are on standby! Email them and ask questions!!

For those of you struggling with math, Khan Academy is a wonderful online resource!
(This has been the most sought after resource)

If you were unable to pick up today-we will be doing it again tomorrow from 8-12. Please do not get out of your vehicle! Call the school and let us know who you are picking up for and it will be brought out to you!

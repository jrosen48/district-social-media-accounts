Currently, the school district plans to re-open schools for instruction after spring break. However, it is unknown at this time if that will be possible. In an effort to be prepared with alternative instructional options, we need your input. We want families to have their preferred delivery of instruction for each of their students. You can choose from online or print options. If computers are needed, we can help with that too. Please complete this short survey so we can provide what is needed for each student.

As Hurricane Laura approaches the Gulf Coast, we are bracing for the severe weather and will not be holding virtual school tomorrow or Thursday.

We will follow guidance from local officials and keep you updated on plans for resuming classes Friday based on the storm’s impact.

We absolutely hate that we are having to cancel school just two days into the new year, but as always, the safety of the YES Prep community is our highest priority.

Here's what Three shared with us, “Pye Pyo exemplifies the importance of hard work and dedication to your craft. Despite the vast majority of his accomplishments and successes, he still continues to push and reach for higher goals. He lives his life according to what he wants to achieve, despite how difficult it may seem. Nothing is impossible because without trying or challenging yourself you won’t ever gain momentum.”

Tough news: Our Covid-19 cases have almost doubled in the last two weeks. At the current rate, we will exceed 1,000 cases by August. The percentage of positive tests is increasing and hospitalizations are also increasing.

In an effort to curb the spread, we've closed all bars and prohibited indoor dining in restaurants. While this is a tough step back, it's a needed step to ensure that residents from neighboring counties whose bars and indoor dining have been shut down by the state will not congregate here, and above all, to reduce the amount of severe illness and fatalities that inevitably follow these kinds of spikes.

The actions we take in the next month will help shape what life looks like six months from now. Let's work together to make it look as close to ""normal"" as we can. We are in this together and I know we can do it. I personally look forward to the day when I can sit with my father and give him a hug. I miss him desperately.

Please have a safe and quiet Fourth of July and I will post updates as they come available.",0.0,"Jim Provenza

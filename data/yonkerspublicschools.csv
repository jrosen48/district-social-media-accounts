Did you know...Yonkers Could Lose $25 Million A Year Due To Census Underreporting?

Officials across the Hudson Valley are urging residents to fill out their 2020 census forms.

In Yonkers, officials worry they could lose out on $25 million a year if they don't raise their census reporting numbers.

""When we go to the federal government for additional aid or federal disaster aid, it's based on census tracks. If people aren't being counted then we're not getting the dollars we need,"" says Mayor Mike Spano.

‚úÖThe City of Yonkers along with its residents, students, community leaders and activists created a message encouraging residents to participate in the 2020 Census.
______________________________
‚úÖThe 2020 Census provides a snapshot of our nation and mid-sized cities like Yonkers depend on the 2020 Census a bit more because of the tens of millions of dollars on the line for programs and services we all use, such as hospitals and schools.

______________________________
‚úÖInvitations to participate in the 2020 Census have been mailed to every household in the country. Each household will have the option of responding online (encourage and easier to complete), by mail or by phone (1-844-330-2020). If residents misplaced their invitations, they can visit www.2020Census.gov.

Yonkers Council of PTA/PTSAs

The City of Yonkers
March 25 at 1:03 PM ¬∑

‚úÖThe City of Yonkers along with its residents, students, community leaders and activists created a message encouraging residents to participate in the 2020 Census.
______________________________
‚úÖThe 2020 Census provides a snapshot of our nation and mid-sized cities like Yonkers depend on the 2020 Census a bit more because of the tens of millions of dollars on the line for programs and services we all use, such as hospitals and schools.

______________________________
‚úÖInvitations to participate in the 2020 Census have been mailed to every household in the country. Each household will have the option of responding online (encourage and easier to complete), by mail or by phone (1-844-330-2020). If residents misplaced their invitations, they can visit www.2020Census.gov.
______________________________
‚úÖTogether we can ensure #YonkersCounts!

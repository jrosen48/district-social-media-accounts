I participated in the Four Corners risk dial zoom this morning and learned the dial will be set at 2.0 for the Four Corners area. That means their dial is on the line between yellow and orange. The reason the dial increased from last week is primarily due to Butler and Seward counties. The positivity rate and the number of cases increased in those counties.

The York county positivity rate decreased and the number of cases in the past week decreased as well.

Based on this information and collaborating with Four Corners Public Health, YPS will continue to stay in the yellow. We will continue to do everything we are doing now to mitigate risk.

I truly believe that our plan is working and we must not let our ""guard"" down.

Have a great Labor Day weekend.

I hope this message finds you safe and healthy. YPS teachers and staff continue to work hard for our students and families and I'm very proud of the effort I'm seeing.

We have made a slight adjustment to our last student day for the 2019-20 school year. Typically the last two or three days in each building include taking finals, field trips, and end of the year celebrations. Since we are not able to bring students back, we have decided to make Friday, May 15th our last student day. This will shorten our calendar by 2.5 days.

The YPS administrative team has several decisions to make in the next couple of weeks. Please be checking our COVID-19 landing page at www.yorkpublic.org for any updates.

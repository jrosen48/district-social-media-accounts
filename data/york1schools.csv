We are kicking off our celebration of the teaching profession by recognizing our five finalists for South Carolina Teacher of the Year. Last month, Superintendent Molly Spearman surprised Shawn Norris, Sarah Gams, Tanya Peckham, Ashley Bennett, and Richard Whitmore with news they had been selected as finalists for the state's highest teaching honor.

The finalists have since been interviewed by a team of expert judges who will decide which educator will become the 2021 S.C. Teacher of the Year. Each finalist receives $10,000 and the winner receives a total of $25,000 and a brand new BMW to use while serving in the position. The winner will be announced at the annual gala which will be rescheduled for later this year.

June 4 at 8:29 PM ·

Congratulations to these talented young artists, who were inducted into the National Art Honor Society yesterday! Our induction ceremony had to be rescheduled and held virtually this year, but their families and I still had a wonderful time celebrating them and their accomplishments! Thank you for a wonderful year of art, creativity, and service, York Academy Regional Charter School artists! You set high standards for yourselves and continually rise to be positive examples to your peers in both character and academics. It is an honor and a pleasure to be your teacher. <3",2020-06-05 09:56:43,,

A huge shoutout goes to Mrs. Melissa Cook for embodying the IB attribute of being #balanced! It's critical to understand the importance of balancing the different aspects of our lives—intellectual, physical and emotional—to achieve well-being for ourselves and others. When we are in balance, we recognize our interdependence with other people and with the world in which we live.

Mrs. Cook has done a great job of providing her students with a quality education and creating space for them to socialize and share during distance learning. She researches the best ways to teach and reach her students, but also makes time for herself and her family. Thanks for being a role model and showing your students how to stay balanced during this challenging time, Mrs. Cook. You are appreciated!

Hi everyone! I have two work spaces. Based off the pictures, which one do you think I enjoy more?

What I miss most about school is being able to watch students achieve a skill they’ve been working on or watching teams work together to accomplish a goal. I miss seeing how kind the students are to one another and watching them interact in such a positive way. The only interaction I’ve seen recently is watching my dog attempt to interact with squirrels. Let’s just say, it’s not very fulfilling compared to what I’m used to seeing from our amazing students!

Ada has been such a risk-taker since beginning distance learning. She has been exploring new ideas by helping her teacher and trying out new tasks and reporting back. She uses innovative strategies by building homes and towns out of Legos! Ada is extremely resilient and faces every task with determination and open-mindedness during this time of change. Way to go, Ada. Here's a big ""Knight Nod"" for being such a risk-taker. Congrats and keep it up!

It's Earth Day and I think this year especially we should all appreciate the nature around us. One of the few places we can go right now is just outside, whether that's our backyards or our neighborhoods. I went on a walk with my dog Chewy (yes that is short for Chewbacca) and just took the time to look around and appreciate the blossoms of spring. I know that I feel like I've been overstaying my welcome in my own home at times, and so going outside really is a nice trip away from my room and the spring cleaning I am still avoiding. I hope everyone is finding ways to get through these uncomfortable circumstances and can take some time to stop and smell the flowers. ~ Michaelina

Hi York Academy families!

As I don't have just one location set up in my house to work, I have been using the dining room table, the comfy couch and sometimes my bedroom floor to join Google Classroom Meets and Zoom meetings! I will say this stay-at-home time has made me more of a risk-taker, because I am using the online meetings to read to students (which I have never done before). I miss seeing you all in the York Academy library, and hope to see you all soon!

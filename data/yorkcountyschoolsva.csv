CASE SOLVED ‚Äì SUSPICIOUS PERSON AT BUS STOP:

On January 23, 2020 at approximately 8:18 am deputies responded to a call in the area of Peacemaker Avenue & Eagle Loop, for a suspicious vehicle near a bus stop, in the Langley housing community. It was reported that two younger white females (maybe in their 20‚Äôs) were in a black midsize car motioning for a student to come to the vehicle. There was no verbal communication between the parties.

Our Investigators did a very thorough investigation of this case. It was determined that the woman at the bus stop was actually someone who had just moved from one side of the housing complex to another. She was dropping her child off for the bus. The child left something behind and the woman was waving for them to come back to get the item.

Sheriff Diggs said, ‚ÄúEven though this was a misunderstanding, we applaud the child who reported it for being aware of their surroundings.

‚ùóÔ∏èIMPORTANT‚ùóÔ∏è
It has been brought to our attention (the sheriff's department has been notified) that scammers have been contacting local businesses from out of state numbers asking for money to put their banner up at Bailey Field üò†

Let me be clear...We will NEVER ask for money over the phone! All partnerships begin with a license agreement, which is sent by an official YCSD email. Money is then either sent to or dropped off directly to the School Board Office. It is then up to the participating new business to provide the banners that WE (the YCSD) put up at the field. Let me repeat....the YFPE DOES NOT provide the banners!

It's unfortunate that scammers are using the Foundation and our business partnerships to swindle hardworking people out of money! If you are a business that ACTUALLY wants to help the York County School teachers, staff and students contact me directly at 898-0451.

This week, one of our favorite traditions took place for our high schools as members of the class of 2019 visited the elementary schools where many of them started their K-12 education. Students and teachers lined the hallways and school grounds to cheer and high five as the Bruton High School, Grafton High School, Tabb High School and York High School seniors passed by in their caps and gowns. It's a memorable moment for all - the younger students who see that they too can do this one day and the soon-to-be graduates who have another chance to see their former teachers.

Each year, we feature student artwork and musical performances in a special holiday video. Special thanks to the Mt. Vernon Elementary School 4th and 5th grade chorus and all our students for sharing their talents and holiday spirit with us.

The artwork submitted for the video was fantastic and we thoroughly enjoyed each submission. As we received more art than could be featured in the video, we‚Äôve also created a special photo album showcasing all the artwork.

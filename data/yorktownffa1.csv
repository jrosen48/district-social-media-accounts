Spread the word that DISH will be broadcasting the 91st Annual Texas FFA Convention!

If you are already a DISH subscriber you can easily view the convention on DISH Studio Channel 102.

Not a DISH subscriber? This is the perfect time to switch! Not only would you be able to watch the Texas FFA Convention, but your local chapter has a chance to receive some support when folks switch to DISH and reference your local FFA chapter. It’s really easy to sign-up and everything you need to know can be found at https://bit.ly/2Ii0IpU!",0.0,"Be sure to watch the State Convention on Dish this year!

Today's spotlight is on our Welding senior lab. In this program, our seniors learned how to manipulate the power of fire and electricity to design and construct the metal products people use every day. Our welding students operate the same advanced welding and fabrication equipment used by professionals to manipulate metal for artistic and industrial applications.

Each spotlight includes a special message from our #ChoffinCTC instructors since they aren't able to end the school year with their seniors in person.

Today's spotlight is on our Interactive App & Game Development senior lab.

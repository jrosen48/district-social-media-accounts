It should also have fruits, like strawberries and blueberries. It is important to pack a healthy lunch, because as kids we need nourishment to live and grow. For lunch you need something like a sandwich with healthy things in it. Some healthy things like lettuce, tomatoes, and onions. Of course as kids, we naturally gravitate towards sweet things for a treat, but not a whole lunch of them. It also would be smart to trade Doritos for Veggie Straws. Some ways you can have a healthier lunch is to eat a healthy dinner that you can eat for lunch the next day. Finally, you can get rid of most of your junk food. These are ways you could have a healthier lunch.""",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2595287833820112&id=616504405031808,,0.0,"A great reminder about what a healthy lunch looks like, by Madison, one of our 5th Grader students: ""The lunch should include a healthy snack such as veggies, like carrots or celery.

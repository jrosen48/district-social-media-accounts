Yesterday for Suicide Prevention week we talked about reaching out to a trusted adult if a friend needed help- BUT who do you go to if YOU are feeling upset or need help? It may be the same adult that you thought of yesterday, or it may be a different adult, teacher, coach, parent, or family friend. We know asking for help- especially for yourself- can be difficult. But the people who care about you WANT you to reach out. They WANT to be there for you during the difficult days and difficult moments.

Think about who that trusted adult is and make sure you know how to get in contact with them, without having to ask someone else. Having that info now, BEFORE a problem happens, makes reaching out easier in the moment. Sometimes our friends are struggling with problems that need the help of that trusted adult.

A group of Ypsilanti residents launched a program called the Ypsi Mask Project for the purpose of making masks for Ypsilanti Community Schools.

The goal is to provide masks to students, teachers and staff who will be taking part in face-to-face instruction in the fall. The Ypsi Mask Project has teamed up with Engage @ EMU to make 4,000 masks. Maria Goodrich co-founded the Ypsi Mask Project in July and says, so far, they’ve made about 900 masks for Ypsilanti Community Schools.

While the 2020-2021 school year will look different for children across the country, Ypsilanti Community Schools (YCS) will offer three different instruction models to fit parents' and students' varying needs and safety concerns.

YCS Superintendent Alena Zachery-Ross notes that while the entire district only has about 600 staff members, nearly 100 volunteered to be on the district's back-to-school safety task force, which started in May. That group has considered guidelines from the CDC, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's school reopening safety plan, and what other districts are planning. Zachery-Ross also drew feedback from a parent advisory council.

Our beloved Henry Ford Early Learning Center caught fire yesterday evening, and the cause of the fire is under investigation.

The Board of Education, district administrators, and the Henry Ford family are incredibly grateful no one was injured and that the Superior Township Fire Department was quickly on the scene to help control the situation.

Henry Ford has been a staple in the Willow Run Community for many years, and we will work hard to get the building in a safe condition before the start of the new school year.

June 10 at 10:25 PM ·

After much discussion the Friends of the Rutherford Pool Board has made the difficult decision not to open the pool for the rest of the season. We know many of you are disappointed, we are too! But we feel this is in the best interest of the safety and health of our community. Below are some of the reasons we've made this decision:
We are concerned that it would be impossible to maintain social distancing while guests are in the pool.

We would have to limit guest capacity which would mean some people would be turned away at the door.

With construction of the bathhouse still not complete we would only open at most half the season. This would cause us to likely lose significant revenue.

Most importantly, we do not want to put our staff and guests at any risk to catch or spread the virus.

We are hopeful that we can take this summer to complete construction and be ready for an awesome season in 2021. Until then, please stay safe and keep in touch with all your pool staff. We miss you!",6.0,"Rutherford Pool

YCS District Technology Distribution Parent Letter",22.0,"PLEASE READ THE DOCUMENTS ATTACHED IN DETAIL TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT ADDITIONAL PICKUP DAYS!

YCS Technology Distribution is CLOSED for the day due to the number of cars and safety issues. It is very likely the Washtenaw County Sheriff's Department will turn you away if you are trying to enter.

Currently, there is a wait time of 2+ hours. We apologize for the inconvenience, but again, we are working under the state restrictions, and volunteers are doing the best they can! We all received a lot of parents that came on a day not assigned, which also holds up the process.

Please review the calendar for your day of distribution for your child. If you have multiple children, you should come next week Tuesday and Wednesday--not today or this week!

We’ve gotten questions about what “Stay Home. Stay Safe. Save Lives.” really means. It means avoiding ALL gatherings – don’t hang out with even just one or two people who aren't your household members. Go out only for essentials like food or medicine. If you need medical care, call first. If out, wear a cloth covering over your nose and mouth and keep a distance of 6 feet from others. Wash your hands well and often. If you have any symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, diarrhea, fever), stay in a separate room from others in your home. Everyone is at risk for coronavirus and should continue taking every precaution to help slow the spread of illness. We’re in this together. All of these actions will save lives.

Schools may be closed, but the Wolf administration is committed to feeding PA students! Through the recently approved Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer (P-EBT) program, eligible families and caregivers may be eligible to receive a one-time benefit benefit for children who normally receive free or reduced-price meals at school. Through this new program, DHS will be able to provide meals to nearly 1 million school-aged children across the state!

If you have experienced reduced household income due to job loss or decreased pay because of #COVID19, you can still apply for free and reduced-priced lunch through the National School Lunch Program and receive a benefit if you now qualify.

2. Give them some control - remind how them how they can help
3. Watch for signs of anxiety, like being cranky, clingy, having trouble sleeping or being distracted
4. Monitor social media use - talk about the fact that rumors are circulating + make sure children are getting information from good sources
5. Be a good role model - staying calm, not stigmatizing + being supportive of community members who need help

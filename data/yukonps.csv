In the “Supe Talk” video distributed August 7th, Dr. Simeroth referenced the district would consider a return to the traditional classroom setting when Canadian County maintained fewer than ten positive COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people for two consecutive weeks. Canadian County was below this threshold for the weeks of August 14th and August 21st, therefore the item was placed on the September board agenda.

After much consideration and lengthy discussion, the YPS Board of Education voted to return to the traditional classroom setting sooner than originally projected. This decision reflects the district’s focus on meeting both the educational and social-emotional needs of our students.

Current options for YPS families include:

- Traditional/Continuous Learning Plan - Parents/Guardians of students currently enrolled in Yukon Virtual School who are interested in the traditional classroom setting may transition to Traditional/Continuous Learning Plan. We ask that you do so as soon as possible by contacting virtual@yukonps.com.

- Yukon Virtual School - Due to the number of students transitioning from Yukon Virtual School (YVS) to the traditional school setting, there are a limited number of YVS seats available. If you are interested in continuing school remotely, please email virtual@yukonps.com.

- YPS Re-Enrollment - Parents/Guardians of students currently enrolled in out-of-district educational options are always welcome to return to Yukon Public Schools. Please contact our YPS Enrollment Center at 405-265-1300 or email enrollment.center@yukonps.com.

We are so excited that we had new artificial turf installed under the play equipment on our playground this summer. After 6 inches of rain, there is no standing water under the equipment which means it can be played on much more quickly after the rain stops! What a fantastic surface for our students! This improvement was made possible by the vote of our community by passing the last Yukon Schools Bond Issue in 2017. The support of our community makes a difference for kids every day!

Thank you for your patience and support as we navigate how to best serve our students in the upcoming school year. The YPS Return to Learn Plan is a result of dedicated research, scenario analysis and feedback from our families, staff and community leaders. Although we are presenting our current plan, we remain open to adopting best practices as they continue to be revealed.

Student learning options for the 2020-2021 school year include traditional or virtual and high school students have the option of blended learning to best accommodate their schedules. Yukon Public Schools is set to open on August 20 for students in the traditional setting and August 26 for students in the virtual setting. In the event of a school shutdown, we will implement our recently developed Continuous Learning Plan to ensure education continues.

Thank you for your patience through this process. There are still so many unknowns but we are receiving your questions and concerns and want to let you know we hear you. YPS leadership is working hard to provide answers regarding distance learning, picking up property, graduation, yearbooks, summer camp, driver’s education and more. The district wants to reassure you that we will communicate answers to you as soon as we have them. The updated information and answers we have as of Thursday, March 26, 2020 include the following:

Regarding meals, breakfasts and lunches are available for pick-up only in the drop-off lanes at Central, Myers, Independence, Lakeview, Ranchwood, Shedeck and Surrey Hills. Pick-up is between 11:15AM - 12:30PM each weekday for both breakfast and lunch.

Regarding checked-out books, boxes will be set up at each breakfast/lunch nutrition location for families to return checked-out library books and textbooks on weekdays between 11:15AM and 12:30PM at the above-mentioned school sites.

Regarding distance learning, on Wednesday, March 25th, the OK State Board of Education approved a recommendation by Superintendent Hofmeister to finish this school year with a form of ""Distance Learning."" Now that this recommendation has been approved, the OSDE is slated to release ""Distance Learning Frameworks"" designed to provide guidance to districts. Superintendent Hofmeister has made it very clear the OSDE acknowledges this form of education will look very different from grade level to grade level, from subject to subject and from district to district. We also acknowledge the goal is to reach every student to ensure equity and this may take different forms. Based on the most recent OSDE Conference Calls, ""Distance Learning"" is not intended to provide any new learning and will be used to focus on standards already taught from August to March 15th as well as the skills listed on the OSDE Family Guides for grade PK-6.

Regarding district grading, the goal during this unprecedented time is to hold our students harmless for the abrupt end of instruction. We know the last weeks of school are an essential time when it comes to demonstrating mastery of skills. Unfortunately, we do not have these weeks and we must rely on the evidence that has already been collected for each standard. Teachers and staff are taking into account the best interest of each student and grades will reflect what students have learned based on the essential standards for the third quarter.

As further solutions become clear, we will continue to communicate via our website at www.yukonps.com, our social media platforms and email communications with YPS guardians. “All of our YPS sites are working extremely hard to make this as positive of an experience as possible for everyone and to make it a beneficial learning opportunity for both students and staff. We will all grow through this together and come out stronger on the other side” assured YPS Superintendent, Dr. Simeroth.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3060966247256754&id=185719641448110,"DRIVE.GOOGLE.COM

Today, state officials announced they will recommend to the state Board of Education that Oklahoma students not return to the classroom for the remainder of the current school year, as our state continues to fight the spread of COVID-19. They will instead recommend a continuous learning plan that will allow students to complete the school year at home. It is important to note that this decision is not final until the state Board of Education meets on Wednesday and votes to approve the recommendation.

We are sharing this information with you in advance, however, so that you can begin to prepare accordingly for your family. We understand this recommendation is in the best interest of everyone’s health, which is our greatest priority as a district. If approved, this also means that all extracurricular activities and special events will be canceled as well. Making these difficult decisions, we believe, is simply the right thing to do for our students, our staff and our community.

We do have good news: Yukon Public Schools is developing a plan to ensure your child will continue to have opportunities to learn and to grow academically, especially with parental support. Because we are unable to safely gather together, these lessons and activities will primarily be delivered and communicated via distance learning methods. As you can imagine, this is a significant transition for our students and our teachers. Yukon Public Schools will spend the next two weeks planning for this effort and will share details with your family as soon as they are available. Teachers and support staff members will hear from their principals soon as they gather input regarding the next phase of the school closure.

For students, it likely will be sad and disappointing to learn that school as they know it will not resume this year. Please give them a safe place to express their feelings and to vent about the changes in their life. For our seniors and their parents, we know it is an especially difficult time. We will do everything possible to ensure their efforts are recognized and celebrated in special and unique ways. This is an unfair situation, but please reassure them that it does not diminish their achievements. In fact, it will become one more example of how they demonstrated their strength as a Yukon Miller.

We have posted numerous resources on our website, including information about free breakfasts and lunches for students under the age of 18, which will continue, as well as answers to frequently asked questions regarding the school closure. You can find these details and more by visiting www.yukonps.com. The site also includes recommendations from the CDC about protecting your health and the health of your loved ones. We ask you to please following their advice by: (1) washing your hands regularly; (2) staying at home, if you can; and (3) practicing social distancing of at least six feet from others.

This is an unprecedented situation, and it has required an unprecedented response. We can still take care of Yukon’s students, though. This is a community that sticks together in challenging times, and we know this experience will be no different. As soon as we identify our next steps, we will share them with you.

Please stay safe. As always, we appreciate your support of Yukon Public Schools.",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3053893647964014&id=185719641448110,"YOUTUBE.COM

“Nothing is more important than the safety and well-being of Oklahomans,” Hofmeister said. “It is critical that we do everything in our power to protect the health of our kids, their families, educators and all vulnerable populations.

We know closing schools has a significant impact on families, and we are committed to doing what we can to lessen that impact as we work to prioritize the health and safety of all Oklahomans.”

MILL stands for Millers Improving Local Lives and this year, we have the opportunity to support Tessa Bynum and her family. A third grader at Parkland Elementary, Tessa is a ray of sunshine. Her father, Darin Bynum, is a math teacher at Yukon Middle School. Tessa was diagnosed in 2010 with Congenital CMV, a virus that caused severe brain damage affecting the function of her body. Tessa has limited mobility and uses a wheelchair but that doesn’t slow her down from being a light in every room she enters.

This family is extraordinary because of the passion they have for those around them. Rather than asking for support to purchase equipment to meet the family’s physical needs, the family asks that you join on their journey to create something bigger than themselves.

Their dream has always been to create a non-profit known as “Every Creation Matters”—a fully accessible and inclusive pottery studio that allows all types of families to participate and make memories. The goal is for all people to understand “not just every art creation matters, but each one of God’s creations matters.”

The squad practices around ten hours a week, on game days, over winter break, over fall break and they do not have an off-season. “During any given half-count of a performance, every part of their bodies have to be in an exact position, completely synchronized, taking teamwork to a new level,” said Reape. “When we perform our championship-winning routine, the untrained eye might think it looks cool but not understand the technicality and skill going into every move.”

The girls know what it takes to win so they work hard and set a high bar for new members. On top of the technical execution, their facial expressions and emotions are judged as well. “It takes performing with passion to win,” said one YHS dancer. “We want people to know that we do more than cheer at games, most of us are in this for the competition and we work very hard to make sure we win.”

Currently an Instructional Specialist at IES, Ms. Burris founded Operation Engagement, a nonprofit organization that provides classroom transformations that promote collaboration, creativity and critical thinking.

“When I started teaching, I had 6-year-olds that didn’t want to come to school,” said Burris. “I knew these children deserved to love learning so I had to ask myself what I could do to make education fun for them.” Burris started to research how to make her classroom engaging without sacrificing the skills or rigorous standards.

She began by transforming her classroom into a doctor’s office. She went to a dollar store and bought shower curtains to section off an “operating room” and purchased gloves and hats for the students. Throughout the week, they performed sentence surgery, subtraction surgery and measured the length of bones from a printed x-ray. Throughout the day, she would stop and shout “Code Red” and put a sight word or math problem on the board for them to solve. The students took turns being patients and doctors and the doctors would help their patients learn the skill so they could mark them as “healthy.”

“I got incredible feedback from the parents, students were crying if they had to miss a day of school,” said Burris. She packed up the doctor’s kit in a Rubbermaid Tub and started working on her next transformation. Over time, it grew into a sort of library system, where teachers could check out kits with no cost and word spread all around Oklahoma.

Less than 1% of students nationwide qualify for this prestigious award based on GPA, ACT score and NSDA points earned at tournaments. “To qualify, you have to have 750 points. To put that into perspective, the most someone can earn in a one hour round is six points. I have competed in over 200 rounds since I was a freshman,” said Anna.

The senior is triple-qualified for NSDA Regionals in Original Oratory, Poetry and Humorous Duet. “In Speech and Debate, we’re not just performing to entertain” Anna continued, “we perform with a clearly defined message; we research, study, write content, and present a passionate and valid argument on a topic.” Anna’s original oratory discusses how society uses blame as an excuse to avoid finding real solutions, her poetry piece brings awareness to mental health and she and her partner’s duet 'Sealed for Freshness: A Tupperware Party Gone Awry' presents a message about feminism and shattering stereotypes of women.

“Speech and Debate provides skills to take with us throughout the rest of our life, not only how to present a persuasive argument but how to be open-minded, how to explore topics from different perspectives, and how to find depth and meaning within ordinary life scenarios.”

Anna credits Mr. Pipkin, YHS Speech and Debate Coach, for teaching her how to find true depth in communication. “He always makes sure we know the ‘why’ in our words and pushes us to see things from different perspectives. I am not the same person I was four years ago, he has really helped me grow so much.”",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2814973245189390&id=185719641448110,,0.0,"Anna Langert is the first YHS student to be named Academic All American by the National Speech & Debate Association.

O’Hara frequently donates blood and platelets with the hopes of helping someone in need. “I've donated blood every single time that I can,” O’Hara said. “I donated on my 16th birthday and then I donated that December, and then I donated that May, and I've done it every year since. I was just hoping that I would make a difference.”

O’Hara’s hopes of helping someone came true in October when he found out someone received three units of his blood in a life-saving transfusion.“I got a call, and they said that they traced my first donation to someone who had a transplant and a transfusion of blood,” O’Hara said. “His name was Ronald Black, and he received 59 units of blood. He had a liver transplant because he had liver cancer and he received my platelets.”

O’Hara had the opportunity to connect with the recipient of his blood donation.“I met him and we talked about his experience,” O’Hara said. “He was actually doing a speech, and they surprised him with me showing up and meeting him because I was the closest donor that they had.”

In addition to O’Hara’s blood, Black received blood from various donors in surrounding states. O’Hara hopes that the feeling of pride that comes with helping to save a life will inspire others to give blood as well. “It felt amazing,” O’Hara said. “It feels like maybe this experience might help other people donate blood, and can really highlight how good of a thing giving blood really is. This experience has really helped me prove that I am making a difference and that I am helping others.”

“I am committed to working tirelessly to uphold our district's stellar reputation and expand educational opportunities across all classrooms” said Haggard. “While our school district continues to grow and prosper, I intend to continue the ‘small town’, communal feel that I have cherished over the years.

“My passion for secondary education started twenty years ago when I began teaching high school Biology and worked in the evenings as the principal of a credit recovery program for at risk students” said Lebsack. “I knew during those years I wanted to make a difference and help individual kids find their own path to success.

YUKON TEACHER AWARDED $5K INNOVATION GRANT

A Yukon teacher who just completed her first year in the classroom said this week that she is excited to begin her second year.
Shauna Walker, who teaches special education at Central Elementary School, recently learned that is she is one of 19 teachers across the state who will share $98,000 in innovative grants from Cox Communications.
Walker, who entered the teaching field last year, was awarded a $5,000 grant that will be used to fund a sensory exploration program.
Walker has seven students in her program. They range from kindergarten through third grade.
Most of the students are autistic.
“A lot of them have sensory issues, whether it be they need a lot of sensory input with touching or certain textures, or quite the opposite where they hate certain textures,” she said.
Walker said she plans to use the funds to purchase equipment, such as sensory bins that include water beads that have a “squishy sensation” or balls that have different textures.
One of the biggest items that Walker hopes to purchase are large floor couches called Pea Pods.
The couches look a lot like a canoe, and are designed so the sides come up around the children and provide them with a private space.
“The sides come up around them so they feel more secure and they have the pressure on them,” she said.
It gives the students the sensation that someone is hugging or holding them, Walker said.
“A lot of the time if they get upset, they want someone to hold them,” she said.
The pods offer an option for the students to have space to relax and calm themselves.
She hopes to have the pea pods in place by the time school starts. She expects to receive the grant funds by early August.
The first day of classes for Yukon is Aug. 15.
Walker said this is her first grant application.
She applied for the grant in March.
“I am super excited,” Walker said.
There were 70 applicants for the grant.
While Walker’s grant was the lone recipient in Yukon, grants also were awarded at Centennial Elementary in Mustang, at three schools in Deer Creek, and at Bethany High School.
“Together, we are helping students prepare for their future by funding critical classroom programs and curriculum. Through Cox Charities, our employees are thrilled to be able to support these innovative learning opportunities that engage and excite students,” said Kristin Peck, vice president of public affairs. “Our partnership with the schools across the state continues to grow, and we’re proud to be a strong part of that community.”",3.0,"Yukon Review

Here is our Jaguar News for the month of August. Remember, your student's teacher will be reaching out to you tomorrow or Friday to set up an appointment for next week. During that appointment, you will sign iPad paperwork, get the iPad and any other learning materials and meet the teacher. We ask that ONLY ONE parent/guardian and the child (if you wish) attend that appointment. Masks must be worn by all!! Please do not bring any school supplies at that time. Those will be needed for those that return to in person learning when that occurs.
We understand that there are a lot of questions surrounding this year. We will continue to do our best to communicate what we know when we know it. Please continue to have patience as we are all navigating the unknown and doing the absolute best we can for our Jaguars and their families. We are committed to providing our students with a quality learning experience. As always, please reach out with any questions or concerns that you have. #jaguarstrong",0.0,"Here is great information for OC Johnson families...

Good afternoon Rolle families. Paper copies of the District Weekly update have been attached to the front gate if you would like to stop by and pick one up.

Friday the 26th June will be the last day for lunch at our Rolle site. Once we get more info on the sites that will remain open in the district we will share.

The district platform Clever will only work for online learning until June 30th. Please see attached info on other sites students can be working on to keep their brains growing. Khan Academy just sent out info on their Camp Khan to work on math skills to get ready for the next grade.

Message from Mrs. Peach:

“On Wednesday, May 27th we will have large manila envelopes ready for each of our students. These envelopes will contain their report card, certificates they have been awarded, graded work they may have turned in, class pictures that were purchased, and other items from their teacher. We also have personal belongings bagged up and ready to send home. Please ask your child if they still need these items. All of our Fifth graders will be receiving a free yearbook that is signed by their teacher and myself. Yearbooks for other students will be sold at the beginning of next year. Please come to school and pick up your child’s envelope between 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM on May 27th. We want everyone to have closure to this school year and these items will help with that feeling and provide a sense of worth to your child.

Yuma School District One families are encouraged to apply for free or reduced-price meals for the CURRENT 2019-2020 school year.

Why now?

In addition to having free/reduced-price meal benefits that would carry over for the first 30 days of the new school year, families may qualify for additional benefits now through the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and would help our district qualify for other grant funding.

If you are new to the district or have recently had a change in financial circumstances, please apply online at the Titan Family Portal (link below). All information is completely confidential. There is no limit to how many times you can apply during the school year.

Note: All families must apply for free/reduced-price meals on an annual basis.

Reminder: ipad, shirts and medication pick up today 11-1. Right lane for pick up, left lane for lunch. Bring Paper with student names, teacher and what you are picking up to display in your car window.

If you have been struggling with the ipads you already have picked up please give them another go. There were more glitches to start off with and they seem to have settled down.

Some tips:
*Logging on in the morning and download assignments to PDF Cabinet. (See this slideshow for more assistance). Mornings seem to be less glitchy.
No internet needed for PDF Cabinet while working on assignments.
*Work on assignments during the day and then attach a screenshot of the assignment back in Google Classroom to turn in the assignment. Please reach out to teachers or myself for any questions.

Reminder: ipad, shirts and medication pick up today 11-1. Right lane for pick up, left lane for lunch. Bring Paper with student names, teacher and what you are picking up to display in your car window.

If you have been struggling with the ipads you already have picked up please give them another go. There were more glitches to start off with and they seem to have settled down.

Some tips:
*Logging on in the morning and download assignments to PDF Cabinet. (See this slideshow for more assistance). Mornings seem to be less glitchy.
No internet needed for PDF Cabinet while working on assignments.
*Work on assignments during the day and then attach a screenshot of the assignment back in Google Classroom to turn in the assignment. Please reach out to teachers or myself for any questions.

Thank you again for supporting our YSD One Child Nutrition Staff during this difficult time. I know many parents are getting upset that our department is enforcing the rule from USDA and Arizona Department of Education stating the child must be in the car to receive a meal. Please do not take your frustrations out on our cafeteria staff. Unfortunately, we have many adults that are requesting 10 meals at a time with no children in their cars. If we were to do this for every person that requested it, we would run out of food, similar to what is currently happening in the grocery stores.

Our department understands times are tough and we want to help out whenever possible. However, there are still rules and regulations our department must follow in order to be in compliance.

Remote learning is not ideal, but my students and parents are taking on this challenge and making the best of it! Look at the learning that is happening outside of the classroom, along with their digital assignments: engaging in art projects with grandparents, building a really cool fort to read in; watching our chrysalises turn into butterflies; visiting a farm to observe different animals; planting corn seeds from the U of A; playing games with family; constructing buildings, completing advanced challenging activities online, and sharing reflections on student learning!

We made it to the weekend! Today we served 11,610 meals for children in the Yuma Community. That is the same amount of meals that we serve on any given day in our school district. Our schools have been closed for 5 days and our department has served 40,060 meals this week. It has been a long week and our school nutrition staff deserve the weekend to rest!

We will back at it on Monday, March 23rd. 11:00am-1:00pm. Our staff is working extra hard to make sure we don’t run out of your favorite school meals. Please be kind to all employees that are working. A smile goes a long way!

ATTENTION ALL STUDENTS and PARENTS

Please be aware that Google Classroom is at times having issues with opening attachments to assignments (File not Found) and with the ability to turn things in. All of your teachers are aware of this and the school district's technology department is aware and they are trying to find a fix. Unfortunately, it is possibly out of our control and will just be something we have to be patient with.

A number for you have reported the issues in the late afternoon and evening, between the hours of 4:30 pm and 11 pm. Those same students have been able to turn things in the next morning before noon.

So, our suggestion is to work in the morning or work in an of line format and turn things in later. Your teachers will not mark things late that are turned in within a day or so.

Here is a video taken today by our school cafeteria manager at McGraw Elementary School. She has given me permission to share on our page. I think it is evident these meals are made with love. Today was homemade Pigs in the Blanket! One of my all time favorite school meals.

“As we completed day four of our Grab-n-Go program I wondered how many people really understand what goes into what we’re doing. So here’s a short little video of us prepping 800 meals. My school has gone from feeding 135 kids on Monday to 426 kids today. Any child in the community is given a lunch for the day and breakfast for the next morning. Today our district expects to feed over 10,000 children. Just so blessed to be a part of this and all the parents are so grateful, confirming that what we’re doing is so needed right now in the community.￼￼”

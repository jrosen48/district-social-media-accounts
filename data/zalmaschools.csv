If anyone has not yet signed up for this program, please feel free to call the office this week at 722-5504 between the hours of 9AM and 12 Noon. We had hoped to start the program this week, however, with our school originally scheduled to be on Spring break we could not get needed food supplies and milk orders changed on short notice. On the 30th, we will provide 7 breakfasts and 7 lunches, including milk and other items that will need to be refrigerated and/or kept frozen. In order to reduce any risk of transmitting any illness, we will bring the meals to your vehicle. We plan for the pick up to be done at the main high school entrance, so parents can drive to the morning drop off location and we will have school personnel meet you there and have the meals brought to you. Hopefully this will speed up the process and keep everyone safe.

Thank you,

The Governor has shut down all schools until April 6th at the earliest. It does not look hopeful, at this time, that we will be able to return to school even then. We all feel for our Seniors and Juniors because this has placed graduation and prom in jeopardy. We will hold off on making any final decisions in regard to these events until we absolutely have no choice. I met with our Seniors and Juniors last week so that they could make some decisions going forth. Should the Governor extend the shutdown beyond April 6th then we may have no choice but to make some tough decisions. For now we can only take a wait and see approach. When decisions are made, we will update on our school Facebook page immediately. Stay well everyone.

Today we are finalizing plans for our summer meals program. If you have not contacted school to arrange for meals for your children I strongly encourage you to do so. This is not an income based program, kids just need to be 18 years of age or younger. There have been some parents concerned that they didn’t sign up because they didn’t want to cause problems for other families to be able to get needed meals. There is absolutely no concern of that happening. We just want to make sure all of our young people have meals during this time off and to help out all of our district families during these uncertain times. Our first day of meals will be Monday, March 30th, between 9AM and 12 Noon. We can arrange delivery if that will help you participate. Please contact school today at 722-3136 or 722-3320 to sign your children up for this program.

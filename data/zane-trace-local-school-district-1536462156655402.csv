We usually go over this information with the 4th grade in the spring, but we had to get a little creative this year so we made a video with the information that we usually discuss.

We have a lot of talent at Zane Trace and there are usually several students in each grade that are curious about band or don't know about our program so I wanted to make sure to get the information out to everyone else as well. It's never too late to get started!

In response to the recent confirmation of coronavirus cases in Ohio, and Governor DeWine’s declaration of a public health emergency, we are adjusting our plans for the Rally for Public Schools on March 18.

We will not be holding an in-person rally at the statehouse. Instead, we will be holding a “virtual rally” at 3:30 pm on March 18 to kick off two weeks of action in support of the students in our public schools. This tele-conference will display the breadth of our public schools coalition, update attendees on the voucher crisis in our school districts, and engage activists in concrete next steps to protect public education.

Please RSVP below if you can join us in our virtual rally on March 18th!

We need to organize mass support for the vouchers policy changes in the House version of Senate Bill 89 before April 1st. If that deadline passes without legislative action, over 1200 schools around the state will qualify for EdChoice vouchers.

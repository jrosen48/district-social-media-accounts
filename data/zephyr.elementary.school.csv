Read Naturally Program:
Students should be reading for 20 minutes per day. Books can be selected from the EPIC accounts set up for them if they do not have access to a physical book. Book titles should be shared with their reading teacher through the Google classroom. Students will be assigned one article from Readworks every other week. They will have 2 weeks to review the vocabulary words, listen to the story, practice reading the story while timing themselves for one minute until they can reach their goal, and complete the questions. Once they can reach their goal, they'll submit a voice recording using the link in the hot read assignment in Google classroom. There is a video to watch in the assignment “How to do a hot read” that explains how to do this. Please reach out to Mrs. Sommers, Mrs. Boyer, or Mrs. Forster with concerns.📚📕",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2729695810493414&id=172285746234446,,0.0,"UPDATE from Mrs. Sommers & the Reading Support Team:

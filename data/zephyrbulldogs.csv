Madellyne Adams has been a Zephyr Bulldog since her freshman year. Madellyne plans on attending South Plains College to further her education in livestock judging. She plans to dominate in judging and raising quality livestock.

While a high school student at Zephyr, Madellyne has been involved in Cheer, Basketball, Livestock Judging, Volleyball, Showing, FCA, and NHS. One of her most memorable moments was getting her hair stuck in a wheel during Ag class.

Though Madellyne is looking forward to a new start after high school, she will miss laughing uncontrollably with her friends.

Madellyne wants to tell future graduates, ""High school is temporary and short so have no regrets and work your hardest.""

She also wants to share the following, ""Thank you to every faculty/staff member that supported me. Thank you for taking your time with me and understanding that I had a lot of dreams to accomplish outside of school. I achieved them because of your support. Thank you to my family for giving me the utmost support in every decision I made.""",https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2842004542521783&id=1400128880042697,,0.0,"Zephyr Senior Spotlight

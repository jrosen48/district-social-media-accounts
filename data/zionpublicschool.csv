August 6 at 10:22 PM ·

Attention: The Cherokee Nation is extending its deadline for its Respond, Recover, Rebuild Education Initiative, to give more parents time to apply!

The deadline has been extended from Aug. 7 to now Friday, Aug. 14.

Parents who have not submitted an application for a technology or clothing stipend still have time. Cherokee Nation citizens who still need to register their child for Cherokee Nation citizenship, or have a pending application for citizenship on file, can also still apply by the new Aug. 14 deadline. Citizenship applications must be completed with supporting records in order to be considered “pending.”

Click on Cherokee.org and go to the blue RRR Education Initiative icon to apply.

Programs available for education COVID-19 relief include:

A $150 to students across Cherokee Nation without regard to income or type of schooling they receive for clothes and a winter coat. For income, eligible students it’s a $300 clothing stipend.

A $400 education technology stipend is also offered for any Cherokee student ages 5 to 18 regardless of income and regardless of where they live.

The COVID-19 pandemic has hit schools and students hard in lots of ways. The very nature of education, and how it is safely delivered in the midst of the biggest public health crisis in generations, has changed dramatically. Distance learning has taken on even greater importance. The Cherokee Nation is pleased to invest $40 million in its Respond, Recover and Rebuild Education Initiative to help students and schools stay on track as we continue to deal with COVID-19.

A drop box will be placed in the Cherokee Nation complex atrium for parents and the public to drop off citizenship applications.

The Registration Department will be closed to the public starting Monday and through August 14 so that the department can focus on processing applications.

Funding for those who applied by the original deadline will be distributed soon.

Wado, to the more than 40,000 applications turned in thus far. We thank you, and are proud of the response and success from the Respond, Recover, Rebuild Education Initiative. We know our children will get off to a great school year while continuing to maintain safety.",0.0,"Cherokee Nation is with Quannah Howe Owens.

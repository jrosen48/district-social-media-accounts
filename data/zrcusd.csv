The City of Zeigler Water Department informed us this afternoon of a water line break that impacts service provided to Zeigler-Royalton CUSD 188. City workers worked into this evening to repair it, but a short time ago we were informed that, in order to finish the repair, there will be a disruption to our water service beginning tomorrow morning that could last for a good portion of the school day. This disruption in service impacts many of our facilities, including the use of restrooms and other services necessary to function throughout the day. As a result, the district is forced to implement a Remote Learning day for all students tomorrow (Wednesday, September 9, 2020).

Assuming the water line is repaired tomorrow, In-Person Learning will resume on Thursday, September 10, 2020. Thursday will once again be a ""B-Day"" for our 5th-12th grade students.

Bus routes district-wide will be running later than in previous years. This adjustment allows the district to be better prepared for screening procedures and capacity management at both schools on a day-to-day basis. Also, please remember that bus riders will have health screenings conducted prior to boarding the bus. It is important that a parent or guardian is present to take the student back home in the event that a student does not meet the standards in place for the screening.

We encourage everyone to also follow the ""Zeigler-Royalton Elementary/Jr. High"" Facebook Page as they will be providing updates and reminders that are specific to that building.

I wanted to send an update regarding the scheduling of classes for incoming (2020-2021) Freshman students. By now we have traditionally hosted a Freshman Orientation for students/parents/guardians, but due to COVID-19 we have been unable to do so. During this orientation we go over the basic high school guidelines and expectations, as well as review class offerings and high school graduation/course requirements. For now we are going to hold off on scheduling for incoming freshman until we can host a Freshman Orientation later this summer. At this point in time, it is my guess that the orientation will be hosted in an online format. I will keep everyone updated and release information regarding the date, time, and format for the orientation once we have it all established. Until then... ENJOY SUMMER BREAK AND RELAX!

If you have any questions at all please do not hesitate to contact me.

It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that we pass along news that Zeigler-Royaton CUSD #188 has lost one of its own. Steve Henderson, High School Math teacher, passed away early Sunday morning. Steve was a beloved member of the ZR community. There is no doubt that his legacy will continue to live in our hearts and minds forever. His contagious personality and kind-hearted demeanor were two of the many qualities that set Steve apart from others.

The loss of Steve will leave a huge void within the ZR community. Our school counselors, as well as our faculty and staff, are available via email or by phone if any students need help dealing with this tragic situation. During this difficult time, we encourage everyone to rely on those around you and reach out if you feel the need to talk with someone.

In an effort to uplift the spirits of our students, some of the faculty and staff from Zeigler-Royalton CUSD #188 will be participating in a parade tomorrow that will travel through the streets of Zeigler and Royalton. The parade is expected to travel through the towns at the following times:
- Zeigler 10:15 am - 10:45 am
- Royalton 11:00 am - 11:30 am

We encourage everyone to step outside their front door and give our teachers a chance to show their appreciation to the community and let the students know how much they miss them. It is VERY important that people do not gather in groups along the streets and that everyone keeps a safe distance from each other while the parade is taking place. We want this to be a positive and safe experience for everyone.

If you haven't heard, our Zeigler-Royalton baseball and boy's basketball teams are going together to host a remarkable event on Saturday, February 22nd at the Zeigler Eagles. The teams are having a fish fry from 1-4 followed by an evening with Cardinal Legend Al Hrabosky. Mr. Hrabosky will speak followed by a question and answer period and a photograph/autograph session. Prices are: Fish Fry only $10, Al Hrabosky event only $20, and Fish Fry and event together $30.

In spite of his career as a Cardinal, Al Hrabosky is a hero of mine because he always makes himself available as a volunteer for the American Cancer Society Days at the Ballpark.

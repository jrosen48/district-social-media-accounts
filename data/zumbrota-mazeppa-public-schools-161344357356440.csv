Rumors on Zumbrota Town Talk(unfiltered site) that Zumbrota-Mazeppa Schools is Covid testing students is completely false. It is very unfortunate that during these times when everyone is on high alert and on edge, people post and spread completely inaccurate information. This is very unethical at a minimum. Other local entities may be doing such things, but rest assured we would not do this. Those involved, check your sources and get the facts before posting such inflammatory comments.

Have a great weekend!
